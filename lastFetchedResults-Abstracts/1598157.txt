In this paper, a line search sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach to a system of nonlinear equations (SNE) is taken. In this method, the system of nonlinear equations is transformed into a constrained nonlinear programming problem at each step, which is then solved using SQP algorithms with a line search strategy. Furthermore, at each step, some equations, which are satisfied at the current point, are treated as constraints and the others act as objective functions. In essence, constrained optimization strategies are utilized to cope with the system of nonlinear equations.

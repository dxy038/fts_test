A novel wavelength arrangement using independent C- and L-band Raman preamplification is proposed for application to bidirectional unrepeatered transmission systems. Bidirectional unrepeatered transmission of 32 multiplexed 43 Gbit/s channels (= 1.28 Tbit/s) over 200 km with Raman preamplifiers has been achieved using the proposed technique

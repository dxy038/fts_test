Background and Objective: Lawsonia inermis (henna) has unique properties and has been used as a medicine since the past. In this project, a polymeric nanofiber composite from Chitosan/Polyethylene oxide/Henna extract was produced as a wound’s cover by electrospinning method.

Materials and Methods: Polymeric nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning method. In order to study the effect of henna on nanofiber properties, diferent nanofibers were prepared without henna and in the presence of henna extract. A scanning electron microscope was used in order to study the morphology and diameter of electrospun nanofibers. The average diameters of prepared nanofibers was obtained by Image J software.

Results: The affecting parameters on the nanofiber properties were studied and optimized. The optimum conditions for preparation of nanofibers with diameters less than 100 nm are: voltage; 20 KV, feed rate; 0.5 ml/h, nozzle-collector’s distance; 10 cm and Chitosan/Polyethylene oxide weight ratio; 0.9. The average diameter of prepared nanofiber at optimized conditions was 95 nm.

Conclusion: The obtained results showed that the nanofibers containing henna extract have high stability. Moreover, water absorption and degradation of nanofibers increased as the amount of henna was increased. According to our results, it seems that the chitosan/PEO/henna (1%) is a suitable choice for wound dressing that facilitate wound healing procedure.

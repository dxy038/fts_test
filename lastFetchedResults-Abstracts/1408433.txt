Background: Female sexual dysfunction is a common problem among general population, especially in urogynecological patient, and can lead to a decrease in quality of life and affect martial relationship. Objective: This study was compared the effect of surgical methods versus physiotherapy on sexual function in pelvic floor disorder. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled trial was performed in Urogynecology clinic since August 2007 to December 2009 on 90 patients aged from 25-55 years with previous delivery, positive history of sexual dysfunction with stage  < 3 of pelvic organ prolapsed and divided in two groups. Group A (n=45) received standard rectocele repair and prineorrhaphy, group B (n=45) received physiotherapy for eight weeks twice a week (electrical stimulation, Kegel exercises). The female sexual function index (FSFI) used to evaluate the sexual function in cases before and after intervention. Frequency of variable scores (libido, orgasm, dysparunia) included without disorder, frequently good, sometimes good, very much and extreme were compared between two groups. Results: Libido and arousal were improved in both groups (p=0.007, p=0.001 respectively). Orgasm and dyspareunia were improved in group B (p=0.001). Dysparunia was more painful in group A. There was significant difference between two groups (improvement of orgasm and dysparunia in group B) (p=0.001). Conclusion: It seems that physiotherapy is an appropriate method for treatment of sexual disorder in pelvic floor disorder.

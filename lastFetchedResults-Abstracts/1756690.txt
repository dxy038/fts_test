Objective
g, depression and PTSD are related to poor physical health outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Previous studies examining the effects of quitting smoking on HRQoL have been mixed. This study aimed to examine the effects of PTSD, depressive symptoms and smoking cessation on HRQoL in a sample receiving treatment for PTSD.

tudy utilized archival interview and self-report data from a clinical trial (VA Cooperative Study 519) that recruited tobacco dependent veterans with chronic PTSD (N = 943).
s
es were conducted using hierarchical linear modeling and indicated that PTSD and depressive symptoms differentially affected the various physical health status domains. Additionally, quitting smoking was associated with better self-perceived health status and social functioning.
sion
ndings further explain the interrelationships of PTSD, depression, and smoking in the prediction of physical HRQoL and advocate the importance of integrated care.

Tracking moving targets in sequence images is an essential key technology and one of the hot research topics in Computer Vision. This system is based on an embedded system platform named Embedded Star and makes full use of the OpenCV (Intel&#194;&#174; open-source computer vision library)to implement and optimize the Mean Shift tracking algorithm. At last, it achieves the objective of real-time tracking and shooting of moving targets, and can be used in sports photography, real-time monitoring and so on. The test data has indicated that it can direct the camera through controlling the cloud terrace to track both rigid and non-rigid targets.

Considering the importance and extensive range of decision-making, scientists from various fields have had many discussions on this issue. Various models have been proposed to facilitate decision-making and have had much utilization. In many site selection problems, multiple objectives must be obtained, simultaneously. This study uses a mathematical model to select a suitable location for the refinery in the multi attribute environment. The proposed model uses a large amount of qualitative and quantitative information in the frame of multi objective functions for the first time in the refinery site selection and is flexible enough to use decision makersâ€™ opinions in order to achieve goals. For this reason, after a brief overview of the selected area characteristics, using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for weighting the criteria, a mathematical operation research model is proposed to determine the best alternatives.

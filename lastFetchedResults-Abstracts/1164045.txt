Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 are major foodborne pathogens implicated in various outbreaks involving pasteurized or unpasteurized milk, and various dairy products. The objective of this study was to determine the antibacterial effect of caprylic acid (CA, C8:0) and its monoglyceride, monocaprylin (MC) on L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 in whole milk. A five-strain mixture of E. coli O157:H7 or L. monocytogenes was inoculated in autoclaved milk (106 CFU/ml) containing 0, 25, or 50 mM of CA or MC. At 37°C, all the treatments, excepting 25 mm CA, reduced the population of both pathogens by approximately 5.0 log CFU/ml in 6 h. At 24 h of storage at 8°C, MC at both levels and CA at 50 mM decreased L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7, respectively by >5.0 log CFU/ml. At 48 h of 4°C storage, populations of L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 were decreased to below detection level (enrichment negative) by 50 mm of MC and CA, respectively. Results indicate that MC could potentially be used to inhibit L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 in milk and dairy products, but sensory studies need to be conducted before recommending their use.

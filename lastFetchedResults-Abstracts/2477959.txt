Background & Objectives: Entering LAS through the wastewater plant&rsquo;s effluent to water resources causes taste and odor changes, aquatics death, oxygen transfer limitation, and disorders in water treatment processes. Therefore, the study objective was to determine optimum conditions for fenton oxidation process to remove linear alkyl benzene sulfonate from aqueous environments using taguchi method and its requirement evaluation for additional treatment of Biolac effluent. Materials &Methods: LAS removal using Fenton oxidation was evaluated in a 500 mL laboratory-scale batch reactor. In order to save the costs, to determine the optimum conditions of the Fenton oxidation, 25 runs were computed using Taghuchi method by Minitab 16 software. Sampling and required tests were performed based on standard methods examination for water and wastewater. For evaluation of Biolac process sufficiency in LAS removal, biolac efficiency in Urmia Wastewater Treatment Plant was studied in 2012. Results: Based on the LAS removal and chemicals required, Minitab software (Ver. 16) recommended the optimum conditions of Fenton oxidation at 900 mg/L H2O2, 170 mg/L Ferrous ion, pH of 4, and reaction time of 20 minutes. It was found that the Fenton oxidation for LAS removal had 86.5% efficiency under optimum condithions and it was second order reaction with the rate coefficient of 0.0152 L/mg.min. Biolac process does not need any additional treatment due to meeting LAS standard in municipal wastewater treatment. Thus, this process decreased annually mean LAS from 5.28 mg/L to 0.734 mg/L in municipal wastewater. Conclusion: Although the Fenton oxidation appears as a chemical process with high efficiency in the removal of LAS, the low efficiency of COD corresponding to the LAS indicated partial decomposition of linear alkyl benzene sulfonate by Fenton oxidation.

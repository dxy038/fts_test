Industrial automation systems may include people, hardware, software and other elements necessary to produce the desirable results. The SysML modeling language is being proposed, by OMG and INCOSE, as a language that allows the system description correctly and consistently among various participants of the same project (software, mechanical, electrical and others engineers). The objective of this work is to evaluate the SysML proposal as a description language for industrial systems through the modeling of an industrial automation unit. A brief system description of the case study is included, the SysML diagrams will be presented during the system modeling and finally comments and considerations about the models and the modeling task are presented.

Congestion control in Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is relatively different from that of traditional networks. The standard TCP congestion control approach is not adapted properly in the dynamic properties of MANET, which creates lot of challenges in routing, due to resources and bandwidth limits. In this paper, we proposed a self congestion prediction (SCP) algorithm for congestion prediction and modified AODV with SCP to propose a novel A-SCP protocol for alleviating congestion and efficient routing. The objective of the algorithm is to minimize network overhead and improvise the throughput without deteriorating the network. To evaluate the proposal we simulate in different random mobility and scalable network environment which shows an improvisation in packet delivery and decline in control overhead and end-to-end delay.

We discuss a problem of attending ships within agreed time limits at a port under the condition of the first come first served order. In addition, we indicate the use of the developed tool to support decisions at a strategic level with the objective of improving the attendance of the ships. The tool is based on a mathematical model of a multi-mode resource-constrained scheduling problem and on an extension of a differential evolution algorithm. We illustrate the implementation by computational tests with data generated on the basis of the characteristics of a real port environment.

The objective of this work is to develop a software tool to improve the acquisition and treatment of data from lifetime measurements made by photoconductance techniques. Subsequently, an analytical expression for recombination is presented where surface recombination, Auger recombination and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination are included. This analytical expression is then fitted to the measured effective lifetime curve by nonlinear methods.

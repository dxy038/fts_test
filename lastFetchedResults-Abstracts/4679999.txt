Power Spectrum Blind Sampling (PSBS) has been recently proposed as a strategy to reduce sampling rates below the Nyquist frequency when the objective is not perfect signal reconstruction but estimation of the power spectrum. In addition, sparse rulers have been proposed as multicoset patterns that can be used in PSBS to reconstruct the power spectrum even when the signal is not sparse. In this paper we propose a sparse ruler design method based on coprime sampling, which gives interesting solutions when long patterns have to be designed.

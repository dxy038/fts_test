The main objective of this work is to emulate the capacity of a variable speed wind turbine generator (WTG) to participate in primary frequency control by using a 2,2 kW test bench. This participation requires a power reserve which is obtained with the help of the generator torque control by following a power reference value lower than the maximum power which must be extracted from the wind. This approach allows also using a part of the kinetic energy in the blades inertia to contribute to this reserve. The dynamic tests carried out on the test bench confirm the capacity of the wind turbine generator (WTG) to participate in the primary frequency control under certain wind conditions.

Objective:
To evaluate if peak characteristics, the retention time, and percentage of total hemoglobin of an unknown peak on the Bio-Rad VARIANT II Hb A1c method may be used to establish a tentative identification of hemoglobin variants.
Method:
The peak characteristics, retention time, and percentage of total hemoglobin obtained on abnormal peaks found on the Bio-Rad VARIANT II Hb A1c method were tabulated and evaluated against the identification of the hemoglobin variant established by the Bio-Rad Î² thalassemia HPLC method and hemoglobin electrophoresis at both acid and alkaline pH.
Results:
Some hemoglobin variants show specific peak characteristics, retention times, and percentage of total hemoglobin on the Bio-Rad VARIANT II Hb A1c method that allows for tentative identification of the hemoglobin variant. The retention times and percentage of hemoglobin variant for the common hemoglobin variants E, D, S, and C obtained on the Bio-Rad VARIANT II Hb A1c method are tabulated below.
Conclusion:
Peak characteristics, retention times, and percentage of hemoglobin variant may be used to establish the presence of a hemoglobin variant and to provide a tentative identification of some hemoglobin variants on the Bio-Rad VARIANT II Hb A1c method.

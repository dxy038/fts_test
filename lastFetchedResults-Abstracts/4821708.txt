The methods of image edge detection based on the differential, wavelet transform and image morphology are introduced in the paper. Differential operator edge detection method is based on the edge of the adjacent regionsÂ´ boundary that is not continuous with the gray, using derivative to detect the edge, Wavelet transform edge detection is by means of selecting the appropriate wavelet function to make wavelet detail component to truely reflect the image of the local gray mutations point, The basic idea of mathematical morphology is to use some forms of structural elements to measure and extract the corresponding shape of the image to attain the objective of image analysis and recognition.

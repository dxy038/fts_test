This paper aims at developing an effective scheme for design optimization of a novel nanocomposite-typed flip chip (FC) technology, constructed by integrating an Ag-nanowire/polymer nanocomposite film together with a nonconductive paste (NCP) technology. The objective of the optimization problem is to achieve the optimal process-induced thermal-mechanical behaviors of the novel FC technology during the NCP bonding process through the selection of material properties, process parameters and geometry data. The process-induced thermal-mechanical behaviors are evaluated using a process-dependent simulation methodology that integrates both transient thermal and nonlinear contact FE analyses and a &#194;&#191;death-birth&#194;&#191; meshing scheme. The validity of the process-dependent FE simulation methodology is also confirmed through experiment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the present design optimization approach, several design problems associated with the FC technology are performed.

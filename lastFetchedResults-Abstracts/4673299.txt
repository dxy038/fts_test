Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) provides efficient solution for multimedia broadcasting services by distributing resources among a group of subscribers. Different from previous broadcasting services, MBMS subscribers will send feedback information which can be used to improve system performance by adapting resource allocation to channel state. In this paper in LTE frameworks we propose a frequency domain packet scheduling (FDPS) algorithm for MBMS, in which resource blocks are dynamically allocated to MBMS based on knowledge of instantaneous channel condition. The objective is to optimize system throughput performance while guaranteeing system coverage. This paper examines the algorithm in details with different (channel quality indicator) CQI reporting modes, alterable frequency bandwidth for MBMS and different numbers of MBMS subscribers per sector. Simulations show that comparing to a simple blind FDPS algorithm, the proposed algorithm improves system throughput without sacrificing coverage.

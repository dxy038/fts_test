We consider two single machine scheduling problems with resource dependent release times that can be controlled by a non-increasing convex resource consumption function. In the first problem, the objective is to minimize the total resource consumption with a constraint on the sum of job completion times. We show that a recognition version of the problem is NP-complete. In the second problem, the objective is to minimize the weighted total resource consumption and sum of job completion times with an initial release time greater than the total processing times. We provide some optimality conditions and show that the problem is polynomially solvable.

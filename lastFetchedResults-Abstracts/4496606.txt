In this paper, a simple prototype of a quasi-resonant DC link (QRDCL) voltage-fed bidirectional power converter operating in the zero voltage soft-switching PWM mode is presented for a battery energy storage system (BESS). The operating principle of this QRDCL circuit and multi-functional control-based power converter system, including PWM inverter mode in which energy flows through from the battery bank to the three phase utility-grid and an active PWM power converter mode in which energy flows through from the utility-grid to the battery bank are described. The multi-functional operating characteristics of this three-phase soft-switching ZVS-PWM bidirectional power converter with a QRDCL for BESS is demonstrated under the conditions of peak-cut mode and battery charging mode in comparison with a three-phase hard-switching PWM bidirectional power converter. Its effectiveness is proved by simulation analysis

Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical aspects of profound hearing loss (PHL) and their significance for defining deafness. Methods: The audiological data were reviewed from 3660 patients who were evaluated in the Otolaryngology Clinic at Louisiana State University in Shreveport, LA, over a 5-year period. The medical charts from the patients were also reviewed for the information of medical diagnosis, surgical records and radiological findings. Results: There were 34 patients identified with bilateral PHL or deaf, 177 patients with unilateral PHL and 123 patients with borderline PHL. Congenital hearing loss and unknown-cause hearing loss in this series were predominant with 267 cases (79.9%). A surgical management was indicated in 39 cases (11.7%) including middle ear infection, ossicular chain abnormalities and auditory nerve/brainstem tumors. Conclusion: This study suggests that audiometrically PHL should be thoroughly evaluated to detect reversible or remediable conditions by surgical and medical approaches. The diagnosis of deafness should be confirmed by an integration of the audiological data and medical documents including surgical and radiological findings. Aural rehabilitation program should be designed for deaf patients with varied etiology and degree of residual peripheral hearing sensitivity following medical clearance.

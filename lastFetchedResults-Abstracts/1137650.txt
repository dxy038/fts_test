This paper addresses the optimum dynamic balancing of planar parallel manipulators exemplified with a 2 DOF parallel manipulator articulated with revolute joints. The dynamic balancing is formulated as an optimisation problem such that while the shaking force balancing is accomplished through analytically obtained balancing constraints, an objective function based on the sensitivity analysis of shaking moment with respect to the position, velocity and acceleration of the links is used to minimise the shaking moment. Sets of optimisation results corresponding to various combinations of the elements of the objective function are evaluated in order to quantify their influence on the resulting shaking moment, ground forces and the driving torques. The results prove that the proposed optimisation approach can be used to completely eliminate the shaking force and to minimise the shaking moment transmitted to the frame of the parallel mechanism. For parallel manipulators or mechanisms with higher degrees of freedom, for which it is virtually impossible to obtain shaking force balancing conditions analytically, we propose an alternative constrained optimisation procedure. This procedure is based on the fact that while the magnitude of either the shaking force or the shaking moment can be bounded through including a set of constraints in the optimisation algorithm, the sensitivities of the other, either those of the shaking force or the shaking moment, can be minimised.

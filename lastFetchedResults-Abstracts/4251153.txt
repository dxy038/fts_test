The objective of this contribution is to report a low cost implementation of a control system for an atomic force microscope (AFM). AFMs rely on a feedback controller as an integral part of their operation. Currently the controllers shipped with most commercial AFMs are implemented in a closed source manner and provide limited signal access. This restricts the development of novel control strategies by the end users. The solution reported in this contribution uses a commonly available Digital Signal Processor kit to implement a Proportional Integral (PI) controller. This controller is tested on a commercial AFM and experimental results are reported.

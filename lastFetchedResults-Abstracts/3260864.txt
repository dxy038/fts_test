In this paper, we present a bidirectional learning scenario model transformation framework for bridging IMS-LD interoperability standard and pervasive Learning Environments design. It includes two modules: (1) IMS-LD to CAAML Transformation Module aiming to facilitate the reuse and the enrichment of existant IMS-LD Learning scenario models; (2) CAAML to IMS-LD Transformation Module aiming to provide possibilities to deploy pervasive learning scenario models generated by ContAct-Me in pre-existing Learning management systems.

This work describes a software tool for analysis and design of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) called ANALYTICE. The objective is to carry out performance evaluation of manufacturing systems through simulation. The simulation architecture and the manufacturing models are built according to a 4-level hierarchy: device, work station, cell, and plant. Emphasis is given to the modeling and analysis of the first three levels

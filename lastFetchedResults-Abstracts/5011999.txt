Two grid-connected solar dish-Stirling power systems have recently been installed on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The objective is to study the reliability of these systems, and investigate means of improving their efficiency and availability in an effort to raise their proven technology status. This paper describes the operation of both systems and evaluates the expected yearly kWh production using historical solar insolation data and past system availability.

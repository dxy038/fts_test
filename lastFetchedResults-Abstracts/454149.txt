The participation of HDL in the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) from peripheral cells to the liver is critical for the antiatherogenic properties of this lipoprotein. Experimental results showing that efflux of cholesterol from cells growing in culture is mediated by HDL and lipoprotein particles containing apo A-I, in particular, support this conclusion. A bidirectional flux of unesterified cholesterol molecules between the plasma membrane of cells and HDL particles in the extracellular medium occurs. Net efflux of cholesterol mass from the cells involves passive diffusion of cholesterol molecules through the aqueous phase and down their concentration gradient between the membrane and HDL; the concentration gradient is maintained by LCAT-mediated esterification of cholesterol molecules in the HDL particles. Fully lipidated apo A-I is important in promoting this aqueous diffusion mechanism because it: (1) acts as a cofactor for LCAT; and (2) solubilizes phospholipid into small HDL-sized particles that are efficient at absorbing cholesterol molecules diffusing away from the cell surface. Apo A-I also exists in an incompletely lipidated state in plasma. Apo A-I molecules in this state are able to solubilize phospholipid and cholesterol from the plasma membrane of cells. This membrane-microsolubilization process is enhanced by enrichment of the plasma membrane with cholesterol and is the mechanism by which pre-Î²-HDL particles in the extracellular medium remove cholesterol and phospholipid from cells. The relative contributions in vivo of the aqueous diffusion and membrane-microsolubilization mechanisms of apo A-I-mediated cell cholesterol efflux are not predicted readily from cell culture experiments. Confounding issues are the variations with cell type and the dependence on the degree of cholesterol loading of the cell plasma membrane.

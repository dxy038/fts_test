Recently, we have shown that the wavelet phase synchronization stability of single sweeps of auditory late responses (ALRs) allows for the quantification of the tinnitus decompensation. Our underlying model of adaptive resonance and spotlighting of attention links the synchronization stability directly to neural correlates of attention reflected in ALRs. Correlates of this attentional mechanism are further investigated in this study by using an auditory paradigm based on maximum entropy principle in healthy subjects. In particular, we show that the wavelet phase synchronization of ALR single sweeps allows for a direct online monitoring of phase locked auditory attention. Such an online monitoring cannot be implemented by known procedures as they are based on large-scale averages of ALRs. Apart from the objective quantification of the tinnitus decompensation, this measure can be used in every online and real time neurofeedback therapeutic approach where a direct stimulus locked attention monitoring is mandatory

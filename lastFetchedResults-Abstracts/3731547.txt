A multiple-input, single-stage bidirectional converter is proposed. It takes a three-winding coupled inductor as the main component of energy transmission, and utilises only two switches to accomplish the multi-input mechanism. Depending on the switching conditions, the circuit can be operated at discharge, charge and alone states. The winding voltage in the high-voltage side of the coupled inductor is manipulated to further increase the corresponding voltage gain, a strategy that is superior to one in the conventional coupled-inductor. This topology is useful for low-power applications. In addition, all switches and diodes have favourable voltage-clamping effects so that the voltage spikes caused by the leakage-inductor energy can be alleviated effectively, and reverse-recovery currents within diodes can be reduced, because the leakage inductor has limited capability to handle quick current changes. There is also a low-voltage-type charge circuit with no increase in additional circuit elements. This helps -to avoid power losses that arise from multistage conversions in traditional auxiliary power systems. This strategy also utilises the synchronous rectification technique to further decrease conduction losses. Numerical simulations and experimental results via examples of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell power source and a traditional battery module are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power conversion strategy.

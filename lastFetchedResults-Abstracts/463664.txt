OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the safety of vaginal delivery of triplets.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study on 69 consecutive triplet pregnancies delivered in the same institution between 1981 and 1992. Vaginal delivery was attempted in 23 otherwise uncomplicated triplet pregnancies, which form the study groupo. They were compared with 23 controls undergoing routine cesarean section and matched for gestational age at birth. Maternal hospital stay, neonatal mortality, hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit, and 5-minute Apgar scores were compared by means of paired tests.
RESULTS: In the vaginal delivery group there was one neonatal death related to prematurity (32 weeks) after intrapartum cesarean section for failure to progress. However, neonatal mortality was not significantly increased in comparison with controls (1 of 69 vs 0). In the study group Apgar scores were significantly higher (9.5 vs 8.4) and hospitalization in the neonatal care intensive unit was significantly shorter (6 vs 18 days) than in the cesarean section group (p â‰¤ 0.002).
CONCLUSION: In carefully selected cases vaginal delivery of triplets may be safe.

In this paper a new simple and low-cost radiating element is presented, based on a multilayered planar configuration with printed dipoles arranged in a suitable rhombic shape. The main objective is to reach UWB performance mainly in the C-X bands, with good matching and fairly regular radiation patterns in different frequency regions. The feeding and radiating features of the antenna element are extensively analyzed and also optimized as concerns the matching features by means of different numerical procedures. The possibility of dual polarization behavior is considered through a double-stacked configuration. From the proposed topology, compact array configurations can also be derived for scanning purposes.

Objective
The toxic dose of irradiation required to achieve stable mixed hematopoietic chimerism is the major limitation to its clinical application in transplantation and other nonmalignant conditions such as hemoglobinopathies. This study examines the additive effect of costimulatory blockage, to our previously described tacrolimus-based conditioning regimen, in further reducing the dose of total-body irradiation to achieve stable mixed chimerism in rats.
Methods

Fully mismatched, 4- to 6-week-old ACI and Wistar Furth rats were used as donors and recipients, respectively. Recipients were administered CTLA4-Ig 2mg/kg/day (alternate days) in combination with tacrolimus 1 mg/kg/day (daily) from day 0 through day +10, anti-lymphocyte serum 10 mg at day +10 (single dose), and total-body irradiation ranging from 100–600 cGy, prior to bone marrow transplantation (day 0) with 100 × 106 of T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells. Levels of donor chimerism were determined over a period of 12 months.
Results

The short course of CTLA4-Ig, tacrolimus, and ALS led to dramatic engraftments at reduced doses of irradiation: 100% (5/5) and 93% (13/14) of the animals developed mixed chimerism at 400 cGy and 300 cGy, respectively. At 300 cGy, recipients exhibited durable, multilineage mixed chimerism at 365 days with donor cells ranging from 19–42% (mean 23.4%) with no evidence of graft-vs-host disease. These mixed chimeras exhibited in vitro (mixed lymphocyte reaction) and in vivo (skin grafts) donor-specific tolerance.
Conclusion

This study suggests that addition of costimulatory blockade to a tacrolimus-based conditioning regimen reduces the dose of irradiation required to achieve stable multilineage chimerism in rats.

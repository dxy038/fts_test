Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) can be designed to adapt to the driver´s current needs, for example, taking the traffic conditions in the immediate vicinity of the ego vehicle into account. This motivates the design of a system intended to measure the local traffic conditions in a way, which corresponds to the driver´s perception of traffic conditions. A new method of measurement is introduced. It is based on automotive sensor technology. A stochastic approach is employed to optimise and evaluate the relationship between the subjective measurements made by the driver and the objective measurements presented. To this end, the drivers´ subjective ratings are taken as reference. The analysis presented here is based on simulation data. The outcomes show that the design of the developed simulation environment is applicable to this work. It is shown that the objective measures correspond to the driver´s subjective ratings. Thus, it is possible to estimate the driver´s perception of traffic conditions using a technical measurement. The algorithm in its presented form is appropriate to give an estimation, which can be used as an input parameter for ADAS.

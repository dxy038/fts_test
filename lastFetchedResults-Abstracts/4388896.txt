The problem of spectrum-shared ability is addressed by considering the shared-path protection in flexible bandwidth optical networks with distributed data centers interconnect. The overall objective of the problem is to minimize blocking probability of cloud service requests and to improving spectrum efficiency. We proposed a survivable algorithm with the spectrum-shared ability (SA_SSA) to address the above problem. For comparison, a traditional algorithm with spectrum-shared ability (TA_SSA) is also introduced. Simulation results show that, considering different the spectrum-shared abilities, SA_SSA is better performance in terms of blocking probability of cloud service requests, spectrum occupation ratio, and spectrum redundancy ratio compared to TA_SSA.

The numerical simulation analysis of adjacent building vibration induced by urban subway transit is made under simple and multiple support excitation, and is compared to experiment and analysis in situ. The results show that: (1) about the adjacent building vibration induced by urban subway transit, the numerical simulation analysis under multiple support excitation is more close to in situ experiment and analysis than under simple support excitation; (2) floorÂ´s vibration is mainly expressed floor slab vibration, and the amplified vibration between floors mainly concentrate to the low band below 20 Hz.; (3) the numerical simulation analysis should consider the damping effect of ground vertical vibrations induced by urban subway transit in building, as far as possible to adopt the theoretical mode under multiple support excitation, which can get more objective and scientific analysis conclusion.

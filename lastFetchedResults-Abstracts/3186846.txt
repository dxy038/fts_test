The purpose of optimal reconfiguration of a distribution network is a matter of finding the best topology of the network to achieve the considered goals. This paper presents an algorithm for optimal reconfiguration of distribution networks using Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA) based on Graph Theory (GT) as a multi-objective optimization problem. The objective function considers the real power losses, and the network voltage deviation index. Also, lines and transformers loading limits are considered as constraints in the optimization problem. To assess the capabilities of the proposed approach, two networks are studied: the IEEE 33-bus distribution network as a small grid and Bardsir regional medium voltage distribution network as a large-scale grid. Simulation results show both voltage profile improvement and loss reduction compared to the situation before the reconfiguration. The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB software and then evaluated by DIgSILENT Power Facrory 14.0.515 software.

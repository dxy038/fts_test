Robust topology optimization has gained importance during the last years. This paper presents a robust approach to topology optimization using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. A key contribution of our approach is that our optimization model handles structural robustness through the first two objectives, namely, the expected compliance and its variance; whereas a third objective incorporates the volume of the structure and tackles the sizing optimization problem. Finally, a major contribution of the proposed approach is that it returns a Pareto frontier showing the designer an array of possible solutions and unveiling the existing tradeoff between the different problem objectives, namely the expected compliance, variance of compliance, and volume of the structure.

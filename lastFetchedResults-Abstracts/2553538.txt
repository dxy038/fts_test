Background and Objective: The sinuses are empty holes that placed within the face bone. The internal surfaces of sinuses are covered with mucous membranes. The paranasal sinuses are approximate to anatomical proximity and its disease can spread to the cranial cavity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the maxillary sinus floor mucosal thickening of patients referred for cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study performed on 161 patients tomography (80 females and 81 males) referred to a specific radiographic center for taking CBCT imaging tomography for treatment including implant insertion at maxillary sinus site and situation that sinus were seen evaluated. All evaluation registered by two examiners in a monitor and same position. Chi-square test was used to investigate the relationship between two variables. 
Results: The highest percentage of patients referred to radiographic center was aged 51-60(64.5%) and the lowest percentage was 71-80 years old (3.7%). A total of 64.6 % of samples had bilateral increase mucus and 11.2 had unilateral increased mucus. The prevalence of thickening sinus mucosa in men were more than women (P=0.016). According to the CBCT images the highest prevalence of maxillary sinus floor mucosa increase was observed in May (17.4%) and the lowest increase was observed in December (5%).
Conclusion: The increase of maxillary sinus floor mucosa was associated with age, sex, and monthly visit.

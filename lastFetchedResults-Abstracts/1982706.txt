The objective of this work was to study the heat-induced gelling properties, at acid pH, of porcine plasma previously treated with microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) under high pressure (HP), when kept under refrigeration conditions for different times (setting time). The results indicated that, although the cross-linking activity of MTGase was enhanced under pressure, consequently, improving the thermal gel texture, the most significant effects, particularly on gel hardness, were obtained by keeping the treated plasma solutions under refrigeration for at least 2 h before gelation. On the whole, under such conditions, increases of approximately 60% of this textural parameter, calculated on the basis of the values corresponding to the heat-induced non-treated plasma gels at pH 5.5, were achieved. However, from the SDSâ€“PAGE profiles, it can be suggested that mechanisms other than polymerisation by MTGase explain the beneficial effects of the treated plasma cold storage on gel texture. In contrast, the setting time had no effects on the water-holding capacity of heat-induced plasma gels at acid pH value, although this gel property was slightly enhanced by submitting porcine plasma solutions to the combined treatment (MTGase plus HP), with improvements being in accordance with the better-structured network of these heat-induced plasma gels.

Background: Adjustment disorder (AjD) is a transient mental health condition emerging
after stressful life events. Its diagnostic criteria have recently been under revision which led
to the development of the Adjustment Disorderâ€“New Module 20 (ADNM-20) as a self-report
assessment.
Objective: To identify a threshold value for people at high risk for AjD.
Methods: As part of a randomized controlled trial evaluating a self-help manual for burglary
victims, the baseline data of all participants (n=80) were analyzed. Besides the ADNM-20,
participants answered self-report questionnaires regarding the external variables post-traumatic
stress disorder symptomatology, depression, anxiety, and stress levels. We used cluster
analysis and ROC analysis to identify the most appropriate cut-off value.
Results: The cluster analysis identified three different subgroups. They differed in their level
of AjD symptomatology from low to high symptom severity. The same pattern of impairment
was found for the external variables. The ROC analysis testing the ADNM-20 sum score
against the theory-based diagnostic algorithm, revealed an optimal cut-off score at 47.5 to
distinguish between people at high risk for AjD and people at low risk.
Conclusion: The ADNM-20 distinguishes between people with low, moderate, and high
symptomatology. The recommendation for a cut-off score at 47.5 facilitates the use of the
ADNM-20 in research and practice.

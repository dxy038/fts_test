Objective: Coronary artery disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetics as compared to general population. To know the demographic and in patients treatment difference between patient of myocardial infarction alone and those with type-II diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases.Material and Methods: A one-year, hospital-based prospective cohort study was conducted at coronary care unit of Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar. Main Outcome measures were to assess demographic and inpatient treatment/ mortality differences between patients of myocardial infarction (MI) alone or with other cardiovascular diseases (CVD, group 1) and patients of MI with type 2 diabetes (group 2).Results: A total of 506, patients, with an episode of MI, mean age 57.5 (11.2 S.D.) years, were admitted during one year period. Off 506 patients, 152 (30%) had type 2 diabetes with mean duration 7.8 (7.9 S.D.) years and 354 (70%) had MI alone or with other CVD. Between-group analysis indicated that in-patient mortality was statistically greater in, group 1 as compared to group 2 (Relative Risk, 3.972; 95% CI 1.44 - 10.94). Within-group analysis indicated that raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically associated with higher in-patient mortality in, group 1 (0.001 and 0.007, Wilcoxon matched pair test, respectively).Conclusion: Our results have shown higher in-patient mortality in patients of MI alone or with other CVD as compared to patients of MIwith type 2 diabetes. Do we have a higher rate of instant (sudden/ street) deaths in type 2 diabetics as compared to general population?

The SmartGrid concept has been calling attention worldwide, being appointed by experts as a possible paradigm rupture in the power electricity sector. SmartGrids bring a number of functionalities and new forms of integration and relationships between the various players, who need clear and objective conceptualization as well as methodologies for analysis of costs and benefits. Thus, it is essential to analyze all aspects from the perspective of all those involved in order to establish optimal deployment policies, so as to maximize the associated social benefits. In this context, this paper presents a methodology that allows the evaluation of functionalities deployed along time, enabling the proposition of roadmaps according to the current characteristics of the utilities and based on social benefits. Furthermore, are presented the main results of the Brazilian Roadmap, obtained under an R&amp;D project approved by the Brazilian Energy Agency and coordinated by the Brazilian Association of Distribution Companies.

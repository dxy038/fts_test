Robust output-feedback controller against various perturbations is proposed for satellite formation keeping. The mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub> controller with regional pole placement constraints is designed based on linear HillÂ´s equations. The mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub> controller takes into account both the disturbance rejection aspects and the LQG aspects. In addition, the closed-loop poles can be forced into some sector of the stable half-plane to obtain well-damped transient responses. The problem is reduced to a convex optimization involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), so it can be solved efficiently. Extensive simulation studies were conducted for the validation of the proposed robust controller using Matlabtrade. The simulation results demonstrate that the developed multi-objective control system is robust stable and optimal in the sense of H<sub>2</sub> norm, and has good steady-state and dynamic performances against various disturbances for the satellite formation system

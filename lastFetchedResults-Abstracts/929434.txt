The paper focuses on the evaluation of the economic losses in the industrial sector due to a lack of power quality. The term power quality includes, in general, a set of boundary conditions which allow electrical systems connected to the grid to function as planned. Therefore, the operation of the power system outside these boundaries directly impacts on the economic performance of the whole system. The evaluation of the economical loses derived from this fact has been the subject of several studies, mostly applied to individual cases, with calculation methodologies either too complicated to be applicable, needing a large input of data, mostly dealing with confidentiality issues, or based on particular cases and impossible to extrapolate. The objective of this paper is provide decision makers and authorities responsible of enforcing compensations for losses derived of power quality issues with a relatively easy to apply methodology for calculating the real quantity of these losses. An example of the application of this methodology and an analysis of the results is also provided. The validation of the methodology and its use for different comparison analysis was also carried out. Conclusions are given at the end of the work and further research is proposed.

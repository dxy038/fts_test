The industrial basin of Decazeville (Riou-Mort watershed, South-West France) is well known for its heavy metal pollution and
its subsequent environmental effects on the Lot-Garonne River system. The source of this pollution is the Riou-Mort River, which
drains smelting waste areas. A first survey after remediation works has revealed elevated dissolved uranium (UD) concentrations in
the outlet of the Riou-Mort River.
The objective of this research is to identify the origin of UD in the Riou-Mort watershed and to evaluate the impact of industrial
activities on this element. Uranium was measured at 10 water sampling sites, located upstream and downstream the industrial basin,
and in three smelting waste deposits. Uranium concentrations in the smelting waste deposits reach up to 14.4 mg kg−1 and
(234U/238U) activity ratios (AR) are near unity. Dissolved U concentrations in the Riou-Mort River and its main tributaries ranges
over two orders of magnitude from 0.02 to 6.1 μg L−1. The highest levels were measured in a site with no anthropogenic pollution,
upstream from the industrial area.
This observation suggests that UD is mainly linked to weathering; the elevated U concentrations originate from the naturally
occurring radioactive materials (NORM) located in the Permian bedrock and no significant U pollution exists, at present, in the
Riou-Mort watershed.
This work demonstrates that spatial monitoring coupled with a long time-series are an essential prerequisite in assessment of
spatiotemporal variations of UD, prior to a diagnostic of pollution in a small watershed.

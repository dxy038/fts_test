A total of 4 experiments with various ponding depths were conducted. With a combined method, dye and iodine-starch staining were used to visualize soil macropore and soil water flow patterns, respectively. Flow patterns with a low infiltration amount were similar to the macropore patterns and macropores were the main factor to control the flow patterns. As the infiltration amount increased, flow patterns were influenced by both macropores and boundary conditions. Soil water flow patterns became more heterogeneous as the heterogeneity of macropores increased. Stained patterns played a much important role in redistribution of infiltration water than the soil saturation change in the stained region. The contaminants concentration decreased dramatically in the upper depth and then the decreasing trend was slowed down.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Depression is the most common mental disorder in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This disorder has adverse effects on the course of disease and treatment process and is recognized as an independent risk factor for death in hemodialysis patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the relaxing effects of Benson relaxation technique on depression in patients undergoing hemodialysis.
METHODS: This clinical trial was performed on 65 hemodialysis patients. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups: control group (n=32) and intervention group using Benson relaxation technique (n=33). The intervention group performed Benson relaxation exercises twice a day for 20 minutes over one month. Beck Depression Inventory was completed one month before and one month after the intervention. The control group received usual treatments (IRCT: 2014011115393N2(
FINDINGS: Overall, 51 patients were male in the present study. The mean age of participants was 48.57±9.18 years in the intervention group and 49.93±8.17 years in the control group. Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the studied variables. The mean score of depression in the intervention group decreased from 32.46±9.86 before the intervention to 23.30±9.23 after the intervention; the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Also, the mean score of depression in the control group changed from 30.58±9.24 before the intervention to 30.83±9.63 after the intervention.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that Benson relaxation technique is effective in reducing depression in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, by applying this technique, we can take a major step towards improving and preventing patients’ psychological problems.

As a continuation of our research and with the aim of obtaining new antituberculosis agents which can improve the current chemotherapeutic antituberculosis treatments, new series of quinoxaline-2-carboxamide 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv, using the radiometric BACTEC 460-TB methodology. Active compounds were also screened by serial dilution to assess toxicity to a VERO cell line. The results indicate that some compounds exhibited a good antituberculosis activity and the arylcarboxamide analogues 3, 8, and 9 were the most active compounds (EC90/MIC1). Also, the cytotoxic effects indicate that these compounds have a good Selectivity Index (SI).

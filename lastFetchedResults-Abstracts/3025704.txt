Our overall objective is to help students develop the foundational capabilities needed to become successful software developers, that will help them learn how to effectively analyze, design, and implement software systems. The main focus of this paper is the development and use of a concept-based learning tool that helps students acquire effective analysis and design skills for the development of object-oriented programs. Concept maps are tools for organizing and representing knowledge; they enable learners to construct, navigate, share, and criticize knowledge models represented as augmented graphical concept maps. Using the concept map-based tool, students can use concept maps of object-oriented programming to help them solve problems.

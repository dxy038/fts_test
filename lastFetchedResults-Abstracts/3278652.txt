Problem Definition: Project managers manage the development process by enabling software developers to perform inspection of early software artifacts. However, an inspection can only detect the presence of defects; it cannot certify the absence of defects or indicate how many defects remain post inspection. Managers need objective information to help them decide when they can safely stop the inspection process. A reliable estimate of the number of defects remaining in software can aid mangers in determining whether there is a need for additional inspections.

By examining the COD, TP degradation factors to analyze the characteristics of constructed wetlands. This article discusses the impact on COD of pH, ORP, ALR, hydraulic loading and the TP of HRT, planting. The results show that the clean dirt capacity of constructed wetlands is a complex biodegradation adsorption process. A variety of factors can affect the degradation and control the relationship between the parameters well to achieve the better performance.

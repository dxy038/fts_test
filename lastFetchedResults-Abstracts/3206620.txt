The objective of this paper is to propose a maximum current amplitude control (MCAC) for the Photovoltaic (PV) power system with the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) behaviour. The proposed MCAC strategy can generate the demanded active and reactive power depending on the output power condition of the PV array and the power rating of the grid-tied inverter. It can be adapted to meet different LVRT grid codes, easily. In this paper, the analytical derivation of the proposed MCAC for the PV power system will be introduced in detail. Computer simulations are shown to verify the performance of the proposed MCAC.

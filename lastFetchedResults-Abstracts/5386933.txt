A dual feed switched-beam patch antenna is proposed and analyzed. A square patch of one wavelength in dielectric substrate is designed to accommodate TM<sub>020</sub> and TM<sub>200</sub> mode distributions. Using this concept, dielectric constant between 2.32 to 10.2 can be utilized to obtain bidirectional patterns without minor lobes. The feed position must be appropriately designed to provide good matching and isolation between the feeds. For instance, the substrate of epsiv<sub>r</sub> = 4.4 is fed at 0.114lambda<sub>0</sub> offset from the center of the antenna. This antenna is suitable for using as elements of a phased array of switched- beam elements.

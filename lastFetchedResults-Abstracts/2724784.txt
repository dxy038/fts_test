A soft-switching bidirectional dc-dc converter using a lossless active snubber is proposed in this paper. In the proposed converter, zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) of main switches is achieved by utilizing an active snubber which consists of auxiliary switches, diodes, an inductor, and a capacitor. Although conduction losses associated with additional components increase, switching losses are significantly reduced due to the ZVS operation of main switches. Therefore, total efficiency is improved. Moreover, there is no reverse-recovery problem of the intrinsic body diodes of the switches. To verify the ZVS of the main switches and efficiency improvement of the proposed bidirectional dc-dc converter, theoretical analysis and experimental results from a 200 W prototype are discussed.

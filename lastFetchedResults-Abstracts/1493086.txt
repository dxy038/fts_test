Quantifying how tillage systems affect soil microbial biomass and nutrient cycling by manipulating crop residue placement is important for understanding how production systems can be managed to sustain long-term soil productivity. Our objective was to characterize soil microbial biomass, potential N mineralization and nutrient distribution in soils (Vertisols, Andisols, and Alfisols) under rain-fed corn (Zea mays L.) production from four mid-term (6 years) tillage experiments located in central-western, Mexico. Treatments were three tillage systems: conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT) and no tillage (NT). Soil was collected at four locations (Casas Blancas, Morelia, Apatzingán and Tepatitlán) before corn planting, at depths of 0–50, 50–100 and 100–150 mm. Conservation tillage treatments (MT and NT) significantly increased crop residue accumulation on the soil surface. Soil organic C, microbial biomass C and N, potential N mineralization, total N, and extractable P were highest in the surface layer of NT and decreased with depth. Soil organic C, microbial biomass C and N, total N and extractable P of plowed soil were generally more evenly distributed throughout the 0–150 mm depth. Potential N mineralization was closely associated with organic C and microbial biomass. Higher levels of soil organic C, microbial biomass C and N, potential N mineralization, total N, and extractable P were directly related to surface accumulation of crop residues promoted by conservation tillage management. Quality and productivity of soils could be maintained or improved with the use of conservation tillage.

The objective of this article is to offer some information about traditional practice regarding the use of the genus Buddleia in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, with the aim of increasing its use as a potential fodder for sheep feeding in the area. Based on the indigenous Tzotzil Botanical Classification, three Buddleia groups were taxonomically identified. Group 1 includes the species Buddleia skutchii and Buddleia cordata, group 2, Buddleia americana and Buddleia crotonoides, and group 3, Buddleia parviflora and Buddleia nitida. Even though all these groups have been used as fodder, the most frequently used are the species in group 1, which are the most common species with the widest distribution patterns. Based on their chemical composition, the species of higher nutritional values were B. skutchii and B. crotonoides (crude protein (CP), 10.6% and 9.3%; neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 37.5% and 33.7%; in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), 75.9% and 58.2%; and digestible energy (DE), 3.3 and 2.5 Mcal/kg). The first one has been recommended for sheep feeding based on its high nutritional value. During an intake and digestibility trial, B. skutchii leaves substituted 50% of Kikuyo grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) without decreasing dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility. These results suggest that the systematic incorporation of B. skutchii into existing sheep production systems could markedly increase feed resources without higher pressure on pasture land.

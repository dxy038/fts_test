Rv0899 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis belongs to the OmpA (outer membrane protein A) family of outer membrane proteins. It functions as a pore-forming protein; the deletion of this gene impairs the uptake of some water-soluble substances, such as serine, glucose, and glycerol. Rv0899 has also been shown to play a part in low-pH environment adaption, which may play a part in pathogenic mycobacteria overcoming the host's defense mechanisms. Based on many bacterial physiological data and recent structural studies, it was proposed that Rv0899 forms an oligomeric channel to carry out such functions. In this work, biochemical and structural data obtained from solution NMR and EPR spectroscopy indicated that Rv0899 is a monomeric membrane-anchoring protein with two separate domains, rather than an oligomeric pore. Using NMR chemical shift perturbation and isothermal calorimetric titration assays, we show that Rv0899 was able to interact with Zn2+ ions, which may indicate a role for Rv0899 in the process of Zn2+ acquisition.

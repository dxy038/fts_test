Taguchi´s robust design is a popular methodology utilized within many different industries in order to improve product quality and process performance at low cost. The robust design of dynamic system is used to find the optimal control factor settings so that the measured response is closest to the ideal function. Although Taguchi´s robust design was effective in improving performance of products or processes, the statisticians pointed to inefficiencies in the method for highly nonlinear problems and complexity of the parameter design. This paper proposes a general model for optimizing the robust design of dynamic system parameter based on the quality loss function. The objective is to minimize the average quality loss instead of maximizing SN ratio suggested by Taguchi. The example of high-precision positioning device is provided to demonstrate the implementation and effectiveness of the proposed method.

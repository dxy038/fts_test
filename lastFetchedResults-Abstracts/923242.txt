Cardiac biomarkers have been employed for clinical and experimental heart disease evaluation. However, several laboratory assays for the evaluation of these biomarkers are available but there is no confluence of results in healthy rabbits. The objective of this research is to provide information about hs-CRP, ANP and ACE serum levels in healthy rabbits by specific commercially ELISA kits and to generate basic tools for cardiovascular research. 38 healthy New Zealand White rabbits were used. All of them were adults, males/females, weighing 2, 2±0,28kg. The blood samples were obtained from jugular vein puncture and the biomarkers serum concentration determined by specific ELISA commercial kits at 450nm. Real concentrations were determined from standards curves of each biomarker provided by the manufacturer and the normal values of these parameters were determined statistically by means, SD, CV, minimum and maximum values, p < 0, 05. The results pointed serum concentrations: ACE 8,93±2,17ng/ml, range 8,24–9,92ng/ml and CV=24,27%; ANP 312,15±100,18pg/ml, range 280,29-344,01pg/ml and CV=32,10%; hs-CRP 369,70±193,40ng/ml, range 308,21–431,10ng/ml and CV=52,31%. This information was not found in the literature using this methodology and its applicability in future researches represents a challenge due to the wide variability of biomarkers and biological heterogeneity of cardiovascular research.

The evidences recorded in past wars and in the present century constitute undeniably documented cases that prove that passive defense is of vital importance. One of the actions that has a specific relation with passive defense, and that can be taken for lowering human vulnerability is to locate shelters that people can use in times when enemy starts attacking. These shelters can be designed at both general and private levels. Private ones are localized at apartment levels, and general ones at city levels. Aimed at exploring the effects of wars and its associated crises upon the society and the space, the present article has set out to localize the multi-purpose and shelter functions in cities on the basis of documentary and library studies in the form of analytical-descriptive studies. For this purpose, it has identified three criteria and eleven factors that have a bearing on the localizing of general shelters, measuring them through conducting surveys with specialists- in the form of interviews and questionnaires- by using analytical network process as one of the newest ways of decision making methods developed for making multi-criteria decisions. Finally, it has identified the most preferred places that are appropriate with the objective through an overlapping of data layers and implementation of these coefficients in Arc GIS software. To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, the District 6 of Tehran has been selected as a case study due to having activity-specific and situational merits on the one side, and due to the fact that a remarkable part of the population live in cities on the other hand.

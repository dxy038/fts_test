This objective of this paper is to demonstrate that NMP is a viable pollution prevention alternative to methylene chloride. Marine Corps Logistics Base (MCLB), Albany, GA, USA was the host site for the demonstration. MCLB's primary function is maintenance of military ground support vehicles, electronic equipment, and small arms. These maintenance processes require the use of methylene chloride to depaint or strip metal parts. A full scale demonstration of NMP was performed at the host site, which included equipment retrofits and material substitution. A cost analysis, using standard US EPA costing methods, was performed and emissions were estimated based on material usage. Results show that, based on the success measures and criteria established by MCLB, NMP is a satisfactory pollution prevention alternative to methylene chloride.

Objective To explain why a subgroup of young men aged
20–24 years do not follow the general trend within the
adult general population, of declining violence with age.
Method A cross-sectional survey of 8,397 adults in
households in Great Britain in 2000. Computer-assisted
interviews to measure self-reported violence and psychiatric
morbidity.
Results Young men age 20–24 years had the same high
prevalence of self-reported violence as those 16–19 years
(52 vs 50%; P = 0.737), contrasting with women whose
violence demonstrated a progressive decline (24.1 vs
14.5%; P = 0.002). This age-related gender difference was
explained primarily by young men who continued to live at
home with their parents (OR = 2.53; 95%CI 1.23–5.20),
with smaller effects from childhood conduct disorder
(OR = 1.56; 95%CI 0.75–3.21), and hazardous drinking
(OR = 2.23; 95%CI 0.76–6.56). Young men living at
home were only 4.3% of all male respondents but yielded
an attributable risk fraction of 21.4% reporting victim
injury.
Conclusion The persisting high prevalence of violence
among young adult men is explained by delay in moving to
social independence. Public health interventions to reduce
effects of known risk factors for violence must consider
progressive economic and social changes in young men’s
lifestyles in westernised countries.

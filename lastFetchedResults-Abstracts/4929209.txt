The objective of this paper is to further improve the antenna filtering capability by making this band- notched behavior switchable. Depending on whether interference from other systems is present or not, the antenna filtering feature can be activated. This work was initiated in F. Antonio-Daiu et al. (2006), but evolved designs with more promising results will be presented here. An antenna with similar performance was presented in V. A. Shameena et al. (2006), but some important differences exist, which will be discussed later. Moreover, using a similar configuration to that of the switchable antenna, a further improvement can be introduced to the band-notched UWB antenna by making the rejected frequency tunable.

In this paper we report the first simulation-based results concerning the potential of a CW radar system for differential attenuation measurements around 19 GHz. The objective is the estimate of the columnar water vapor from a LEO satellite or from airplanes carrying a nadir pointing radar system. Simulations are based on a microwave propagation model for atmosphere, radiosonde data, and ground backscattering cross section models. The correlation between the radar output and the columnar water vapor is shown.

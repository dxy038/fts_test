Objective: Studying suicide can ‎be of assistance to prepare the ‎ground for the adoption of ‎effective preventative measures. ‎In the present study, our aim was ‎an in-depth review of suicide ‎epidemiology in the city of Sari, ‎in the northern part of Iran. Our ‎focus was on geo-demographic ‎and other risk factors affecting ‎the frequency of suicide in order ‎to demonstrate populations with ‎greater risk of suicide for future ‎preventive and protective ‎measures‏.‏
Method: In a prospective study, ‎during a one year period, a ‎descriptive semi-structured ‎questionnaire was used to ‎conduct interviews with subjects ‎who attempted suicide and ‎referred to one of the four major ‎trauma and emergency centers ‎in the city of Sari, or with the ‎relatives of those who completed ‎their attempt. Convenience ‎sampling method was used. ‎Statistical analysis was ‎performed using SPSS-20 ‎software. Multivariate tests were ‎based on ?2 values. Logistic ‎regression was performed ‎estimating the effect of risk -‎factors‏.‏
Results: In this study, 228 ‎suicide attempters were enrolled; ‎of whom, 78.5% were female; ‎‎28.5% of all the attempts resulted ‎in death. The odds of suicide ‎completion were significantly ‎increased in the following cases: ‎married status (OR: 3.49; 95% CI ‎‎2.82,4.53), illiteracy ‎‎(OR:2.71;95%CI 2.10,3.64), ‎presence of comorbid physical ‎illness (OR:2.22;95%CI ‎‎1.64,3.21), history of previous ‎suicide attempt (OR:2.03; 95%CI ‎‎1.56,2.81), and age over 50 (OR: ‎‎2.01, 95% CI 1.14,3.05). Suicide ‎outcome estimated worst in the ‎married illiterate attempters. The ‎leading method of use was ‎suicide by burn (SBB).‎
Conclusion:  The variety ‎observed in  the regional ‎distribution of  suicide risk factors ‎calls for more non-discriminatory ‎attention and adoption of ‎precautionary, preventative and ‎protective measures for each ‎section of the society accordingly.‎

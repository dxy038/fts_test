In code division multiple access (CDMA) systems a significant degradation in detection performance due to multiuser interference can be avoided by the utilization of interference cancellation methods. Further enhancement can be obtained by optimizing the power allocation of the users. The resulting constrained single-objective optimization problem is solved here by means of particle swarm optimization (PSO). It is shown that the maximum number of users for a CDMA system can be increased significantly if an optimized power profile is employed. Furthermore, an extensive study of PSO control parameter settings using three different neighborhood topologies is performed on the basis of the power allocation problem, and two constraint-handling techniques are evaluated. Results from the parameter study are compared with examinations from the literature. It is shown that the <i>von-Neumann</i> neighborhood topology performs consistently better than <i>gbest</i> and <i>lbest</i>. However, strong interaction effects and conflicting recommendations for parameter settings are found that emphasize the need for adaptive approaches.

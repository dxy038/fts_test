Objective: In magnetoencephalogram (MEG) recordings of patients with epilepsy several types of sharp transients with different spatiotemporal distributions are commonly present. Our objective was to develop a computer based method to identify and classify groups of epileptiform spikes, as well as other transients, in order to improve the characterization of irritative areas in the brain of epileptic patients.
Methods: MEG data centered on selected spikes were stored in signal matrices of C channels by T time samples. The matrices were normalized and euclidean distances between spike representations in vector space RCÃ—T were input to a Ward's hierarchical clustering algorithm.
Results: The method was applied to MEG data from 4 patients with localization-related epilepsy. For each patient, distinct spike subpopulations were found with clearly different topographical field maps. Inverse computations to selected spike subaverages yielded source solutions in agreement with seizure classification and location of structural lesions, if present, on magnetic resonance images.
Conclusions: With the proposed method a reliable categorization of epileptiform spikes is obtained, that can be applied in an automatic way. Computation of subaverages of similar spikes enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of spike field maps and allows for more accurate reconstruction of sources generating the epileptiform discharges.

The trend in electrical drives is to integrate the frequency converter, the electrical motor, and even the gear or the pump into a single unit, in order to reduce the costs, to increase the overall efficiency and the equipment reliability. This paper presents the first integrated regenerative frequency converter motor for industry applications, based on a matrix converter topology. The low volume, the sinusoidal input current, the bidirectional power flow, and the lack of the bulky and limited-lifetime electrolytic capacitors recommend this topology for this application. This paper shows how the matrix converter disadvantages-the lack of bidirectional power devices, the lower voltage transfer ratio, and the overvoltages caused by the input filter during power-up-that have delayed the industrial implementation have been overcome. In order to demonstrate the validity of the solution, a 4-kW matrix converter motor prototype is built using a standard frequency converter motor enclosure for testing the requirements for an industrial drive. The tests demonstrate the good performance of the drive

One of the most prevalent challenges in the semiconductor industry is improving productivity without increasing capital spending. This focus has resulted in the development of multiple equipment efficiency and cycle-time reduction programs. In 1996, the IBM Microelectronics Division manufacturing facility in Essex Junction, Vermont, developed a continuous improvement process (CIP) to address these issues and, more specifically, to understand and improve the continuous improvement factor (CIF) of its range management system. Range management is a line operating methodology that divides the process flow of a fabricator into 24-hour segments. Daily, the objective of the system is to move work in progress (WIP) through operations where raw process time (RPT) at a given x-factor equals 24 hours. A team of eight range analysts (assembled from manufacturing and technical areas) use CIP to measure the success of this activity and, through data analysis, seek to determine and rectify root cause detractors. Measurements for improvement include both CIF (number of successful range moves in a 24-day period) and cycle time. This paper discusses development of CIP from theory to implementation and results. Specifically, it focuses on the techniques utilized by the range analyst team in the C.I. model. Included in this model are analyses for the TAKT (German for &#8220;beat&#8221;) chart, cycle time, equipment, process, staffing, root cause, as well as the various methods of measurements

The objective of the present work is to assess the analysis capability of
thermo-hydraulic code on the direct contact condensation in the core makeup tank (CMT)
of passive high-pressure injection system (PHPIS) in the CARR Passive Reactor (CP-
1300). RELAP5IMOD3.1 is chosen to evaluate the code predictability on the direct
contact condensation in the CMT. It is found that the predictions of MOD3.1 are in
better agreement with the experimental data than those of MOD3.0 From the nodalization
study of the test section, the I-node model shows better agreement with the
experimental data than the multi-node models. RELAP5IMOD3.1 identifies the flow
regime of the test section as vertical stratification. However, the flow regime observed
in the experiment is the subsonic jet with the bubble having the vertical cone shape. To
accurately predict the direct contact condensation in the CMT with RELAP5IMOD3.1,
it is essential that a new set of the interfacial heat transfer coefficients and a new flow
regime map for direct contact condensation in the CMT be developed.

In this paper, a contribution to the characterization of power MOS transistors under optimized switching behavior is presented. This behavior is shown to be appropriate for improving the performance of new high frequency power processing topologies. Reverse conduction through the channel resistance is imposed, thus avoiding the problem of integral diode recovery time without resorting to external diodes. Control circuit design is discussed. Advantages and drawbacks are analyzed and tested in a series resonant converter. An insight into MOSFET reverse conduction modeling is presented, aimed at the development of an accurate model for computer aided design of topologies using the MOSFETÂ´s bidirectional paths. Simulation results are shown to prove the accuracy of the model

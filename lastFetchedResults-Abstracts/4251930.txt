Structural reliability analysis requires characterizing uncertainties in strength and loads for selected failure modes. The objective of this paper is to study the uncertainties associated with the vertical wave-induced bending moment on ship hull girders. Also, uncertainties in whipping effects are investigated. Spectral analysis was used to calculate the maximum life-time wave loads on a ship with and without whipping. This type of analysis requires knowing a set of basic random variables. The uncertainties in wave-induced and whipping bending moments were investigated using Monte Carlo simulation by randomly generating these basic random variables and calculating wave and whipping loads on a ship. A parameteric study was performed to investigate the effect of variability in these basic random variables on the uncertainties of wave loads

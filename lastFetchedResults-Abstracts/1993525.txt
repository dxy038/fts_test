In large structures, such as arch dams, geometric shape optimization due to the high construction costs is very important. The main goal of this study is proposing a mathematical model and providing three algorithms to find the optimal shape of the dam. Due to efficient behavior, a double-curvature arch dam will be analyzed in this paper. The suggested formulation can include various design constraints, and can choose the lowest value for the dam volume.
Optimization of arch dam depends on the related geometrical restrictions. To have a general procedure, all of these parameters will be included in the authors' model, and the required constrains will be comprised in the solution process. In this optimization approach, for better compliance with the facts, the behavioral constraints are used, as well.
Based on the pervious experiences, for selection geometry of the structure, a general parabolic model is utilized and all of parameters defining the structure geometry, as the design variables, are considered. As the objective function, dam volume is defined. It should be mentioned that all practical constrained can be included in this optimization model. A mixture of methods for solving the optimization of the arch dam is available. One of the most efficient algorithms is the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) technique. In this study, three approximation tactics are used.
A variety of the double-curvature arch dams are analyzed.  Due to volume limitation of the article, only a few samples will be presented here.  Findings clearly demonstrate that the suggested techniques can lead to the optimal structural shape. According to the numerical results, the volume of concrete dam decrease significantly. Moreover, the analysis's times will be considerably short.

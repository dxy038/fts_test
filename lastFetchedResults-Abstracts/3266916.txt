The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the advantages of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in a simulated microgrid testbed that is characterized by photovoltaic (PV) power as the primary generation source. A PV source interfaced with BESS at the DC link has the advantage that it can emulate a conventional generator with the added attribute of providing reserve power. A microgrid test bed is designed with multiple PV/BESS systems dispersed at various locations. The presence of BESS enables the PV sources with the ability to participate in frequency and voltage regulation during grid-connected mode of operation. A droop control based power sharing scheme is employed for the purpose of regulation. A strategy for charging is also employed in the case where the power demanded is less than the PV array power.

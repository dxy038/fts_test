We consider the problem of call admission and resource management on the downlink of a CDMA wireless network supporting stream and packet services over a range of transmission rates and offering different grades of service. The objective is to design a simple admission scheme that ensures adequate signal-to-interference ratios for both the incoming call, if accepted, as well as previously admitted calls. Our approach is based on two key ideas: (a) an integrated measure of resource utilization that is independent of the traffic mix, and (b) an estimate of the additional resources required to accommodate the new call seeking admission. The current work considers estimation of the total transmitted power distribution on the downlink, and prediction of its displacement as a result of admitting a new call. The total transmitted power distribution is estimated based on data obtained from the power control module. The displacement of total transmitted power is predicted based on the characteristics of the incoming call and the current resource utilization. Dynamic call capacities are compared with static capacities to indicate the effectiveness of the algorithm in achieving high network utilization with low probability of overload.

<strong>Objective:</strong> The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Persian version of Chicago Multi-Scale Depression Inventory (CMDI) in Iranian subjects.<br /><strong>Method:</strong> CMDI was translated into Persian according to the standard method. Two hundred and sixty two medical students (of whom, 114 were re-tested 5-10 days after the first test), Archibald 40 patients with major depressive episodes, 23 patients with multiple sclerosis, 21 patients with epilepsy, and 43 normal persons selected from acquaintances of the patients were included in the study. Samples were matched for age, sex, marital status, and education. Exclusion criteria were as follows: neurologic diseases (except multiple sclerosis or epilepsy) or head trauma, serious medical condition, alcohol or opioid abuse. Subjects were omitted if they did not answer any of the items in BDI-II or CMDI. Demographic questionnaire, BDI-II, and CMDI were given to the subjects. <strong><br />Results:</strong> The mean scores of CMDI and its subscales for depressed people were significantly different from multiple sclerosis patients, normal people, and medical students. The mean score of mood subscale for epilepsy patients was significantly different from normal people. The mean score of CMDI and evaluative and vegetative subscales for epilepsy patients were significantly different from the normal subjects and medical students. Correlation coefficient between BDI-II and CMDI was 0.86. Reliability and internal consistency coefficients for CMDI were 0.92 and 0.95 respectively. Cut off scores for CMDI and mood, evaluative, and vegetative subscales were 123, 46, 36, and 44 respectively.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Persian version of CMDI has content,Â  convergent, and discriminant validity and is reliable and internally consistent. These findings support the use of CMDI in Persian participants.

This paper describes the performance of patch antennas and microstrip transmission lines, manufactured with a use of meshed (perforated) printed circuits. Meshed printed circuits are used primarily on the ground side and in some cases on the transmission line side. The objective of this research is to provide elements and feeding lines suitable for wearable, inflatable and other flexible antennas. Considered meshed printed circuits feature with greater width of mesh lines than grided antennas made with thin wires. Two models of antenna elements and six transmission lines were manufactured and measured. The results of studies have shown than among major advantages is bandwidth broadening in the considered meshed elements.

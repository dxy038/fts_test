Spatial planning of boundary regions in IRAN for being of  length borders and locating  more than half of country provinces in international borders with neighboring countries ,to prosper special position in the country planning  system .Therefore the main object of this thesis in the meanwhile making clear boundary regions spatial planning in programming system ,recognition of elements and its component, the methods of connection of these elements with other elements of country programming system and recognition of importance and necessity of dealing with boundary regions spatial planning. Results show that development and security in the boundary regions correlative with each other. Also intensity of regional unbalance between border regions and interior regions in IRAN effected on national development, in other words although undeveloped in the boundary regions led to in security to produce an effect on undeveloped and insecurity on the whole country.

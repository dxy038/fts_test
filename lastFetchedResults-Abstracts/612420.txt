Introduction & Objective: The quality of life in asthmatic patients is affected by different factors including lack of knowledge about the disease. This study was designed to investigate the effects of the compliance-based education model on asthmatic patient’s quality of life.
Materials & Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 70 patients who had referred to Besat outpatient clinic in Kerman were selected as samples and randomly divided into experiment and control groups. Members of the experiment group took part in four sessions of group education, each lasted 2 hours while the control group received no intervention. Both groups of the patients, before and eight week safter the intervention, filled out the questionnaire of asthmatic patients’ quality of life designed by Marks et al in 1992. Data was analyzed by SPSS / 16 software.
Results: Before the intervention, the total mean scores of the quality of life in the experiment and control groups were 34/7 and 32/85 respectively. After the intervention the figures reached to 27/1 and 32/82 that was a statistically significant difference. Based on the results of this study, after the education the quality of life in the experiment group had improved significantly while there wasn’t seen such a  difference in the control group.  Also the mean score of the quality of life in the experiment group compared with the control group was significantly better (P < 0/05).
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that educating asthmatic patients with compliance based model can improve the quality of their lives, therefore health care team specially the nurses can use this model while taking care of patients with asthma.

In this paper, a bidirectional cross-linking transverse flux permanent magnet synchronous motor is presented, which has a larger space utilization ratio than the traditional transverse flux machine. The stator core unit can make full use of rotor permanent magnets, and effectively increases no-load back-electromotive force (back-EMF), with the features of easy manufacturing. The structure and the driving principle of this motor are introduced. The 3-D magnetic circuit model is established, and the analytical expression of the no-load back-EMF and the torque are derived. In addition, the magnetic field and torque are analyzed by the 3-D finite element method (FEM). A prototype was designed and manufactured. The back-EMF and static torque experiments were carried out. The theoretical analyses agreed with the experimental results well. That verified the validity of the theoretical analysis.

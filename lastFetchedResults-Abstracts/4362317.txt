Patients with hemiplegia caused by cerebral haemorrhage need to train in the acute stages of the condition. The motion of rolling-over is the most primitive training, although the evaluation of rolling motion is rather subjective. In this study, an objective method using accelerometry has been developed. Fifty hemiplegic patients were involved in the study. Two tri-axial accelerometers were attached to the acromion and pelvic. Training was given in the rolling motion from supine to lateral. The acceleration signals at two sites were recorded and converted to a digital signal to store in a computer. The response time, time course of signal, and attractor of vertical and lateral direction of signal were evaluated. The response times from supine to lateral position were less than two seconds, two to five seconds, and more than five seconds for normal subjects, patients who could achieve a rolling motion, and patients who could not achieve one, respectively. From the time course of acceleration, the onset of rolling motion was observed. When both shoulder girdle and pelvic girdle have a simultaneous onset, the rolling motion is smooth. A smooth, quarter circle attractor was observed. This method may be effective in evaluating whether patients can achieve rolling motion

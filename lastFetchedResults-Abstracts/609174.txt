Cryopreservation of semen has long been seen as a means of benefiting the breeding of animals of agricultural importance, and has been recognized as contributing to the conservation of endangered and to overcome aspects of male infertility in animals. The composition of extender, suitable cryoprotectants and optimum freezing and thawing rates are important factors for successful semen cryopreservation. Tris based extenders with egg yolk and glycerol has been widely used for freezing buck semen. This study was conducted with an objective of comparing the addition of two levels of egg yolk (10 and 20%) in the semen extender. A total of 20 ejaculates were collected from eight Jakhrana bucks twice daily using an artificial vagina. Each ejaculate was evaluated for progressive motility, plasmalemma integrity (live), functional membrane integrity (HOS) and acrosome integrity before and after freezing. No significant difference was found between 10% and 20% groups in terms of motility and live percentage before freezing. However, HOST differed significantly (P < 0.01) between 10 and 20% groups (69.4±1.35 and 78.2±1.32 respectively) after four hours of equilibration. In addition, prefreeze intact acrosome percentage between 10% and 20% groups (93.4±0.54 and 91.3±0.69 respectively) also differed significantly (P < 0.01). After freeze-thawing, there was no significant difference between groups in terms of post thaw motility and live percentage. Further, functional membrane integrity and acrosome intact sperms also differed significantly (P < 0.05) between the groups. The presence of 10% egg yolk has exerted better functional membrane integrity (60.56±1.31), acrosome intactness (48.0±1.06) than the presence of 20% egg yolk (52.7±1.87 and 32.5±2.59 respectively). The results from this study  proves that 10% egg yolk addition is better than 20% egg yolk level as functional membrane integrity and intactness of acrosome are very essential for better fertility.

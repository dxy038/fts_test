This paper presents an approach to estimate the characteristics of multiple narrow-opening cracks from magnetic flux leakage signals. The locations, orientations, lengths and depths of the cracks are the objective of the inversion process. This procedure provides a reliable estimation of crack parameters in two separate subsequent steps. In the first step, the Canny edge detection algorithm is used to estimate the locations, orientations and lengths of cracks. Then, an inversion procedure based on space mapping (SM) is applied to estimate the cracks depths efficiently. The accuracy of the proposed inversion technique is examined with two different arrangements of multiple cracks.

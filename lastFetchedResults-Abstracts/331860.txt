Objectives: To compare fluconazole capsules (50 mg daily for 14 days) and itraconazole capsules (100 mg daily for 15 days) in the treatment of denture stomatitis, using objective clinical and mycological outcome measures.

Methods: Twenty complete denture wearers with denture stomatitis were enrolled. At baseline, palatal erythema was measured with an electro-optical instrument, a denture disc specimen was collected from the fitting surface of the denture for culture and an oral rinse and imprint cultures were collected for mycological culture. Ten patients received fluconazole capsules (50 mg daily for 14 days) and 10 received itraconazole capsules (100 mg daily for 15 days). Palatal erythema was reassessed and the microbiological specimens re-collected on day 14.

Results: The most common form of denture stomatitis seen in this group of patients was Newton's Type II. All patients responded to advice to leave their dentures out at night but there was a poor overall improvement in denture hygiene. There was an objective reduction in palatal erythema following treatment with both fluconazole and itraconazole. A wide range of yeasts were isolated from the mouths of all the denture stomatitis patients before treatment. C. albicans was the most common isolate. A mycological cure was achieved in only five of the 20 patients, one in the fluconazole group and four in the itraconazole group. A further eight patients in the fluconazole group and three in the itraconazole group had reduced yeast counts by the second visit.

Conclusion: Fluconazole and itraconazole were of comparable efficacy in the treatment of denture stomatitis, on the basis of reduction in palatal erythema and mycological culture.

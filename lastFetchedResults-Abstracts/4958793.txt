To minimize cost and size, most commercial digital cameras acquire images using a single electronic sensor (CCD or CMOS) overlaid with a color filter array (CFA) such that each sensor pixel only samples one of the three primary color values. To restore a full-color image from CFA samples, the two missing color values at each pixel need to be estimated from the neighboring samples, a process that is commonly known as CFA demosaicking or interpolation. This paper introduces and compares seven demosaicking methods in terms of both subjective and objective (PSNR) evaluations.

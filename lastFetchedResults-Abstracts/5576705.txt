With the advances in smart mobile devices technology, participatory sensing is particularly useful in personalizing behavioral interventions that focused on the individual needs of overweight user. The behavioral intervention to weight monitoring attempted to induce weight loss using motivational theory. Therefore, the objective of this paper is two-fold: First, to map the interpretation of motivation and incentives from computer science view into psychology literature. Second, to conceptualize intrinsic incentive using computational approach in a participatory sensing application. For the first objective, we specify the theoretical basis for health behavioral change which is used in the mobile weight-loss, diet, or physical activity intervention developed by researchers in participatory sensing application. To address the second objective, this paper proposed a conceptual framework for intrinsic incentives that integrate Self-determination theory model of health behavior change into our participatory sensing application, w8L0ss. The proposed framework provides an integrated architecture for health and pervasive domain for the present study which focuses solely on intrinsic incentives.

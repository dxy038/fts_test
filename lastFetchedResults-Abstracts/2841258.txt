The paper presents an application of a new method - Modified Fuzzy Programming Technique(MFTP) for the Fuzzy optimal solution to the Single Objective FuzzyTransportation Problem(SOFTP) with Fuzzy parameters in terms of Triangular Fuzzy Numbers without defuzzifying the problem. Numerical illustrations are solved to show the better results and comparisons are also provided to show the same. The problem is formulated where parameters of cost objective functions, supply and demand are taken as Triangular Fuzzy Numbers. The proposed method is applied for the first time to solve the SOFTP. First, the SOFTP is converted into a Multi-Objective Transportation Problem and then solved by the MFTP.

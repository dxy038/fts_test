The growth of wind generation embedded in distribution networks is leading to the development and implementation of Active Network Management (ANM) strategies. These aim to increase the capacity of Distributed Generation (DG) that can connect to a network. One such ANM strategy is generation curtailment where DG is given a nonfirm connection under which the network can instruct a generator to reduce its output under specified conditions. Currently in the UK the Orkney distribution network operates a curtailment scheme for wind and other renewable generation [1]and a similar scheme is being developed for the Shetland Islands [2]. The main objective of this paper is to explore the options for Principles of Access (PoA) for curtailment of wind generation on distribution networks which employ ANM. The PoA define the commercial rules by which a DG unit obtains access to the distribution network and under an ANM curtailment scheme the PoA defines the curtailment instructions that would be sent to different DG units when network constraints occur. The scenarios studied in this paper are based on the Orkney distribution network.

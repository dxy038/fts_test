With the availability of high-end integrated analog front-ends, distinction between different digital ultrasound systems is determined almost exclusively by their software component. Moreover, PC-based implementations for sophisticated medical imaging technologies have emerged where powerful multi-core computational ability replaces expensive embedded systems. The objective of this work is to develop a modular low-cost PC-based digital ultrasound imaging system that has almost all of its processing steps done on the PC side.

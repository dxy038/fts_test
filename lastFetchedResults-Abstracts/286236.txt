Background:  Natural rubber latex allergy is a potentially life-threatening, immunoglobin E (IgE) mediated reaction. Despite great strides in identification of high-risk groups, methods for diagnosis remain limited in the United States and most evaluations are performed by allergists. Objective:  The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of evaluation for latex allergy and association with practice characteristics in United States dermatologists. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of one third of United States Fellows of the American Academy of Dermatology. Results:  The survey response rate was 43%. Of responding dermatologists, 17% stated that they evaluate patients for latex allergy, most commonly with a radioallergosorbent (RAST) or use test. Only 3.6% stated that they perform prick or scratch tests for latex allergy in their office, and most of these dermatologists (86%) prepare their own latex prick test solutions. Evaluation for latex allergy was significantly associated with patch testing, photopatch testing, an interest in contact dermatitis, and number of contact dermatitis books owned, but not with number of years in practice. Conclusions:  Most United States dermatologists do not evaluate patients for latex allergy, most likely because of lack of available antigens and because methods for diagnosing latex allergy are not familiar to most dermatologists.

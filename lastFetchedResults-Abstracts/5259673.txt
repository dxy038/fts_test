This paper presents a multi-objective optimization of a Permanent Magnet Assisted Synchronous Reluctance Machine with three barriers per pole, based on a genetic algorithm. The aim of the study is to optimize both the torque and the high frequency electro-magnetic saliency, to obtain a motor with a good behaviour when controlled by means of sensor-less techniques with high frequency signal injection. The optimization is carried out changing the permanent magnet coercive field and the thickness of the magnets of each barrier, independently.

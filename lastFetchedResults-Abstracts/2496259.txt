Objective
A 10 year old presented with painless loss of vision as the first manifestation
of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). Clinical assessment detected diagnostic features
of NF1 and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan confirmed presence of
plexiform neurofibroma and bilateral optic pathway glioma (OPG). The child
was managed with chemotherapy which helped in improvement of vision.
Review of current literature recommends vision testing in diagnosed cases of
NP1 till 7 years of age; this is aimed at detecting visual impairments resulting
from a symptomatic OPG.

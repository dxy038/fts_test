Background and Objective: Considering the higher incidence of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disorders in diabetes mellitus, this study was conducted to evaluate the beneficial effect of oral 6-week administration of Cynara scolymus L. (CS) on contractile reactivity of isolated thoracic aorta.

Materials and Methods: Wistar rats were divided into control, CS-treated control, diabetic, and CS-treated diabetic groups. For induction of diabetes, streptozotcin (STZ) was intraperitoneally administered (60 mg/Kg). Meanwhile, CS-treated groups received CS mixed with standard pelleted food at a weight ratio of 6.25% for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, contractile reactivity of thoracic aortic rings to KCl and noradrenaline was determined using isolated tissue setup. 

Results: Although CS-treated diabetic group did not show a significant reduction in KCl-induced contractile respone as compared to diabetic groupa, but NA-induced response was significantly lower in treated-diabetic group (P<0.05) as compared to diabetic group. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference between control and CS-treated control groups regarding contractile reactivity. 

Conclusion: Oral administration of CS for 6 weeks could improve hyperglycemia and also attenuate the contractile responsiveness of the vascular system and this may prevent the development of hypertension in diabetic rats.

The author suggests that more understanding of the characteristics of a cellÂ´s impedance may lead to improved accuracy or suggest measurement techniques best suited for evaluating capacity by impedance measurements. He describes some measurements made in an effort to achieve this objective. The cell chosen for this work was a Globe model TCG-1680, a flooded lead-calcium cell sized at 1680 A hours at the 8 h rate. Comparisons between lumped constant networks and cell impedances are discussed as well as linearity and surface charge effect

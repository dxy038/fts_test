Background: Miscarriage is a common phenomenon complicating more than half of pregnancies. Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) is defined as three or more pregnancies lost before the twentieth week of gestation. It is believed that abnormality in maternal immune reaction to fetus and sharing of HLA antigens might be associated with RPL. Objective: To investigate the effect of HLA-DRB1 sharing between the couples with recurrent pregnancy loss on the pregnancy outcome after leukocyte therapy. Methods: Sixty primary RPL women who were immunized and followed after therapy (30 successful and 30 unsuccessful) and their husbands formed the cases of this study. In addition, one hundred healthy women were considered as the controls. HLA-DRB1 genotypes of all the cases and controls were checked by PCR-SSP method. Results: HLA typing indicated that the prevalence of HLA-DRB1 sharing (defined as at least one allele sharing) between the couples with unsuccessful outcomes was significantly higher compared to those with successful outcomes (63.3% vs. 23.3%, p < 0.004). Moreover, HLA DRB1*07:01 allelic group was significantly more frequent in the patients with unsuccessful outcome compared to the controls (18.3% vs. 8%, p < 0.04). Conclusion: Our results confirmed the role of HLA sharing in RPL and revealed that HLA-DRB1 typing may be a valuable prognostic factor for the leukocyte therapy outcome.

Color is an important indicator of product quality evaluation. In this paper, a method of color difference detection based on BP neural network was proposed. RGB values of objects were firstly extracted, which were three inputs of BP neural network. Then the trained neural network converted RGB values to L*a*b* values. Finally, according to the formula of the color difference, the objective quantificational value was calculated. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect and analyze the color difference of objects.

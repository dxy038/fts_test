The primary objective of this research work is to study and investigate the performance measures of Reactive protocols (AODV, TORA) and Proactive protocols (DSDV) routing protocols of MANET using TCP & CBR based traffic models. In this paper we will simulate the environment used for analyzing, evaluating and implementing AODV, DSDV and TORA routing protocols in MANET, to analyze the performance of above said protocols based on Packet Delivery Ratio, Average End-to-End Delay and Throughput. We will investigate the effect of change in number of nodes on MANET routing protocols. Here, we will analyze and compare the performance of MANET routing protocols based on both CBR and TCP based traffic patterns. We have used the NS-2 simulator for performing various simulations and used awk scripts for analyzing the results.

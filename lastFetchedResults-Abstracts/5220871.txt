Temperature measurement and monitoring plays a very important role in cold chain of blood. This paper describes a Web-based real-time monitoring system on cold chain of blood. The objective is split into three different tasks. First, wireless sensors send sensing data to database server through two types of networks: 1) For outdoor network, wireless sensors on mobile devices send data through the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) network, 2) For indoor network, wireless sensors in blood bank send data through intranet. Second, sensing data are stored into a database, and can be reviewed by an Internet Web interface which allows authorized users to configure necessary information. The third piece of the proposed monitoring system is an alarm mechanism, which gives the alarm information to staff when the temperature or the relative humidity exceeds an acceptable limit. There are four types of alarm methods: by email, by smart messaging service text messages, by dialing and by pop-up Web page with alarm information or alarm music. Pushlet technology is adopted to accomplish pop-up Web pages from web server to clients. Our system is verified in several blood banks and the results show that it is superior to the existing products of the similar type.

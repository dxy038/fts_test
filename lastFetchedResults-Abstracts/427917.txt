There is only limited research on subjective social status (SSS) and its effect on health in general and in minority US populations in particular. This study first investigates the determinants of SSS and the relationship between SSS and objective social status. It then explores the relationships of SSS to self-reported physical health, self-reported mental health, and self-rated health (SRH). The study population consists of Mexican-origin individuals living in low-income neighborhoods in Texas and grouped into acculturation categories based on nativity and use of the Spanish language. We also investigate the role of reference groups.

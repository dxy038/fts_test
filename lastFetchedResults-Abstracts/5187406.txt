Jetty road is the link of onshore to artificial island. It is used for marine oil exploitation and production. As a result of special terrain conditions of shallow beach area affected by tide, the project construction of jetty road has characteristics of higher investment, higher degree of risk, longer construction duration and higher maintenance costs. Overflow roads have been developed recently with height lower than the highest water level. The roads are different from usual roads in that overflow is allowed during high tide. The most important factor that influences the cost is the height of jetty road. To assure reasonable working days, maintain quality and reduce the project cost, it is important to determine a proper road height. Combining with full life-cycle cost theory, this paper presents a genetic algorithms (GAs) model for multi-objective optimistic design of jetty road height. The model is applied to oil field around Bohai Sea, and the numerical results show that the optimistic models perform well for optimistic problem and reduce the engineering cost.

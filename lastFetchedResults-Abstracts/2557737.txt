Objective(s): In previous studies, antioxidant activity of Viola odorata L. has been demonstrated. In this study, we have investigated the anti-melanogenic effect of extract and fractions of the plant in B16F10 cell line. Materials and Methods: Impact of different increasing concentrations of extract and fractions of V. odorata was evaluated on cell viability, cellular tyrosinase, melanin content and mushroom tyrosinase as well as ROS production in B16F10 murine melanoma cell line. Results: Viola odorata had no cytotoxicity on B16F10 cells compared to control group. Kojic acid as positive control had significant decreasing effects on cellular and mushroom tyrosinase activity, melanin content and ROS production (P<0.001, for all cases). V. odorata (1-20 Î¼g/ml) decreased all measured parameters including cellular tyrosinase and melanin content as well as ROS production and among all extract and fractions ethyl acetate fraction had the best effect (P<0.05). Conclusion: Viola odorata had promising anti-melanogenic activity through inhibition of cellular tyrosinase activity and ROS production as well as melanin content. More basic and clinical studies need to aver its impact.

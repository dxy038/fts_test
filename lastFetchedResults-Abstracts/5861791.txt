This paper reviews the current status and implementation of integrated charging methods for plug-in electric vehicles and hybrids. Battery charger systems are categorized into on-board and off-board types. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Typical on-board chargers limit the high power because of weight, space, volume and cost constraints. Integration of the charging function into the electric drive system and electric motor has been developed to minimize battery charger costs, weight and volume. In an integrated charger, motor windings are used for the inductors. The motor drive inverter serves as a bidirectional ac-dc converter. Various integrated charger topologies are presented, compared, and evaluated based on cost, weight, suitability, configurations, and other factors.

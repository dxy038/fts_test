We present a time dynamic channel simulator for broadband fixed wireless access systems which properly combines earlier reported models for single degradation effects. The wideband model combines the effect of rain, scintillation, vegetation and multipath propagation. The objective is to specify the relationship between propagation effects and combine them to construct a comprehensive channel model suitable for designing fade mitigation techniques and evaluating system performance. The dynamics of rain attenuation is done using the Maseng-Bakken model. The multipath propagation is modeled using the geometrical based single bounce elliptical channel model. The spatial correlation between multipath taps during rain is incorporated using a space-time rain attenuation model. A lowpass filter which models the power spectral density of scintillation is used to describe the dynamic characteristics of scintillation. The signal fading due to swaying vegetation is described by utilizing a multiple mass-spring system to represent a tree and a turbulent wind model. In addition, numerical results under different combinations of propagation impairments are presented.

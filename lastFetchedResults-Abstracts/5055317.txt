We are preparing to return humans to the Moon and setting the stage for exploration to Mars and beyond. However, it is unclear if long missions outside of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) can be accomplished with acceptable risk. The central objective of our project, the Earth-Moon-Mars Radiation Exposure Module (EMMREM), is to develop and validate a numerical module for completely characterizing time-dependent radiation exposure in the Earth-Moon-Mars and Interplanetary space environments. EMMREM will provide the ability to predict radiation exposure on the surface or atmosphere of Earth, on the Moon, Mars, and in interplanetary space between Earth and Mars. EMMREM is being designed for broad use by researchers to predict radiation exposure by integrating over almost any incident particle distribution from interplanetary space. EMMREM is being developed using contemporary state-of-the-art particle radiation models. Beyond this, it will have the capability to incorporate new and improving models, as they become available, to give continually improved estimates of radiation hazards and effects. EMMREM will be comprehensively validated using direct and contemporaneous measurements near Earth, at the Moon and Mars to significantly reduce uncertainties in radiation exposure predictions. EMMREM will characterize the extremes, statistics, and variations over time of radiation exposure caused by solar energetic particles and cosmic rays. The results of EMMREM will improve risk assessment models so that future human exploration missions can be adequately planned for. This makes highly relevant to NASAÂ´s Vision for Space Exploration and the Living With a Star Programs.

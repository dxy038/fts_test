Galvanic isolated gate drivers require a control signal as well as energy transmission from the control side (low-side) to the driver side (high-side). An additional backward signal transmission is preferred for error signals, status information, etc. This is often realized by means of several transformers or opto-couplers. Decreasing the number of isolation elements results in lower cost and a higher degree of miniaturization. This work presents a gate driver with bidirectional signal transmission and energy transfer via one single transformer. The key concept proposed in this paper is to combine bootstrapping to deliver the main gate charge for the driven power switch with additional energy transfer via the signal transformer. This paper also presents a very efficient combination of energy transfer to two high-side supply rails with back channel amplitude modulation. This way an isolated gate driver can be implemented that allows 100% pulse-width modulation (PWM) duty cycle at low complexity and system cost. The proposed high-side driver IC with integrated power supply, modulation and demodulation circuits was manufactured in a 180nm high-voltage BiCMOS technology. Measurements confirm the concept of bidirectional signal transmission with a 1MBit/s amplitude modulation, 10/20MHz frequency modulation and a maximum power transmission of 14mW via the transformer.

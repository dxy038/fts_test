The objective of the present paper is to demonstrate the influence of temperature in the incorporation of trivalent europium chloride, in Y-zeolite by solid state reaction were discuss. The results obtained from luminescence properties of europium III (Eu III) ion, confirms that solid state reaction between hydrated Eu III chlorides and ammonium forms of zeolites is possible. The solid state ion exchange obtained in different temperatures exhibited a large degree of exchange. Results from luminescence (emission, excitation and lifetime) and X-ray diffractometry were also evaluated. The luminescent properties of Eu III show this ion in different sites into zeolite. X-ray diffractometry shows that zeolite is stable at high temperature.

OBJECTIVE: Hyperglycemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients following coronary artery bypass grafting. Tight glycemic control in perioperative period can reduce these events. The goal of this study was to determine whether combination of continuous infusion and subcutaneous glargine as a basal insulin could improve glycemic control. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Diabetic patients who were candidate for CABG were randomized to receive continuous insulin infusion with or without subcutaneous Glargine insulin for at least 72 hours which started 24 hours before surgery and continued for 48 hours after surgery. 
RESULTS: A total 84 subjects were required. In group A (n = 45) continuous insulin infusion was used for glycemic control and in group B (n = 39) we used continuous insulin infusion with subÂ¬cutaneous glargine insulin. Blood glucose level was significantly better in desirable range in group B in comparison to group A. Total mean blood glucose level  in group A was 186.1 mg/dl and in group B was 174.3 mg/dl (P = 0.008). Frequency of hypoglycemia (blood glucose <70 mg/dl) was 0.66% in group A and 0.5% in group B that was similar (P = 0.530). The mean length of stay in the hospital was not different between two groups (P = 0.288). 
CONCLUSION: We found out that a combination of continuous insulin infusion and glargine insulin as main basal insulin can improve glycemic control in diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

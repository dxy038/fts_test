Temperature dependences of various important FC applications parameters of La<sub>3</sub>Ga<sub>5.5</sub>Nb<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>14 </sub> (LGN) single crystals were measured. These are sound velocities within range 77-370 K, dielectric permittivities within 4.2-400 K, thermal conductivity within 50-300 K. From above data temperature dependences a full set of elastic and piezoelectric constants were calculated. Results show existence of cuts with zero temperature coefficients of resonant frequencies and sound velocities. We found an anomaly in derivative of &#949;<sub>33</sub> near 50 K. Thermal conductivity behavior shows on disorder in crystal structure

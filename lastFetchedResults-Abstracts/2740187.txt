Visual discomfort is caused by several factors such as accommodation-vergence conflict and window violation in conventional stereoscopic displays. To ensure comfortable conditions in the stereoscopic viewing, it is essential to develop an effective way of improving visual comfort in stereoscopic displays. This paper proposes a new method for visual comfort improvement that adjusts the disparity of a scene under the guidance of an objective assessment metric of visual comfort. The proposed method employs a visual comfort assessment metric that takes into account various discomfort factors in the stereoscopic viewing. The results of subjective assessment experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently improve visual comfort in the stereoscopic viewing.

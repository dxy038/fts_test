Advertising as the dominant means of communication in an organization plays an important role in the success of the organization. The primary objective of this study is to explain young consumers' attitudes toward advertising. In this regard, a conceptual model is presented to evaluate the effect of six independent variables of product information, hedonism, good for the economy, image and social role, the deviation of the values of materialism and consumer attitudes toward advertising. Participants in this study were selected from among university students in Yazd. The results indicated that three of the six hypotheses were confirmed. Two variables, namely the deviation from the values and materialism have a negative impact on the attitudes of consumers towards advertising. These results will enable advertising managers to be more sensitive towards consumersâ€™ attitudes and to ensure that their campaigns will not adversely affect the performance of the companies they follow. These findings can also help consumers to better understand the role of advertising in the purchase of goods

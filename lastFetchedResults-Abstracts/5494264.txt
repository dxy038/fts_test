The demand for bidirectional DC/DC converters is increasing because of their potential capability for sustainable energy conversion systems where the power is to be captured from or stored in energy storage elements. This paper presents a three-phase series resonant bidirectional converter which is suitable for high power applications. The converter consists of two three-phase full bridge networks, the resonant tanks and a high frequency three-phase transformer. All switches can work either in ZVS or ZCS mode. The voltage drop on leakage inductances is minimized by choosing the switching frequency close to the resonant frequency, allowing high efficient power conversion. The phasor analysis is applied to the circuit to develop a dynamic model for designing the control system. Simulation and experimental results are used to verify proper operation of the proposed converter and the obtained dynamic model.

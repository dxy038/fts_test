Objectives
The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in color and color coordinates after accelerated aging of resin composites depending on the measuring modes of reflectance and transmittance.
Methods

Color of seven resin composites (1-mm thick specimens) was measured in the reflectance mode and in the transmittance mode. After the baseline color measurement, the specimens were aged for total energy of 150 kJ/m2. Color change after aging was calculated in the reflectance mode and in the transmittance mode. Based on the data of A2 shade composites, the influence of measuring mode on the color change image and changes in three color coordinates (ΔL*, Δa* and Δb*) after aging was analyzed by ANOVA (p < 0.01).
Results

Measuring mode influenced image, ΔL* and Δa* values. There were significant correlations between the color changes measured in the reflectance mode and in the transmittance mode (r = 0.91).
Significance

The color changes in the transmittance mode can roughly be estimated based on the reflected color changes.

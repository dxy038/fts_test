This paper deals with the temperature tracking problem for a jacketed chemical reactor involving an exothermic reaction. A high gain based controller are designed to achieve this control objective. The proposed high gain control design involves a design function that has to satisfy a well defined mild condition. Usefull expressions of such a function are proposed from the available sliding mode like controllers. More specifically, it is shown that one can easily incorporate a filtered integral action in the control design to provide a robust offset free performance in te presence of step like disturbances while reducing the sensitivity with respect to noise measurements. The performances of the proposed control approach are illustrated in a realistic simulation simulation framework. Two controllers have been particularly used depending on the reaction rate processing. More specifically, the reaction rate is not taken into account or considered in the control design throughout an adequate high gain observer.

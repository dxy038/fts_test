This paper presents a new three-phase anti-resonance hybrid delta-connected capacitor bank for power factor correction in low-voltage industrial power systems. In general, shunt capacitors connected in series with reactors should be designed carefully before installation in order to avoid series and/or parallel harmonic resonance between the capacitors and system inductances. However, the system parameters vary dynamically according to the power system configurations and loads. Consequently, harmonic resonance might occur after the capacitors have been installed. The main objective of the proposed hybrid capacitor bank is to compensate for reactive power without any harmonic resonance. The hybrid capacitor bank is a combination of delta-connected capacitors connecting in series with three small-rating single-phase inverters without any matching transformer. The inverter is used to improve the characteristics of the capacitors. This paper deals with the implementation and control of the hybrid capacitor bank. Experimental results verify the viability and the effectiveness of the proposed anti-resonance hybrid delta-connected capacitor bank for reactive power compensation.

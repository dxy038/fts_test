This paper proposes a single-phase to three-phase drive system composed of two parallel single-phase rectifiers, a three-phase inverter and an induction motor. The proposed topology permits to reduce the current and consequently to reduce the power ratings of the power switches of the front-end rectifier. The model of the system is derived and it is shown that to reduce the circulating current is an important objective in the system design. A suitable control strategy, including the PWM technique, is developed. Experimental results are presented, as well.

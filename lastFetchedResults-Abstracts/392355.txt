Objective: there is a lack of uniformity in the literature of the definition of delayed facial palsy (DFP) after vestibular schwannoma surgery. The aim of this study was to attempt to provide a clear definition of this clinical entity. Methods: a prospective study was undertaken of all patients, with an intact facial nerve postoperatively, undergoing vestibular schwannoma surgery during a 16-month period. Delayed facial palsy was defined as any worsening of facial function after the initial assessment of postoperative function. Results: a total of 67 patients, operated on between February 1994 and June 1995 satisfied the requirements of the study. Eight of the 67 patients developed a worsening of facial function after the first postoperative day. There were three males and five females with an age range of 29â€“73 years (mean, 53 years). Conclusion: DFP should be defined as any deterioration of facial function after vestibular schwannoma surgery.

Sub systems of complex system or platforms under network centric warfare (NCW) condition are required to work collaboratively in order to achieve an overall mission objective. It is very difficult to model and analyze the reliability of this kind of multiplatform phased mission system (PMS). At first, this paper sums up the characters of multiplatform PMS, and then put forward the method of mission representation, which can translate the multiplatform PMS into a PMS with single platform. The simulation is the best way to research the mission reliability of multiplatform PMS after contrasted other analytic method. Colored Petri Nets (CPN) is used to constructing the 3 levels framework of simulation model of multiplatform PMS. By transferred the multiplatform PMS into the initial token of CPN model, the reusability is hugely improved. The CPN model is demonstrated and validated by a simple example.

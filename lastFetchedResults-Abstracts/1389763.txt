CD10 is an important cell marker in the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and of breast myoepithelial (ME) cells in humans. The objective of this study was to assess the value of CD10 as a marker of canine ME cells using immunohistochemistry on routinely processed normal, dysplastic and neoplastic mammary tissue. Five different CD10 positive cell types were identified on the basis of cell morphology, pattern of immunoreactivity, and on the co-expression of additional cell lineage-specific markers.

 cells were typical fusiform cells with a ME cell phenotype (calponin- and cytokeratin [CK] 14-positive, CK8/18-negative). Type 2 cells were typical or atypical polyhedral cells with a luminal epithelial (LE) cell phenotype (calponin- and CK14-negative, CK8/18-positive). Type 3 cells had a type 1 phenotype with variable morphology, and type 4 were atypical neoplastic cells with a mixed ME/LE phenotype. Type 5 cells were typical fusiform cells with a stromal phenotype.

 cells were considered normal ME cells and were found in all sample types; type 2 cells were considered normal or neoplastic LE cells and were also found in all sample types; types 3 and 4 cells were restricted to tumour samples and to malignant tumours, respectively, and type 5 cells were found in all sample types, although predominantly in neoplastic tissue. The findings indicate that the CD10 antigen is a sensitive (although not specific) marker of canine ME cells in normal, dysplastic and neoplastic mammary tissue. Differences in the distribution and staining intensity of CD10-positive cells suggest a number of potential roles for this protein in the pathogenesis of canine mammary neoplasia.

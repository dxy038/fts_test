Abstract
Global warming has developed into a major environmental concern in recent decades. The primary source of C02 emission and accumulation in the atmosphere is the high consumption of fossil fuels that have a major share in energy use. Therefore C02 emission control and accumulation impacts the development of the energy sector and can change the set of feasible points for the development of the energy system. As a result different methods such as emission reduction policies, taxation and reduction of fossil fuels consumption are pursued in order to control CO2 emission and such measures are evaluated in energy models.
The available energy models, do not consider environmental safety problems and the competition between different pollution control policies. Therefore, in this paper C02 concentration reduction via environmental protection measures in the energy system is considered and in particular, the role of afforestation in view of mass balances of C02 and cost constraints.
The model identifies the best point through minimizing system costs given the constraints and the objective function Use of the model allows us to identify the impact of pollution control methods on C02 emission and accumulation. In addition, the model allows for estimating potential reduction of C02 emissions and comparison of met present value of different uses of available land for agriculture, pasture or forestry.

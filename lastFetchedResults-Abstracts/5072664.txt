A Newton-Raphson iterative technique is used to optimize the values of circuit parameters which characterize a voltage-controlled surface acoustic wave (SAW)-stabilized oscillator (VCSO). An expression given by T.E. Parker (1987) is used to calculate the double-sideband phase-noise-to-carrier ratio; good agreement between calculations and phase-noise measurements is achieved by minimizing the squared-error through the use of a Newton-Raphson minimization scheme. Less accurately known circuit parameters are thus optimized in an iterative fashion using exact expressions for the elements of the Hessian matrix. This technique is useful for the accurate determination of circuit parameter values; alternatively, it can be used in the design of low-phase-noise oscillators by using desired (rather than measured) phase-noise values in the objective function to be minimized.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is associated with elevated oxidative stress and decline in antioxidant defense. Vitamin E supplementation reduces oxidative stress level in diabetic pa-tients. Purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin E supplementation on glycemic control and lipid profile in type 2 diabetic patients. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study 31 type 2 diabetic patients with Fasting blood Sugar (FBS):140-200 mg/dl, Triglyceride (TG): 200-400 mg/dl, Cholesterol (TC): 200-300 mg/dl and mild hypertension were selected. Subjects received vitamin E 800 IU/day for 3 months. At the baseline and end of the study FBS, TC, TG, LDL, HDL, Glycated hemoglobin and fasting insulin level were measured.
RESULTS: In this study 31 type 2 diabetic patients (19 female, 12 male) with mean age 53.03 Â± 8.87 years were studied. Vitamin E supplementation for 3 months had no positive effect on type 2 diabetic patients. As FBS, TG and fasting insulin decreased but this decline was not significant. Also total Cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes were not remarkable.
CONCLUSION: Results of this study showed that 800 IU vitamin E administration for 3 months could not improve blood glucose, lipids , HbA1c, fasting insulin, systolic and diastolic BP in type 2 diabetic patients.

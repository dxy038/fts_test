A novel image segmentation method based on modified fuzzy c-means (FCM) is proposed in this paper. Using the neighborhood pixels selectively, a spatial constraint punishment term is added in the objective function of standard FCM to improve the robust to noise, raise the convergent rate and reduce computing time. Experiments on standard image segmentation prove the availability of the improvement.

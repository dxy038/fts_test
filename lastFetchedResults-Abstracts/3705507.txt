Different methodologies are available for clustering and classification purposes. The objective of the research is to prove the capability of self-organising maps (SOMs) to classify customers and their response potential from distributor, commercialiser, or customer electrical demand databases, with the help of load response modelling methodologies as support tools. The search for customer suitability is restricted to day-ahead and real-time products, in which interest is growing in developed countries. Therefore customer demand and response (demand and distributed generation policies) have been tested and compared with price curves. Both steps have been performed through SOMs. The results clearly show the capability of this approach to improve data management and easily to find coherent policies to accomplish cleared-demand offers in different prices scenarios.

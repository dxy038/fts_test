The paper presents two control algorithms for a matrix power converter with sinusoidal output currents at a desired output frequency. The first is based on space vectors for a 3x3 matrix converter. Output voltage waveforms are unique in that they do not simply vary between zero volts and a peak line voltage, as for typical PWM algorithms. The second is a two dimensional PWM algorithm for an NxM matrix converter, where output voltages are functions of both the input and output frequencies. Both algorithms assume balanced output loads and input voltage sources, that short circuits can appear across the output phases and that input currents can be discontinuous. Other capabilities of the matrix converter, such as bidirectional flow of power and input power compensation are not demonstrated in the paper

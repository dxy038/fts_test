The objective of this study was to characterize the quality attributes of pork derived from pigs of the following backgrounds: Duroc, Pietrain (Halothane negative, NN), Pietrain (Halothane positive, nn), Berkshire, Hampshire (rn+), Hampshire (RN−), and a synthetic line. A 10-member panel was trained to evaluate visual appearance of uncooked lean and fat, and flavor and texture of cooked chops. Hunter L*, a*, and b* values, hue angle, cookloss and Warner–Bratzler shear force were also determined. Visual color differences occurred due to genetic background. Chops from Duroc, Berkshire, Pietrain-nn, and the synthetic line were least pink. Chops from Berkshire carcasses appeared to have the most marbling in the lean and those from Pietrain-nn pigs appeared to have the least. Chops from Pietrain-nn and Hampshire-rn+ carcasses had the highest a* values while chops from Duroc, Pietrain-NN, and Hampshire-RN- carcasses had the lowest. Cook loss from chops from Duroc carcasses was lower than that from Hampshire rn+, Pietrain-NN and synthetic line carcasses. Shear force was highest for chops from Pietrain-nn and Hampshire-rn+ carcasses. Chops from Hampshire-RN− carcasses were most juicy followed by those from Hampshire-rn+, Pietrain-NN, Berkshire and Duroc carcasses. Shear force was positively correlated with abnormal flavor intensity, metallic taste, and chewiness (r=0.72, 0.94, and 0.69, respectively), and negatively correlated with sweetness (r=−0.73). Overall, genetic background had significant effects on many of the quality characteristics evaluated.

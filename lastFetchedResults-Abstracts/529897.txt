One of the most important ways that is proposed for management of carbon value is: Increasing the carbon aqumilation by means of carbon sequestration. Carbon is found in all living organisms and is the major bulding block for life on earth carbon exists in many forms, prominately as plant biomass, soil organic matter and as the gas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and dissolved in sea water, carbon sequestration is the long term storage of carbon in oceans, soils, vegetation and geologic formations. Although oceans store most of the earth, s carbon, soils contain approximately 75% of the carbon pool on land - three times more than the amount stored in living plants and animals, therefore, soils play a major role in maintaining balanced global carbon cycle. The effect shrubs and perennial grass and soil on CO2 fluxs in Hamedan Ranges are not know. The objective of this reaserch were to determine carbon sequestration in this factors. Resoult show that, between 9 spices, Astragals gosypinus has the hights potential for Carbon sequestration and Echinophora platiloba has a lowest, between dry wight and soil organic carbon and cover plant obtaind correlathon (R=0.52)

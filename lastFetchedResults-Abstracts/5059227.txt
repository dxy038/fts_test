Tacit knowledge exists in knowledge main-bodies of different hierarchy in enterprise. To enable full sharing and improve core competitiveness, incentive models of knowledge sharing for knowledge main-bodies of different hierarchy should be established; According to principal- agency theory, and taking into account incomplete information of knowledge sharing, multi-stages incentive model of knowledge sharing for knowledge worker, incentive model of knowledge sharing for knowledge team based on team sharing interests, and incentive model of knowledge sharing for supplier, are proposed. The results indicate that, in order to acquire maximum rewards in enterprise, special incentive contracts are to be made for different knowledge main-bodies, optimal incentive decisions to meet enterprise own objective are to be made, and knowledge bodyÂ´s knowledge sharing effort is to be improved.

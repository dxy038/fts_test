In this paper, a new optimal policy is introduced to determine and adapt the generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) network topology based on the current traffic load. The integrated traffic engineering paradigm provides mechanisms for dynamic addition of physical capacity to optical networks. In the absence of such mechanisms, the rejection of incoming requests will be higher. The objective of the proposed policy is to minimize the costs involving bandwidth, switching and signaling. The policy is derived by utilizing the Markov decision process theory. The new policy is split into two levels: the MPLS network level and the optical network level. In addition to the optimal policy, a sub-optimal policy and a threshold-based policy are also proposed which are less computationally intensive but have comparable performance to the optimal policy. The proposed policies have been evaluated by simulation and compared to some heuristics. Numerical results, which show their effectiveness and the achieved performance improvement, are presented.

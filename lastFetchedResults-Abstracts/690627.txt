Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii are major opportunistic waterborne pathogens causing hospital-acquired infections. Copper–silver ionization has been shown to be effective in controlling Legionella colonization in hospital water systems. The objective was to determine the efficacy of copper and silver ions alone and in combination in eradicating P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and A. baumannii at the concentration applied to Legionella control. Kill curve experiments and mathematical modeling were conducted at copper and silver ion concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 mg/L, respectively. The combinations of copper and silver ions were tested at concentrations of 0.2/0.02 and 0.4/0.04 mg/L, respectively. Initial organism concentration was ca. of 3×106 cfu/mL, and viability of the test organisms was assessed at predetermined time intervals. Samples (0.1 mL) withdrawn were mixed with 10 μL neutralizer solution immediately, serially diluted and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates. The culture plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and enumerated for the cfu (detection limit 10 cfu/mL). The results showed all copper ion concentrations tested (0.1–0.8 mg/L) achieved more than 99.999% reduction of P. aeruginosa which appears to be more susceptible to copper ions than S. maltophilia and A. baumannii. Silver ions concentration of 0.08 mg/L achieved more than 99.999% reduction of P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and A. baumannii in 6, 12 and 96 h, respectively. Combination of copper and silver ions exhibited a synergistic effect against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii while the combination exhibited an antagonistic effect against S. maltophilia. Ionization may have a potential to eradicate P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia and A. baumannii from hospital water systems.

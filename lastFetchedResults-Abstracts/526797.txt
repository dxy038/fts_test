Early-maturing flint maize germplasm could be an important alternative for the development of new early-maturing commercial hybrids adapted to cooler summer regions. Our objective was to evaluate the performance of flint populations in crosses with four testers from different heterotic groups, as sources of new potential inbred lines. Ten flint maize populations were crossed to four inbred testers representing Reid Yellow Dent, Lancaster Sure Crop and two Spanish flint heterotic groups. Topcrosses were evaluated in four environments in north eastern Spain in 2001 and 2002. The main type of gene action expressed was additive. All populations except Enano Norteno/Vasco and Hembrilla Norteno/Vasco, had a higher specific combining ability in crosses with Reid Yellow Dent or Lancaster Sure Crop testers. Average yields were better when populations were crossed with dent lines rather than with the flint inbred line EP42. These results could be useful in the development of new inbred lines that would increase genetic variability present in commercial European flint maize.

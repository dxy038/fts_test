The objective of the present studies is to apply alternative (non-silicon-based) microfabrication technologies to generation of atmospheric pressure ion optical devices. We have devised novel materials, processes, and designs for micro ion optical systems for control of ions within sources, and across apertures and conductance arrays. Patterned microstructures and geometries for flow and electrostatic field shaping are achieved using PCB-MEMS. The laminates we have designed and fabricated are based on liquid crystal polymers (LCP) with photodefinable bonding materials and various electroformed metals. The choice of PCBMEMS was driven by the requirement of a low investment process, a material capable of high levels of electronic systems integration, while providing a vacuum compatibility competitive to glass. Processes for shaping the polymer dielectric for fluid flow control and the metallization for electrical field control have been devised.

In the case of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems generally, the full state vector is unknown on account to the nature of the system and the difficulty of the measure of some components of the state vector. The objective of this paper is an experimental comparison between two different sliding surface algorithms applied to the two real one link manipulators. The first algorithm is a variable structure adaptive control with reference model using only the measurements of input and output (with two sliding surfaces); the other algorithm is a variable structure adaptive control with reference model using the full state vector (with one sliding surface)

In this letter, we investigate the effect of the analysis window duration on speech intelligibility in a systematic way. In speech processing, the short-time magnitude spectrum is believed to contain the majority of the intelligible information. Consequently, in our experiments, we construct speech stimuli based purely on the short-time magnitude spectrum. We conduct subjective listening tests in the form of a consonant recognition task to assess intelligibility as a function of analysis window duration. In our investigations, we also employ three objective speech intelligibility measures based on the speech transmission index (STI). The experimental results show that the analysis window duration of 15-35 ms is the optimum choice when speech is reconstructed from the short-time magnitude spectrum.

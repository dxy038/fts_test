In this paper, a modified Rough Fuzzy C Means [MRFCM] algorithm for MR image segmentation is proposed. With the assistance of the pixels in the boundary region of rough set, the modified Rough Fuzzy C Means clustering algorithm improves the objective function and further the calculation and distribution of membership values along with the time complexity in segmenting the images is reduced in this algorithm. In this paper it is shown that the proposed algorithm fares better result in image segmentation in terms of clustering and time complexity. The clustering algorithms are compared by the help of Davies-Bouldin (DB) index. Total time taken for segmentation process of these algorithms is also compared.

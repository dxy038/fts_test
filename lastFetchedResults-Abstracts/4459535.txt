This paper presents a model of a web service composing based on particle swarm to resolve dynamic Web services selection with QoS global optimal in Web services composition. It can dynamically select and bind the best suitable Web service to meet the requirement of different users. The essence of the model is that the problem of dynamic Web Service selection with QoS global optimal is transformed into a multi-objective services composition optimization with QoS constraints. The theory of intelligent optimization of multi-objective genetic algorithm is utilized to produce a set of optimal Pareto services composition process with constraint principle by means of optimizing various objective functions simultaneously. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate the feasibility and efficiency of this algorithm.

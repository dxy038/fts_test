The main motivation for this tutorial is that one particular property of the mobile entities - their similarity, has been of interest in wide range of application domains where some form of location-based awareness is needed. The objective of this tutorial is to give an overview of the different facets of the problem of detecting the similarity among moving objectsÂ´ trajectories. Specifically, different techniques are presented for assessing the similarity and identify the implications that different applications context(s) have on the specific approaches. The article also discuss the impact of the similarity-based mining/clustering of spatiotemporal data on applications that have large societal impacts, such as efficient traffic management and disaster remediation.

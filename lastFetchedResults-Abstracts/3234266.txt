In order to achieve the ubiquitous Internet, connection to the network must be available everywhere, at anytime, without disruption of service. In order to reach this objective, communications are now considered necessary and will play an increasing role in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) era. As train speeds increase (up to 350 km/h), wireless communications between devices on the train and devices outside the train (called correspondent nodes, CN) encounter difficulties, and maintaining communication quality is a major challenge. This paper, propose a solution for seamless internet access in trains through handoff anticipation and virtual interface for efficient router multihoming.

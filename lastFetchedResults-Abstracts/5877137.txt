This paper explores the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that can effectively solve a multi-objective problem where an importance of the objective differs each other unlike the conventional problem which concerns each objective evenly. Since such a type of a problem is often found in industrial problems (e.g., logistics network), we propose the biased multi-objective optimization using the reference point (i.e., the factor of strongly concerned). Intensive experiment on the multi-objective knapsack problem had revealed that our proposed method was more superior and had higher diversity than the conventional multi-objective optimization method.

Three quantification experiments for heart murmur grading were performed, including murmur area ratio, weighted murmur area ratio and murmur duration ratio, and murmur energy ratio. The result of this study shows that it is possible to find a reasonable, noninvasive, easy, and inexpensive method to realize objective quantification for heart murmur grading.

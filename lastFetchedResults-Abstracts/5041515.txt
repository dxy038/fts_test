This paper presents a functional parameters monitoring for an alternative flow driven hydraulic system. The classical solutions of the hydraulic drives imply a unidirectional flow of the fluid through pipes between the energy converters, therefore between the pump and the motor. The hydraulic transmissions using alternating flows are based on the bidirectional displacement of a finite fluid volume through the connection pipes between the alternating flow and pressure energy converters (generator and motor). In order to study this kind of systems, a new concept for functional parameters monitoring is needed. Combining the advantages provided by the computers, the sensors and the acquisition and control boards, the experimental results obtained provides the information needed for the next developing level: the automatic control of the alternative flow driven hydraulic systems.

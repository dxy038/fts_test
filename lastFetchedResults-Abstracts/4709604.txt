The authors present a novel image sensor with a chopper-stabilized edge detector and a correlated-double-sampling readout circuit, based on a 2-&#956;m BiCMOS technology for pattern recognition neural network VLSI applications operating at 77 K. With the chopper-stabilized edge detector and the correlated-double-sampling readout technique, the two-dimensional photodiode array, which can be efficiently built with only one readout circuit, provides a bidirectional edge detection capability for high-resolution image sensing applications operating at 77 K

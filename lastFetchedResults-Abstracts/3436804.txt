In this paper, we present two error-concealment algorithms developed for scalable motion-compensated subband/wavelet video coders. These algorithms exploit the properties of motion-compensated temporal filtering to recover lost video data by motion compensation from correctly received previous and future video frames. Our experiments indicate that backward motion-compensated prediction outperforms replacement from neighboring correctly received frames by up to 3 dB in terms of PSNR. In addition, a bidirectional algorithm tops the unidirectional one by up to 1 dB. Also, visual improvements are often higher that PSNR improvements would suggest

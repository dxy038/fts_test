The main objective of this research is developing the quality of rural housing in Iran. To fulfill this objective, a participatory action plan has been proposed for construction of a rural dwelling in a specific village (as a sample).
At the first step, based on the literature review, rural housing pattern has been identified. Then, different approaches of people participation in housing construction have been studied and a theoretical frame work has been developed. Accordingly, the feasibility of participation approach in rural housing in Iran has been discussed. As the architectural design is a part of rural housing construction process and providing a desirable house depends on a comprehensive planning, a rural housing pattern has been presented in two levels:
1.	Presenting project management plan which defines a process including architectural design.
2.	Realization of the action plan
Although for an appropriate design, all the steps defined earlier in this process need to be applied, but applying the first step was approximately impossible due to many limitations faced in a research. For the second step based on a model including strategic planning and organizing design, a field study has been carried out in a given house located in Baloqyah Village in Meshkin Shahr. Baloqyah is located in the foothill and has cold and long winters. In the sample house which has been considered for the pilot project, a family of seven members was living. Farming was the main livelihood of the family. The house composed of two residential buildings (old and new), a barn and the related equipment. The most important objectives of field studies were:
-	Studying vernacular architecture and residents' lifestyle
-	Evaluating the performance of residential and farming units
-	Understanding the needs and desires of residents
-	Climatic evaluation of buildings
Finally, desirability of the house from the residents' viewpoints has been evaluated through several checklists. To examine the suggested method presented in this paper, an ideal plan for a house has been developed. This has been done with the help of local people. In this procedure a layout has been provided in interaction with the residents and then, architectural drawings have been presented. Final plans have been provided by applying residentsâ€™ opinions. Accordingly, the positive and negative points of the given plans have been discussed by both the experts and the local people. 
Regarding the outcomes of pilot project, some instructions for enhancing inhabitants' participation in rural housing have been given.

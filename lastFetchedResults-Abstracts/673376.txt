Introduction: Striae gravidarum occurs in 50-90% of pregnant women in the third trimester and never completely disappears, so it is a major aesthetic concern for most women. 
Objective: Survey of frequency of striae gravidarum and the associated factors in nulliparus pregnant women
Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was done on 200 women over 36 weeks pregnant primiparous qualify, referred to AL- Zahra hospital in 1388. Information including location and severity of the stria gravidarum, skin type and hair were examined clinically. Demographic features of the participantsâ€™ age, gravidity, gestational age, stria history of prior pregnancies, history of skin diseases, family history for stria, weight before pregnancy, BMI, weight gain during pregnancy, using corticosteroid and local creams or lotions, fetal sex, and PCO were gathered through interviews and questionnaires. Collected data were analyzed by SPSS version 11.5.
Results: There were 149 cases (74.5%) with stria gravidarum and 51 cases (25.5%) without it. A significant difference was observed between steriae and the variables of maternal age, weight gain during pregnancy, BMI before pregnancy, educational level and family history. 
Conclusion: As revealed, the more weight gaining during pregnancy, the more risk was there for stria gravidarum formation. Positive family history of striae gravidarum seems to be an important associated factor and a greater chance of striae exists for younger mother.

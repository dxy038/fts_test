State-feedback model predictive control (MPC) of constrained discrete-time periodic affine systems is considered. The periodic systemsâ€™ states and inputs are subject to periodically time-dependent, hard, polyhedral constraints. Disturbances are additive, bounded and subject to periodically time-dependent bounds. The objective is to design MPC laws that robustly enforce constraint satisfaction in a manner that is least-restrictive, i.e., have the largest possible domain. The proposed design method is demonstrated on a building climate control example. The proposed method is directly applicable to time-invariant MPC.

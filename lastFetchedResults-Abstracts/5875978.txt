In this paper we present a bi-directional AutoZe-roing Amplifier(AZA). The direction of the circuit is controlled by swapping the VDD and GND resulting in swap of input and output. The amplifier can have similar or different properties in each directions. In addition to the gain, the amplifier offers frequency band adjustment allowing it to be used in designing bidirectional time-continuous circuits such as filters and amplifiers. We also present a bi-directional frequency mixer/extractor using the bi-directional amplifier. The simulations presented in this paper are valid for the 90 nm CMOS transistor models from STM having a VDD equal to 1.2 V and threshold voltage of 0.25 V.

We propose intersection learning for bidirectional associative memory (ILBAM). ILBAM is based on a novel relaxation method. A number of computer simulations show the effectiveness of ILBAM: (1) it can guarantee the recall of all training pairs; (2) it requires much lower weight renewal times than conventional methods; (3) it becomes more effective in the case where there are many training pairs needed to be stored; (4) it is insensitive to the correlation of training pairs; and (5) it contributes to the noise reduction effect of BAM

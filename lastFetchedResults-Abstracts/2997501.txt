The cost effectiveness of cellular and broadband radio access systems is coupled with the efficient exploitation of the scarcely available radio spectrum. In this perspective, the frequency assignment problem will maintain its importance for several years to come. This paper elaborates on an interference-oriented version of the frequency assignment problem. The objective function is associated with the interference levels that are imposed by the frequency allocation, while the constraints are related to the allocation of the frequencies required in each cell and the prevention of some unacceptable interference situations. In this paper, the problem is identified, described in detail, formally stated and formulated is an optimization problem. A computationally efficient heuristic algorithm that falls in the simulated annealing (SA) category is presented, which gave pretty satisfactory solutions in realistic test cases

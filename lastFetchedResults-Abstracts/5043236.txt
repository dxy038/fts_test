The nonlinear dielectric properties of a three component system consisting of nonlinear resistive, linear resistive, and nonconducting cubes of equal size is studied to determine the range of nonlinear grading properties which can be achieved. The system is modeled on a statistical basis, with confirmation through Monte Carlo simulations. The objective is to gain insight into the range of field grading properties which should be possible as a function of the characteristics of the nonlinear component and the ratio of the three components.

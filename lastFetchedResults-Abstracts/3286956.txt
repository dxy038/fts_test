DEAP (Dielectric Electro Active Polymer) is a new type of smart material. The tubular actuator based on DEAP material has various potential applications and is fundamentally a capacitive load. A high voltage bidirectional converter is required to provide power for the actuator. A bidirectional flyback based converter has been implemented. The parasitic elements have serious influence for the operation of the converter, especially in the high output voltage condition. The detailed behavior analysis has been performed considering the impact of the critical parasitic parameters. The converter has been analyzed for both charging and discharging processes in low and high output voltage operating occasions. The experimental waveforms can validate the analysis.

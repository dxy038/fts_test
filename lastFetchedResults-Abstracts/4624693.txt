The supply chain of agricultural products has received a great deal of attention lately due to issues related to public health. Something that has become apparent is that in the near future the design and operation of agricultural supply chains will be subject to more stringent regulations and closer monitoring, in particular those for products destined for human consumption (agri-foods). The supply chain of agri-foods, as any other supply chain, is a network of organizations working together in different processes and activities in order to bring products and services to the market, with the purpose of satisfying customersÂ´ demands. This work is a study for renovating the distribution network of multi poultry product from slaughterhouses to the retailer in the city of Tlemcen (Algeria). For this concrete case we chose two products namely chicken and turkey-cock meat. The objective of our problem is to determine the centroid of customer clusters (set of retailers), and the location/allocation of slaughterhouses in such a way that total logistics costs (location and transportation costs) are minimized, in such a way that capacity of vehicles and slaughterhouses are respected. As mentioned in our paper, the entire problem is decomposed into two sub problems, and each sub problem is solved in sequential manner, to get the final solution. LINGO optimization solver (Version12) has been used to get the solution to the problem.

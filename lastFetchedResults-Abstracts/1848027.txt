Parallel magnetic resonance imaging through sensitivity encoding using multiple receiver coils has emerged as an effective tool to reduce imaging time or to improve image SNR. The quality of reconstructed images is limited by the inaccurate estimation of the sensitivity map, noise in the acquired k-space data and the ill-conditioned nature of the coefficient matrix. Tikhonov regularization is a popular method to reduce or eliminate the ill-conditioned nature of the problem. In this approach, selection of the regularization map and the regularization parameter is very important. Perceptual difference model (PDM) is a quantitative image quality evaluation tool that has been successfully applied to varieties of MR applications. High correlation between the human rating and PDM score shows that PDM should be suitable to evaluate image quality in parallel MR imaging. By applying PDM, we compared four methods of selecting the regularization map and four methods of selecting the regularization parameter. We found that a regularization map obtained using generalized series (GS) together with a spatially adaptive regularization parameter gave the best reconstructions. PDM was also used as an objective function for optimizing two important parameters in the spatially adaptive method. We conclude that PDM enables one to do comprehensive experiments and that it is an effective tool for designing and optimizing reconstruction methods in parallel MR imaging.

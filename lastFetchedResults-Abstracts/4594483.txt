This paper explores the possibility of enhancing the performance of genetic algorithms (GA) in automating the design of combinational circuits by multi-objective optimization using problem specific genetic operators. The objective is to design digital circuits with 100% functionality and minimum number of logic gates. Experiments are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm against a conventional genetic algorithm to achieve an error-free circuit (single objective function) with minimum gate representation (multi-objective function).

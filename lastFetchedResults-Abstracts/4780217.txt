Facing many rapid changes and challenges in the ever-increasing competitive pressure, higher education institutions are becoming increasingly aggressive in their service activities to raise their public reputation that is concerned by their customers. Higher education institutions are increasingly focusing on determining critical service attributes in order to fulfill customer needs and build a strong public reputation. This aim can be realized through an integrated model of Kano Model and Customer Oriented Reputation Model using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The objective of this research is to develop an integrated model that acquires critical service attributes that can promote good public reputation for higher education institutions. This integrated model is illustrated empirically in case study of Industrial Engineering department of four famous private universities in Jakarta, Indonesia.

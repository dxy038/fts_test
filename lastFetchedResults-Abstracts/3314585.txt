This paper presents the application of virtual air temperature oven as an alternative way of carrying out the temperature control experiment in process control laboratory at Faculty of Electrical Engineering, UiTM, Shah Alam. A virtual air temperature oven is developed so that students will have effective experiment time and achieve the objective of the experiment. The development of virtual air temperature oven system is divided into two parts namely monitoring and temperature control. The principle operation of virtual air temperature oven is designed based on the actual air temperature oven. The design includes all the necessary components and facilities necessary to function properly. The program is written using G-programming language potentialities of LabVIEW&#8482; version 2011 running on a Dell Core 2 Duo 2.0GHz, 3GB RAM computer with Windows 7 Ultimate operating system. It is proved that this type of instrument gives great improvement in laboratory experiments in terms of flexibility.

Objective. To determine the specific features of representations of cholesterol and hypercholesterolemia according to the educational level (EL) and gender among hypercholesterolemic (HC) subjects.

Design. The knowledge, beliefs and personal opinions of 1579 hypercholesterolemic patients [58% males; 40% low EL; mean age 58.3 (SD = 11.5)], recruited by their general practitioners, were analyzed from the responses to a self-administered questionnaire.

Results. In comparison with women, and after adjusting for EL, men were less likely to know the acceptable total cholesterol level (OR = 0.80; P < 0.05), more likely to perceive hypercholesterolemia as not being a serious disorder (OR = 1.33; P < 0.05), mainly due to overweight (OR = 1.74; P < 0.001), modern (OR = 1.41; P < 0.01), and carefree lifestyle (OR = 1.80; P < 0.01), and less able to commit themselves to a therapeutic project (diet is only possible if shared by the spouse or family, OR = 1.25; P < 0.05). In comparison with subjects with a middle/high EL, and after adjusting for gender, the least educated subjects exhibited lower dietary knowledge (P < 0.001) and less right beliefs (the presence of cholesterol in blood is normal, OR = 0.48; P < 0.001), expressed the most misconceptions concerning hypercholesterolemia and its attendant risks (high cholesterol can induce cancer, OR = 1.63, P < 0.01, or rheumatism, OR = 3.64; P < 0.001; it is possible to perceive high cholesterol levels before seeing the results of blood tests, OR = 1.48; P < 0.001), exhibited lower self-efficacy (it is discouraging to know that heredity plays a role in a health problem, OR = 1.42; P < 0.001) and were the least convinced by and motivated for treatment (treatment may be limited in time, OR = 1.32; P < 0.05, dieting is impossible if one has an active lifestyle including eating out, OR = 1.64; P < 0.001).

Conclusions. For distinctive reasons, male gender and low educational level, which are already recognized as cardiovascular risk factors, emerged from our study as limiting patient's personal involvement in the management of hypercholesterolemia. They attest to the need to support educational and informational messages aimed at alerting, convincing and motivating. To heighten the impact of such efforts, it would seem necessary to target specific messages to men and patients with low educational level.

Saliva contains a number of proteins that may be useful as biomarkers of health and disease and can be easily obtained from large numbers of animals in a non-invasive, stress-free way. The objective of this study was to explore the protein composition of porcine saliva from 10 specific pathogen free pigs using first one-dimensional SDSâ€“PAGE and then two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. A reference proteome pattern for porcine saliva was established with the identification of 13 different, mainly saliva-specific, proteins. These reference data will facilitate the investigation of salivary proteins potentially altered in disease and could serve as novel diagnostic biomarkers.

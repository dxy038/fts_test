Memetic algorithms with an appropriate trade-off between the exploration and exploitation can obtain very good results in continuous optimisation. That implies the evolutionary algorithm component should be focused in exploring the search space while the local search method exploits the achieved solutions. In a previous work, it was proposed a region-based algorithm, RMA-LSCh-CMA, adding to algorithm MA-LSCh-CMA a niching strategy that divides the domain search in equal hypercubes. The experimental results obtained, with the benchmark proposed in the CECÂ´2014 Special Session on RealParameter Single Objective Optimisation, show that the use of these regions allow the algorithm to obtain better results, specially in higher dimensions, and the resulting algorithm is more scalable.

This paper presents a state of the art on electronic transformer, whose structure is based on power electronic devices and high-frequency electromagnetic induction. It has the capability to handle bidirectional flow of active and reactive power for different input-output voltage ratios and mitigate voltage disturbances and harmonic voltage and / or current. These features overcome the current limitations of distribution transformers, thus improving power quality and preserving the characteristics of voltage conditioning. This paper describes the evolution of electronic transformers as a generational change in the traditional distribution transformers, with the advantage of control added capacity for the benefit of users and the electric network.

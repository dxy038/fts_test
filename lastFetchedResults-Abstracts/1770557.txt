Background: Nowadays, one of the basic problems of tuberculosis treatment is drug resistance. This study was done to determine the drug resistance of mycobacterium strains isolated from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis to anti-tuberculosis drugs and determine the affecting factors.
Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, all patients with tuberculosis who were covered by Markazi Province Health Center (917 persons) during 2005 to 2010 were included in this study. For all patients with resistant pulmonary tuberculosis, culture and antibiogram by standard method (proportional) were done. Effective factors in drug resistance were identified by logistic regression model using SPSS software.
Results: Overall, the rate of resistance in patients with smear-positive was 7.3% and the rate of MDR-TB was equivalent to 4.3%, and 0.5% of smear positive patients were resistant to all five drugs. The most resistant strains were isoniazid (68.8%), rifampin (62.5%), pyrazinamide (25%), ethambutol (21.9%), and streptomycin (21.9%), respectively. The highest rate of resistance was in the 15-45 years age group. The incidence of resistance was significantly associated with sex, grade of smear positivity, relapse of TB, and HIV infection.
Conclusion: The study of drug resistant mycobacterium strains over six years showed a growing trend. Therefore, close attention to prevent the production and dissemination of resistant strains is very essential.

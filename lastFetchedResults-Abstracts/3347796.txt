This paper presents an improved parameter extraction algorithm for photovoltaic (PV) panels based on only datasheet value, which is very useful in the development phase of power conditioning system (PCS). In order to increase the accuracy of PV circuit model especially in the maximum power point (MPP), optimization method with objective function incorporating only the MPP conditions was suggested to obtain the circuit parameters in the single diode model. Pattern search optimization was adopted to implement the algorithm and search region with initial value was also discussed. The measurement data from crystalline PV array showed that the proposed algorithm improved the accuracy near the MPP in comparison with conventional methods. Furthermore, the suggested method provides more uniform and fast way of parameter extraction which is less dependent on power rating of panel and userÂ´s skill.

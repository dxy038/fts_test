The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) in the operating room (OR) environment in a filmless hospital. Surgeons and OR staff were interviewed to assess the degree to which the PACS in the OR met their requirements and expectations. PACS was favored over film in the OR for the majority of those surveyed. Image quality was perceived as equivalent to or better than film. Image availability was cited as the major advantage over film. Areas for improvement in workstation design and PACS training were described and solutions offered. A filmless OR was preferable to a film environment for surgeons and staff. Attention to the specific requirements of different hospital environments such as the OR during PACS design and implementation may increase the utility of PACS for non-radiologist users

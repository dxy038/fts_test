Background & Objective: Migraine is one of the chronic and Common Kinds of headache. Among important treatments which are advised for improvement of acute migraine attack, there are tryp tans and Ergot Alkaloids Because of side effects of Ergot Alkaloids Like nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, Peripheral vessel contractions and induced headache and its limited consumption and patients age limitation, the patients face some difficulties using Ergot Alkaloid. On the other hand Tryp tans are Consumed as a monotherapeutic regimen but Ergot Alkaloids must be used with metoclopramide in order to prevent nausea and also they should be used in the acute phase of migraine so we decided to Compare the two groups of drugs so that if they have positive effectiveness in favor of Tryp tans, using them would be advised.
Methods: The range of age for patients was 20- 40 years who suffered from classic and common migraine according to IHS criteria, were randomly placed in two groups. One group (36) was treated in the acute phase of disease by sumatryptan and the other (39) by a combination of 3 dihydroergotamine and naproxen and metoclopramide, and therapeutic effectiveness was studied by three Criteria of intensity, attack and frequency of attack. After the treatment, they were analyzed through chi square.
Results: In terms of intensity, duration and frequency of the headache after the treatment, there was no significant difference between two groups and the results in both group were the same.
Conclusion: As there were no significant statistical difference between the effect of two drugs on attack intensity, headache duration and frequency in patients of classic and common migraine, and because of the complications of Ergot Alkaloids like vomiting it should be consumed with metoclopramide and because of vessels contractions which may result in the organs gangrene and induced headache, and its maximum dose is 6 mg per week, sumatryptan is advised as the monotherapeutic.

In traditional inventory models such as the economic order quantity (EOQ) and the economic production
quantity (EPQ) the sole objective is to minimize the total inventory-related costs, typically holding cost
and ordering cost. These models do not consider the presence of defective products in the lot or rework of
them. Recently, Jamal, Sarker, and Mondal (Jamal, A. A. M., Sarker, B. R., & Mondal, S., (2004). Optimal
manufacturing batch size with rework process at single-stage production system. Computers and Industrial
Engineering, 47(1), 77–89) proposed a model, which dealt with the optimum batch quantity in a single-
stage system in which rework is done by addressing two different operational policies to minimize
the total system cost, but their models do not consider planned backorders. In this direction, this paper
develops an EPQ type inventory model with planned backorders for determining the economic production
quantity for a single product, which is manufactured in a single-stage manufacturing system that
generates imperfect quality products, and all these defective products are reworked in the same cycle.
We also establish the range of real values of the proportion of defective products for which there is an
optimal solution, and the close form for the total cost of inventory system. The use of the inventory model
is illustrated with numerical examples. The classical EOQ, EPQ inventory models with or without planned
backorders and Jamal, Sarker and Mondal’s model (Jamal, A. A. M., Sarker, B. R., & Mondal, S., (2004). Optimal
manufacturing batch size with rework process at single-stage production system. Computers and
Industrial Engineering, 47(1), 77–89) are shown to be special cases of the EPQ inventory model presented
in this paper.

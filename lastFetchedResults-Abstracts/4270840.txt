Pharmaceutical industry has been invested tremendous efforts in the research and development to present new listing-drugs with more therapeutic effect and lower side-effects over years. However, those new listing-drugs are usually more expensive than previously developed drugs. In order to balance the trade-off between medical quality and cost reduction, hospitals have to keep making critical decisions on choosing a best combination of similar therapeutic effect drugs. This study aims to develop effective approaches for the efficiency evaluation of drugs. Since it is a multi-criteria decision-making problem, we first screen the critical factors and dichotomize them into two categories, the quantitative indicators and the qualitative indicators. The quantitative indicators include &#8220;daily drug expenses&#8221;, &#8220;drug profits&#8221;, &#8220;consumption of quantity&#8221;, &#8220;side-effects&#8221;, etc. The qualitative indicators include &#8220;production quality&#8221;, &#8220;physician preference&#8221;, &#8220;special drug formulation or design&#8221;, etc. We proposed to evaluate the quantitative indicators and the qualitative indicators by data envelopment analysis and analytic hierarchy process, respectively. The proposed approaches are able to acquire a ranking of the efficiency of similar therapeutic-effect drugs. Following our case study, we conclude that the proposed approaches may serve as more objective and effective decision-support tools for the decision-makers who have to decide the ranking of similar therapeutic-effect drugs.

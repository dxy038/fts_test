Phellinus linteus (Berkeley &amp; Curtis) Teng (Hymenochaetaceae) was inoculated into cooked grains, and new products were formed after the colonisation of fungal mycelia. Our objective was to evaluate the antioxidant properties of ethanolic and hot water extracts from fermented products [Phellinus-fermented adlay (PFA) and rice (PFR)] as compared to uninoculated controls [polished adlay (PA) and rice (PR)]. PFA and PFR were more effective than were PA and PR in antioxidant activity by the conjugated diene method, reducing power, scavenging ability on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals and chelating ability on ferrous ions. Total phenols were the major antioxidant components found in both extracts (1.31–9.10 mg/g). Flavonoid contents were in the range of 0.07–1.26 mg/g. Total phenols and flavonoids of two extracts were associated with antioxidant properties. Based on the results obtained, Phellinus-fermented products possessed effective antioxidant properties.

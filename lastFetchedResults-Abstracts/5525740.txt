Various laser interferometric techniques successfully applied in medical and industrial diagnostic sectors not yet fully developed and adjusted in the field of conservation of cultural heritage are being considered. The drawback is that each technique implies distinct operation characteristics solving specific problems that cannot correspond to the complexity of diagnostic problems involved in the field of cultural heritage. As such the fragmented applicability obstructs their transfer to the new demanding field of application. Therefore the project objective is to integrate complementary advantages of techniques based on the same fundamental physical principles in one system-device capable to provide the desirable flexibility of function and standardised operation providing a user-friendly on-field transportable system as a universal structural diagnostic tool for cultural heritage applications. Structural diagnostics in art conservation lacks novel alternative tools and it is assumed that this essential advance will allow and promote the wide use of laser diagnostic techniques in art conservation discipline enhancing both fields. The project involving nine partners from seven European countries among which are SMEs and endusers is in its third and final year and specific results will be provided and shown

Objective
The objective of the study was to compare the effect of horizontal versus vertical closure of the vaginal cuff during vaginal hysterectomy on vaginal length.
Study design
Forty-three women were randomized to undergo horizontal (n = 23) or vertical (n = 20) vaginal cuff closure during vaginal hysterectomy at a community hospital. The primary outcome of vaginal length before and after surgery was compared by the Student t test and the paired t test.
Results
Preoperatively mean vaginal lengths in the horizontal and vertical groups were statistically similar (7.76 ± 1.23 cm versus 8.28 ± 1.39 cm, respectively; P = .21). Postoperatively the groups statistically differed (6.63 ± 1.02 cm versus 7.93 ± 1.18 cm, P< .001). The mean change in vaginal length was –1.13 ± 1.15 cm and –0.35 ± 0.91 cm, respectively (P = .01). Within-group comparisons revealed a statistical difference between pre- versus postmean vaginal length in the horizontal group (7.76 ± 1.23 cm versus 6.63 ± 1.02 cm; P< .001) and no difference within the vertical group (8.28 ± 1.39 cm versus 7.93 ± 1.18 cm; P = .11).
Conclusion
Closing the vaginal cuff vertically is superior to horizontal closure for the purpose of preserving vaginal length.

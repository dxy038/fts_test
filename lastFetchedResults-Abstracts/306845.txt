Objective: In the presence of low serum folate, mutant 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR+ [A223V/C677T]) in the homozygous state (+/+), may predispose to higher plasma homocysteine (tHct) levels and coronary artery disease (CAD). To determine the impact of this relationship on predisposition to early-onset CAD, we examined the prevalence of the mutation and plasma tHct in patients with early-onset CAD and compared them to patients manifesting CAD later in life.
Methods: Three hundred patients with history of acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris and angiographically documented CAD were studied. Patients consisted of two groups: group 1 (G1 = 150 patients) presenting with these findings under age 50; while group 2 (G2 = 150) presented for the first time over age 65 years. Prevalence of the MTHFR+ mutation was assessed by molecular analysis, and plasma tHct and folate were measured. An association of the +/+ genotype with early onset CAD could lead to its higher prevalence in the younger age group.
Results: There was no significant difference in the frequency of the (+/+) genotype between the two groups (G1: 11.3% vs. G2: 11.3%). However, patients with the (+/+) genotype in both groups had higher tHct when plasma folate was below the mean value (G1: p< 0.0001 while G2: p < 0.01).
Conclusion: The mutant MTHFR genotype was not found to be a determining factor in early-onset CAD. Higher tHct values were obtained in the older age group, which is expected because other studies have shown that tHct levels increase with age. A significant relation was shown between MTHFR genotype and low folate status yielding high tHct levels in those with the (+/+) genotype. As this relation was seen in both groups, although to a lesser extent in the older G2, it does not explain the underlying cause of early-onset CAD.

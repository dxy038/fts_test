A number of clinical studies investigated associations between mood states and environmental factors. However, they mostly rely on self-reporting methods to describe past activities which, due to recall difficulties, may not be reliable. In this pilot study, we attempted to measure the amount of social interaction at workplace in an objective way and to investigate correlations with mood states. The results show correlation between social interactions and mood states both in the beginning and at the end of monitored intervals.

This paper compares the conventional integral, fuzzy and hybrid neuro-fuzzy (HNF) controllers for the automatic generation control (AGC) of an interconnected hydro-thermal system. The design objective is to improve the transient performance of the interconnected system following a disturbance. Appropriate generation rate constraint (GRC) has been considered for the thermal and hydro plants. In the analysis, the hydro area has been considered with electric governor and thermal has been considered with single reheat turbine. System performance has been examined considering 1% step load perturbation in either thermal or hydro area with generation rate constraints. Simulation results are presented to show the improved performance of HNF controller in comparison with a conventional integral and fuzzy controller.

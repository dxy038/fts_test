Background and Objective: Accurate and reliable information is critical to effective decision- making to
preventing road traffic injuries (RTIs). This study investigated the status of Road Traffic Data Collection
System (RTDCS) and provided some practical solutions.

Materials and Methods: All RTIs in 2012 were included in the study. The RTIs data are collected by
police using COM 114 tool. The PATAK software was designed and used to link relevant records of
specified accident. Using descriptive analysis and also Microsoft Office Excel and PATAK software’s
functions the errors of RTDCS were detected.
Results: A total of 1,392,815 records of road traffic accidents were examined. Approximately 7% of RTIs
were recorded repetitively. There were more than 2% of all injuries with no information about general
condition of accident and 10.2% with no divers’ information. Missing data was almost high in all variables
and in some cases were 50%. Mismatching and inconsistent in the part of data and overlapping in some
of variables in data collection tool were of other problems. More than 99 percent of records identified and
merged correctly using the PATAK software.

Conclusion: The study revealed that RTDCS faces some problems and shortcomings. Using designed
PATAK software, probability of all data utilization in road traffic data collection system is provided. To
improve quality of RTIs data, reloading and modification of RTDCS is necessary.

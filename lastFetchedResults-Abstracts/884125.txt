The presence of extra-regional powers in the Middle East and their impact on the quality of security order of the region is one of the important issues which have attracted the attention of the observers. Since World War II till date the United States has been an important player which has actively intervened in the region and has had a determining role in its security structure. In this direction the United States has recently tried to expand NATO's sphere of operation toward the Middle East region by admitting new partners and collaborators. The present article is of the view that this strategic behaviour of the Untied States is within the objectives of security framework of that country. These objectives can be enumerated as follow: expansion of its sphere of influence and hegemony in the region, confrontation and containment of the growing power of the Islamic Republic of Iran, helping normalization of relations between Israel and Arab countries by participating them in NATO's programme and organs, accelerating process of reforms in the Middle East, fighting against Islamic fundamentalism and radicalism and terrorist activities emanating from it, ensuring the security of energy resources and their safe transfer to the United States and its allies and providing support for pro-West Arab governments.  These measures have been welcomed by Israel and pro-Western Arabs and will have important effects on the security of the Middle East and will make NATO a significant Middle East player. It is true that NATO's main objective is facing international threats to peace and security and in this way it can ensure the Middle East's stability but NATO being a Western security organization will facilitate the objectives of the United States and its allies and therefore, it can be said that the presence of NATO in the Middle East will have adverse effect on security interests of Iran.

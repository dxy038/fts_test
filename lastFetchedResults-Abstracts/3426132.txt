In recent years, the new field of micromagnetic devices has drawn the attention of an increasing number of researchers. The objective in this field is to develop very small magnetic microdevices with a planar structure for high-frequency applications. Three technologies are being exploited in order to achieve higher scales of integration: the development of new materials, microlithography and dry etching techniques, and microdevice analysis and design. This paper reviews recent research on micromagnetic devices.

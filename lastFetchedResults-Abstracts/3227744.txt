As a basic Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique, the perturb and observe (P&amp;O) algorithm has been widely considered in the literature related to photovoltaic systems optimization. While its principal seems primarily suited for a digital implementation, the analog version analysis was relatively neglected. Moreover, very few results have been presented in both cases for a significant performance analysis in presence of static and dynamic solicitations, related to the main field perturbations such as solar irradiance intensity, temperature, shading and load variations. Hence, this paper is aimed to undergo, through simulation in a Matlab/Simulink environment, a systematic performance evaluation of an optimized, easy to implement, analog P&amp;O MPPT algorithm. The behaviour of the MPPT stage of interest, is investigated under a multitude of the various working conditions quoted above, with either topologies based on a buck or a boost power DC-DC converter. Significant results in this scope are presented, before integrating the designed MPPT stage in a real photovoltaic chain application. The latter consists of a photovoltaic solar shelter equipped with a stand alone solar battery charging terminal for electric scooters. This work being part of a project which final objective is to realize and implement, by local means, specified operational demonstrators of renewable energy standalone systems, to be sited at the ongoing building yard of the new &#8220;reduced emission&#8221; town project of Boughzoul, located at the middle of the steppic highlands of Algeria (170 Kms south of Algiers). This application is aimed to ensure onsite mobility, to a limited number of individuals among the working personnel, and introduce the concept of non polluting transport means.

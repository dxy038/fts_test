The increasing demand for FPGAs and reconfigurable hardware targeting high performance low power applications has lead to an increasing requirement for new high performance reconfigurable embedded FPGA cores. This paper presents a multi-objective population based algorithm which given a library of basic blocks and a list of constraints, identifies an optimum reconfigurable embedded reconfigurable core suitable for the target application

The author describes a generalization of the theory of hysteresis to cover asymmetric or minor hysteresis loop excursions. The original description of the model was found to be particularly useful because it enabled hysteresis loops of magnetic materials to be successfully modeled with a limited set of only five physically based parameters. The extension of the model presented is completely self-consistent with the original formulation and requires no additional parameters to describe the minor loops. Results of the model calculations are shown with the objective of demonstrating the morphology of the solutions. These display the expected behavior and also include the phenomena of minor loop crossing the partial coincidence of minor loops under certain conditions

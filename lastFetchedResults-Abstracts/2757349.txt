The objective trends in electric power systems (EPSs) call for prompter and more adequate response of control systems. New smart measurement, communication and control tools, information and computer technologies can be used to improve EPS controllability. The distinctive features of the Unified Energy System (UES) of Russia are discussed and the current emergency control system is presented in the paper. A modern approach to monitoring, forecasting and control is suggested. Some artificial intelligence applications for development of emergency control in the UES of Russia are presented.

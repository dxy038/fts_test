Objective. The study examined the change in intracarpal canal pressure (ICCP) in relationship to finger, hand, wrist and forearm position.

Design. The study was an in vivo measurement of ICCP in seven subjects undergoing a standardized set of manoeuvres that systematically varied finger, hand, wrist, and forearm position.

Background. It has been known that the ICCP increased with extremes of wrist flexion and extension but the change in pressure in response to radial and ulnar deviation as well as hand and forearm position has not been reported.

Methods. The ICCP was measured using a slit catheter technique; each variation of position was repeated three times with continuous monitoring of ICCP, wrist angulation, and metacarpal-phalangeal joint angulation.

Results. The study demonstrated that ICCPs were lowest when the wrist is in a neutral position, the hand relaxed with fingers flexed and the forearm in a semi-pronated position. Wrist extension and flexion resulted in the greatest increase in ICCP followed by forearm pronation and supination. Radial and ulnar deviation also increased the pressure but to a lesser extent.

Conclusions. The findings of this study support the concept that the wrist and forearm should be maintained in a neutral position during vocational and avocational activities in an effort to minimize pressure within the carpal tunnel and thereby reduce the risk of developing carpal-tunnel syndrome.

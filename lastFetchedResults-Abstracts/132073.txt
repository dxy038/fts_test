BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Priapism is a rare but serious adverse effect of psychotropic drugs and antipsychotic agents were implicated in 15% to 26% priapism associated with medications. Among atypical antipsychotics, clozapine, risperidone and olanzapin have been reported to be associated with this condition.
CASE: A 24-year-old man attended to the clinic with symptoms of delusion of control, delusion of persecution, delusion of somatic and auditory hallucination and since last year had progressive social withdrawal. He was prescribed risperidone 6 mg single dose. He experienced non-sexual stimulation and painful erection.
CONCLUSION: Physicians who prescribe serotonine- dopamine antagonist (SDA) should take care about this rare but it is serious complication, especially in cases with previous history of priapism following the use of psychotropic drugs.

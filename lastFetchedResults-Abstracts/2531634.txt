Background and Objective: The performance of in-vessel composting process, as one of the most effective methods of oily sludge treatment, depends on factors such as nutrients and temperature. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the trend of changes of these factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the trend of changes of organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and temperature during the composting of bottom sludge of crude oil storage tanks.

Materials and Methods: The sludge was mixed with the immature compost at the various ratios of sludge to compost including 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, and 1:10 with the initial C/N/P of 100/5/1 and then was composted for a period of 10 weeks. The process of mixing and moisture adjustment of the mixtures was done 3 times a day during the composting period. Sampling and analysis were performed every week for organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus and every day for temperature.

Results: The research indicated that the concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were decreased sharply during the first weeks of the process and then they were decreased gently. At the final stage of the composting, the ratios of C/N and C/P increased from 20:1 and 100:1 to 26:1 and 166:1, respectively. In addition, the temperature of the reactors was kept in the mesophilic range during the process period.

Conclusion: The similar trend of decrease of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the composting reactors is an indication of decreasing the activity of the microorganisms involved in petroleum hydrocarbons degradation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

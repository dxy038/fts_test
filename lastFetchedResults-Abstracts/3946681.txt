This study presents a novel controller for bidirectional control of a dual active bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter. The proposed controller uses the high-frequency AC-link current of the DAB DC-DC converter as a control parameter so that the dynamic power and regeneration demands of advanced aircraft electric loads can be met using ultracapacitors. A model of the proposed current control technique has been developed and simulations of a 540-V/20-kW prototype show that the proposed control system exhibits good static and dynamic performance during bidirectional operation. The same control technique can control the DAB converter operating in quasi-square-wave mode under low loads. The results obtained from the model under various voltages, currents and power transients verify converter operation and validate the proposed controller performance during bidirectional power transfer.

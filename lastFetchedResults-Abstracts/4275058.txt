This paper considers a multi-objective order scheduling problem in a multi-page invoice printing system which contains four main stages. The invoices usually contain several pages in duplicate or triplicate, thus the different pages are firstly printed in separated printing lines and then assembled together to become multi-page invoices. The objectives considered are the minimization of the makespan, the average flowtime and the maximum tardiness for all the invoice orders. A multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed for solving the problem. Numerical experiments indicate that the algorithm is efficient and effective.

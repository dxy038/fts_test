We introduce a new approach to distribution fitting, called Decision on Beliefs (DOB). The 
objective is to identify the probability distribution function (PDF) of a random variable X with 
the greatest possible confidence. It is known that Xf is a member of ={ , , }. 1 m S f L f To 
reach this goal and select Xf from this set, we utilize stochastic dynamic programming and 
formulate this problem as a special case of Optimal Stopping Problem. The decision is made on 
the basis of the outcome of a limited number of experiments. A real number, namely, belief is 
assigned to each candidate by considering the outcome of observations. At each stage and after 
a random observation, beliefs are updated by applying Bayesian formula and then either one 
element of S is selected as the desired PDF or another observation is made. At each stage, a 
PDF from S with the greatest belief is accepted as the desired PDF provided the belief is 
higher than a least acceptable designated level. We assume the total number of possible 
observations can not exceed N and a cost is incurred for each observation. Dynamic and 
nonlinear programming are applied to calculate the least acceptable belief value for each stage. 
To reduce the search of the optimal solution, the concept of entropy is utilized.

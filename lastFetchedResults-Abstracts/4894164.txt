This paper presents a new stochastic optimization approach for parameter tuning of conventional power system stabilizer (PSS). Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) technique is suggested in this paper to search for optimal settings of PSS parameters. An eigenvalue-based objective function to enhance system damping of electromechanical modes is considered. The performance of the proposed PSS is investigated under different disturbances and loading conditions for a single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system. The effectiveness of the proposed PSS is demonstrated through nonlinear time-domain simulation and two performance indices. The results analysis reveals that the designed QPSO based PSS has an excellent capability in damping power system oscillations in comparison with designed classical particle swarm optimization (CPSO) based PSS and enhance greatly the dynamic stability of the power systems.

Inroduction & Objective: Diabetes is a state of chronic hyperglycemia due to lack of secretion of insulin or the inability of cells to use insulin to happen. Probiotics also have a variety of biological activities including anti-diabetic activity. The purpose of this study is the effect of Lactobacillus on the glycemic index in diabetic rats.
Materials and Methods: To perform this experiment, 40 male Wistar rats were used in the four groups: control group consisted of healthy, diabetic group, and groups including the control group receiving probiotics and probiotic diabetic groups were divided. Groups of diabetic rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin diabetic levels were 60 mg/kg. Daily for 21 days, Lactobacillus casei 109 cfu/ml TD2 as much as the gastric gavage to groups of mice were given. Finally, the blood glucose levels were evaluated.
Results: The results showed that L. casei TD2 significantly (P <  0.001) reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and led to significant changes in glycemic control mice received the probiotic found.
Conclusion:The results suggest that L. casei strain TD2 prevent an increase in serum glucose levels in diabetic mice, are effective.

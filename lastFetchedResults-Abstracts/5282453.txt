Multi-objective optimization tools in aerospace structures have to face the huge number variables and objectives. High number of variables cases high computation cost to optimization process. In this regard a variable reduction tool which could remove the less effective variables and priority arrange them appear to be vital. In this paper some data mining tools are applied for reason of variable reduction.

Objective: It was our goal to compare the efficacy of a suburethral fascial sling with that of a combination of Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz urethropexy and Ball urethroplasty in patients with intrinsic sphincter deficiency and urethral hypermobility. Study Design: This study consisted of a retrospective observational evaluation of patients from 2 separate practice sites. Preoperative and postoperative data were collected from patientsâ€™ medical records. The long-term results were based on a mailed questionnaire addressing bladder symptoms and quality-of-life issues. Results: Among a total of 48 patients, 37 (77. 1%) responded in the group undergoing Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz urethropexy combined with Ball urethroplasty, and 30 out of 35 (85.7%) patients replied in the suburethral fascial sling group. The mean length of follow-up was 2.7 years (range, 1-5 years). The patients were similar in age, hormonal status, parity, and previous bladder neck surgery. Similar cure and improvement were demonstrated in both groups (86.6% in the suburethral fascia group and 89.2% in the group with the Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure combined with Ball urethroplasty). No significant differences were found in urinary incontinence types, irritable bladder symptoms, voiding difficulties, or quality-of-life measures. Conclusions: The suburethral fascial sling and a procedure consisting of Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz urethropexy combined with Ball urethroplasty have similar results in patients with intrinsic sphincter and urethral hypermobility.

Background: Nitric oxide (NO), a highly reactive radical, participates in the nonspecific natural
defense mechanism of the oral cavity. The present study was attempted to evaluate the salivary
NO levels in 4–5 year?old children with early childhood caries (ECC). The objective of the present
study was to assess the salivary NO concentration in children with different caries activity.
Materials and Methods: The study included 120 healthy 4–5 year?old children and they
were equally divided into three groups based on decayed, missing, filled surfaces (dmfs) score;
forty caries?free children (control group), forty children with dmfs 1–5 (ECC group), and forty
with dmfs ?6 (severe ECC group). Saliva collected was measured for NO concentration by
Griess reaction method. The obtained data were analyzed by ANOVA and Pearson’s correlation
coefficient.
Results: The mean level of NO in the saliva of the control group was 51.2 ± 8.3457 and that of
ECC and severe ECC were 47.1 ± 5.2614 and 33.625 ± 4.6942, respectively. The mean salivary
NO concentration was significantly higher in healthy controls when compared to children with
ECC and severe ECC. Moreover, a negative correlation (r = ?0.6658) was observed between the
salivary NO level and the mean dmfs, suggesting that as the salivary NO level decreases, the caries
incidence increases.
Conclusion: The obtained results support the antimicrobial activity of salivary NO and also suggest
that an increase in NO production might contribute to lower the caries occurrence in children.

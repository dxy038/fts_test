Background and objective: Researches related to perfectionism have tried to
investigate the negative relationship between this variable and its’ dimensions
with the various fields of physical and psychological hygiene and health. The
aim of this study was to investigate the role of perfectionism and its’ dimensionsin
predicting disordered eating behaviors among students.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 477 students of
AllamehTabataba’i University who was selected by multiple cluster sampling.
Participants responded to the questionnaires of demographic characteristics,
perfectionism of Besharat (1382), disordered eating behaviors of Garneret al.
(1982). Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise
regression.
Results: There were significant positive correlations between perfectionism
and its’ dimensions (self-centered, other -centered, and community-centere d)
with disordered eating behaviors (p < 0.01). In other words,when perfectionism
increases, the degree of disordered eating behaviors among students also increases.
Stepwise regression analysis also indicated that in the interaction between
the dimensions of perfectionism, the community-centered perfectionism
and other-centered perfectionism significantly predicted, respectively, 11%
and 9% of the variance of disordered eating behaviors among student (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: The results of this study suggest the importance of perfectionism
and its’ dimensions in predicting disordered eating behaviors.These factors can
explain the high degree of variability of these behaviors.

This study presents a design strategy based on genetic algorithms (GA) for semi-active fuzzy control of structures that have magnetorheological (MR) dampers installed to prevent damage from severe dynamic loads such as earthquakes. The control objective is to minimize both the maximum displacement and acceleration responses of the structure. Interactive relationships between structural responses and input voltages of MR dampers are established by using a fuzzy controller. GA is employed as an adaptive method for design of the fuzzy controller, which is here known as a genetic adaptive fuzzy (GAF) controller. The multi-objectives are first converted to a fitness function that is used in standard genetic operations, i.e. selection, crossover, and mutation. The proposed approach generates an effective and reliable fuzzy logic control system by powerful searching and self-learning adaptive capabilities of GA. Numerical simulations for single and multiple damper cases are given to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed intelligent control strategy.

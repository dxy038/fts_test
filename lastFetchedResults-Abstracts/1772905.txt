There exists a strong clinical need for a more capable and robust method to achieve bone augmentation, and a system with fine-tuned delivery of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has the potential to meet that need. As such, the objective of the present study was to investigate a synthetic biodegradable hydrogel for the delivery of DBM for bone augmentation in a rat model. Oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) (OPF) constructs were designed and fabricated by varying the content of rat-derived DBM particles (either 1:3, 1:1 or 3:1 DBM:OPF weight ratio on a dry basis) and using two DBM particle size ranges (50–150 or 150–250 μm). The physical properties of the constructs and the bioactivity of the DBM were evaluated. Selected formulations (1:1 and 3:1 with 50–150 μm DBM) were evaluated in vivo compared to an empty control to investigate the effect of DBM dose and construct properties on bone augmentation. Overall, 3:1 constructs with higher DBM content achieved the greatest volume of bone augmentation, exceeding 1:1 constructs and empty implants by 3- and 5-fold, respectively. As such, we have established that a synthetic, biodegradable hydrogel can function as a carrier for DBM, and that the volume of bone augmentation achieved by the constructs correlates directly to the DBM dose.

The IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) is the fundamental access method providing asynchronous best-effort services in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). In this standard, the currently employed Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and the Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) mechanism represent major sources of energy consumption at both the access point and mobile stations of a WLAN. To improve energy efficiency in WLANs, this paper introduces an enhanced DCF protocol incorporating bidirectional transmissions in combination with sleep periods, called Bidirectional Sleep DCF (BDSL-DCF). By following this new scheme, every successfully established connection between a sender and its intended destination can be used to exchange data, hence reducing control overhead and channel contention. Furthermore, this functionality allows those mobile stations not participating in data transmission to activate the sleep mode to conserve energy. Simulation results show that BDSL-DCF can outperform DCF in terms of energy efficiency and throughput, with negligible impact on packet transmission delay.

This study describes a non-dominated algorithm which we call the dynamic multi-objective routing algorithm (DyMORA) developed to improve the simple hybrid routing protocol (SHRP) in choosing the best route towards the Sink node. The multi-objective approach presented allows simultaneous analysis of the four metrics used in the protocol and generates a Pareto-optimal solution. The performance of SHRP concerned to time convergence and reliability with and without DyMORA was analysed via simulation tool NS-2. The performance of SHRP with DyMORA proved to have closed performance to the original SHRP protocol and in many cases superior performance, despite the use of a more complex election algorithm.

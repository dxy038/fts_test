The objective of the supervisory control for elevator group is to efficiently operate the limited number of elevators and to assign an appropriate elevator to an issued hall-call. There are two algorithms in the supervisory control for elevator-group: the minimum long-wait algorithm and the area-based control algorithm. These algorithms, however, can not always cope with fluctuation of traffic condition in the building, which sometimes results in poor elevator operation services. In an attempt to overcome this problem, authors propose a new control system in which the fuzzy expert system is introduced to the area-based control algorithm. When the fuzzy control algorithm is employed, development time is required in setting production rules and adjusting membership functions. In this article, authors propose a self-adjusting area-based control algorithm which is defined as the supervisory control for elevator group in which the membership functions are self-adjusted. The effectiveness of the system is studied by simulation

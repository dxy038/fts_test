Ontology is increasingly seen as key factor for sharing and understanding concepts among heterogeneous implementation platforms and architecture description languages (ADLs). Ensuring various views as desired by its stakeholders requires conformance to sound principals and rules of ontology engineering. In this article we propose a meta-ontology called (OntoArch) to describe ADLs and MDA (model driven architecture) platforms from their core level, rather than architecture and implementation. Our objective is to increase the high level of systemspsila concepts abstracting for wrapping and integrating heterogeneous software concepts into MDA platforms via a top-level ontology.

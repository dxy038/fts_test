Objective: Low density Lipo-protein Receptor- related Protein (LRP) is the most important cholesterol receptor in neurons. It serves as a receptor for APOE protein which is the most important risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease. LRP also contributes to the ligation of lipoproteins with APOE in neurons. Association between LRP C766T and Alzheimer’s disease in Iranian patients with late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) was investigated in this research.
Materials and Methods: 100 patients with LOAD were selected based on DSM-IV-TR and NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria and 100 normal controls without any personal and family history of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia were included in this case- control study. AD patients and control subjects were matched for age and sex. PCR-RFLP was set up to detect LRP C766T polymorphism.
Results: LRP C/C genotype and C allele distribution were more frequent in AD patients than in control subjects. However, this difference was not statistically significant. When association between LRP C/C genotype and AD was categorized by the gender, in both genders, there was not any significant correlation.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that 766C allele of LRP gene could not significantly alter the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Iranian patients. Analysis of other genetic factors and environmental factors are promoted in Iranian population.

In modern numeric control (NC) servo systems, manual tuning approaches are still dominant in servo parameters regulation due to systemsÂ´ complexity. In manual tuning, it is not easy to evaluate the regulated systems from frequency responses. With regard to such problems, in this paper, we put forward a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, where three different features are proposed based on expert experiences to specify the effectiveness of tuned parameters from system responses in low, medium and high frequency spectrums. This fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method has been validated against experiment results, which clearly demonstrates that these features can provide an objective judgment on the tuned parameters.

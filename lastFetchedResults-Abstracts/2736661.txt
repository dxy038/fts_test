This paper presents a multiobjective formulation for the topological design of synchronous motors. The developed torque of a motor is broken into two components: the torque due to the permanent magnet excitation and the torque due to the magnetic reluctance. In addition, topological gradients of the two torque components as objective functions are derived respectively using an adjoint variable method. Instead of simply maximizing the total torque, these two torque components are treated as different objectives in the design, thus a Pareto front of different topologies of rotor design can be achieved.

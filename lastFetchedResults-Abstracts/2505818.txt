Four adverse events were observed over the study.<strong><br />Results: </strong>The difference between the SX and placebo was not significant in the frequency of adverse events.<strong><br />Conclusion: </strong>This study indicates that SX is safe and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate ED at least in the short-term.</div>

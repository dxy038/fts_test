
Introduction: Viral hepatitis during pregnancy is associated with high risk of maternal complications. No data are available on hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevalence in pregnant women in north west of Iran.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBsAg in women attending health care centers of Urmia.
Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that included 368 pregnant women who attended the antenatal clinics of Urmia health care centers, during the period of April 2010 - October 2010. Demographic and epidemiological data were collected. Samples were screened for HBsAg by ELISA. Those who were positive for HBsAg were tested for HBeAg.
Results: Mean age of participants was 29.5Â±5 years. HBsAg was found in 3(0.8%) of 368 pregnant women.  HBeAg was not detected in positive samples. History of abortion was reported in eighteen percent (66) of the participants. We found no significant association between HBsAg positivity and place of residence (urban or rural), age, educational level and history of abortion.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a low prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women in Urmia district. Prevalence of HBV infection in pregnant women has been decreased due to HBV vaccination program in last twenty years. HBsAg screening of pregnant women can decrease vertical transmission of virus from mother to child.

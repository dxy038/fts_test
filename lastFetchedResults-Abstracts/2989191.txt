An objective function that encourages an encoder to have the minimum overall Euclidean reconstruction error is shown to lead to encoders that can be implemented using functions that depend only in a piecewise linear fashion on the input vector. From the neural network viewpoint, the optimal form of the probability that each neuron is the next one to fire is a piecewise linear function of the input vector

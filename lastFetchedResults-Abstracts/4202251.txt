Capacity planning is a challenging issue for designing next generation optical core networks. This paper presents a fuzzy linear programming (FLP) approach for capacity planning in optical networks under long-term demand uncertainty where the information of traffic loads is imprecise by nature. The simplicity of fuzzy logic is integrated with linear programming for capacity planning in optical backbones. The uncertainties in demand matrix are represented by membership functions using a-cut concept to provide a mathematical framework for dealing with non statistical uncertainties. The proposed approach offers the ability of consideration all conditions for decision making in optical networks. Simulation results show the efficiency of fuzzy linear programming method for capacity planning in optical networks. The proposed approach could be extended for considering other uncertainty sources in capacity planning problem of optical networks such as objective function and constraints.

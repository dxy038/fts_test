In this paper, a performance optimization based on the ecological coefficient of performance (ECOP) criterion has been carried out for an irreversible regenerative Brayton heat-engine. The results obtained were compared with those using the power-output criterion and alternative ecological performance objective-function defined in the literature. The design parameters, under the optimal conditions, have been derived analytically and their effects on the engineâ€™s performance have been discussed. It is shown that, for the regenerative Brayton-engine, a design based on the maximum ECOP conditions is more advantageous from the point-of-view of entropy generation rate, thermal efficiency and investment cost.

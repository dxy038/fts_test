This paper presents an optimal control-based energy management strategy for a parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). This strategy not only seeks to minimize fuel consumption while maintaining the state-of-charge of the battery within reasonable bounds, but also seeks to minimize wear of the battery and extend its life. This multi-objective optimal control problem is solved numerically using PontryaginÂ´s Minimum Principle (PMP).

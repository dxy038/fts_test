According to the importance of establishing contingent event management system, the main objective of this paper is to construct a coordinating system framework of third party logistics supplier (3PLS). Firstly, we analyzed different kinds of contingent events and the importance of dealing with emergency management. Secondly, we introduce Unified Modeling Language in general, and then we propose the flowsheet of the contingent events for 3PLS. Lastly, we constructed a framework for this system and the system framework is described in detail from many kinds of UML views, by point of views of static structures and dynamic behaviors.

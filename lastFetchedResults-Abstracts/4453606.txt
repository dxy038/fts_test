The objective of this work was to design and build a prototype of a retractable, motorized laptray for motorized wheelchairs, which could offer wheelchair users with severe disabilities a work surface on their wheelchair. A prototype was designed and built so it could be carried along on the wheelchair. By means of DC motors, solenoids, and a linear actuator, the retractable laptray can be operated independently. A second prototype is presently under development

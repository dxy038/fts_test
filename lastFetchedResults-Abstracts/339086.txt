Objective
Various TEL-JAK2 fusions have been identified in patients with lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemias that result in constitutive activation of the JAK2 kinase domain. Such fusions can mediate factor-independent growth of hematopoietic cell lines and induction of malignancy in mouse models.
Materials and methods

To assess whether zebrafish could be utilized as a suitable model for the study of myeloid oncogenesis, we generated a zebrafish tel-jak2a fusion oncoprotein based on that seen in a case of chronic myeloid leukemia. This was transiently expressed in zebrafish embryos under the control of the spi1 promoter, which is strongly active in myeloid precursors.
Results

Visual, histological, and molecular analysis revealed disruption of normal embryonic hematopoiesis, including perturbation of the myeloid and erythroid lineages.
Conclusion

These results indicate that the zebrafish tel-jak2a oncoprotein is functional, and suggest that this organism will be useful for the experimental study of myeloid malignancy.

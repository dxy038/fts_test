This work presents a strategy to control a mobile robot navigating along a corridor. The proposed control system is based on the fusion of the control signals generated by two redundant controllers. Redundancy here means that both controllers have the same objective, which is to keep the mobile robot in the middle of the corridor. The two control signals being fused are generated by a controller based on the optical flow technique and by a controller based on distance measures provided by ultrasonic sensors.

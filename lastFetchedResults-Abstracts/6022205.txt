This paper presents an automatic test generation methodology for complex coverage points in the context of systems consisting of an environment (E), a machine (M) and a controller (C). The coverage points are modeled as temporal scenarios over a set of low-level events supported in M. These events canÂ´t be generated directly. There exists a set of high-level macros (supported in E) that can generate these events. The objective is to generate a sequence of macros to reach a complex coverage point in M. We present a prototype tool that automatically generates a systemverilog test-bench for the required macro sequence generation. The result on DLX pipeline shows the effectiveness of the approach

Background and objective: Sourdough fermentation. with interactions between lactic acid bacteria
and yeasts. is considered to playa key role in producing bakery products with improved flavor,
texture and shelf-life properties. This research focused on evaluation of acidification properties of
different starter cultures in liquid sourdough fermentation and selecting an appropriate inoculum
hased on quality and shelf-life properties of the resultant bread.
Material and methods: Liquid sourdough samples were fermented by cultures including L.casei
and Siccrevisiae (T Il. Lfermentum and S'cerevisiae (T2). Lcasei, Lfermentum and S.cerevisiae
(T3) and addc to bread doughs (l5')!o w/w). Technological properties (moisture content. specific
volume and organoleptic properties) and slielf-Iife of the sourdough breads were compared with
those of a control bread.
Results: Sourdoughs fermented by inoeulums TI and T3 had a similar pH-lowering rate (there were
only small differences). Inoculum T3 showed tile highest acidification rate. In comparison.
inoculum T2 showed a lower acidification rate (pH> 4). Liquid sourdough breads had higher
specific volumes as compared to the control bread. and sourdough bread T3 ranked first
organoleptically. Sourdough breads (TI and T3) had a lower staling rate than the control value. and
bread T3 showed a highcr staling rate than T I (p< 0.(5).
Conclusion: Sourdough addition can improve organoleptic properties-specific volume and shelflife
of the breads.. Based on acidification properties and sensory analysis, inoculum Licasei,
Lj'".,l1entllll1 and S.cercvis;ae produce the most desirable effects.

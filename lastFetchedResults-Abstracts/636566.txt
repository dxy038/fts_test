This paper discusses the development of a multivariate control charting technique for short-run autocorrelated
data manufacturing environment. The proposed approach is a combination of the multivariate residual
charts for autocorrelated data and the multivariate transformation technique for i.i.d. process observations
of short lengths. The proposed approach consists in fitting adequate multivariate time-series model of various
process outputs and computes the residuals, transforming them into standard normal N(0, 1) data and
then using standardized data as inputs to plot conventional univariate i.i.d. control charts. The objective for
applying multivariate finite horizon techniques for autocorrelated processes is to allow continuous process
monitoring, since all process outputs are controlled trough the use of a single control chart with constant
control limits. Throughout simulated examples, it is shown that the proposed short-run process monitoring
technique provides approximately similar shifts detection properties as VAR residual charts.

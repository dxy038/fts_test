Objective
gh the exact reason is not known, encapsulated gram-negative Porphyromonas gingivalis strains are more virulent than non-encapsulated strains. Since difference in virulence properties may be due to difference in cytokine production following recognition of the bacteria or their products by the host inflammatory cells, we compared cytokine production following stimulation with bacteria or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of a non-encapsulated and an encapsulated P. gingivalis strain (K− and K1).

 necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production following stimulation of the cell-line Mono Mac 6 with bacteria or LPS of both P. gingivalis strains was determined using flow cytometry. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of the two P. gingivalis strains or their LPS on TNF-α and Interleukin (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-10) production in whole blood using Luminex. In both experiments, Escherichia coli bacteria and LPS were used as a reference.
s
. gingivalis strains induced lower cytokine production than E. coli with the exception of IL-6. P. gingivalis K1 bacteria elicited a higher overall cytokine production than P. gingivalis K−. In contrast, P. gingivalis K1 LPS stimulation induced a lower cytokine production than P. gingivalis K− LPS.
sions
ndings suggest that the encapsulated P. gingivalis K1 bacteria induce higher cytokine production than the non-encapsulated P. gingivalis K−. This was not due to its LPS. The stronger induction of cytokines may contribute to the higher virulence of P. gingivalis K1.

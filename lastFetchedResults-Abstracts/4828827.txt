A new speech coding algorithm `pole-zero CELPÂ´ is proposed in which the short-time spectral envelope of the speech wave is modelled with a pole-zero filter. Objective and subjective comparisons of a CELP (12 pole and 14 pole) and a pole-zero CELP (8 pole-6 zero and 12 pole-6 zero) coder are made. The results presented show that pole-zero CELP is able to reproduce the original speech signal better than the CELP coder. The informal subjective tests show a preference for the pole-zero CELP coder (12 pole-6 zero)

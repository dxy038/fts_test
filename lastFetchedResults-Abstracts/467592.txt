Objective: Our purpose was to determine whether the routine initiation of dexamethasone therapy in patients with postpartum HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia) syndrome produces specific and general therapeutic benefits. Study Design: In this retrospective, analytic study the puerperal courses of 43 women with postpartum HELLP syndrome who were treated with dexamethasone were compared with those of 237 similar patients who did not receive corticosteroids. Dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously at 12-hour intervals was given until disease remission was noted in treated patients, at which time up to two additional 5 mg intravenous doses were given at 12-hour intervals. Results: The two patient groups were similar in regard to mode of delivery, gestational age, parity, and frequency of eclampsia. Compared with control subjects, dexamethasone-treated postpartum patients were more ill with significantly higher (p< 0.05) admission mean arterial blood pressure, higher serum uric acid level, and severe proteinuria. Dexamethasone administration was associated with a more rapid normalization of platelet counts and lactic dehydrogenase values. Most impressive was a clinically significant reduction of indicated transfusion and respiratory therapy, invasive hemodynamic monitoring, infectious or bleeding-related morbidity, and length of postpartum hospital course. Conclusions: Patients who received dexamethasone for postpartum-onset HELLP syndrome experienced a shorter disease course, faster recovery, less morbidity, and less need for other interventionist therapy compared with patients with HELLP syndrome who did not receive dexamethasone.

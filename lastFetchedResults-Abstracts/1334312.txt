Background and Objective: Obesity and saturated fat diet have a negative effect on plasma lipoproteins. The best therapeutic regiment for the treatment of obesity and reduction of serum lipoproteins is a diet containing non-saturated fatty acids accompanied with aerobic exercise. This study was carried to evaluate the effect of 8 weeks aerobic training and peanut consumption on serum Lipoproteins levels in overweight and obese men.
Materials and Methods: This semi-experimental study was done on 36 obese males with age of 41.82±3.4yr, BMI: 32.38±2.50 kg/m2 in North of Iran during 2009. Subjects were divided in three equal groups: aerobic interval training, peanut consumption aerobic, interval training and control. peanut consumption Training group were consumed 50gr peanuts daily. Prior and after training period, serum lipoproteins levels of subjects were evaluated. Data were analyzed using SPSS-16, ANOVA and LSD tests.
Results: There was a significant differences between the reduction of total mean serum cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins in experiment group II (aerobic interval training and peanut) compare to other groups (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Aerobic interval training plus peanut regiment reduce lipoprotein and specifically triglyceride and low-density lipoproteins in overweight and obese men.

The articleÂ´s central objective is to solve the mobility problem in wireless communications. In the service acquiring process of mobile terminals, wireless communications are asking more requirements for mobile handover. This paper proposes a Cross-layer Scheme based on Integrated Mobility Management (CSIMM) to reduce the handover latency and provide the high transmission performance. The main idea is to realize the uniform authentication and trigger the association of MAC layer and IP layer at the same time by incorporating the Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points and Proxy Mobile Internet Protocol version 6. A mathematical model is developed as well. The performance results show that our scheme is superior to those existing inter-domain handover methods in the term of the access and handover latency.

An AC/DC current-regulated pulse density modulated (PDM) power converter is presented. The MOS-controlled thyristor (MCT) is used in this power converter because of its promising advantages over existing power devices. A unique bidirectional switch configuration is used, which allows the MCT to switch easily at zero voltage. The converter performance is evaluated driving a 5 hp induction motor. MCT switching was performed satisfactorily, but the device fails before its ratings are reached. The MCT will be better than other devices when used in applications that require critical timing and high voltage blocking capability

Objective: To investigate in man the factor structure of retinal oscillatory potentials (OPs) to full-field luminance stimulation (0.9–9.5 cd.s.m−2) and the correlation with the spontaneous fluctuations of plasma ammonia.
Methods: Six male healthy volunteers were studied. Five OP recordings and ammonia determinations (GLDH method) were obtained for each subject at 2 h interval during an 8 h experimental session. A standard factor analysis was applied on the OP latency (time from stimulus to peak) and amplitudes values.
Results: Two consecutive factors on latencies and two factors on amplitudes were identified, consistent with reported differences between the earlier and later OP waves. The model explained a large portion of the OP variance. Both factors on latencies and factor 1 on amplitudes were directly correlated to the stimulus intensity and the ammonia plasma concentration in the 15.8–39.5 μmol/l range. Factors 1 and 2 on latencies decreased and factor 1 on amplitude increased at increasing stimulus intensities. The latency factors decreased and the amplitude factor increased with increasing ammonia concentration. Factor 2 on amplitudes did not correlate with the stimulus intensity or ammonia concentration.
Conclusions: The factor structure further supports the evidence of functional differences between early and late OP waves. The observed correlation conceivably reflects a role of ammonia in the modulation of retinal electrophysiology in physiological conditions and potentially accounts for spontaneous variability in otherwise controlled electrophysiological studies.

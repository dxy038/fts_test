This article has analysed the problem of controlling the movement of the 3D visual window for the surgery robot operated by the doctors in their habits, and found out the relationship of position and pose between the objective window and the current window, and established kinematic model of the robot arm with a laparoscope, and then analysed the workspace of the end of the laparoscope. According to the above, established the kinematic model of the 3D visual window based on the dynamic vision, the analytical expressions of its kinematic algorithm have been derived, and verified it through a kinematic sample.

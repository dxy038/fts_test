The goal of this paper is to present a partitioned-based optimal power flow (POPF) tool for VAR planning using partitioned power system networks. This tool incorporates a partitioning algorithm, a generic load flow Howard University Power Flow Program (HUPFP), and an optimization algorithm-Extended Quadratic interior Point (EQIP) method, all in one environment. The VAR planning objective function formulation used for this phase of the project is presented. Also the implementation of the POPF algorithm is discussed with specific emphasis placed on the partitioning algorithm, the EQIP algorithm, and a handling infeasibility scheme. The POPF algorithm is illustrated on the IEEE 30-bus test case partitioned into 2 local areas for the VAR planning objective

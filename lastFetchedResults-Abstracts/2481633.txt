Background: Matricaria chamomilla L. is a valuable medicine plant that determining of threshold tolerance and assessing of quantitative yield and phytochemical is necessary in different condition, especially of salinity and pH.
Objective: Determination of essential oil, percent of essential oil efficiency, tolerance threshold to salinity and pH in medicinal plant of chamomile.
Methods: This research was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Salinity levels was performed with EC; 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 dSm-1 using NaCl and pH levels of 4, 5, 6.4, 8 and 9. 
Results: The results showed that the maximum of wet and dry weight of flower and number of flower were achieved in EC 2 and with increasing of salinity to more than 2 dSm-1, were decreased (P?0.01). Percentage of oil yield efficiency was lowest in EC 2 and increased by rising of salinity. Assessing essential oil showed that, with rising of salinity stress ?-Bisabolol oxide A (5.2%) and Camazulene (47.9%)were increased and reduced, respectively. The results of pH treatments showed that the maximum of number of flower and dry and wet weight of flower were achieved in pH 8, and reduced significantly (P < 0.01) by down and up of optimum pH (8). The ?-Bisabolol oxide A(73.1%) increased with rising of pH and was maximum in pH 8. 
Conclusion: Salt tolerance threshold based on flower yield and total biomass were 2 and 4 dSm-1, respectively. The highest yield was obtained in pH 8, based on total dry weight of flower.

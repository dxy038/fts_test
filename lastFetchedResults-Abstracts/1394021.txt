Although either static or dynamic measurements have been used for model updating in a damage identification procedure, when a generally valid and accurate model is sought, different types of measurements should be combined. While modal characteristics give information about the global response of structures, static measurements are more concerned with the local response. Their combination would allow considering different scale levels in the detection through the simultaneous optimization of several objectives. In this work, a damage identification methodology is presented which allows combining static and dynamic measurements within a model updating procedure posed in a multi-objective framework solved by using evolutionary algorithms. Unlike other globalâ€“local multi-stage procedures developed in the past, the proposed method is solved as a simplified one-stage procedure.

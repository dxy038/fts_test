Background: There is mounting evidence for HPV involvement in cervical cancer Human
Papilloma Virus DNA is detected by hybridization techniques in 75 - 100% of patients with
condylomas, precancerous cervical dysplasia, and invasive carcinoma.
Objective: The aim of this study was investigating factors that may contribute to falsenegative
colposcopic biopsy results in positive high-risk HPV DNA results.
Material and Methods: Patients positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)
DNA with negative cervical histopathologic findings were examined between January
2004 and August 2006.
Results: Patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC) in
Papanicolaou smears, with positive HPV DNA results, but negative cervical
histopathologic findings accounted for 4.5% of all ASC smears submitted for HPV
DNA testing. We found 4% of the cases had focal HPV infection or mild dysplasia.
When serial sectioning of the biopsy material were examined, we found that 29% had
clinically significant lesions : HPV infection or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CIN I,
18%; CIN WIn, 8%; and dysplasia, not otherwise specified (which we can not
categorize into any group), 3%. Of the remaining patients, follow-up revealed squamous
abnormalities in 25%. About 5% of patients with positive HPY DNA results had a
negative follow-up biopsy result. "False-negative" biopsies accounted for one third of
cases.
Conclusion: In almost one third of cases, clinically significant lesions were found when
additional levels were examined.

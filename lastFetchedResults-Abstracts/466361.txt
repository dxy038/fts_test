Objective:This study was undertaken to determine whether the expressions of 3 proliferation markers (Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and silver-staining nucleolar organizer regions) and of p53 tumor protein could differentiate spontaneous abortions from gestational trophoblastic diseases and also discriminate among gestational trophoblastic disease subgroups. Study Design:Twenty-two partial hydatidiform moles, 17 complete hydatidiform moles, 6 invasive hydatidiform moles, and 20 nonhydropic spontaneous abortions (control group) were evaluated by means of immunohistochemical techniques with antibodies to Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and p53. One-step silver staining was used to detect silver-staining nucleolar organizer regions. Results:The expressions of Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, silver-staining nucleolar organizer regions, and p53 were significantly higher in the gestational trophoblastic disease group than in the control group. The results of linear discriminant analysis showed that silver-staining nucleolar organizer region count had the highest sensitivity and specificity (93.3% and 100%, respectively) for distinguishing gestational trophoblastic disease from spontaneous abortion. Sensitivity and specificity for discriminating gestational trophoblastic disease from spontaneous abortion increased to 100% when all four markers were used together. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen was found to be the best discriminating variable for differentiating among gestational trophoblastic disease subgroups. Conclusion:Our findings suggest that expressions of Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, silver-staining nucleolar organizer regions, and p53 may aid in the diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic diseases. These fairly rapid, simple, and economic techniques could serve as a useful adjunct to conventional methods in the diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic diseases.

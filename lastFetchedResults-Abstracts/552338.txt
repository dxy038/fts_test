Background and Objective: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common oral ulcerative disease that affects 20% of general population. The etiology of RAS is unknown and it is due several different mechanisms. The purpose of study was to assess the epidemiology and related factors in its occurrence . Subjects and Methods: In this descriptive -cross sectional study, 1105 persons attending to health centers in Zahedan, selected in a multi-stage random manner, were assessed for abundance and effective factors in development of RAS. The data were gathered as single stage and by interview, completion of a questionnaire and clinical examination. The data were analyzed by Chi-squared test using SPSS software.

Results: Among 1105 persons (476 males and 629 females) examined, 199 persons (18%) were affected by aphthea and 168 (84.4%o) case had minor, 26 case (13.1%) had major and 5 case (2.5%) had herpetiform aphthea. In this research, there were significant correlations between the abundance of RAS and age (P<0.00l), education (P =0.001), job (P=0.002), allergy (P=0,02), kind of allergy (P =0.004), predisposing disease (P =0.005), family history (P< 0.001) and brushing (P<0.00l). No significant differences were found between the abundance of RAS and gender, using snuf, tobacco or mouth wash.

Conclusion: RAS is a multifactorial lesion and factors such as age, high-stress job, high education, trauma and allergy are positively co-related with occurrence of the aphthea. Sci Med J 2011; 10(3):323-334

Background: Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and several antigenic
proteins of Brucella have been considered for preparation
of diagnostic reagents and subunit vaccines, The objective
of this study was to identify and compare immunogens of B.
abortus S19 which induce humoral immune responses in human,
goat and rabbit.
Material and Methods: The bacterial whole cell extract was
prepared in extraction buffer and resolved using twodimensional
gel electrophoresis (2-DE) . The resolved antigens
were reacted against human, goat and rabbit sera using western
blotting ,
Results: At least 19, 14 and 16 immunogenic proteins were recognized
in western blotting with human, goat and rabbit sera,
respectively. The most abundant proteins of the bacterium with
immunogenic properties in goat and rabbit but not in human,
were a group of 5-6 proteins with molecular masses of 32-34
KDa and isoelectric point (pl) ranging from 4.5 to 5.7. In contrast,
a group of 5 proteins with molecular weight of 45 KDa and
pi in the range of 4.5 to 5.4 as well as several low molecular
weight proteins were immunogenic in human. Furthermore several
proteins of Brucella had similar reactions against all sera.
Conclusion: These results showed that some of the antigenic
proteins of Brucella could be candidates for more accurate
diagnosis of Brucellosis in humans and domestic animals.

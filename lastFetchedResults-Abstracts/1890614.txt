Land-use spatial allocation is a multi-objective collaborative spatial optimization method
for rational use of the land use. Based on global search capabilities and the information feedback
mechanism of ant colony optimization (ACO), a land-use spatial allocation model (ACO-LA) is
proposed. FirstlyFirst, a construction graph is built for modeling the land-use spatial allocation
problem. SecondlySecond, the behaviors of artificial ants are improved so that the solution can be
foundobtained quickly in the searchingsearch space. Finally, the ant colony generates optimized
solutions by reconciling the conflicts between different planning objectives or by setting the relative
dominance of different land-use types. Our study focuses on Gaoqiao Town of Fuyang City in
Zhejiang Province, China. The model maximizes the land-use suitability and spatial compactness,
and minimizes the cost of changing the land use, based on a variety of constraints, e.g., the optimal
land-use structure and land-use policies. The results suggest that this model can obtain an optimized
land-use spatial pattern from different sets of sub-objective weights and different development
scenarios. With the constraint of the land-use structure, the land-use types can be distributed more
reasonably by different sets of sub-objective weights. In different development scenarios, the model
encourageencourages areas of land-use types in line with the development direction, adapting to
meet different development needs by setting the relative dominance of the different land-use types,
W
dominance, which is added to the component selection probability Pij.

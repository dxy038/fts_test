Application of `advanced analysis' methods suitable for non-linear analysis and design of steel frame structures permits direct and accurate determination of ultimate system strengths, without resort to simplified elastic methods of analysis and semi-empirical specification equations. However, the application of advanced analysis methods has previously been restricted to steel frames comprising only compact sections that are not influenced by the effects of local buckling. A research project has been conducted with the aim of developing concentrated plasticity methods suitable for practical advanced analysis of steel frame structures comprising non-compact sections. A primary objective was to produce a comprehensive range of new distributed plasticity analytical benchmark solutions for verification of the concentrated plasticity methods. A distributed plasticity model was developed using shell finite elements to explicitly account for the effects of gradual yielding and spread of plasticity, initial geometric imperfections, residual stresses and local buckling deformations. The model was verified by comparison with large-scale steel frame test results and a variety of existing analytical benchmark solutions. This paper presents a description of the distributed plasticity model and details of the verification study.

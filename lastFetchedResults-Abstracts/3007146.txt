This paper presents an interactive surrogate worth trade-off (ISWT) method for multi-objective decision-making in reactive power sources planning. The method to be presented here requires a best-compromise solution that is also a global noninferior solution. The proposed solution scheme is an interactive architecture, which allows the complex details of the internal structure of the multi-objective decision-making problem to be effectively exploited and, at the same time, provides an effective mechanism for treating other important "subjective" elements. Finally, the task of decision-maker (DM) is often made simpler if he is asked to indicate a preference rather than supply estimates of the trade-off involved. Therefore, the presented method is based on objective trade-off analysis and can obtain a desirable, global noninferior solution.

Objective: Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and osterix (OSX) as two specific
osteoblast transcription factors and distal-less homeobox 5 (DLX5) as a non-specific one
are of paramount importance in regulating osteoblast related genes including osteocalcin,
bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteopontin and collagen type I?1. The present study sets out to
investigate whether epigenetic regulation of these genes is important in osteoblastic differentiation
of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, MSCs were differentiated to osteoblasts
under the influence of the osteogenic differentiation medium. DNA and RNA were
extracted at days 0, 7, 14 and 21 from MSCs differentiating to osteoblasts. Promoter
regions of RUNX2, OSX, DLX5 and BSP were analyzed by methylation-specific PCR
(MSP). Gene expression was analyzed during osteoblastic differentiation by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Results: MSP analysis revealed that promoter methylation status did not change in
RUNX2, DLX5 and BSP during MSC osteoblastic differentiation. In contrast, OSX promoter
showed a dynamic change in methylation pattern. Moreover, RUNX2, OSX, DLX5
and BSP promoter regions showed three different methylation patterns during MSC differentiation.
Gene expression analyses confirmed these results.
Conclusion: The results show that in differentiation of MSCs to osteoblasts, epigenetic
regulation of OSX may play a leading role.

In this research investigation, the lubricated wear behavior of leaded α+β brass sliding against stainless steel counterface was studied with the aid of a pin-on-disk apparatus. The main objective of this work was to study the effect of aqueous based environments on the interface and tribological characteristics of this tribosystem, as in several cases the formation of a thin corrosion product layer can act as a lubricating film, decreasing the coefficient of friction of the tribosystem. Thus distilled water and 3.5% NaCl solutions were used as possible lubricants and were then compared with a commercial SAE 80 W lubricant, which is extensively used in many light and heavy-duty, automotive, commercial or industrial applications. From the experimental results obtained, Stribeck curves for each lubricative environment were exacted and analyzed. In addition, by evaluating changes in the coefficient of friction of the tribosystem in accordance with the observed wear mechanisms, the characteristic lubrication regimes (elastodynamic, mixed and boundary) were identified in these curves.

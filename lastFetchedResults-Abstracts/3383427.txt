Fiber matrix burners incorporating &#8220;superemissive&#8221; ceramic materials were tested to obtain the relationship between power generation and the pollutant emissions. The tested variables were the following: equivalence ratio, fuel input, and inlet air temperature. One important objective was to achieve maximum efficiency of electricity generation at the lowest level of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. It was found that NO<sub>x</sub> emission under these specific conditions does not depend on inlet air temperature in the ranges from 20 to 200&#176;C. This phenomena suggests that &#8220;thermal NO<sub>x</sub>&#8221; is not a significant contributor of NO<sub>x</sub> emission in these types of burners. The test data indicate that the thermophotovoltaic (TPV) power output increased by a factor of 2 by increasing the combustion temperature while the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions were stable. The result of these findings is that high efficiency, low polluting TPV-power generation is feasible. The basic technology responsible for the low NO <sub>x</sub> emission and the electric power generation is being further developed for use in high-efficiency appliances, generators, and total energy systems

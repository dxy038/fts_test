The purpose of this study is to select a robust and scalable routing protocol and to estimate the bandwidth overhead for extremely mobile, volatile and bandlimited tactical networks. The objective is to determine the suitability of such protocols for application to DARPA-sponsored SUO SAS (small unit operation situation awareness system) tactical networks. As it is well known, a critical issue for such networks is that routing control overheads increase rapidly with network size, thereby limiting their scalability. This paper presents a link-state proxy flooding protocol (LSPFP) with flat proxy architecture (FRA) which, as shown through analytical approximation of control overhead traffic, meets the scalability requirements of tactical networks. The generic routing concept is used to derive the analytical approximation equation, rather than a specific link state protocol.

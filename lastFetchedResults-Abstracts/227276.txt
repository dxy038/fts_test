A zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) threelevel
auxiliary resonant commutated pole inverter
(ARCPI) is presented for high power GTO
inverters. The concept of ARCPI for two level
inverter is extended to the three-level inverter.
The proposed auxiliary commutation circuit
consists of one resonant inductor and two
bidirectional switches, which provides the ZVS
condition to the main devices without increasing
device voltage or current stresses. The auxiliary
device operates with zero-current switching (ZCS)
which allows the use of low-cost thyristors. The
proposed ARCPI can handle higher voltage and
higher power (1-1 0 MVA) with fewer harmonics
comparing to the two level one. Operation and
analysis of the proposed ARCPI are illustrated
and the features are compared with those of the
snubber circuit incorporated three-level inverter.
Experimental results with lOkW, 4kHz prototype
are presented to verify the principle of operation.

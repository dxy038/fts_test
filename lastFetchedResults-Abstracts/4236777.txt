An algorithm for computing the reactive power requirement of induction generator based distributed generation is proposed in this paper. The machine equivalent circuit is combined with an AC power flow algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO), for simultaneous integration of induction generation and shunt compensation capacitors in a power distribution network with the objective of minimizing network power loss. The algorithm iteratively calculates the required slip for the output power of the generator to be within a small tolerance band of the specified output power. PSO is then employed to obtain the global optimal solution with the compensation capacitors locally providing the reactive power requirement of the generator. The algorithm is tested on a standard 33-bus distribution network, showing its effectiveness for the integration of induction machine based generation.

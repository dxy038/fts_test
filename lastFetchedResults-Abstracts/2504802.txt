Background: Different studies show that chromosomal balance translocation in the parents can cause recurrent spontaneous abortions. Incidence of chromosomal translocation abnormalities in couples with repeated abortions is from 0% to 31%. Objective: The purpose of this research was studying the presence or absence of chromosomal abnormalities and heteromorphism in couples with recurrent abortions and also the role of this anomaly in the abortions. Materials and Methods: This study is a cross sectional descriptive study which have investigated 75 couples who had three abortions or more, and 65 couples who had two abortions that referred by gynecologist to the lab of Beheshti Hospital in Hamedan for cytogenetical investigation. Also 40 healthy individuals without history of abortion investigated as control group.GTG bonding technique (staining banding with gymsa and trypsin) is used in this study. Results: Frequency of chromosomal abnormalities and heteromorphism among couples with three or more abortions were reported respectively 5.3% and 9.3%. This frequency in couples with two abortions was respectively 3.07%and 6.15%. The frequency of chromosomal heteromorphism in control group was 7.5% and no chromosomal abnormalities were observed in them. Conclusion: This study shows that chromosomal abnormality can be one reason of recurrent spontaneous abortions and more abortion increases the probability of this anomaly. Also, existence of chromosomal heteromorphism in the general population without clinical abortion symptoms shows that chromosomal heteromorphism cannot be the reason of these spontaneous abortions.

Objective: To evaluate the results of Lipoprotein (a)[Lp(a)] measurements by a competitive two-step monoclonal enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay method comparing them with those by a conventional ELISA.
Methods: Serum having various isoforms of Lp(a) and purified Lp(a) were assayed using the method described here and commercially available kits. The reference range was determined with the use of 324 normal subjects by means of calculation from Lp(a) results of logarithmic transformation.
Results: Our method takes adbantage of a competitive reaction between fixed antibody and free antibody to Lp(a), having the detection range up to 1000 mg/L with the lowest detection limit of 2 mg/L. The anti-Lp(a) monoclonal antibody employed in the assay system reacts uniformly with all phenotypes of Lp(a) but showing very low cross-reactivity for plasminogen and LDL. Within-run and between-run precisions were excellent, giving CVs of 2.9 and 4.0% with mean values of 145 and 635 mg/L, respectively. In comparison of the results by our method with those by a polyclonal method (Biopool) or a monoclonal antibody method (Terumo), they correlated well; Y (our method) = 0.99 × (polyclonal method, Terumo) − 1.9, r = 0.994 (n = 60), and Y = 0.94 X(monoclonal method, Terumo) − 9.8, r = 0.97 (n = 60), respectively. The reference range was 105.9 ± 25.4 mg/L, the difference between the sexes was not significant.
Conclusion: Our method has proven highly accurate and specific. It is applicable with auto analyzer because it does not require such a pre-dilution step as is necessary for Lp(a) determination by conventional ELISA assay. Accordingly, we can conclude that our test method is workable for both clinical laboratories and mass screening.

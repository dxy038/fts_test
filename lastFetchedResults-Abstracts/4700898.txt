The relationship of the three main factors of engineering management, is analyzed based on the concept of construction engineering management, which are resource, technology and management. Then, vector model is established which can quantitatively describe the mutuality of each element and its sub-element. The level of engineering management, the defects and loopholes at construction preparation stage can be assessed by this model, and quantitative evaluation to the realized level of management objective when project finished can also be assessed.

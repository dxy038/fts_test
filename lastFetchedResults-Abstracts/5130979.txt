DRASTIC model is one of techniques and methodologies to evaluate environmental impacts on groundwater. GIS is one of tools for data gathering and processing, such as geo-referencing, integration, aggregation, or spatial analysis. The main objective is to find out the shallow groundwater aquifers vulnerable zones in one of industrial areas in Jiaozuo City where there are a lot of enterprises allowed to enter which will make great pressures on local groundwater. Arcview 3.3 GIS software connected with DRTIC model was used. Results show that more than 70 percent groundwater is under the medium to high vulnerability for pollution. More work should be done to protect local groundwater resources.

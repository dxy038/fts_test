Objective: Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis is a rare invasive fungal disease, which often has a fulminant and characteristic clinical course. The patients are usually immune-compromised, with diabetic ketoacidosis. The underlying disease is an important factor determining the prognosis of infection and response to treatment.
Case: The authors report a case of fulminant rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis with no apparent underlying disease. Therapy included surgical intervention and systemic administration of amphotericin B. However, due to the aggressive behavior of disease and occult underlying systemic condition the treatment was unsuccessful and the patient died after debridement and medical therapy.
Conclusion: Only a few cases of Rhino-orbito-cerebral Mucormycosis have been reported in the literature with no identified predisposing factor. In our case, no specific predisposing factors were found accompanying the fulminant progression of rhino-orbito-cerebral mucomycosis.

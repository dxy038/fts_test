The objective of this tutorial workshop is to provide a concise review of the most optimal operational practices and the current best practices and guidelines for developing an IPv6 addressing plan. This workshop will greatly benefit educators and industry practitioners whom desire to obtain knowledge in the fundamentals of IPv6 addressing and IPv6 network addressing design. This workshop is especially important for educators teaching in the information technology and computer science fields. It would be unacceptable for students in these fields to enter the work-force without a fundamental knowledge of IPv4 - the same is now equally true of IPv6. Attendees will receive practical knowledge of IPv6, complete hands-on exercises, and receive examples of hands-on labs and projects that can be incorporated into the classroom to supplement the current curriculum.

Introduction: Obesity and the associated consequences is a major health concern. Infertility is considered as one of the most important health problems. Studies have shown that there is a relationship between obesity and infertility. Obesity causes hormonal disturbance and also interferes with the normal ovulation process.
Objective: This study investigated the relationship between obesity and risk factors for infertility.
Materials and Methods: this study is a comparative analytical one done on 200 women (100 women infertile and 100 fertile women), admitted to Kowsar hospital in Qazvin during 2013-2015. Sampling method was simple. Tool for data collection was a check list including: demographic data, blood pressure, BMI and the waist to hip ratio, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Statistical analysis was done using descriptive and analytical methods in spss.16.
Results: The results showed mean body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio between the two groups were significantly different (P < 0.05).Survey of lipid profile showed that cholesterol and triglyceride levels in infertile women were significantly different from that in fertile women, being higher in infertile women (P =0.04). Also, a positive correlation between BMI and cholesterol and triglycerides levels in the two groups was shown (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The present study revealed a positive association between infertility and increased lipid profile in infertile women. Therefore, due to the increasing prevalence of obesity in the society, we need to pay special attention to this issue and take into account public awareness and lifestyle change programs.

Increasing the maritime transportation market and using the container have led the large volume of containers to the seaports. Considering the long time presence of containers in the country's seaports and the traditional structure of container transportation, not only can cause high fuel consumption but also increase the diverse environmental pollution, traffic congestion and road accidents. Therefore constructing the dry ports or internal logistics ports is one way that has successful experiences in other countries. The idea of dry ports' presence in the special distance from the seaports has reduced many of the problems have been created for the seaports.  However, the optimum location of dry ports has to be determined, like all service centers, and correct extension of them has valuable achievements. The main objective of this study is locating the site for construction of dry ports in the country. On the other hand locating of them is eclipsed of different and sometimes contradictory quantitative and qualitative criteria.
Due to the Analysis Hierarchical Process is one of the most comprehensive systems for multiple criteria decision making techniques and this method has enough ability to consider various quantitative and qualitative criteria, so in this study it was used to determine the weights of criteria and alternatives and after the ranking of options, the results were compared.
In this study, field research and library resources has utilized for determining of effective measures in the dry ports' locating. Then these factors were divided to benefits and cost factors and weight of them was determined with using of a questionnaire and binary comparison. Finally, the incremental benefit/cost analysis was used for the ranking of alternatives in order to construct the dry ports.

Free radicals are cause of the various diseases. Oxidation also reduces the quality of the food
and causes the disease. Synthetic antioxidants have human health risks, so it is necessary to
identify the natural antioxidant agents. The objective of this study was to optimize the
production of gelatin hydrolysissate with antioxidant properties. The catfish skin gelatin was
extracted using sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid and citric acid by the washing after each
treatment, finally 3 volumes of distilled water added at 45Â° C for 12 h in a shaker incubator and
hydrolyzed under various conditions of temperature, enzyme concentration and time using the
Flavourzyme. Gelatin for measuring the ion chelating of ferrous iron, mixed with FeCl2 and
Frosin and after ten minutes of stay at room temperature, absorbance at 562 nm was measured.
Response surface methodology was used to optimize the production of gelatin hydrolysis. The
test variables included the time (min), temperature (oC) and enzyme-substrate ratio (%), percent
the chelated Fe (II) was considered as a response. Analysis of variance showed significance of
the models, temperature and enzyme to substrate (P < 0.05) and not significance for the time
(P > 0.05). This indicates a good fitness to the model. Catfish skin gelatin hydrolysate show a
good percent Fe (II) ion chelating in the range of 20-81%. The results suggest antioxidant
peptides from catfish skin gelatin hydrolysis can be a potential candidate for the pharmaceutical
industry and for the development of functional foods.

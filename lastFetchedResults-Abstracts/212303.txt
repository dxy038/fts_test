Optimization is an important methodology for activities in planning and design. The transportation designers are able to introduce better projects when they can save time and cost of travel for project by optimization methods. Most of the optimization problems in engineering are more complicated than they can be solved by custom optimization methods. The most common and available methods are heuristic methods. In these methods, the answer will be close to the optimum answer but it isn 't the exact one. For achieving more accuracy, more time has been spent. In fact, the accuracy of response will vary based on the time spent.
In this research, using the generic algorithms, one of the most effective heuristic algorithms, a method of optimization for urban streets direction will be introduced. Therefore model of decision making in considered one way - two way streets is developed. The efficiency of model in Qazvin network is shown and the results compared whit the current situation as case study. The objective function of the research is to minimize the total travel time for all users, which is one of the most used in urban networks objectives.

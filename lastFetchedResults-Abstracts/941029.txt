Air quality monitoring data are important bases for air quality management strategies planning and performance assessment.
Therefore, the environmental protection authorities need to plan the air quality monitoring network effectively. However, in
Taiwan, the national Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) and some county environmental protection bureaus (EPB)
separately installed their own monitoring stations. This study developed an integrated methodology and computer system for
planning air quality monitoring networks. The environmental, social, and economic objectives and sub-objectives, and their
weights were identified using system analysis and multiple objective planning, based on the principles of sustainable development.
A multiple objective optimization model and procedure for sustainable air quality monitoring networks planning are developed in
this study. According to the procedure, a multiple objective planning system for sustainable air quality monitoring networks
(MOPSSAQMN) is developed using computer software based on the modified bounded implicit enumeration algorithm with the
constraint arrangement method. The air quality monitoring network of Taoyuan County, in northern Taiwan, was used as a case
study to demonstrate the proposed method. Two satisfactory alternatives based on different conditions were generated using
MOPSSAQMN. The compared results show that this study generated better alternatives than the current monitoring network. An
installation schedule for the alternative was proposed, and its first step is now being implemented by the EPB of Taoyuan County
Government. The procedure and computer system developed in this study can be used to assist the competent authorities to devise
good and different alternatives for air quality monitoring networks planning.

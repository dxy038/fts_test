A new method called the method of inner-point of the interface is given for a linear programming. An optimal solution can be obtained by finite iterations or no finite optimal solution can be proved using this method. This method is called the method of innerpoint of the interface, because its iteration process is from one interface point to another step by step which is remaining objective function value not increased. The method can be used for achieving an optimal solution.

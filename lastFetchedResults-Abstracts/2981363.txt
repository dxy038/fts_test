In this paper, we propose a new simple method to optimize the parameters of the deep-submicron MOSFETs, namely, maximizing the nominal driving current at constant worst case (i.e. considering technology fluctuation) off-state current. Although there are only one objective and one constraint in this optimizing procedure, the effects of subthreshold factor S, channel carrier mobility, source/drain resistance, drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and V<sub>th</sub> roll-off are all considered. To demonstrate the capability of this method, it is used to optimize the source/drain junction depth for 0.1 &#956;m MOSFET. The results show that a junction depth as shallow as 0.02 &#956;m is needed to maximize the driving current for a uniform channel doped MOSFET

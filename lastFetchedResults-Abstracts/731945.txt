Objective. This study was undertaken to evaluate a smoking cessation intervention provided to women smokers as follow-up to cervical cancer screening.

Methods. Women who had had a Pap test in the prior month (N = 4,053) were called to complete a survey that assessed smoking status; 580 identified smokers were randomized to receive Usual care (n = 292) or a Self-help intervention (n = 288) that included a self-help booklet, a smoking and reproductive health infor mation card, and three telephone counseling calls. Women were followed up at 6 and 15 months postbase line.

Results. Cessation rates in the Usual care (UC) and Self-help (SH) groups did not differ at the 6-month (UC 10.5% vs SH 10.9%, P = 0.56) or 15-month follow-up (UC 15.5% vs SH 10.6%, P = 0.17). Among women with an abnormal Pap test result there were no differences by study group in cessation rates at 6-month (UC 9.8% vs SH 11.0%, P = 0.71) or 15-month follow-up (UC 14.6% vs SH 13.4%, P = 0.96).

Conclusion. Integrating interventions into the clini cal setting and involving providers at the point of care may have greater potential for capitalizing on this “teachable moment.”

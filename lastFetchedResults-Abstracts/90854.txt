The design of efficient time compression support hardware for built-in self-testing (BIST) is of great importance in the design and manufacture of VLSI circuits. The test data outputs in BIST are ultimately compressed by time compaction hardware, commonly called a response analyzer, into signatures. Several output response compaction techniques to aid in the synthesis of such support circuits already exist in literature, and parity bit signature coupled with exhaustive testing is already well known to have certain very desirable properties in this context. This paper reports new time compaction techniques utilizing the concept of parity bit signature that facilitates implementing such support circuits using nonexhaustive or compact test sets, with the primary objective of minimizing the storage requirements for the circuit under test (CUT) while maintaining the fault coverage information as best as possible.

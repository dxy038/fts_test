The author describes the advanced avionics system development laboratory (AASDL), a general resource facility that provides new technology and vehicle programs and a cost-effective method of evaluating the concepts and approaches employed in their design. This resource lab permits complete end-to-end simulations of system operation in the simulated mission environment desired. It serves as the center of an integrated network of current and future specialized testing facilities. The AASDLÂ´s ability to support the rapid modeling of new or present systems and evaluate performance in desired applications is shown in two examples. The functional hardware and software elements of the AASDL design are also reviewed in the discussion of the example cases. In the far term, the objective of this laboratory is to reduce optional costs by combining developmental and analytical tools

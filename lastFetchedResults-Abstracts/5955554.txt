The groundwater (GW) was also concurrently used as control. Four popular vegetables had been cultivated on-farm during June 2004-November 2005. It was found that the amounts of irrigated water varied according to seasons, with ratios of irrigated water : total water inputs ranging from 0.03 to 1.00. The harvesting rates of Chinese kale in RW- and PE-plots were statistically different (P&lt;;0.05) and higher than GW-plot in the 2<sup>nd</sup>-4<sup>th</sup> cultivation. For cauliflower, there was no statistically different in harvesting rates among plots irrigated with RW, PE and GW in 4 cultivation. The harvesting rates of Petsai Chinese cabbage in 2 crops were higher in RWand PE-plots. They were statistically different (P&lt;;0.05) from those irrigated with GW. For Chinese radish, harvesting rate of PE-plot was statistically different (P&lt;;0.05) in the 1<sup>st</sup> cultivation. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> cultivation, harvesting rate of RW-plot was statistically different (P&lt;;0.05) while the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> cultivation had no statistically different in all plots. The toxicity on vegetable growth due to RW and PE was not observed throughout the study. In terms of plant´s growth, RW and PE are suitable for vegetable cultivation while harvesting rates can be expected to be similar to or higher than those irrigated with groundwater.

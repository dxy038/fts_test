According to Jossient, interesting characteristics of breast tissues mostly lie above 1MHz [1]; therefore a wideband excitation source covering higher frequencies (i.e. above 1MHz) is required. The main objective of this research is to establish a feasible bandwidth envelope that can be used to design a constant EIM voltage source over a wide bandwidth with low output impedance for practical implementation. An excitation source is one of the major components in bio-impedance measurement systems. In any bio-impedance measurement system the excitation source can be achieved either by injecting current and measuring the resulting voltages, or by applying voltages and measuring the current developed. This paper describes three voltage source architectures and based on their bandwidth comparison; a differential voltage controlled voltage source (VCVS) is proposed, which can be used over a wide bandwidth (&gt;;15MHz). This paper describes the performance of the designed EIM voltage source for different load conditions and load capacitances reporting signal-to-noise ratio of approx 90dB at 10MHz frequency, signal phase and maximum of 4.75k&#937; source output impedance at 10MHz. Optimum data obtained using Pspice&#174; is used to demonstrate the high-bandwidth performance of the source.

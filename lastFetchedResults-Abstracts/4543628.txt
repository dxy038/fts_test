Recently, multi-radio mesh technology in wireless networks has been put under extensive research. This is because of its potential to overcome the inherent wireless multi-hop throughput, scalability and latency problems caused by the half-duplex nature of the IEEE 802.11. This paper introduces a design and modelling of different elements on a distinct type of multicomputer networks, the dual-radio wireless hypermesh (DIWH), based on SystemC methodology. The hepermesh is a well-known topology that belongs to the hypergraph family of networks. Hypermeshes have been proposed as potential alternatives to the graph networks for the future System Area Networks (SAN). In this work, we consider a two dimensional DIWH network, where each router node is equipped with two radio interfaces and two non-overlapping channels are available for each node. we address the problem of assigning channels to communication links in the network with the objective of keeping overall network latency low and provide a relatively high throughput. The simulations and analysis have shown that our design achieves a significant increase in network throughput with less average network latency for large number of communication nodes, compared with the CSMA shared channel model, which is currently the de facto MAC protocol for most wireless networks. Our simulations have been validated analytically to show the accuracy of the developed model. In addition, simulation results have shown that the wireless hypermesh outperforms shared medium wireless networks under the constant total bandwidth argument, especially in large networks.

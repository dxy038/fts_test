Reengineering in all its facets is now a well recognized field within information technology literature and practice for more than 25 years. This paper gives a review of reengineering over this period. It is neither intended as a scientific assessment of the "myriad" of papers ever published about this subject area nor as an extensive review of pros and cons of the various reengineering approaches. It is rather a personal - and not all objective! - assessment of the author\Â´s experiences gained in this field in various projects and especially in the current position as head of an IT software quality department at one of the most crucial IT information service providers in Germany.

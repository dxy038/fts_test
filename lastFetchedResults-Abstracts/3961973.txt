An improved DC model of low- and high-power GaAs MESFETs is proposed. The third-order dependence of fitting parameters on bias conditions is included. The main objective is to obtain a very good agreement between measured and simulated I-V curves, particularly in the knee and saturation regions, regardless of the technological characteristics of the device. The model has been compared with the most significant models presented in the literature, showing some significant improvements of the state-of-the-art

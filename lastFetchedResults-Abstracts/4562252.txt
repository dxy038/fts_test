The control strategies of hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) consist of determining an optimal power split between different energy sources. The objective is to improve fuel economy and reduce pollutant emissions of the vehicle. In this paper a global optimization algorithm based on Lagrange formalism is recalled. This algorithm is then embedded within a Predictive Model Control scheme. Experimental results are presented.

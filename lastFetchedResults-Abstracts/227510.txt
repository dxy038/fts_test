The special circumstances are considercd of an induction motor driven submersible punip
supplied from a variable frequency converter which is remote from the pump location, necessitating
subsea cables which may be considerably longer than in normal practice. The principal objective of
the series of practical tests is to investigate the pcrroniiance of such systems to evaluate a complete
electromechanical system model for use in the prediction of the current and torque requirements of
the drive, and to assess the effect of converter switching patterns on the voltage profile of the
transmission section. Results of coinputer studies are presented which are validated by comparison
with measurements taken on an ESP system during precommissioning tests. The factors affecting the
inservice operational characteristics of the drive are discussed and recommendations made.

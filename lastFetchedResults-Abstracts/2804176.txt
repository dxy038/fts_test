Rising energy costs and strict regulations for carbon dioxide emissions require changes of current energy provisioning systems within the industry sector. For this purpose, this paper presents an approach for smart factories based on an intelligent energy management system considering the integration of new regenerative energy sources, improvement of energy-efficiency production means and replacement of factory internal fleets by electric vehicles. The objective of an internal energy management for smart factories is to offer a carbon dioxide neutral energy supply while minimizing energy costs at the same time, benefiting from the possibilities of local electric storage systems.

This paper focuses on multi-objective designing of multi-machine Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) using Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA). The TCSC parameters designing  problem  is  converted  to  an  optimization  problem with  the multi-objective function including the desired damping factor and the desired damping ratio of the power system  modes, which is solved by a SPEA algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed controller validates on a multi-machine power system over a wide range of loading conditions.  The results of the proposed controller (SPEATCSC) are compared with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based tuned TCSC through some operating conditions to demonstrate its superior efficiency.

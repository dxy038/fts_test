Retina-like processing techniques to perform nonuniformity correction of infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPAs) are discussed. The objective is to design and test electronic structures based on early vision processes in the vertebrate retina. Two adaptive techniques are successfully developed. Both are stable and convergent and are used to process existing infrared images in nonreal time on the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Connection Machine. They are implemented on a real-time image array processor interfaced to an IRFPA in the laboratory. Conceptual designs for an analog chip are prepared and partially simulated

The performance of suboptimal convolutional decoding over fading channels is explored. The suboptimal decoding algorithm used is the bidirectional algorithm. By estimating a &#8220;decoder weight spectrum&#8221; for the decoder, an &#8220;equivalent free distance&#8221; may be observed. Furthermore, by using this &#8220;decoder weight spectrum&#8221;, useful estimations of the error probabilities are obtained and compared to computer-simulation results in the case of very slow and very fast fading. The resultant curves are shown to be very tightly related. Computer-simulation results are also shown for various signal-to-noise ratios, normalized Doppler spreads, and frame length on three typical fading channels: the Rayleigh fading channel with exponential and Bessel autocorrelation functions and the Rician fading channel with exponential autocorrelation function. We show that considerable gains (up to 4 dB) can be obtained with respect to a similar-complexity Viterbi decoder at a frame error probability P<sub>e </sub>=10<sup>-3</sup> and a slightly smaller gain (up to 1.8 dB) at a bit error probability P<sub>b</sub>=10<sup>-5</sup>

The main purpose of this paper is to design active roll control system to improve the roll stability of the heavy tractor semi-trailer. This paper studies an adaptive gain scheduling controller with LQR method, in which the vehicle speed is variable. A linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based on state feedback controller is used to optimize the roll stability of the vehicle. The control objective for optimizing roll stability is to be reducing the lateral load transfer rate while keeping the suspension angle less than the maximum allowable angle. The simulation result indicate: the adaptive gain scheduling control is effective in the active roll stability control of the heavy tractor semi-trailer.

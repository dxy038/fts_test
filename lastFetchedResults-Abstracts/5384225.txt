Summary form only given. This paper presents an optimal control methodology to generate a group behavior for Unmanned Underwater Crawling Vehicles (UUCV) having track-style wheels. The group behaviors with leader-follower formation and obstacle avoidance algorithm is developed to maximize multiple objective functions within a goal attainment method for an uncertain environment. This is done by using intelligent control technology based on physical dynamics modeling.

This paper proposes the Unified Hybrid Power Quality Conditioner (UHPQC). The proposed topology manipulates, at the same time and in continuous way, the displacement power factor and also it mitigates the dominant harmonic component of the line current. The structure is composed by a small rating Active Power Filter (APF) in series with a single passive filter. The main objective of this topology is to control the reactive power injected by the passive filter into the system by controlling the voltage applied on its terminals and simultaneously to compensate the dominant harmonic of the line current. The system automatically compensates the reactive and dominant harmonic power flow in order to guarantee the desired displacement power factor (DPF) and a low harmonic distortion. No information about power system parameters is necessary to the correct operation of the topology. Single phase practical results are presented and discussed.

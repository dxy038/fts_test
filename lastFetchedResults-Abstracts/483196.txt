Background: Knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibility is a suitable method in empirical use of
antimicrobial agents.
Objective: This study was designed to detect the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of urinary tract infections.
Methods: This prospective study investigated the positive urine cultures of out-patients and inpatient of Avesina Teaching hospital in Qazvin during 3 months from July to September 2007. The antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing was performed by disk diffusion method. Findings: Among 224 urine samples, E coli was the most common species (61.2%) followed by Pseudomonas (10.3%), Kelebsiella (8.9%), and coagulase negative staphylococci (6.3%). Nitrofurantoin (72.4%) and Amikacin (77%) were shown to be the most effective drugs on E coli species with Amikacin showing the highest efficacy on Pseudomonas species (50%). Conclusion: E coli was the most common pathogen with maximum susceptibility to Nitrofurantoin. Hence, the administration of this drug in treatment of indoor and uncomplicated forms of UTI is recommended. Intravenously, Amikacin was found to be the most effective agent for such clinical complications.

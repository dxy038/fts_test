In this paper we present a speech enabled bidirectional automatic Indian language text to Braille transliteration system. The system allows bridging the communication gap between a visually impaired and a sighted person. The present system can be configured to take Indian language text document as input and based on some transliteration rules, can generate the corresponding Braille output. The system is augmented by an Indian language text-to-speech (TTS) system through which a user can get instantaneous audio feedback from the input text. We further extended the system to support transliteration of Dzongkha text to Braille. Finally we present an Audio QWERTY editor which allows a visually impaired person to read and write Indian language texts through a computer.

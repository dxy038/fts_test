This paper considers a single machine family scheduling problem where jobs are partitioned into
families and setup is required between these families. The objective is to find an optimal schedule
that minimizes the total weighted completion time of the given jobs in the presence of the sequence
independent family setup times. This problem has been proven to be strongly NP-hard. We
introduce a genetic algorithm that employs an innovative crossover operator that utilizes an
undirected bipartite graph to find the best offspring solution among an exponentially large number
of potential offspring. Computational results are presented. The proposed algorithm is shown to be
superior when compared with other local search methods namely the dynamic length tabu search
and randomized steepest descent method.

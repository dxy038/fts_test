Purpose: This study compared the vowel formants frequency in polyp patients with normal individuals in sustained vowels. Methods: This study is cross-sectional and descriptive–analytical. Variables are: Average of first, second and third formants in six vowels of Persian. These parameters were investigated in patients with vocal fold polyps and normal subjects. People were selected from the age group of 20 to 40 years. Samples of the study included 10 patients with natural sound (5 female and 5 male) and 10 patients with polyps (5 female and 5 male). Results: In men and women with vocal fold polyps, the highest and lowest values ​​of first formant (F1) is in vowel / a / and / u /. Maximum and minimum values of second formant      (F2) in both are in the / e / and / u / and maximum and minimum values of third formant (F3) vowels are in / u / and / e /. First and second formants of Persian vowels differ in normal voice and vocal fold polyps )p=0.028( however, this was not the case in the third structure (p=0.59) Conclusion: Considering the structures are useful in the diagnosis and F1 and F2 can be considered more in objective evaluations.

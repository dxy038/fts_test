Following a review of terms used in information theory, conventional communications systems are examined. Functional models that lead to a statistical impulse generator are developed for a neuron and a fish. The problems of information generation, reduction, and storage in man are considered. The concept of bidirectional communication is advanced where the receiver as well as the transmitter is active and the theory of bidirectional communication is shown to be a generalization of ShannonÂ´s information theory.

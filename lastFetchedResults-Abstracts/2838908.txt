This study proposed a bidirectional DC/DC converter with inductor attached at the output terminal to a output voltage. We developed n switched capacitors capable of multiple outputs ranging from 2 to n times the input voltage based on a fixed input voltage source during forward boost with output ranging from 1/2 to 1/n times the input voltage during reverse buck. The inductor was designed to work between continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) to enable the adjustment of output voltage as 2+D times input voltage. Finally, the analysis of waveform simulations verified the experimental results, which presented a maximum efficiency rate of 93.3% and average conversion rate of approximately 90%.

The idea of the test chip experiments started in ITC 1991 (McCluskey and Tseng, 2000). We wanted to get actual tester data that would answer some questions about manufacturing test of digital ICs. The objective was to find out the relative effectiveness of different test techniques, such as stuck fault tests, delay tests, IDDq, etc. The test chips are Murphy, ELF35, ELF18, and ELF13.

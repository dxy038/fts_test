An ultra-wideband (UWB) planar antenna optimized by a newly developed Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm- Jumping Genes Genetic Algorithm (JGGA) is proposed. The optimization procedure aims at finding an antenna not only with low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) and small size, but also with stable radiation pattern over the wide band. There are five objective functions and they are based on VSWR, antenna size, radiation pattern and gain. Both the simulated and measured results are given and they agree well with each other.

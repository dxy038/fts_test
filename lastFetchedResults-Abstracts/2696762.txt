Hybrid flowshop scheduling problems include the generalization of flowshops with parallel machines in some stages. Hybrid flowshop scheduling problems are known to be NP-hard. Hence, researchers have proposed many heuristics and metaheuristic algorithms to tackle such challenging tasks. In this letter, a recently developed discrete firefly algorithm is extended to solve hybrid flowshop scheduling problems with two objectives. Makespan and mean flow time are the objective functions considered. Computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms many other metaheuristics in the literature.

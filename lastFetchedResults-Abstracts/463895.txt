OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional status of patients with hyperemesis gravidarum and the effect of a treatment regimen administered during hospitalization.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a descriptive, controlled study of 20 patients with hyperemesis gravidarum whose nutritional status was assessed and compared with that of 20 pregnant, nonvomiting matched controls. Blood nutrient status was reassessed after 10 days of treatment with an intravenous saline solution containing a multivitamin preparation and again at day 20.
RESULTS: Mean dietary intake of most nutrients fell below 50% of the recommended dietary allowances and differed significantly (p< 0.01) from that of controls. More than 60% of the patients had suboptimal biochemical status of thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin A, and retinol-binding protein. Vitamin C, calcium, albumin, hematocrit, and hemoglobin values were significantly higher in those patients where the duration of vomiting had been longer, suggesting the presence of dehydration. Treatment was associated with cessation of vomiting and improvement in blood nutrient status. Pregnancy outcome was favorable in all patients.
CONCLUSION: The hyperemetic pregnant patient is at nutritional risk; prompt initiation of corrective therapy is recommended.

Introduction: Road traffic crashes are the main cause of trauma mortality in most of world countries especially Iran. The objective of this study is to evaluate RTC mortality and morbidity in the last 10years (1997-2006).
Methods:
Data were obtained from Iran official reports of police, health sources and the Statistical Centre of Iran (SCI). These data include population, registered motor-vehicles number, RTC, RTC injuries and deaths, during the period of 1997-2006. Statistical analysis was performed by Stata 8 software and significance of mortality change was evaluated by Poison distribution. Results: RTC fatalities increased between 22.1 (95%CI, 21.7-22.4) per 100,000 and 40.5 (95%CI, 40.1-41.0) per100,000 from 1997 to 2005, but in the last year of 2006, this trend is reversed and there was declined to 39.1 (95%CI, 38.7-39.6) per 100,000. RTC injuries has been increased from 110 to 401 per 100000 population from 1997 to 2005, but decreased to the 393 per 100000 in 2006. Conclusion: This paper shows road traffic crashes mortality and morbidity in Iran in recent ten years and the decrease in the last year. This decline was most probably the result of a variety of interventions, including legislation, police enforcement, improvements in traffic and transport, health care facilities and media and public education. It is recommended that efforts of all responsible organizations continue in unique leadership.

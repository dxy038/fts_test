Objective
In this study, we investigated the changes of the serum levels of thyroidhormones including Thyroxine (T4), Triiodothyronine (T3), T3 resin uptake andThyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in epileptic children during treatment withanti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) including carbamazepine (CBZ), primidone (PRM),phenobarbital and valproic acid (VPA).
Materials and Methods

This study consisted of four case-series comparisons, was conducted on 115epileptic children (37 girls and 78 boys with an age range between 2 monthsand 15 years, mean: 62.06 Â± 44.97 months). These children were divided into4 groups who took either phenobarbital (n=29), PRM (n=28), CBZ (n=29), orVPA (n=29) for 3 months. Thyroid hormone levels (T3, T3 resin uptake, T4 andTSH) were measured at the beginning and three months after starting the study.
Results

At first, all patients were euthyroid and there were no clinical or laboratoryfindings suggestive of hypothyroidism. Regarding thyroid hormones before andafter the administration of phenobarbital, carbamazepine, valproic acid andprimidone, there were no significant changes in serum T3, T4, T3 resin uptakeand TSH levels.
Conclusion

Our findings showed that short term therapy with phenobarbital, carbamazepine,valproic acid and primidone had no effect on thyroid function etsts.

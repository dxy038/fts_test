Soils around mining sites play a significant role in the transport and control of heavy metals in the
environment. Therefore, understanding the adsorption properties of soil is essential in solving
pollution problems. The objective of this paper was to study Zn(II) adsorption onto Sarcheshmeh
copper mine soils. The adsorption isotherms of Zn(II) were studied. The Langmuir isotherm indicated
an excellent fit for the experimental data in comparison with other isotherms. The capacity of Zn(II)
adsorption was assessed by distribution coefficient for samples (SA and SE), such that, the SA sample
showed high Kd values. Also, the amounts of Zn(II) adsorbed onto the soil decreased with increase in
the initial concentration. The results of this study show that soils around mine can play an effective
role in decreasing Zn(II) contamination.

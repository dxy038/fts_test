Objective: Evaluation of intra-abdominal pressure during different stages of pregnancy, before and after feeding in pregnant ewes with single and multiple lambs.
Design: Experimental field study.
Animals: Seven parous ewes.
Procedure: At the end of the second month of gestation, a balloon was made from condom was inserted into the pelvic cavity through a posterior mid-line laparotomy. Intra-abdominal pressure recorded on days 90, 120, 135 and 143 of pregnancy by infusion of 4ml of physiological saline into the balloon connected to a transducer and a pressure recorder.
Statistical analysis: Data from different stages were compared using Student " tÂ° test.
Results: The results indicated that, at each stage of pregnancy the intra-abdominal pressure before feeding was higher than that after feeding and in ewes with single lambs, it was higher than in ewes with multiple lambs.
Clinical implications: It has been postulated that increased intraabdominal pressure associated with increased rumen fill and the presence of multiple lambs are involved in the pathogenesis of cervical-vaginal prolapse. Although in this study, intra-abdominal pressure decreased after feeding and in multiple pregnancy. Therefore feeding and multiple pregnancy, not only can not increase intraabdominal pressure, but also it can not be a pathogenesis of cervical-vaginal prolapsc.

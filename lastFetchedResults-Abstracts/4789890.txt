Impulse radio (IR) Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) has gained great interest recently for indoor location and tracking applications. Due to its high bandwidth and short pulses length, UWB potentially allows great accuracy in range measurements based on time of arrival (TOA) estimation. There are many different techniques that have been proposed for UWB localization; however they usually have big errors in non line of sight (NLOS) conditions. The objective of this paper is to propose a TOA estimation algorithm that permits precise self-localization of mobile vehicles in indoor environments with obstructed line of sight. This paper presents a wavelet cyclic cross-correlation strategy for time of arrival estimation based on dynamic threshold selection, with multi source reference identification. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reaches good accuracy in NLOS situations and allows position estimation at low frequency bands.

We propose a multi-objective Pareto-optimal technique using Genetic Algorithm (GA) for group communication, which determines a min-cost multicast tree satisfying end-to-end delay, jitter, packet loss rate and blocking probability constraints. The model incorporates a fuzzy-based selection technique for initialization of Quality of Service (QoS) parameter values at each instance of multicasting. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm satisfies on-demand QoS requirements (like high availability, good load balancing and fault-tolerance) made by the hosts in varying topology and bursty data traffic in multimedia communication networks.

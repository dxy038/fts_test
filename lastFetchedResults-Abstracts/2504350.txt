Background: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of AZF
(Azoospermia Factor) microdeletions of the Y chromosome in infertile Turkish male
patients and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcome of these patients.
Objective: This study was undertaken in order to evaluate the outcome of intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI) in infertil man with AZF microdeletions
Materials and Methods: We evaluated 348 azoospermic and oligozoospermic patients
retrospectively. Fourty of these patients had various types of AZF microdeletions. These
patients had non-obstructive severe oligoasthenospermia or azoospermia with normal
karyotype. Azoospermic patients underwent testicular sperm extraction and aspiration
(TESE, TESA). Then ICSI was performed to patients who had testicular sperm or
ejeculat.
Results: Fourty patients with AZF microdeletion were evaluated in this study. No
spermium could be found in 27 patients. Three of these patients had only AZFa
microdeletion, three had AZFb microdeletion, three had AZF (b+c), six had AZF
(a+b+c) and 12 patients had AZFc microdeletion. Only two of all patients achieved a
pregnancy and both had only AZFc microdeletion.
Conclusion: AZFc microdeletions have a better prognosis for achieving spermium in
ejaculate or TESE, TESA materials.

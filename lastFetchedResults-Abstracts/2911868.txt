Using a compound-valued logic, a logical architecture is introduced for representing fuzzy cognitive maps and for modeling knowledge acquisition in adaptive bidirectional associative memories. The excitatory, neutral, and inhibitory values of causal relations provide an effective paradigm for knowledge acquisition and processing. The main contribution is a NPN (negative-positive-neutral) calculus that is used as a logical inference engine.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

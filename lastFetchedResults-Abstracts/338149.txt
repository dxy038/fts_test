Objective
A fusion protein made of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO), referred to as MEN 11303, has been tested for biologic activity using mobilized CD34+ cells.
Methods and Results
MEN 11303 and a combination of GM-CSF/EPO produced the same amount of colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), of burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), and of multipotent CFU-mixed. After 15 days, liquid cultures of CD34+ cells exposed to MEN 11303 yielded a total cell number larger than that obtained with an equimolar mixture of GM-CSF and EPO, with a clear prevalence of cells exhibiting an erythroid phenotype. A colony-forming cell assay established from CD34+ cells precultured with MEN 11303 for 7 days yielded a greater amount of BFU-E than GM-CSF/EPO combination. Exposing CD34+ cells to MEN 11303 for 7 days in liquid culture resulted in higher recoveries of cells expressing a comparatively less differentiated hematopoietic phenotype and of long-term culture initiating cells. A cell-based binding-competition assay using the human EPO-receptor (EPO-R) transfected murine Ba/F3EPOR cell line showed that MEN 11303 bound to EPO-R with a sixfold lower affinity but induced a more sustained receptor phosphorylation. MEN 11303 supported the growth of Ba/F3EPOR cells more efficiently than EPO and remained detectable in the spent culture medium for a longer time.
Conclusion
MEN 11303 and the combination of GM-CSF/EPO are equally potent in recruiting hematopoietic progenitors into cycle, but the fusion protein is superior in promoting the expansion of committed erythroid percursors. Primitive hematopoiesis is less affected by MEN110303 than GM-CSF/EPO combination. Part of these effects may reflect the peculiar interaction of the EPO moiety of MEN 11303 with the EPO-R.

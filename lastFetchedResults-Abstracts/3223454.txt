In this contribution, the measurements of intra-body radio propagation channel are conducted at carrier frequencies 433 MHz, 900MHz and 2.4GHz with bandwidth of 2 MHz for different persons. The objective is to find unique propagation characteristics which can be used as fingerprints for personal authentication. The experiment results obtained demonstrate that the distribution of the fading coefficients of the intra-body channels, as well as the power frequency spectra exhibit distinguishable features which can be used to authenticate person´s identity. The measurements also illustrate that by using the reference fingerprints in terms of power frequency spectra, the correct identification probability can be maintained at the level above 98% in a short time. Furthermore, it is discovered that the validity of reference fingerprints is more sensitive to the clothes that a person wears than to the displacement of scatterers in the environments and slight changes of the person´s posture.

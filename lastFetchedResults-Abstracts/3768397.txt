This paper introduces the concept of an integrated instrumentation environment (IIE) for multiprocessors. The primary objective of such an environment is to assist the user in the process of experimentation. The emphasis in an IIE is on experiment management (including stimulus generation, monitoring, data collection and analysis), rather than on techniques for program development as in conventional programming environments. We believe the functionality of the two environments should eventually be provided in one comprehensive environment.

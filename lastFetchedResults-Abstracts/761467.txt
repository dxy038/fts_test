An attempt has been made towards the synthesis of strongly adherent poly(2,5-dimethylaniline)
coatings on low carbon steel substrates, with an objective of examining the possibility of using
this polymer for corrosion protection of steel in chloride environment. In this work, the
poly(2,5-dimethylaniline) coatings were synthesized by electrochemical polymerization of
2,5-dimethylaniline using sodium salicylate as a supporting electrolyte. The characterization of
these coatings was carried out by cyclic voltammetry, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results of these
characterizations indicate that the aqueous salicylate solution is a suitable medium for the
electrochemical polymerization of 2,5-dimethylaniline to generate strongly adherent and
smooth poly(2,5-dimethylaniline) coatings on low carbon steel substrates. The performance of
poly(2,5-dimethylaniline) as protective coating against corrosion of low carbon steel in aqueous
3% NaCl was assessed by the open circuit potential and the potentiodynamic polarization
measurements. The potentiodynamic polarization measurement reveals that the
poly(2,5-dimethylaniline) coating increases the corrosion potential and reduces the corrosion
rate of low carbon steel almost by a factor of 50. This study clearly ascertains that the
poly(2,5-dimethylaniline) has outstanding capability to protect low carbon steel against
corrosion in chloride environment. C   2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

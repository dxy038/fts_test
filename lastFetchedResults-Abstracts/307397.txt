Objective
To evaluate 13C-NMR spectroscopy as a method for fat quantitation in human feces without time consuming or unpleasant preparation steps.
Design and Methods:
Stool samples of seven healthy subjects were collected for 18 days before and during oral intake of the inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases Orlistat. Fecal lipid content was determined first using 13C-NMR, then by conventional gravimetry after homogenization and Bligh & Dyer lipid extraction.
Results:
The correlation between gravimetry and 13C-NMR was excellent (R2 = 0.91). In repeated measurements, the mean percentage error was 2.8%. On average, 13C-NMR yielded 1.27 g less fat than gravimetry. Orlistat efficacy for fat excretion assessed by 13C-NMR and by gravimetry was 34.3% and 33.9%, respectively.
Conclusions:
With a total measurement time of three minutes, 13C-NMR spectroscopy of unprocessed whole stool provides an accurate alternative to gravimetry for assessing total fecal fat excretion. 13C-NMR is superior with regard to practicability and speed.

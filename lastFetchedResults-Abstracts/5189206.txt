In this paper, we present a new look at the sensing-throughput tradeoff problem. Distinguishing with the previous work, the throughput in our paper is defined as the number of data bits per second received correctly rather than the achievable rate. This choice facilitates the investigation on optimizing throughput for a frame based wireless data transmission scheme from a general point of view. Our objective is to maximize the cognitive radio (CR) throughput under the constraint of the preset detection probability threshold. We investigate the behaviors of the throughput under the situations with and without cooperative spectrum sensing and propose efficient algorithms in both cases for the throughput maximization. Numerical results show that the throughput obtained by our proposed algorithms achieve the optimal performance.

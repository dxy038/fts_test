We describe a new algorithm WFG for calculating hypervolume exactly. WFG is based on the recently-described observation that the exclusive hypervolume of a point <i>p</i> relative to a set <i>S</i> is equal to the difference between the inclusive hypervolume of <i>p</i> and the hypervolume of <i>S</i> with each point limited by the objective values in <i>p</i>. WFG applies this technique iteratively over a set to calculate its hypervolume. Experiments show that WFG is substantially faster (in five or more objectives) than all previously-described algorithms that calculate hypervolume exactly.

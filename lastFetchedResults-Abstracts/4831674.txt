As the wireless technology becomes more and more prevalent, the demand for it in the enterprise world grows to be more evident. The main objective of this test-bed environment research is to create a comprehensive and integrated WiMAX and Wi-Fi network and investigate the effects of WiMAX QOS routines on the throughput and delay time in the system. We implemented the entire network environment and tried to provide analysis for the outcomes. We were able to successfully implement our integrated WiMAX - Wi-Fi system and experiment with variety of Quality of Service (QoS) scenarios. The numerical results obtained with help of a commercial network analyzer Tool (PRTG) confirms that expected outcomes for effectiveness of the QoS routines defined in the proposed WiMAX architecture are met.

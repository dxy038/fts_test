In order to solve optimal technical and economic allocation of distributed generation in distribution network, a multi-objective nonlinear optimization model is built considering the uncertainty of the type, location and capacity of distributed generation. The sub-objectives in this model include the least investment cost, the highest earning, the highest environment benefits and the least loss in distribution network. Interval numbers are used to deal with the uncertainty of the property values and their weights in the actual decision-making of DG optimal allocation. A method combined by TOPSIS algorithm based on interval mathematics and genetic algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve that model. Taking a typical distribution network as a test example, the result shows the validity and practicability of the proposed method.

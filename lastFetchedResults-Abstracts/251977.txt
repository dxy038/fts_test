On an experimental apparatus designed to measure the directional spectral
emissivity of semitransparent materials at high temperature (2000Â°C), a specific
optical device (kaleidoscope) is mouInted in order to homogenize the energy
distribution of a CO2 laser beam, which is used as a heating source. An objective
of this work, for operating in the best conditions, is to obtain a uniform
temperature of the tested sample. This study, based on Fourier optics, focuses
on a square aperture kaleidoscope. A model was developed to simulate the
energy distribution of the laser beam, at any transverse plane on the optical
path. The final objective is to simulate the energy distribution on the sample
surface to optimize the homogenization device taking into account the surface
temperature gradient induced by the local energy distribution. To validate this
model, quantitative comparisons of theoretical simulations and experimental
thermal spots are performed.

Proposes a dynamic load-balancing technique for a video-on-demand (VOD) server system which is responsible for transmitting video stream data to a clientÂ´s set-top box (STB), and shows the result from a VOD system designed to incorporate our proposed load-balancing scheme. Our load-balancing technique is an application of the extended gradient model, in which we modify and update the control parameters and extend the 2D load map to 3D [we call this the &#8220;workload distribution surface&#8221; (WDS)], taking into consideration the operational factors of the VOD service, such as the quality of service (QoS). The objective is to use the power of the VOD server efficiently, so that we can enhance the performance of the server and build a VOD server system which provides many more services with good quality to subscribers

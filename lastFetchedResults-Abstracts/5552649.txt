The southwestern region of China is in karst areas, in which the geological structure is very complex, and it is extremely difficult to build the tunnel when the engineering experience in such long-distance karst is lack. The author introduced some kinds of membership functions in brief and listed the impact factors of the negative effects of groundwater environment in tunnel project to make subordinative fuzzy function. The objective of this paper is to ensure whether the risk of tunnel construction in karst areas can be evaluated and reduced by using fuzzy method. Based on MATLAB Software Platform, relying on the tunneling of Dian-Ling highway in Tongluo Mountain, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of tunneling engineering has been realized. The conclusion shows that the comprehensive evaluation is scientific in the application for tunneling engineering and relevant membership function depends more on experience of experts.

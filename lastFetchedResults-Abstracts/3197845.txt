The challenge of recreating a green belt (hedgerow, forest, green corridors ...) is to restore biodiversity that the ecological continuity required. A coherent ecological network allows species to move, interact, and continue to support human being. The main objective of this paper is to explore the potential of image processing methods to map hedgerows, corridors, woodlands of the green belt. We present a methodology based on unsupervised and supervised classification, segmentation and classification fusion. It is applied to a rural landscape and several sensors: Very High and High Resolution, optical and radar satellite, respectively FORMOSAT-2 (8m) SPOT 5 (2.5m and 10m) and TerraSar-X (3m).

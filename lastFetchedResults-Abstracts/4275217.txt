A linear network of intelligent sensors is examined. The objective is to solve a computational problem in a minimal amount of time. The sensors in the networks can be equipped either with front-end processors for communication off-loading or without front-end processors. The cases of equal division of processing load and optimal division of processing load are discussed for both the network with front-end processors and the network without front-end processors. An example of the inclusion of the solution time, the time taken for sensors to report the solution back to originator, is also presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The paper aims to initiate work towards a universal standard to ease the problems associated with the shortage of frequencies. This will also create opportunities for those who are the fortunate owners of frequencies. An objective is to propose a protocol which is suitable for as many users and applications as possible, and for a wide heterogeneity of radio equipment. The paper proposes a protocol layer between the application and the IP layers in the radio units. The protocol has a `client-to-client´ part, for mutual coordination between radio clients in an overlay network, and a `client-to-database´ part, for coordination with a central database.

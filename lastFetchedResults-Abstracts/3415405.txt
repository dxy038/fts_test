Obtaining infrared (IR) surface-temperature measurements of miniature square targets on the order of 1.6 mm with a spatial resolution of 15 &#956;m has recently become possible using the Barnes Engineering Computherm system, but the accuracy and precision of the measurements have been limited. The objective of the present work is to provide a calibration procedure that will improve the accuracy and precision of the two-dimensional temperature measurement. A method of measuring surface temperatures on semiconductor surfaces using subminiature syringe thermocouples to remove the emissivity calculation error is described. Accuracy is further improved by numerically removing the estimated system distortion from the radiance scan image. The precision of the IR microscope is improved by averaging scans to minimize the random noise. Investigations into defining and correcting the distortions and noise have improved the accuracy on precisely controlled black-body sources to &#177;0.025&#176;C and the precision to &#177;0.03&#176;C

Background and Objective: White MTA, and Portland cement
have similar chemical structures. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the inflammatory reaction of rabbit bone tissues to
implanted white MTA, and Portland cement.
Subjects and Methods: In this in vivo study, twenty 1-year old
male Iranian rabbits (experiment white Specie), were divided
into 5 groups (4 in each group). After preparation of 3 holes
(distance 2 cm- depth and diameter 2 mm) in tibia, the allocated
groups received an intra-bony implant of the test materials
(White MTA, or Portland cement) and the third hole, with no
implant, was created to evaluate inflammatory reaction related
to surgical trauma. Samples were processed for histological
study after 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days. Furthermore, blood
samples were taken for evaluation of systemic inflammation for
ESR test. The results were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and
Mannâ€“Whitney tests.
Results: At similar time points, statistical analysis revealed
significant difference between implanted material (white MTA ,
Portland cement) in the first and second holes with control hole
due to bone tissue reaction but pair-wise evaluation Between all
of implanted material found no significant differences. In
different times bone tissue reaction showed significant
differences.
Conclusions: The finding of this study demonstrated a similar
tissue compatibility between both implantable materials and
improvement of tissue healing occur with similar time profile
after material implanting.

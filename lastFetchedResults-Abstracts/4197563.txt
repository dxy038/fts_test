Sensing deployment is an important issue addressed in wireless sensor network (WSN). This paper proposes a virtual force directed co-evolutionary particle swarm optimization (VFCPSO) algorithm, which uses a combined objective function to achieve the tradeoff of coverage and energy consumption. By considering deployment as an optimization problem, VFCPSO is more reliable and flexible for WSN, since it can satisfy the combined requirements instead of only enlarging coverage. Because centralized VFCPSO is computation-expensive for WSN, a distributed VFCPSO (D-VFCPSO) is proposed by achieving optimization with the collaboration of multiple sensor nodes. Simulation results show that the D-VFCPSO has the better performance than VF-style algorithms and centralized VFCPSO in the terms of time cost and deployment results. It is obvious that the proposed D-VFCPSO can rapidly and effectively achieve the sensing deployment in WSN.

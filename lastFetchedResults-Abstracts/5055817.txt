Objective To study the function of the rennin-angiotensin-aldoterone system(RAAS) under high altitude hypoxia environment and objective to investigate the effects of high altitude hypoxia on the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2(ACE2) Genetics polymorphisms. Methods Forty male adult Sprague Dawley(SD) rats, under high altitude hypoxia environment were divided randomly into 4 groups: the control group(D group, Xi´an area 5m above sea leve1), the 1-day hypoxia group, the 2-day hypoxia group and the 3-day hypoxia group. To move the standardized healthy male SD rats to high altitude environment 1d brings up Qinghai Gelmu (height above sea level 2700m ) and 2d to bring up Tibet tangula( height above sea level 5000m ) and 3d Tibet Naqu when 3 experimentals group animals from plain(5m above sea leve1). and use radiating immunity law ( RAI ) is ascertained by measuring great rat plasma the concentration of PRA, AT II, ALD in 4 groups. ACE2 Genetics polymorphisms were measured by PCR-RLFP. Results PRA AT II content in serum increased and ALD content descended in high altitude hypoxia (P &lt;; 0.01). ACE2´s electrophoresis is to display three kinds of passages compose separately in the interest of GG, AA and AG. The great rat of plain gos into tall height above sea level area queen, and ACE2´s genotype is GG´s, plasma PRA. The content remarkbly moves upward, and ALD´s content obviously drops (P&lt;;0.01). ACE2´s genotype is AA´s, plasma PRA 2. The content moves upward , and ALD´s content drops (P&lt;;0.05). ACE2´s genotype is AG´s, plasma PRA, ALD changes unobvious (P&gt;;0.05) Conclusion RAAS and ACE2 genetics GG, AA is concerned with acclimatization hige altitude hypoxia environment and have import.

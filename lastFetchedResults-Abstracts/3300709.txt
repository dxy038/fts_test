The objective of this study is the discrimination and characterization of different lung cancer monoline cells using statistical analysis of polarimetric backscattered signals. The main aspect of this study is the use of the WelchÂ´s t-test and the p-value statistics as a representative metric for discriminating distributions based on their mean and standard deviation. The outcome of this study indicates that enhanced discrimination of lung cancer samples can be obtained based on their t-test values between different cancer samples for different geometries.

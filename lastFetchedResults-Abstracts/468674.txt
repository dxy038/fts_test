OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively midtrimester homocysteine concentration levels for the prediction of superimposed preeclampsia in women with chronic hypertension.
STUDY DESIGN: Between March 1, 2000, and February 1, 2002, pregnancies that were complicated by chronic hypertension that required medication had homocysteine, vitamin B12, and folate concentrations measured between 16 and 20 weeks of gestation. All women received folate supplementation. An upper limit threshold for increased homocysteine was defined as the mean value plus 2 SDs.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven women were enrolled. Mean homocysteine concentration levels were 5.1±1.7 μmo/L for the 16 women who had preeclampsia compared with 4.7±1.3 μmo/L for the 41 women without preeclampsia (P = .56). Two of 16 women with preeclampsia (13%) had concentration levels that exceeded the 95th percentile (6.9 μmo/L) compared with 2 of 41 women (5%) without preeclampsia (P = .31). The sensitivity and specificity were 13% (95% CI, 1.6-38.3) and 95.1% (95% CI, 83.5-99.4), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Second-trimester homocysteine concentration levels were not helpful in the prediction of preeclampsia in chronically hypertensive women.

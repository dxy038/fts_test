High cost of noise barrier is usually caused by improper design parameters. Based on the road traffic noise prediction model, an optimized design method of L-shaped noise barrier used in reducing noise emission from traffic flow is presented, in which cost of noise barrier is chosen as objective function, the requirement of noise reduction as acoustic constraints, and design parameters are considered comprehensively. After compared with current design methods, the advantages of the new method in noise reduction and improvement in economic cost are verified. The vertical noise barrier is given to study the cost-effectiveness of L-shaped noise barrier, in term of the analysis, a choice of barrier type can be made by the method, and its results are instructive to the selection of the design parameters and shape of barrier.

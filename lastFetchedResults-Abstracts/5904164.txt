In this position paper, we set out to explore the possibilities of formulating problems in requirements engineering with concepts and frameworks from cybernetics. The objective is to seek practical synergies and to understand notable differences between the two areas. We try to understand to what extent known research results from cybernetics can be applied to address problems encountered at the requirements stage in software life cycle. In particular, we try to formulate the goal-oriented requirements analysis process as a feedback control system, in which a classical "divide and conquer" design philosophy is turned into a continuous augmentation process to existing design towards an optimal one. Similarly, control frameworks for the requirements elicitation process and requirements inconsistency management process are briefly explored. Potential control variables such as information entropy value for elicitation and quantitative measurements for inconsistencies are discussed.

The main theme of the present study is merciful breath from religious mystical perspective which raises many questions. Some of these questions are: is merciful breath a matter of personal taste or is it based on religious text? What is the main objective of discussing this concept in mystical works? What problems does the discussion of this top solve and what practical uses will it offer? The findings of the present paper indicate that what have appeared in the works of mystics in this field stem from religious texts and grate Sufi saints, relying on the verses of the Quran and Islamic traditions maintain that universal forms are manifested in the merciful breath. Indeed, the entire being (existence) is the expansion of this very divine mercy. The first existence that manifested from the Essence of the Almighty is called the First determination in brief status and is called merciful breath in detail status. Mystics maintain that the world of being (existence) was created on the basis of the merciful breath and is erected on that basis and hence the world is a form of the merciful breath. According to mystics, there are two kinds of manifestations of the Essence of Truth. The first manifestation is the essence of uniqueness. And the second is the status of the Essence which is called merciful breath. If Allah is the Truth Perfect, His mercy is the Beauty of Creation. 
Besides being the medium between appearance and inner being, the Merciful Breath if the source of all perfecting movements and hence the Divine mercy is expanding in the religious (lawgiving) and creation systems. This is the first principle of the basis of being (existence). Therefore, no attribute except this one can cause the survival and security of human beings.

Objective.
This study describes the total physical activity and the contribution of work to total physical activity among Dutch workers. The study was conducted in the Netherlands in the years 2000â€“2002.
Methods.

2,417 respondents of a cross-sectional survey representing the Dutch adult working population were included. Physical activity was measured by the proportion meeting the current public health physical activity recommendations and by total physical activity (in minutes per week). Seven occupational groups and 28 sectors were distinguished. Unadjusted analyses were carried out using chi-square test and one-way analysis of variance.
Results.

On average, 53.7% was sufficiently active according to the recommended levels. Work contributed for 30% to total physical activity. There were significant differences between the occupations and sectors in total physical activity levels as well as in the amount of work-related physical activity. Those in policy and higher executive functions were least active at work with work contributing for 19.5% to total physical activity, whereas those working in agricultural occupations were most active at work with work contributing for 55.1% to total physical activity.
Conclusions.

Work is still an important source of total physical activity among workers. Based on the differences observed, branch-specific strategies to enhance work-related physical activity are recommended.

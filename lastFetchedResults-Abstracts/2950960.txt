The purpose of this study is to improve a robust control strategy using frequency-shaped sliding surfaces. The control objective is the trajectory tracking of a flexible beam attached to a rigid hub. A compensator is introduced in sliding mode through a frequency-shaped performance index with prescribed degree of stability. This procedure yields desirably fast trajectory tracking without exciting the unmodelled dynamics (UD). It also offers a methodology to resolve this trade-off. Simulation results show that regarding the excitation of UD, the proposed control structure exhibits superior characteristics among peer sliding mode strategies

Based on the Index based Built-up Index (IBI) which was derived from soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and normalized Difference building Index (NDBI), information of urban land-use in Jinghui irrigation district were quickly and effectively extracted from three periods remote sensing images. According to the complexity in the spectroscopic properties of urban land-use, the relatively independent thematic index was chosen to compose bands, effectively extracted the urban land-use information from the remote sensing image. The research greatly improved the automated information extraction of urban land-use, and provided objective and accurate information for the study of human activities impact on hydro-ecological environment in irrigation districts.

The aim of this paper is to obtain efficient operation of the components in the series-parallel drivetrain in order to develop an optimal power distribution system. This will be done through the use of efficiency maps of the electric motor and the engine. Based on the information obtained about the speed and torque characteristics, the aim would be to operate the motor and the engine in a defined region of speed and torque. An added objective of the strategy is the capability to maximize the energy captured through regenerative braking. This technique will be demonstrated by simulating the power distribution for an actual driving cycle in order to obtain better understanding of the procedure and achieve realistic optimization.

Actually, interactivity is a key factor in the telecommunications sector, as the end user is who evaluates the content received through the transmission network or Internet. That is why several technologies were developed for digital television, both in Brazil and in Europe, in order to obtain more acceptance among the population, focusing on attracting more and more users. Having a large number and variety of programs available, such as TV shows, news, movies, games, apps, Internet and others; and the different technologies that allow decoding and access to all this information, comes the need to deploy a single platform that allows the use of Broadcast and Broadband platforms into a single technology, regardless of the parameters established in the countries with the highest technological development. Therefore, the objective of this work is to optimize a model that be adapted to the Brazilian Digital TV System (ISDB-Tb) with the European one (HbbTV), developing a technology that obtains greater interaction with the viewer, using broadcast channels and the Internet.

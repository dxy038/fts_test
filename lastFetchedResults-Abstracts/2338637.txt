In this paper, we present an improved version of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm known as SPEA, which has a high capability for solving problems defined in a large size space. We applied the algorithm to solve the problem of minimization of time-energy of orbital transfer, which often appears in space missions. The computational results show that the algorithm is valid and efficient.

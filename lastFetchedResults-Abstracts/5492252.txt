A hybrid mechanism is a configuration that combines the motions of two characteristically different electric motors by means of a mechanism to produce programmable output. Hybrid five bar mechanism is the most representative one of hybrid mechanism. In this paper, the kinematic analysis for a hybrid five-bar mechanism is introduced. An optimization design of hybrid actuator is performed with reference to kinematic objective function. By the use of the properties of global search of genetic algorithm (GA), an improved GA algorithm is proposed based on real-code. Optimum dimensions can be obtained by using the optimization method. Finally, a numerical example is carried out, and the simulation result shows that the optimization method is feasible and satisfactory in the design of hybrid actuator

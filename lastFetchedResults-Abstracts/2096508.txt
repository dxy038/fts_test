Macrophage inflammatory and immune functions were characterised in red deer (Cervus elaphus), for use as a model for natural infection with bovine tuberculosis. Highly enriched populations of deer macrophages were obtained from 14 day cultures of plastic-adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cervine macrophages produced superoxide anion in response to respiratory burst stimuli (serum-opsonised zymosan and phorbol myristic acetate), but nitric oxide production could not be detected under the conditions tested. The lysosomal enzymes acid phosphatase and lysozyme were detected at the intracellular and extracellular level. Stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide extract (Escherichia coli LPS) enhanced the production of superoxide and acid phosphatase, with a peak increase in activity observed after 2 h. Production of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), determined using cytokine-sensitive cell lines and mRNA analysis (Northern blotting), indicated maximal secretion of both cytokines after 24 h stimulation with LPS, preceded by a peak in message accumulation at 2â€“6 h post-stimulation. Cervine macrophages stimulated proliferative responses in T cell-enriched lymphocyte populations derived from the peripheral blood of autologous animals that had been primed to mycobacterial antigens (Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin, BCG). Macrophages were able to stimulate responses after pulsing with particulate (BCG) or soluble (purified protein derivative) mycobacterial antigens. These results indicate that macrophage inflammatory and immune responses in red deer are similar to those in other mammalian species, and that macrophages may play an important role in resistance to mycobacterial infection.

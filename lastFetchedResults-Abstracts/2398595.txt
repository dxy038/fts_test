Objective
tudy is aimed to investigate the effects of triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) on expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in cultured murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.
s
NA gene expression analysis of COX-2 and iNOS, RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to TEGDMA and HEMA, and mRNA of each gene was observed by using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The Western blotting method was applied for detection of COX-2 and iNOS proteins extracted from RAW 264.7 cells treated with the resin monomers. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was quantified by immunoassay with commercially available ELISA kits.
s
 and HEMA induced the expression of COX-2 mRNA dose-dependently in RAW 264.7 cells. The expression of COX-2 mRNA was up-regulated at 5 h of exposure to both TEGDMA and HEMA, and diminished thereafter. The resin monomers did not affect the expression of iNOS mRNA. Up-regulation of COX-2 protein was confirmed in the cells treated with TEGDMA and HEMA. Production of PGE2 was also enhanced by TEGDMA. However, HEMA did not affect PGE2 biosynthesis, although HEMA up-regulated the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein.
icance
findings suggest that TEGDMA and HEMA can be a critical factor of inflammation related to resin-based dental biomaterials, and that COX-2 is involved in the inflammatory reaction of the resin monomers.

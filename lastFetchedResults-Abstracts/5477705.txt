On 12<sup>th</sup>, January, 2005, the National Department has approved Beijing´s new city plan (2004-2020) , in which there is a remarkable change of the capital´s developing direction, i.e. building a residential city for more than 18 million population. We had made 8000 questionnaires during the summer of 2005, and we also had built a database in GIS, and based on the subjective evaluations of the local people´s, we have calculated the primary results of 100 questions in each questionnaire. By the comprehensive processing of the data and the results, we can concluded that there are some favorable regions in Beijing City´s now, mostly are around the 4 main circle roads of urban, and along the main rivers and waters in the city, for the new city plan has decided to develop the new satellite city in the sub-urban, and these traditional less developing areas are now becoming the hot spots in the coming years. At last, we construct GIS spatial database for the analysis of Beijing´s inner spatial residential environment, and its affects on the living style and daily behavior of local citizens. And our research objective was meant to put forward some useful proposals for the capital city´s construction and the theory of China´s building harmony society.

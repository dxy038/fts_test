Intelligent control approaches for smart low voltage (LV) grids have to meet the future requirements caused by increasing penetration of decentralized generation (DG) from renewable sources and new network participators like electric vehicles. These technical requirements can be solved, but especially in LV networks it is necessary to consider the cost benefit ratio. This paper will therefore focus on active control approaches investigated within the research project &#8220;DG DemoNet - Smart LV Grid&#8221;. By using an existing Smart Grid metering infrastructure and pursuing the long-term objective of a &#8220;plug&amp;automate&#8221; solution, the mentioned challenges should be solved with acceptable costs regarding investment, maintenance and operation. In this paper the proposed control concepts for the transformerÂ´s on-load-tap-changer (OLTC) are in detail discussed along with first experiences from simulations of some of these concepts.

The main objective was to study steel fiberÂ´s effect to improve the seismic performance of concrete columns under Low Cyclic. The axial compressive ratio of all columns was 0.11, and the shear span ratio was 3. Through the low cyclic loading test of steel fiber reinforced concrete components that steel fiber were added at the volume fractions of 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%. The cracking and damage process of the specimens were studied. The failure patterns and hysteretic behavior of column specimens with different steel fiber volume fractions were analyzed. The test results indicated: the performances of reinforced concrete such as ductility and energy dissipation have been strengthened by steel fiber, but not increasing with fiber content. When the admixture of 1.5% the seismic performance of column specimens to achieve optimal.

Abstract:
Objective 
Behavioral interventions such as relaxation training and biofeedback are some 
of the most effective interventions for management of migraine headaches. In 
this study we evaluated the utility of biofeedback-assisted progressive muscle 
relaxation training (PRT) in the treatment of migraine. 
Materials and Methods 
In this prospective study, twenty patients (12-18 years old) with a confirmed 
diagnosis of migraine headache, admitted to the Talie counseling center between 
March 2005 and December 2005, were evaluated; they were randomly 
assigned into an experimental group receiving biofeedback-assisted PRT and a 
control group in waiting list. All patients recorded the intensity of the headache 
and its frequency and duration before and 12 weeks after the treatment. 
Results 
The data was analyzed using Independent sample t-test for mean differences. 
In the biofeedback-assisted progressive muscle relaxation trained group, a 
statistically and clinically significant decrease was detected in intensity (p <  
0.001; mean difference 31.7; SD=1.86), frequency (mean difference = 4.4; 
SD = 1.58), and duration (mean difference 3.55; SD=1.32) of headaches 
Conclusion
It can be concluded that biofeedback-assisted progressive muscle relaxation 
training is a successful form of therapy in treatment of migraine.

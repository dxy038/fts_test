Objective: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has a broad range of molecules and neurotrophic factors essential for neurogenesis. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into the cells with neural-like phenotype under the induction of appropriate growth factors. According to the significant role of retinoic acid (RA) in neurogenesis, this study aims to differentiate BMSCs into neuron-like cells using CSF, RA, and the combination of CSF and RA.
Methods: Rat BMSCs were isolated and characterized. The CSF was prepared from the cisterna magna of 19-day-old Wistar rat embryos. The BMSCs were induced by either 5% CSF (CSF group), 10-6 ÂµM RA (RA group), or CSF plus RA (CSR group) for 12 days. Morphology of differentiated cells was examined by inverted microscope and axonal outgrowth measured using Image J software. In addition, the expression of neural-specific markers (Nestin and MAP-2) was examined by immunocytochemistry.
Results: We observed specific-neuronal morphology in the differentiated cells. The maximum axon length was seen in the CSR group on the 12th day of induction. Immunocytochemistry results showed that the neural progenitor marker (Nestin) was expressed in all treated groups. However, MAP-2, as a mature neural marker, was only expressed in the CSR group.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that CSF accompanied RA lead to differentiation of cells with neuronal and glial phenotypes from BMSCs in vitro.

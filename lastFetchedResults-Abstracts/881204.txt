One of the main purposes of outdoor recreation management is to provide high quality of recreational chances and measuring tourism social carrying capacity is a managerial tool to achieve this objective. Besides, social carrying capacity is closely associated with ‘perceived crowding” by visitors. A review of literature in outdoor recreation suggests that when resource social carrying capacity is violated, crowding occurs; crowding causes visitors’ experience quality to decline and as a result resource utility decreases. Since no research in Iran has been directed at variables influencing visitors’ perceived crowding, the purpose of this study was to identify and prioritize these variables. To achieve this goal, a field study was conducted in 2011 Norouz Holliday at Margoon Waterfall using visitor’s questionnaire. Study sample were chosen from domestic tourists visiting Margoon Waterfall. Descriptive-inferential statistics were used for the analysis.  Results from 273 questionnaires analyzed, showed that 4 variables contribute to visitors’ perceived crowding at Margoon Waterfall respectively: expectation from number of others, lack of  parking space, other visitors’ behavior, lack of picnic space. In addition, there were statically significant difference between perceived crowding and location at site.

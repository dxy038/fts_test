In this paper, we propose to develop a methodology that assesses the efficiency of educational lifecycle processes by applying the generic assessment framework of ISO/IEC 15504-2 to ISO/IEC 19796-1. Its purpose is to determine to what extent the education lifecycle processes exist in an organization, and to measure their maturity level. We want to propose this methodology to assess the strength and weakness of the learning services providers, and/or to benchmark their progress in their improvement project. The methodology will provide a framework to assess education lifecycle process in a standard, objective, and repeatable way. It will explain how to realize an education lifecycle process performance and maturity assessment in all its steps.

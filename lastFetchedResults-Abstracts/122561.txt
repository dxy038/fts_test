Objective:Phonological Awareness (PA) is a extra linguistic
skill and defined as individual awareness of constituent's
sounds of the word . This skill is a prerequisites of learning
to Read. Many researchers suggested reciprocal relation
between PA and Reading. This research determined level of
PA-fundamental ability of reading-in normal first grade femal students of Isfahan & shahinshar to compare two current method of Reading that are used in educational system of Iran.
Materials &methods:The method used in this research is cross-
sectional, descriptive-analytic and was done by 106 first grade
female students who were normal and selected randomly in
Isfahan & shahinshar cities. 51 students had teached by phonetic
method and rest of them had teached by whole word method. The
selection way of children was: this children had not any articulation ,vision, reading , learning and cranial nerve disorders and this children investigated by Phonological Awareness test. scores of children by test calculated and this scores analyzed by t-test in Spss software.
Results:The mean score of phonological awareness in phonetic method was 51.98 and in whole word method was 57.46.There was a significant differences between them in their scores (p-0.047). In addition,within subtests of phonological awareness task,mean score of first phoneme omission in whole word method was 4.84 and in phonetic method was 3.33.There was a significant difference between them in their scores(p=0.001).
In the rest of subtests was no significant difference between them. Conclusion :Based on this study, a significant correlation could be found in Phonological Awareness between both group and in other hand, there was a significant correlation between scores of first phoneme omission in both groups (Whole word and Phonetic method).Based on importance of phonological awareness as a
predictor of reading, we suggest more research in this outline must be done.

The objective was to determine, relative to animals expressing their full potential for carcass growth, the impact on meat quality of increasing carcass growth of grazing steers by supplementing with concentrates or by increasing grass supply. Sixty-six continental (Limousin and Charolais) crossbred steers (567 kg) were assigned to one of six diets: (1) 18 kg grass dry matter (DM); (2) 18 kg grass DM grass and 2.5 kg concentrate; (3) 18 kg grass DM and 5 kg concentrate; (4) 6 kg grass DM and 5 kg concentrate; (5) 12 kg grass DM and 2.5 kg concentrate; or (6) concentrates daily. Animals were slaughtered after an average of 95 days. Samples of the M. longissmus dorsi (LD) were collected at the 8–9th rib interface and subjected to sensory analysis and to other assessments of quality following 2, 7, or 14 days aging. Carcass weight gain averaged 360, 631, 727, 617, 551 and 809 g/day for treatments 1 to 6, respectively. There was no difference between diets for colour, Warner–Bratzler shear force (WBSF) or any sensory attribute of the LD. WBSF was negatively correlated with (P&lt;0.05) carcass growth rate (−0.31) but only a small proportion of the variation in meat quality between animals could be attributed to diet pre-slaughter or carcass fatness. It is concluded that high carcass growth can be achieved on a grass-based diet without a deleterious effect on meat quality.

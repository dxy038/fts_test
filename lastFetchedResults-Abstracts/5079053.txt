How to persue the best development effects and economic benefits by a reasonable number of wells in oil field development process is a very important issue. Filtration of preponderant oil reserve is significant for enhancing oil recovery and saving economic cost. Oilfield development is a gradual process. The best block will be usually aimed for the first objective of development. However, quality of oil reserve involves many factors and it is very difficult to make decision. So fuzzy evaluation method is used for filtration of preponderant oil reserve in this paper. The research classified static and dynamic parameters and made program of the fuzzy evaluation method. Through analysis of oil field examples, the results showed that: this method can easily distinguish high and low level of oil reserves to meet the requirements of oil field applications.

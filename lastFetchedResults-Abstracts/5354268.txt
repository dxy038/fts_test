Network-on-chip (NoC) has been proposed as an alternate to wired communication frameworks of System-on-chip (SoC) design. Application specific SoC design requires custom NoC architectures, which may not be regular but are more suitable for a particular application. This paper presents a genetic algorithm for synthesis of custom NoC architectures for applications having IP cores with varying communication bandwidth requirements. The optimization objective of the technique is to improve communication load and energy distributions across the network subject to the resource constraints in such a way that the overall efficiency in terms of throughput and communication latency improves. Experimental results show that customized irregular NoC clearly outperforms the traditional regular mesh architecture in terms performance.

In the 191h century, one of the most salient differences between the
traditional Iranian values and the Western capitalist tendencies is
manifested in the approaches taken by Britain and Iran toward the
abolition of slavery in the Persian Gulf.
In this period, the abolition of the ancient practice of the trade in
African slaves in the Persian Gulf became the focus of, what was only in
appearance, the humanitarian and the liberation endeavors of a power like
Britain. In the long run, however, the issue placed Iran under pressure to
the point that it constantly found itself having to alternate between
inclination and disinclination-inclination for wanting to uphold the
traditional values, and disinclination for standing against the hegemonic
ambitions of the foreign powers.
Beyond the scope of this article, other elements, too, like the
persistent rivalry between Britain, Russia and France. were instrumental
in forcing the Ghajarid Government to respond positively to their shortand
long-term requests. In time, the Ghajarid submission to such precepts
strengthened the position of Britain allowing it to realize its fundamental
objective-the gradual penetration into the Persian Gulf.

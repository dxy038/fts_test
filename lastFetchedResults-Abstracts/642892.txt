Objective
Glutamine is one of the most abundant amino acids found in maternal milk, and its concentration increases throughout lactation. Because glutamine is essential for macrophage functionality, it is hereby suggested that early weaning in conjunction with the absence of glutamine consumption impairs the functioning of macrophages, which could in turn be reversed with an in vitro supplementation with glutamine.
Methods

Swiss Webster mice were early weaned at 14 d of age (EW group) or at 21 d of age (control group, n = 8 per group). The EW group was fed a glutamine-free diet from days 14 to 21 of life.
Results

Mice in the EW group presented a significant decrease in plasma and muscle concentrations of glutamine and an increase in the activity of glutamine synthetase in the muscle. Peritoneal macrophages obtained from animals in the EW group presented a significant increase in the production of interleukin (IL)-10 and a significant decrease in the synthesis of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, nitric oxide, and hydrogen peroxide and in their ability to adhere, spread, phagocytize, and kill fungi. Glutamine in vitro supplementation reversed the decrease in IL-6, nitric oxide, and hydrogen peroxide synthesis and the decrease in the capacity to adhere, spread, and phagocytize in animals of the EW group.
Conclusion

These new data may imply that a lack of glutamine intake in early weaned mice hampers the functioning of peritoneal macrophages.

Modern distribution grids are rapidly evolving toward complex systems (Smart Grids) due to the increasing level of penetration of distributed energy systems and information and communication technologies. In this context, Power Quality (PQ) becomes an important concern and advanced technical solutions to PQ problems are needed. The waveform distortions are one of the most important PQ disturbances and active filters are considered an useful technical solution to this disturbance. This paper deals with multi-converter distribution systems and formulates the problem of siting and sizing of active filters as a multi-objective optimization problem. The problem includes also the control strategies of the active compensators among the problem variables. A heuristic simplified approach based on a trade-off analysis is proposed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem with the aim of minimizing several objectives while meeting proper equality and inequality constraints. The proposed approach is applied to a 17-busbars distribution test system giving evidence of its effectiveness.

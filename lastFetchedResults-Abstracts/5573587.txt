A fundamental aspect of software product quality is the possibility of measuring. Therefore, measurement applied to the software product and processes has become a need, even in the smallest organizations where agile methodologies are applied. The objective of this paper is to describe a proposal of a hybrid measurement process for the ISO/IEC 15504-ISO/IEC 12207:2008 standards and CMMI Dev 1.3 model in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The hybrid process was obtained through the definition of a cluster of tasks valid in both models. The motivation and viability of having hybrid processes in small organizations is analyzed. Besides, the use of hybrid processes as basic processes that are able to be fitted in similar processes in differents quality models and standards is discussed. Moreover, the definition of hybrid processes in order to provide a support in the creation of processes compatible in different models and standards is included.

In this paper, we study the problem of global asymptotic stability for a class of bidirectional associative memory neural networks with distributed delays and nonlinear impulsive operators. We establish stability criteria by employing Lyapunov functions and the Razumikhin technique. These results can easily be used to design and verify globally stable networks. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

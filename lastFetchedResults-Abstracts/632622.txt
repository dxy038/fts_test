This study explored the salience and predictive value of the identity dimension of acculturation among 351
Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union in the United States. Whereas bidirectional acculturation
models consider only two identities—ethnic identification with the culture of origin (Russian) and identification
as a member of one’s new society (American)—this study broadens the examination of identity to
include a third component—Jewish identity. Jewish identitywas found to be the most salient of the three but
predicted only one of the aspects of psychological adjustment—alienation. Findings underscore the need for
the acculturation field to incorporate the possibility of more than two cultures into the explanatory framework
and to examine the extent to which ethnocultural identities are contextually bound.

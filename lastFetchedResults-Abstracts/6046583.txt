Fault tolerance has become an increasingly interesting topic in the last decade where the automation has become more complex. A trend towards more autonomic control systems also drives the interest for fault tolerance. In mass produced industrial systems the unit costs is a paramount issue. Hence cheap fault tolerant control using analytical redundancy has become an important industrial research area. The objective is to provide solutions that provide fault tolerance to the most frequent occurring faults and thereby reduce the costs of handling the faults. This paper describes the diverse nature of requirements and approaches to fault tolerant control of induction motor drives

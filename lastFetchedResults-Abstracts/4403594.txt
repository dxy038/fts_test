Based on amplify-and-forward bidirectional relay multi-antenna system, in order to improve the bit-error-rate performance of OFDM wireless systems, a practical precoding algorithm is proposed for single user pair. Using MSE and Lagrangian function, precoding matrices are jointly optimized and quantified. The precoding matrix indexes are fed back to source and relay nodes with reduced feedback. Simulations indicate the effectiveness of the proposed reduced feedback. The proposed method can improve bit-error-rate performance comparative contrast to existing algorithm. It obtains the better error rate performance as well as reduced precoding feedback.

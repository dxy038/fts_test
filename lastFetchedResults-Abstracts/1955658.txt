The objective of the present investigation deals with optimization of l-lactic acid production from Zizyphus oenophlia, a potential low cost substrate. Central composite design (CCD) based on response surface methodology (RSM) was employed as a statistical tool to investigate the effect of substrate: media ratio, temperature, pH and inoculum volume on lactic acid production. Under optimum condition, the experimental yield was 95.09%, which matched well with the predictive yield of 95.45%. HPLC and circular dichroism (CD) analysis of the fermented product was carried out to confirm the presence of lactic acid in its L (+) seriospecificity respectively. For application of lactic acid in biotechnological sector polymerization studies were carried out. The PLA upon recovery through direct polycondensation reaction resulted in the yield of 85%.

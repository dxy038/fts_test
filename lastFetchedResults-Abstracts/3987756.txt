Efficient utilization of radio resources in wireless networks is crucial and has been investigated extensively. This letter considers a wireless relay network where multiple user pairs conduct bidirectional communications via multiple relays based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. The joint optimization of channel and relay assignment, including subcarrier pairing, subcarrier allocation as well as relay selection, for total throughput maximization is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. Using a graph theoretical approach, we solve the problem optimally in polynomial time by transforming it into a maximum weighted bipartite matching (MWBM) problem. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the network total throughput versus transmit power per node and the number of relay nodes.

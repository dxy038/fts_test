Objective: Childhood immunization programs have been suggested as an infrastructure to deliver vitamin A supplements to children in developing countries. The effects of giving vitamin A, a potent immune enhancer, with measles immunization to nine-month-old infants is unknown.

s: A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial of vitamin A, 100 000 IU at the time of standard titer Schwarz measles immunization was conducted with nine-month-old infants in Bogor District, West Java, Indonesia. Antibody titers to measles were measured at baseline and one and six months following immunization.

s: 394 infants received measles immunization, and 37 infants (9.4%) had baseline antibody titers &gt; 1:120, which is consistent with previous natural measles infection. Of the remaining infants, 98.8% seroconverted to measles, and 99.3% had titers consistent with protection against measles six months postimmunization. Seroconversion rates were similar in vitamin A and placebo treatment groups.

sion: High dose vitamin A supplementation can be given without reducing seroconversion to standard titer Schwarz measles immunization in nine-month-old infants.

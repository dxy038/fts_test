A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) aggregator is an agent between the power grid and plug-in hybrid electrical vehicles (PHEVs). This paper studies the coordinated charging control of a V2G aggregator, which aims at minimizing the charging cost and reducing the power losses incurred by the fluctuating load. On one hand, a lower cost of charging gives the owners of PHEVs an incentive to cooperate. On the other hand, with an increasing popularity of PHEVs, the impact on the power grid such as power losses should be of concern to the aggregator. As an inherent property of a V2G aggregator, we enable bidirectional electric power flows between PHEVs and the power grid. Given the planned schedules of all the vehicles that are managed by an aggregator, we formulate the coordinated charging control as a dynamic programming problem. Due to the curse of dimensionality, we apply an approximate dynamic programming approach, which reduces the dimensionality of both state space and control space, to obtain the control sequences. We conduct simulations given the 24-hour schedules of 100 vehicles. Simulation results show that coordinated charging control can reduce both the total cost of charging and power losses significantly, compared with the scheme where each vehicle starts charging as soon as it is connected to the grid.

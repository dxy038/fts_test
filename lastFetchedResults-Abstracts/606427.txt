The Pacific Island Countries constantly struggle with the challenges of high petroleum dependence for their
electricity production and lack of adequate energy services. It is possible to alleviate the energy poverty by utilizing
abundant renewable energy resources available in the region. The objective of this work is to investigate the
feasibility of a wind/solar photovoltaic/diesel generator-based hybrid power system in a remote location in Fiji
islands. We used the Hybrid Optimisation Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) software to simulate the system
and perform system optimisation analysis. The system characteristics were studied in terms of optimal
configuration, net present cost and the cost of energy. An entirely renewable energy-based configuration is feasible
if 10% annual capacity shortage is allowed, while for a scenario with no capacity shortage, addition of a diesel
generator is necessary. The addition of renewable energy components results in greenhouse gas reduction which
could be used for carbon trading.

For real-world problems, the task of decision-makers is to identify a solution that can satisfy a set of performance criteria, which are often in conflict with each other. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms tend to focus on obtaining a family of solutions that represent the trade-offs between the criteria; however ultimately a single solution must be selected. This need has driven a requirement to incorporate decision-maker preference models into such algorithms - a technique that is very common in the wider field of multiple criteria decision making. This paper reviews techniques which have combined evolutionary multi-objective optimization and multiple criteria decision making. Three classes of hybrid techniques are presented: a posteriori, a priori, and interactive, including methods used to model the decision-makers preferences and example algorithms for each category. To encourage future research directions, a commentary on the remaining issues within this research area is also provided.

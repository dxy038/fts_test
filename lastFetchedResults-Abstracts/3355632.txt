Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is increasingly becoming an important facilitator of effective and efficient delivery of services in higher education institutions (HEIs). The introduction of open, distance and e-learning (ODEL) mode of study has made it necessary for academic libraries to incorporate computer-based information systems (CBIS) in order to facilitate easier access to information for learning, teaching and research to all library users. To meet this objective, HEIs need to put in place measures of securing these systems. This study investigated the security measures employed by selected academic libraries in Kenya. The specific objective of this paper is to address the physical measures used by academic libraries to secure their CBIS. Data was collected through observation and interviews and was analyzed, interpreted and presented using qualitative methods. Results revealed the libraries studied had taken several physical measures to protect their CBIS. Suggestions for further research are discussed.

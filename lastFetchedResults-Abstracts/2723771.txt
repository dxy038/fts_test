Sharpness is an important quality attribute influencing image quality. Existing sharpness assessment models have not given sufficient consideration to the human visual system, especially the human luminance masking effect. On the basis of an isotropic local contrast model, an objective perceptual sharpness assessment model is proposed combined with the human luminance masking effect. Experimental results show that the proposed perceptual sharpness metric provides better predictions than four existing sharpness metrics and can evaluate image perceptual sharpness effectively.

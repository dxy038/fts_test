The TEAM benchmark problem 22 is an important optimization problem in electromagnetic design, which can be formulated as a constrained mono-objective problem or a multiobjective one with two objectives. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective version with three objectives, whose third objective is related to the quench constraint and the better use of the superconducting material. The formulation proposed yields results that provide new alternatives to the designer. We solved the formulation proposed using the multiobjective clonal selection algorithm. After that, we selected a particular solution using a simple decision making procedure

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is an emerging area of research. With the increase in applications for sensor networks, managing sensed data volume, monitoring wireless sensor node's health, data manipulation and representation presents a variety of challenges and has become a vital component of sensor networks. In this critical context visualization is a key issue to develop and operate these networks. The objective of this contribution is to present a detailed survey on various data visualization tools available for WSNs. In this contribution total 19 data visualization tools are presented that is especially designed and developed for Wireless sensor Networks.

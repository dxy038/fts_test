Objective (s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of Sexual Quality of Life-Male (SQOL-M) questionnaire. 
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, using a standard translation technique, the English version of the SQOL-M was translated into Persian language. Validity of the questionnaire was assessed by content validity, construct validity, convergent and known groups validity. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was calculated to assess the internal consistency and test-retest reliability was conducted to estimate the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
Results: The exploratory factor analysis confirmed a one-factor solution with good item-total correlations. Convergent validity showed satisfactory correlation between the international index of erectile function (IIEF) and its subscales with the SQOL-M. The known groups validly discriminated between men with and without erectile dysfunction (p < 0.001). Reliability evaluation was demonstrated excellent internal consistency and test–retest reliability (Cronbach’s alpha and ICC were 0.94 and 0.95 respectively). 
Conclusion: The results showed that the Persian version of SQOL-M instrument had a good structural characteristic and it is a valid and reliable tool for measuring the male sexual quality of life.

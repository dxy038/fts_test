Objective: Our purpose was to compare the functional roles of oxytocin in term and preterm labor in rats by both biochemical and pharmacologic means. Study Design: We determined the myometrial oxytocin receptor density and the maternal plasma concentrations of oxytocin and progesterone on gestational days 18, 20, and 22 (morning) and at the onset of delivery (day 22 afternoon) in rats with labor at term and at the onset of delivery (day 20 afternoon) in rats in preterm labor induced by the combined use of bilateral ovariectomy and estradiol injection. We also evaluated the effects of an oxytocin antagonist, L-366,509, on the initiation of both term and preterm labor. Results: The number of tritiated oxytocin binding sites in myometrial membranes rapidly increased on gestational day 22 (morning) in rats with term labor. Plasma progesterone level decreased in an inverse fashion. A rapid increase in circulating oxytocin concentration was observed at the onset of delivery in rats in labor at term. Both the plasma oxytocin concentration and the receptor density had the same values in rats with preterm labor as in rats with term labor. L-366,509 delayed the initiation of labor in rats with term and preterm labor in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: It is confirmed biochemically and pharmacologically that oxytocin plays an important role in the initiation of both term and preterm labor in rats. The oxytocin antagonist examined was able to delay term and preterm labor, so it might prove useful in clinical practice for the treatment of preterm labor. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:621-7.)

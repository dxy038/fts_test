As a new approach, intelligent speed adaptation (ISA) systems are being developed to provide drivers with assistance for controlling their driving speeds. In this study, ISA impacts were investigated through micro-simulation. The simulation results show that ISA has positive impacts on safety in terms of reducing speeds and speed variations. Applying ISA can harmonizing vehicle speeds between and within lanes, which results in reductions of the number of lane changes and short time-to-collision events. However, journey times could be increased because of speed decreases. This is part of the work of STARDUST, an EU project aimed at assessing the extent to which advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated vehicle guidance (AVG) systems can contribute to sustainable urban development. The main objective of this simulation study was to assess what impacts intelligent speed adaptation (ISA) have on traffic performances.

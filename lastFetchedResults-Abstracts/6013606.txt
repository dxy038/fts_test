Based on the initial achievements made in Internet of Things, the hierarchical model of learning assessment will be constructed, applying both quantitative and non-quantitative evaluation standards, extracting key information that influences learning efficiency through data mining technique, formulating the weight of evaluation standards through analytic hierarchy process, diminishing the anthropogenic factors, so that a comprehensive, integrated and objective evaluation result of studentsÂ´ learning can be concluded by way of analytic hierarchy process.

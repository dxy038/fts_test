An analysis and design of variable double-band hysteresis current controller for single-phase full-bridge bidirectional converters are presented in this paper. A variable double-band hysteresis is applied into bidirectional converter current controllers in order to improve dynamic response and reduce switching losses by increasing the switching frequency when inverter output current is relatively low and decreasing the switching frequency when inverter output current is relatively high without sacrificing the harmonic content of the AC side current. The experimental result shows the proposed variable double-band hysteresis current controller has a better average efficiency than the fixed one.

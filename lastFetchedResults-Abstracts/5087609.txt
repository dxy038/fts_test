In order to reduce the transportation risk of hazardous materials, the route optimization method is adopted. A mathematical model for the problem related to multi-objective route optimization of hazmat transportation with time-windows constraints and time-varying attributes is firstly established. Based on equivalently converting the proposed model into a static multi-objective shortest route problem resorted to the space-time network techniques, an dynamic labeling algorithm which can solves the model and generates all non-dominated routes is then developed. Finally, an example is taken for analyzing the practicability of them. The test shows that they have better operability in solving such complexity problem, which can provide technical support to decision-making of the government authorities and the hazmat transportation enterprises.

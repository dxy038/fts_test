This paper presents the application of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Finite Element Method (FEM) for optimal design of a High Temperature Superconducting Linear Induction Motor (HTS LIM). The design procedure is much different from that of traditional Linear Induction Motors (LIMs). First, the GA method is used to produce a series of optimal design data. The product of efficiency and power factor is taken as an objective function in order to maximize the product under a constant current drive; second, due to the new and unique structure the model of the motor using the optimal data should be analyzed with the finite element method in order to confirm the accuracy of the model. As a result, it is known that the novel method is very accurate as an HTS LIM optimization technique.

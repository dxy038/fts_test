Periodontal ligament is a thin layer of soft tissue that connects root of a tooth to
the surrounding alveolar bone. These ligaments play an important role in initiating
tooth movement when loads are applied to teeth with orthodontic appliances. The
majority of such soft tissues exhibit as viscoelastic bodies or have a time-dependent
behavior. Due to the viscoelastic behavior of the periodontal ligaments, the mechanical
properties are strongly affected by the loading history. Poisson’s ratios for the
viscoelastic materials are time-dependent (in time domain) or complex frequency-dependent
(in frequency domain) quantities. Moreover, three-dimensional stress fields
depend on these Poisson’s ratios. The main objective of this work was to develop a
mathematical approach capable of determining the time-dependent Poisson’s ratios of
the periodontal ligaments based on experimental data of stress relaxation and creep
tests. The resulting stress relaxation and creep curves are described by a three-parameter
viscoelastic models. The time-dependent Poisson’s ratios of the periodontal
ligaments have been obtained as increasing functions of time, because shear modulus
of these ligaments relaxes much more than their bulk modulus.

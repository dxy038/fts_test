Much is known about the performance of power connections as tested in the laboratory setting. Additional circumstantial evidence of connection performance exists in the form of analysis performed on failures throughout the history of overhead distribution networks. However, each of these methods do not provide a complete understanding of connector performance, as lab testing isolates the connection from other environmental factors, and field failures are most often not analyzed for frequency or root cause and are only performed on an extremely limited basis. The objective of this study was to determine the conditional state of various connection technologies under actual operating conditions and environmental exposure. The information gathered from this study will help to fill the void of connection technology performance between lab qualification tests and field failure. The survey included different connector technologies in side-by-side locations to gain insight into the degradation mechanisms acting on power connectors. This paper describes the field test methodologies incorporated to analyze connectors in overhead distribution applications, and outlines some early findings based on preliminary survey results that will assist the connection specification and application process.

Objectives
e, the production of highly durable dentine bonding is still a challenge. Self-healing bonding resins may provide a new direction for the improvement of the bonding durability. The objective of the current study was to synthesize polyurethane nanocapsules encapsulated with the core material triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) for use as a major component in a self-healing bonding resin.
s
 nanocapsules were synthesized via interfacial polycondensation in a miniemulsion, and the TEGDMA nanocapsules were then characterized via Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to investigate the morphology, the average TEGDMA loading (DL%), and encapsulation efficiency (EE%). The mechanical property of dental adhesive with different concentrations (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 wt%) of the TEGDMA nanocapsules were also measured, and the cytotoxicity was investigated using an MTT assay.
s
onfirmed that the TEGDMA nanocapsules were successfully synthesized. These nanocapsules showed a high drug load. The bond strength of the dental adhesive incorporated with 9 wt% TEGDMA nanocapsules was significantly higher compared with those of the other groups (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the biocompatibility of the dental adhesive was not affected by the incorporation of the TEGDMA nanocapsules.
sions
rrent study demonstrated the successful synthesis of TEGDMA nanocapsules, and the overall properties of the dental adhesive were not compromised.

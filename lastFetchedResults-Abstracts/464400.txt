OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the effect of hyperplasia on cell-to-cell communication in the microvasculature of the human endometrium. STUDY DESIGN: Ten biopsy specimens of simple and complex hyperplasia of the human endometrium were investigated by electron microscopy. RESULTS: The microvasculature of the hyperplastic endometrium shows morphologic disorder. The extracellular matrix is altered, and cell death is widespread. Intercellular contact is infrequent or absent. CONCLUSIONS: These results are in marked contrast to the ultrastructure of the normal microvasculature. The complex cell-to-cell interaction observed in normal tissue appears lost. This report, combined with others, indicates that cell-to-cell contact is sparse in hyperplastic endometrium.

Bluetooth technology has gained much attention and support from leading manufacturers. It is the first commercial ad hoc radio system to be used on a large scale that allows users to make effortless and instant communication between various communication devices, such as mobile phone and keyboard. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the impact of soft blocking interference in Bluetooth networks. Since individual packets hop independently and pseudo-randomly within the same bandwidth, collisions might occur. Analysis and simulation data illustrate the different throughput performance between both ACL and SCO connections. It has been shown that the number of slaves and piconets will impact on soft blocking. Packet loss occurs for both voice and data traffic.

The objective of this work is to investigate the micro-abrasion of Y-TZP in tea. This material is a candidate replacement in dental restoration and to date there has been very little work carried out to investigate the wear behaviour in oral cavity conditions. Various additions such as milk and sugar, which affect the solution viscosity and pH, were assessed as part of this work and the results were compared to the performance of the material in aqueous conditions. Wear maps were generated showing the change in wear rate as a function of applied load and exposure time.

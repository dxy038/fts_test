Objective
evalence of metabolic syndrome has been increasing worldwide, however its association with prostate cancer (CaP) is unclear. We reviewed patients undergoing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) to evaluate if those with metabolic syndrome had more aggressive disease.
als and methods
pective database of patients undergoing RARP between January 2005 and December 2008 (n = 2756) was queried for components of metabolic syndrome (BMI ≥30 and ≥2 of the following: hypertension, diabetes or elevated blood glucose, and dyslipidemia; n = 357). Patients with no components of metabolic syndrome were used as controls (n = 694). Biopsy and final pathology were compared between the 2 groups using all controls, and using best-matched controls (n = 357) based on greedy matching by propensity score.
s
ed with unmatched controls, metabolic syndrome patients had higher pathology Gleason grade (≥7: 78% vs. 64%, P &lt; 0.001) and higher pathologic stage (≥T3 disease: 43% vs. 31%, P &lt; 0.001). After controlling for confounders, those with metabolic syndrome when compared with best-matched controls had maintained the greater pathology Gleason grade (≥7: 78% vs. 64%, P &lt; 0.001) and pathologic stage (≥T3 disease: 43% vs. 32%, P &lt; 0.001). They also had significantly greater pathologic upgrading of Gleason grade 6 adenocarcinoma found on biopsy compared with best-matched controls (63% vs. 45%, P &lt; 0.001). On pathology, a 2-fold increase in Gleason 8 and greater was noted between patients with metabolic syndrome and best-matched controls (15% vs. 8%).
sions
controlling for confounders, patients with metabolic syndrome were found to have higher Gleason grade and tumor stage on final pathology and were more likely to have upgrading.

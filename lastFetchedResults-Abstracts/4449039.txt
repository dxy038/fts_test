This paper discusses two types of eWLB packages. One is extra-small package and second is Embedded Land Grid Array (eLGA) package. Although single die eWLB has been around for quite some time, processing of very small dies and packages can pose many challenges. In extra-small eWLB package, a single die is placed with a small gap from the package edge, encapsulated by mold compound and interconnected with redistributed layers (RDL) and solder balls. eLGA is a thinner package compared to conventional LGAs. The objective of this paper is to share test vehicle designs, challenges in processing, potential solutions, key processes, package level and board level reliability tests.

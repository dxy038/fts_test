The objective of this study is to develop a methodology capable of solving the problem of patients asthma. The study employs chemical evaluation in the pulmonary mechanisms. The measurements of the vital capacity of parameters of air flow are investigated. Spirometry tracings give a reliable indirect method of assessing the presence and severity of obstructive ventilatory defect. In addition, experiments on several patients were successfully made in the laboratory with X-ray imaging. The paper deals with the management of asthma and covers new treatment procedures on the basis of available evidences

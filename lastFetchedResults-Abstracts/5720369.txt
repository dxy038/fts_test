In this paper, an objective function consisting of generators, bus bars and lines vulnerability indices for optimal placement of facts devices including UPFC, SVC and TCSC has been presented. To calculate the vulnerability and network security indices, an appropriate model of mentioned devices to solve the load flow calculation is used. Also, in this paper, the optimal placement of facts devices has been done by two ways. In the first case, placement and installation of them is performed individually and in the next state the placement of these devices have been done simultaneously. For the case studies, IEEE 30-buses test system is selected and a UPFC, SVC and a TCSC are placed in the system simultaneously and non-simultaneously. Results show that these devices have better influences in the simultaneous placement mode than the non-simultaneous mode, and could improve voltage profile and network security margin.

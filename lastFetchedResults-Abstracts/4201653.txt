We are introducing in this article the Multicommodity Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP), where the objective is to deliver all the demands of different commodities by a tour that minimizes the sum of the fixed and variable costs for the selected arcs. The MTSP yields then a large scale mixed integer linear programming problem. In this article we devise a Lagrangean based heuristic approach to tackle this more general TSP variant.

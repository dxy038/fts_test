In this paper, we study the swarm-based coverage control problem for multi-agent systems where the main objective of a group of mobile agents is to explore a given compact region. We consider a group of coverage agents that move as a swarm in order to explore the given domain. Agents are deployed to uncovered regions via a swarming control scheme where a leader agent selects a target position in an uncovered region while all other agents are commanded to swarm around the leader agentÂ´s target position. In addition to the coverage objective, we design control inputs for collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and proximity maintenance.

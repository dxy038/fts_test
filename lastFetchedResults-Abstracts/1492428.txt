Although agricultural land management is known to affect near-surface soil physical quality (SPQ), the characteristics of these affects are poorly understood, and diagnostic SPQ indicators are not well-developed. The objective of this study was to measure a suite of potential SPQ indicators using intact soil cores and grab samples collected from the 0–10 cm depth of a clay loam soil with the treatments: (i) virgin soil (VS); (ii) long-term continuous bluegrass sod (BG); (iii) long-term maize (Zea mays L.)—soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation under no-tillage (NT); (iv) long-term maize–soybean rotation under mouldboard plough tillage (MP); (v) short-term (1–4 years) NT after long-term MP; (vi) short-term MP after long-term BG; (vii) short-term MP after long-term NT. Organic carbon content, dry bulk density, air capacity, relative water capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity appeared to be useful SPQ indicators because they were sensitive to land management, and proposed optimum or critical values are available in the literature. Soil macroporosity was also sensitive to land management, but optimum or critical values for this parameter are not yet established. Soil matrix porosity and plant-available water capacity did not respond substantially or consistently to changes in land management, and were thus not useful as SPQ indicators in this study. Converting long-term BG to MP caused overall SPQ to decline to levels similar to long-term MP within 3–4 years. Converting long-term NT to MP or vice versa caused only minor changes in overall SPQ. With respect to the measured SPQ indicators and their optimum or critical values, both VS and BG produced “good” overall SPQ in the near-surface soil, while long-term maize–soybean rotation under NT and MP produced equally “poor” SPQ.

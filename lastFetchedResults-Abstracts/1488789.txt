Rate and extent of postmortem metabolism control pork quality development. Our objective was to evaluate the role of the phosphagen system (phosphocreatine, PCr; and creatine, Cr) on metabolism and pork quality. Muscle PCr and Cr were manipulated by feeding pigs the creatine analogue, β-guanidinopropionic acid (β-GPA). In experiment 1, pigs received standard (control) diet or β-GPA supplemented (2%) diet (1 wk or 2 wk). Supplementation with β-GPA (2 wk) decreased total Cr (PCr + Cr; P = 0.02) and improved pork color (decreased reflectance, P = 0.003); however, β-GPA supplementation reduced growth performance (P = 0.007). To separate effects of phosphagen system and growth, a second experiment was conducted with control, pair-fed, and 2 wk β-GPA (1%) supplementation; pigs were also offered a control or β-GPA supplemented flavored beverage. Neither treatment influenced pork quality. Immediately postmortem, ATP/ADP was higher in control compared to pair-fed (P &lt; 0.05); subsequently, ATP/ADP was similar among all groups. Loss of the phosphagen system may lead to adaptive changes that promote conservation of cellular ATP.

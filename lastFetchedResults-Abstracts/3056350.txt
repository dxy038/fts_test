An objective no-reference measure is presented to assess line-structure image/video quality. It was designed to measure image/video quality for video surveillance applications, especially for background modeling and foreground object detection. The proposed measure using local statistics reflects image degradation well in terms of noise and blur. The experimental results on a background subtraction algorithm validate the usefulness of the proposed measure, by showing its correlation with the algorithmÂ´s performance.

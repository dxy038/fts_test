It is necessary to investigate detailed elastic property of human tissue as a foundation for developing objective and quantitative elasticity imaging (elastography). In this paper, we present our elasticity measurement method based on direct compression test for surgically-resected breast tissues. In addition, we discuss the feasibility of our approach to quantitative elastography by comparing the results of elastography obtained in vivo with those confirmed in direct compression test after extirpative surgery.

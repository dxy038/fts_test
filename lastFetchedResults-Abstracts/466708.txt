Objective: Middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity has been successfully used for timing the first cordocentesis in fetuses who are at risk for anemia because of maternal red cell alloimmunization. The effects on Doppler velocimetry after the intrauterine transfusion of adult blood to these fetuses are unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the applicability of Doppler methods for the prediction of severe anemia in fetuses who had undergone 1 previous intrauterine transfusion. Study Design: Doppler examination of middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity was performed before cordocentesis in 64 fetuses who had undergone 1 previous intrauterine transfusion. Timing of the second intrauterine transfusion was based on traditional criteria. Anemia was defined as mild (hemoglobin value between 0.84 and 0.65 multiples of the median), moderate (hemoglobin value <0.65-0.55 multiples of the median), and severe (hemoglobin value <0.55 multiples of the median). Receiver operator characteristic curves were created to select threshold values to identify the 3 degrees of anemia with a sensitivity of 100%. Results: Gestational age at the Doppler study ranged from 19 to 36 weeks. Forty-six fetuses (72%) were not or mildly anemic; 7 fetuses (11%) were moderately anemic, and 11 fetuses (17%) were severely anemic. Middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity for the prediction of severe, moderate, and mild anemia at a sensitivity of 100% showed false-positive rates of 6%, 37%, and 70%, respectively. Conclusion: In fetuses who have undergone 1 previous intrauterine transfusion because of maternal red cell alloimmunization, timing the second intrauterine transfusion can be determined noninvasively by Doppler ultrasonography on the basis of an increase in the peak velocity of systolic blood flow in the middle cerebral artery.

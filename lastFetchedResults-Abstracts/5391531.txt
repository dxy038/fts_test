The world of marketing has entered into a new arena, in which Internet dominancy, mass commoditization and anonymizaiton of products in virtual marketplaces have resulted in a perplexing situation for traditional paradigms of branding. In light of this phenomenon developing an excellent Internet-based brand is increasingly becoming a challenging endeavor. Although, over past years branding literature has been nourished with a remarkable amount of theoretical and empirical studies to investigate different dimensions of Internet branding but the debate of Internet branding has not been settled yet and subsequently i-branding is still a vague concept with theoretical ambiguities and conceptual shortcomings. Hence, Internet branding as an emerging field of inquiry suffers from a gap and so, requires more conceptual ingredients. Furthermore, very few investigations have been devoted to clarify the conceptual relationship between Internet marketing mix and Internet branding. In this sense it must be also noted that theoretically, brand as an intangible asset is built on a successful execution of marketing mix strategies, therefore, aligning marketing mix and branding strategies in an Internet environment not only provides an impetus for propelling i-branding towards a competitive edge but also unveils the latent aspects of the relationship between Internet marketing mix and conventional school of Internet branding. In this respect, the main objective of this study is to contribute to the body of knowledge in this sense by bridging the aforesaid gap. The method of investigation is literature survey and quantitative analysis.

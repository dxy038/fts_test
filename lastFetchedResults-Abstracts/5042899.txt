The objective of this paper is to present the exact solutions for instability control of piezolaminated thin steel sheet struts subjected to static and dynamic axial compressive forces. The electromechanical piezoelectric constitutive law derived by Tiersten is adopted. Solution for the actuation and control is derived from the basic principle of the imperfection approach considering geometric nonlinearity. Closed form solutions for static and dynamic control of piezolaminated struts are prescribed. The actuation and active control is demonstrated using PVDF smart materials laminated on thin steel sheet.

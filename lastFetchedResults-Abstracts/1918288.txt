This study was designed to evaluate weights of operatively-excised stenotic aortic valves and to compare them with age, sex, body mass index, and presence or absence of concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. Weights of operatively-excised stenotic aortic valves have not been previously reported. We weighed operatively-excised stenotic valves in 499 patients (aged 19 to 91 years, mean 70), none of whom had mitral valve replacement. The 499 aortic valves ranged in weight from 0.45 to 11.30 g (mean 2.67). The mean weights of the unicuspid and bicuspid valves were heavier than those of the tricuspid valves (4.36 vs 3.34 vs 2.04 g, p &lt;0.05). Mean valve weights were greater in the 304 men than in the 195 women (3.19 vs 1.87 g, p &lt;0.001), in the younger patients than in the older patients (3.13 g in patients â‰¤40 years old vs 2.89 g in patients 41 to 70 years old and 2.47 g in patients 71 to 91 years old, p &lt;0.05), and in the 230 patients who did not undergo simultaneous coronary artery bypass grafting compared with the 269 patients who had this additional procedure (2.94 vs 2.45 g, p &lt;0.001). The mean weights of the valves were similar in patients whose body mass index was &lt;25, 25 to 30, and &gt;30 kg/m2 (2.62 vs 2.76 vs 2.57 g). Weights of operatively-excised stenotic aortic valves provide objective evidence of valvular stenosis.

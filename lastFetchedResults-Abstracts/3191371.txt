Penetration levels of renewable resources on distribution systems are increasing due to the mandated programs and associated economic incentives. Therefore the effects of these interconnections on the systems will need to be studied and evaluated. This paperÂ´s concentration will be on voltage profile of a distribution system subject to high penetration levels of different renewable sources such as; photovoltaic and wind generation plants. The study will take into account different generation patterns for Photo Voltaic (PV) and wind generations. The model will consist of wind and PV units connected to three distinct loads. Simulation results addressing irregularities in wind patterns and various energy absorption levels of PV farms are presented. Functionality of suitable Volt-VAr options and possibility of controls using multi-objective optimization techniques have been proposed.

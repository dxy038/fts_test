An electric arc furnace is a load with a definite impact on the power system. Some of the impacts include harmonics, voltage flicker, and increased power system losses. The objective of this study was to develop a model for analysis of the electrical characteristics and electrical parameters affecting the behavior of an arc furnace load. The model developed, is based on steady state analysis, but, through further model refinement, dynamic analysis may be studied.

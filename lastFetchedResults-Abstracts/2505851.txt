<strong>Objective:</strong> The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Revised Cheek and Buss Shyness Scale (RCBS) using confirmatory factor analysis among (n = 300) college students.<br /><strong>Method:</strong> A total of 300 undergraduate students participated in this study And completed the Revised Cheek and Buss Shyness Scale (RCBS). A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test diagnosis as a unitary construct and to test an earlier-reported two-factor model.<strong><br />Results:</strong> Results indicated that unidimensional measurement model of the RCBS did not provide the best fit for the data. Then three measurement models were tested, and the results showed that a two-factor model taking into account differences in the direction of item wording provided a satisfactory and parsimonious fit to the data. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was used to better understand the factorial invariance of the scale across genders, and indicated that two-factor structure of the RCBS was equivalent across genders. Supplementary t-tests revealed no other gender differences on shyness.<strong><br />Conclusions:</strong> The results provide initial support for the construct validity of the self- report version of the RCBS in college students.

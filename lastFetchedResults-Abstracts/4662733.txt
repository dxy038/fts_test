This paper proposes client-centric fractional frequency reuse (CC-FFR) techniques for interference mitigation in OFDMA-based cellular wireless networks. In this framework, clients exploit their peer-to-peer connectivity to bargain for spectrum by exchanging channel quality indicator (CQI) metrics with the objective of jointly finding viable sub-channel allocations with low co-channel interference and high throughput. We analyze both the unconstrained case of greedily maximizing system capacity, as well as the fair case where optimization is performed subject to minimum rate constraints per user. Our numerical results, based on realistic channel propagation models and IEEE 802.16-based system parameters, show a promising performance gain that motivates to further investigate the potential of using user cooperation for co-channel interference mitigation.

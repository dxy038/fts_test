Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Myers-Briggs type inventory extraversion is associated with clinical evaluation ratings that students earn during their (obstetrics/gynecology) junior medical student clerkship.
Study design
The Myers-Briggs type inventory was administered to medical students during their obstetrics/gynec clerkship. Bivariate correlations between clinical evaluations, National Board of Medical Examiners subject scores, and data from the Myers-Briggs type inventory extraversion scale were analyzed.
Results
Pearson product-moment correlation between clinical and National Board of Medical Examiners subject scores was not significant (r = .25; P = .05). The National Board of Medical Examiners did not show significant correlations with the Myers-Briggs type inventory extraversion data. The clinical evaluations showed a significant correlation (r = .35; P = .005) with Myers-Briggs type inventory extraversion.
Conclusion
Results show that Myers-Briggs type inventory extraversion is correlated positively with clinical evaluations. The National Board of Medical Examiners subject examination and clinical evaluations were not correlated significantly. Findings question whether clinical evaluation data should be included in the obstetrics/gynecology medical student evaluation process.

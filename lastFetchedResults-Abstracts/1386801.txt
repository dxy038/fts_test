The objective of this study was to characterise the molecular epidemiology of Streptococcus zooepidemicus isolated from the respiratory tracts of 198 Thoroughbred racehorses based at three Newmarket training yards over a 10 month period. Typing utilised two separate PCR procedures targeting the M-like protein hypervariable and the 16Sâ€“23S RNA gene intergenic spacer regions of the bacterium. S. zooepidemicus, isolated from 23% (224/983) of study samples, comprised 24 different types of varying prevalence. The four most common types, A1HV4, A1HV2, C1HVu and D1HV1, accounted for 45% of all the typed isolates. Overall, the findings were similar to those reported in a study of Welsh Mountain ponies and confirm that in equids, S. zooepidemicus is not a homogeneous, clonal population but instead represents a wide diversity of strain types. This diversity also highlights potential difficulties in using vaccines to control S. zooepidemicus infections in horses as it is likely that the induction of a heterologous, cross-protective immunity will be required.

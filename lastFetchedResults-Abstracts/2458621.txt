Preparatory work on the EU advanced dual coolant (A-DC) blanket concept using SiCf/SiC flow channel inserts as electrical and thermal insulators has been carried out at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe in co-operation with CEA (SiCf/SiC composite-related issues) as a conceptual design proposal to the EU fusion power plant study planned to be launched in 2001 within the framework of the EU fusion programme having the main objective of specifying the characteristics of an attractive and viable commercial Dâ€“T fusion power plant. The basic principles and the study method for the A-DC blanket concept are presented in this report. The results of this study show that the A-DC blanket concept has a high potential for further development due to its high thermal efficiency and its simple concept solution.

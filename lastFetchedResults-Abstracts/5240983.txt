Given the cost involved in establishing an international business graduate school, the objective of this study is to evaluate the financial viability of starting an MBA program in a foreign location. In 2004, the University of Delaware in partnership with Flag International, LLC was awarded a contract to offer an MBA program in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Based on the experience gained in implementing this US AID project, this study develops a financial simulation model that can be used to evaluate the sustainability of foreign-based MBA programs. While the deterministic model indicates that the model may be a viable venture with minimal start-up costs, the results of the stochastic simulation indicate that significant risk does exist with the potential for significant negative returns if the venture is not managed properly.

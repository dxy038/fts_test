An ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) system has been used to deposit thick films of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-x</sub> on (100) LaAlO<sub>3</sub>. Nitrate precursors with a Y:Ba:Cu ratio of 1:2:0.6 have been used with a deposition temperature of 900&#176;C and annealing temperature of 500&#176;C. Growth rates as high as 1 &#956;m per minute have resulted in epitaxial growth of biaxially aligned (&lt;3&#176;), 3 &#956;m thick YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-x</sub> films, with typical endpoint T<sub>c</sub> of ~86 K and onset T<sub>c </sub> of ~91 K and J<sub>c</sub>, of &gt;10<sup>4</sup> A.cm<sup>-2 </sup>, 1 T, 77 K. It has been previously shown that lower nitrate precursor concentration, and hence decreased growth rate, has resulted in improved superconducting properties. The main objective of this paper is to investigated the effect of deposition temperature and post-annealing on the properties of the superconducting films

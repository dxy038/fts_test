Background: Decision making is inseparable from management and it is considered as base for decision making. Decision making has an important role in the strategic level. Thus, strategies, models and variety methods are established to help managers which decision making is one of them. 
Objective: There are different kinds of relations among the elements of decision making, particularly among criteria, for this purpose ANP method has proposed for involving all relations between elements of the problem. 
Method: ANP method is somehow sophisticated and time consuming that makes us to use softwares to solve the problems even a simple problem that often is concerned to strategist that needs a rapid reaction and less patience. The reason that strategies in most cases prefer AHP more than ANP in strategic situation is simplicity of the ANP posses in achieving to result but AHP doesnâ€™t consider the dependency of the criteria's which results to wasting opportunities and capital because of choosing inappropriate strategy. 
Results: The meta-heuristic proposed method in this paper is named SIMANP that with it's simple mechanism, high accuracy, fast giving result, less time consuming and satiety to software solves the network problems accurate and easily. 
Conclusion: The SIMANP method will endow strategists and strategy managers who need accuracy, simple and fast giving result with the advantages of ANP Compared with AHP.

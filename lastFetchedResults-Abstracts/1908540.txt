Purpose
size has been used as one of the criteria to stratify renal cell carcinoma (RCC) into different pathological stages (pT). The recent 2002 UICC/TNM classification of malignant epithelial renal tumors is modified to substratify pT1 RCC into pT1a (less than 4.0 cm) and pT1b (greater than 4.0 but less than 7.0 cm). In this study we ascertained if this stage modification has prognostic relevance.
als and Methods
l of 259 consecutive radical nephrectomy specimens of organ confined RCC from 1970 to 1997 at 1 institution, including 153 of conventional RCC (CRCC), 71 of papillary RCC, 28 of chromophobe RCC, 1 of collecting duct carcinoma and 6 of RCC not otherwise specified, with a mean clinical followup of 7.5 years (median 6.4) were included in the study.
s
were 115 pT1a (44.4%), 95 pT1b (36.7%) and 49 pT2 tumors (18.9%). Disease recurrences (DR) and disease specific death occurred in 2 (1.7%) and 0 cases (0%) of pT1a, 7 (7.3%) and 5 (5.3%) of pT1b, and 16 (32.6%) and 12 (24.5%) of pT2. DR for pT1b was higher compared with pT1a (all histological subtypes RR 3.68), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.106). If only CRCCs were analyzed, DR in the pT1b group was statistically higher compared with pT1a (RR 8.54, p = 0.047). Disease specific survival in pT1a could not be evaluated because no deaths occurred in this subgroup. DR and disease specific survival were significantly different between pT1b and pT2 tumors for all histological subtypes (RR 5.51, p = 0.001 and 5.49, p = 0.001) and for the CRCC subtype (RR 5.50, p = 0.001 and 5.18, p = 0.005, respectively). Using size as a continuous variable the logarithmic change in tumor size was a significant predictor of DR (RR 8.82, p = 0.001). All statistical analyses were adjusted for age and sex.
sions
ging RCC into pT1a and pT1b yields prognostically important information, validating the 2002 TNM modification for malignant renal epithelial malignancies. The substratification of pT1 is particularly useful in tumors with CRCC histology.

Energy issue is a critical problem for sustainable development. Both electrical grid, as the power supply network, and buildings, as major power consumers at demand side, can play important roles with optimal grid management and control. This paper presents an interactive building load management framework between smart grid and commercial buildings, with optimal setting for both supply and demand sides. A simplified building thermal model and kinds of indoor temperature control strategies are employed for estimating load management capability and aggregation load profile of buildings. Building operation cost function and simplified dynamic pricing algorithm are also developed for bidirectional interactions. Load alteration and shifting can be achieved by implementing the interactive load management strategy offering improved overall load factor of the grid.

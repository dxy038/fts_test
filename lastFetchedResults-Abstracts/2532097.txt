A four year long research programme divided into four phases has been designed for the first time to assess the combined Noise-Air quality and combined exposure to Noise-Air pollution at the curbside open-air microenvironment of Kolkata city, India. The results and the findings of the different phases of study had already been published. The objective of the review work is to fuse the findings of the different phases of studies; to identify the factor(s) influences the degree of correlation between concentration of the air pollutant(s) and traffic noise level at the microenvironment of the city. Incidence of moderate to very strong positive Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients between concentration of the air pollutant(s) and traffic noise level indicated chances of correlated exposure to these environmental stressors at the microenvironment of the city. Average combined Noise-Air quality and combined exposure to Noise-Air pollution of the microenvironment of the city was very poor (0.17) to fair (0.50) and poor (-0.06) to excellent (3.33) respectively. The best combined Noise-Air quality and the best level of combined exposure to Noise-Air pollution at the microenvironment of the city was prominently evidenced in after-noon, in summer and under variable road geometry. However, the worst combined Noise-Air quality and the worst level of combined exposure to Noise-Air pollution at the microenvironment of the city was prominently evidenced in evening, in winter and under constant road geometry. A principal component analysis revealed that intensity of wind determines the degree of correlation between the environmental stressors at the microenvironment.

Objective: It has been suggested that periodontal disease may be a risk factor for a number of multifactorial systemic conditions such as preterm deliveries. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between maternal periodontal disease and body size of newborns.
Methods: After controlling traditional risk factors for premature child birth and low birth weight. One-hundred eighty mothers were selected: 17 were periodontally healthy, 77 had gingivitis. 72 had initial periodontitis and 14 suffered from established periodontitis. These mothers and their newborns formed the study population, The body size consisting of weight, height, and head and chest circumference, were taken from newborns' hospital files, Findings: A decrease in the newborns' body size was observed as the mothers' periodontal disease severity increased. Birth weight, height, and head and chest circumference of babies born of mothers with established periodontal disease were significantly lower than those who were born of mothers with healthy periodontal condition, gingivitis and initial periodontal disease (P=0.006, P=0.016, P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). Conclusion: The data suggest that there is a considerable association between periodontal disease in pregnant women and body size of their newborns. this preliminary finding needs to
be confirmed in more extensive studies.

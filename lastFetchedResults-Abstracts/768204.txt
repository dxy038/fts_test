The high-temperature solid oxide fuel cell
(SOFC) is the most efficient and environmentally friendly
energy conversion technology to generate electricity from
fuels such as hydrogen and natural gas as compared to the
traditional thermal power generation plants. In the last
20â€“30 years, there has been significant progress in the
materials development and stack technologies in SOFC.
Among the electrode materials, lanthanum strontium
manganite (LSM) perovskites, till today, are the most
investigated and probably the most important electrode
materials in SOFCs. The objective of this article is to
review and update the development, understanding, and
achievements of the LSM-based materials in SOFC. The
structure, nonstoichiometry, defect model, and in particular
the relation between the microstructure, their properties
(electrical, thermal, mechanical, chemical, and interfacial),
and electrochemical performance and performance stability
are critically reviewed. Finally, challenges and prospects
of LSM-based materials as cathodes for intermediate and
low-temperature SOFCs are discussed

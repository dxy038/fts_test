Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the developmental outcome of neonatal survivors of hemolytic disease of the neonate treated with modern intrauterine transfusion techniques. Study Design: In this prospective, observational study, auditory evoked-response tests were performed in the nursery. Neurodevelopmental evaluation with the Gesell Developmental Schedules was performed between 9 and 18 months of corrected age to assess motor skills, language development, comprehension capacity, and social skills. The McCarthy Scales of Children’s Abilities were administered between 36 and 62 months. Results: Forty children who survived severe fetal hemolytic disease were followed up until 62 months old. Demographic data included gestational age at first intrauterine transfusion (26.4 ± 3.7 weeks), median number of intrauterine transfusions (4, range 1-8), lowest fetal hematocrit (20.2%± 7.8%), peak fetal bilirubin (7.1 ± 2.1 mg/dL), incidence of hydrops fetalis (45%),and mean gestational age at delivery (35.6 ± 2.2 weeks). One case of severe bilateral deafness and 1 case of right spastic hemiplegia were diagnosed. The Gesell Developmental Schedules score was assessed between 9 and 18 months of corrected age in 22 infants. The global developmental quotient was 101.9 ± 9.5 (mean for normal population is 100). Regression analysis revealed no correlation between the global developmental quotient and gestational age at the first intrauterine transfusion, gestational age at birth, or the severity of the fetal hemolytic disease (fetal hematocrit, fetal bilirubin, presence of hydrops fetalis, total number of intrauterine transfusions, duration of neonatal phototherapy, and number of neonatal exchange transfusions). Eleven of the 40 children were followed up until they were 62 months old, and the McCarthy Scales of Children’s Abilities were administered. The mean cognitive index was 107.6 ± 9.4 (90-109 is considered average). Conclusion: Despite severe fetal hemolytic disease, normal developmental outcome can be expected for children treated with intrauterine transfusions. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:858-63.)

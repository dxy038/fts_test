The increasing complexity of the systems that monitor and control a modern power grid require of the power engineer and system operator a correspondingly greater fundamental understanding of phenomena occurring in the system from a system point of view. With the objective of giving the engineer and operator this increased understanding, the Energy Systems Research Center is now in the process of constructing a model electric power system coupled with a commercially available Energy Management System control center. The combination of EMS and realistic power system model make this a unique laboratory in which can be performed studies in stability, system control, power system load modeling, etc. The paper gives an overview of the design of the realistically scaled down, three phase model power system, and itÂ´s integration with the EMS control center. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the laboratory is to be used.

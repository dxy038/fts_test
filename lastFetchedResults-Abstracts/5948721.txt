This paper introduces the essential features of structural equation model (SEM) and grey system and analyzes the feasibility of evaluating work stress by combining SEM with grey system. Based on the requirements of the research approach and the research objective, an initial model (M<sub>1</sub>) is constructed for the evaluation of college teacherspsila work stress after the relevant researches have been reviewed. 86 and 165 questionnaires are collected respectively from two colleges at different levels. Then SEM is applied to conduct confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the questionnaire data with the constructed model, and two desirable models are obtained. The comparison of the two desirable models shows that there are differences in the measuring scales while evaluating work stress in universities at different levels. Finally, grey system is used to evaluate the intensity of college teacherspsila work stress.

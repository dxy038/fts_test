Two major players are active in determining the development of environmental policies: the government and ‘‘the public.’’ These
diverse players have intrinsic limitations and are often driven by different agenda, different aims, and different means. Therefore,
inconsistent actions and lack of a clear agenda and action plan characterize the environmental policy. There is an essential role for a third
player, namely, a team that is as professional and as objective as possible. The Samuel Neaman Institute (SNI) has taken it upon itself to
serve as this third party, and has been providing the scientific background needed to develop and propose a rational and environmental
set of priorities for Israel since 1998.
In this paper, we evaluate the contribution of the SNI to environmental policy making in Israel. We shall determine the relationship
between the recommendations and suggestions presented by SNIand the subsequent actions adopted by the various authorities. A very
clear advantage of the activity described here is that it serves as a bridge connecting scientists and other professionals to the general
public, and raises awareness of the practical and political problems that need to be solved in order to maintain proper environmental
quality in the country and the community.

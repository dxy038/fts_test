The success of eliminating the disease Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) depends on the detection capabilities of medical organizations. In Malaysia, the government hospitals perform the major part of this particular task. An important ingredient of the diagnostic process in government hospital is the visual interpretation of standard chest X-ray films. A previous study proposed an objective alternative; involving wavelets coefficient, as the feature vector of MTB. In this study, we proposed an AndrewÂ´s Curve graphical presentation of the feature vector of MTB.

In this paper, multi-objective fuzzy optimization is proposed as a means of dealing with fuzzy information in design specifications. The multi-objective fuzzy optimization is transformed into a single-objective nonfuzzy optimization problem. The resulting optimization problem is solved by gradient methods. Also, a new membership weighting strategy is outlined to incorporate preferences in the objective functions. This is shown to provide a much closer distribution of the degree of satisfaction of the objective functions. The outlined technique is also shown to provide an intuitive framework for solving the eigenstructure assignment problem for the design of output feedback control. A remotely operated underwater vehicle is used to illustrate the eigenproblem

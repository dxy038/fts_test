The feasibility of hybrid optical amplification in an interleaved bidirectional architecture is studied. An optical repeater node is constructed using an L-band erbium-doped fiber amplifier and bidirectional Raman pumping to achieve a combined gain of 34 dB. Signal impairments associated with this architecture are identified and measured. Dense wavelength-division-multiplexing transmission of 40+40 25-GHz-spaced channels is demonstrated using the hybrid bidirectional amplifier over nonzero-dispersion-shifted fiber spans.

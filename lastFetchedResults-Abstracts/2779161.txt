Introducing distributed generation (DG) into distribution networks can affect the problem of optimal switch placement. A method for solving the problem of optimal placement of sectionalizing switches with a large number of DGs is presented. The primary objective is to minimize the total cost of achieving a certain level of reliability in the presence of DG. The problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming to determine the optimal number and location of sectionalizing switches. Allowing DG to operate in an island mode is also considered. The effectiveness of the proposed formulation is examined on a modified reliability test system. The presented results indicate that the proposed formulation can provide a global optimum solution for the problem of sectionalizing switch placement, while reliability, capital investment, and annual operation and maintenance costs are considered. Furthermore, DG can play a key role in providing a reasonable improvement in the reliability indices of the system.

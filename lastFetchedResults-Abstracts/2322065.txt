In the modern art of Iran, painting discourse and poetry discourse (in spite of the ancient artistic tradition) are independent from each other. Nevertheless, poetry and painting sometimes join together; for instance, in the connection between the poetry of Nima Yushij and the painting of Bahman Mohasses. The aim of this paper is to study this connection and also find out the hidden common experience in the works of these two artists. Moreover, via exploring the meaning of “shore” in their works, the roots of the two artists’ experience of modernity is also investigated.
The method used in this study is comparative which is based on comparing the discourses of poetry and painting and analyzing the literary themes employed in them.
This research aims to show that shore is considered as a deeply lived experience originated from the environment of the two artists which is represented in two different media. The analysis of such representation shows how objective and subjective experiences are conformed to each other. Moreover, “shore” is construed as a metaphor bearing with itself the meaning of modern matter in two aspects. First, fluidity as a metaphor of modern life is displayed in the image of shore and sea in the works of Nima Yushij and Bahman Mohasses. Second, the coastline as a border between sea and land, water and soil, and fluid and solid is a rebellion against dualist certainty.

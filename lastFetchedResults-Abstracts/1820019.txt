Objective
nt matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and human β-defensin (HBD) functions have been found in inflammatory diseases. The objectives of this study were to investigate the immunolocalisation, mRNA expression and molecular forms of MMP-25, MMP-26, HBD-1 and HBD-2 in chronic and aggressive periodontitis and in peri-implantitis. The expression of MMP-25 by cultured human plasmacytoma cells and macrophages, and the effects of MMP-26 and Porphyromonas gingivalis trypsin-like proteinase on HBD-1 and -2 were also studied.

histochemistry, immunofluorescent analysis, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting were used to assess localisation, mRNA expression and molecular forms of MMP-25, MMP-26, HBD-1 and HBD-2. HBD degradation by MMP-26 and P. gingivalis proteinase was studied by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
s
 was present in plasma cells and polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and MMP-26 was present in oral and sulcular basement membrane zones. HBD-1 was distributed perivasculary in gingival connective tissue and in oral and sulcular epithelium, and HBD-2 was found to a lesser extent in the perivascular space. Low MMP-25, MMP-26, HBD-1 and HBD-2 mRNA expression was found. Immunoblot revealed 29–57-kDa MMP-25 in myeloma cell lysates, but not in macrophages, and partly activated MMP-25 and -26 in diseased gingival crevicular fluid and peri-implant sulcular fluid. P. gingivalis trypsin-like proteinase degraded HBD-1 and -2.
sions
MP-25 and -26 were expressed more strongly in extensively inflamed gingiva compared with healthy gingiva. The expression of HBD-1 was stronger than that of HBD-2 in periodontitis and peri-implantitis. De-novo expression of MMP-25 and -26 is associated with periodontal and peri-implant inflammation. Furthermore, P. gingivalis trypsin-like proteinase, but not MMP-26, can degrade HBD-1 and -2, which could lead to a weakened innate immune response.

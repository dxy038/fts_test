This paper presents a methodology to be added at the power system dispatch problem in order to evaluate and improve voltage stability margin by optimizing generators and synchronous condensers reactive power injection. The main objective is to reschedule the reactive injection of the machines, from a perspective of improving voltage stability margin, without impact on the active economical dispatch.

The objective of the FP7 funded TROPOS project is to design a modular multi-use platform for use in deep waters, with a focus on the Mediterranean, tropical and sub-tropical regions. In this paper, the related environmental aspects are considered, where both legal and technical issues are addressed. The multiple purpose platforms can enlarge the benefit from different functions, and reduce the environmental impacts through synergies among single impact as well. This proposed study demonstrates the impact assessment through multiple, integrated technologies.

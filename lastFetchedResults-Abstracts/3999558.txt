A 6-bit passive phase shifter for 2.5- to 3.2-GHz frequency band has been designed and implemented in a standard 0.18- &#956;m CMOS technology. A new switched-network topology has been proposed for implementing the 5.625 <sup>&#176;</sup> phase shift step. The insertion loss of the circuit is compensated with an on-chip bidirectional amplifier. The measured return losses of the circuit are better than 8 dB with output 1-dB compression point of +9.5 dBm in the transmit mode and noise figure of 7.1 dB in the receive mode. The fabricated phase shifter demonstrates an average RMS phase error of less than 2<sup>&#176;</sup> over the entire operation bandwidth, which makes it suitable for high-precision applications.

This paper presents firstly a dynamic grouping maintenance strategy for multi-component systems with positive economic dependence, which implies that combining maintenance activities is cheaper than performing maintenance on components separately. Preventive maintenance durations and multiple occurrences of maintenance activities within scheduling horizon are considered. Moreover, in a dynamic context, maintenance opportunities, defined as inactivity periods of the systems at which several maintenance activities could be executed with reduced maintenance costs, may randomly occur with time. The second objective of the paper is to propose a new algorithm to optimally update online the grouped maintenance planning by taking into account the maintenance opportunities. A numerical example of a five components system is finally introduced to illustrate the proposed dynamic grouping maintenance strategy.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of ovarian tissue extract on isolated preantral follicle growth, maturation, and hormone production of neonatal mouse ovaries after three-dimensional culture.
Methods: We obtained the tissue extract from adult mouse ovaries and determined their protein concentrations by the Bradford method. The experimental group comprised mechanically isolated preantral follicles after encapsulation with alginate hydrogel in ?-MEM supplemented with different concentrations of ovarian tissue extract and in 10% fetal bovine serum as the control group. Both groups were cultured for 12 days. At the end of the culture period, we assessed the mean diameters, survival and maturation rates, production of 17-B estradiol, and progesterone hormones. 
Results: The follicles cultured in different concentrations of ovarian tissue extract underwent degeneration, with the exception of the group that contained tissue extract (one-half the protein level of FBS) which had a 71.78% survival compared to the control (75%). The average follicle diameter, rate of MII oocytes, production of 17-B estradiol, and progesterone hormones were significantly higher in the group supplemented with ovarian tissue extract (one-half the protein level of FBS) compared to the control group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Ovarian tissue extract, as a proliferation and maturation factor, leads to growth, maturation, and better function of preantral follicles. This extract can be used to improve the in vitro follicular culture in a dose-dependent manner.

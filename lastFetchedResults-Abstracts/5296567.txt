On behalf of the Program Committee, we are pleased to welcome you to ISPCS 2010, the fourth IEEE Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement Control and Communication! The venue Symposium follows the tradition to alternate meetings between Europe and America and is thus hosted this year by the University of New Hampshire. Although the venue changes every year, the program committee is always of the same character: distributed all over the world, exactly as the origins of the contributions. This yearÂ´s call for papers resulted in 41 full-papers submissions to the conference. The quality of the contributions was, as always, exceptionally high, and the decision process for which papers to accept was long and difficult. To have an as objective as possible review process, more than hundred reviews where requested which resulted in a long list of comments and suggestions. The reviews have been carefully taken as a basis for the selection of the 25 accepted papers.

Police patrol district design presents a multi-objective optimization problem with two goals: minimizing workload variation between patrol districts and minimizing the response time for officers responding to calls for service. We evaluate three different methods for scoring district designs: a closed form probability based approach, a discrete-event simulation based on hypercube models for spatial queuing systems, and an agent-based simulation model. We find that all methods provide similar evaluations when service demand is low enough that cross-boundary support is infrequent. However, when the demand for service routinely exceeds the supply available within districts, only the agent-based simulation model accurately represents the resulting complexities and significantly changes the evaluation scores to reflect the behavior of the system.

Despite of beneficial effects of antibiotics in treatments of infectious diseases, antibiotic residues in milk, meat and their products can cause serious side effects for human health. The objective of this study was to monitor antibiotics residues in raw and pasteurised milk produced in Eastern Azerbaijan province of Iran. For this purpose, 10 industrial dairy farms as well as 10 local milk collection centers and 6 dairy processing plants were randomly selected. Raw milk samples were collected in 5 and pasteurised milk samples in 10 replications. Residual antibiotic of milk samples were monitored by Delvotest (version SP) kits. The results showed that 26% of raw milk samples collected from industrial dairies and 16% of raw milk of collection centers showed detectible antibiotic residues. In addition, 30% of pasteurised milk samples showed positive Delvotest results. Concluding, the antibiotic residue in milk and dairy products has to be monitored as routine test due to their side effects on human health.

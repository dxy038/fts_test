A new model of the human operator in a compensatory tracking task is developed using a sensitivity function shaping control synthesis formulation. Weighting filters are chosen to shape the sensitivity functions of the closed-loop operator-controlled feedback system based-upon established characteristics of manual operator systems. The weighting filters are used to represent the operatorÂ´s objective of error minimization and the inherent limitation of the operator to affect control at very high frequency. The model parameters can be computed using either H-infinity or H<sub>2</sub> control solutions. The new model retains the simplicity of the well-known crossover model yet is readily adapted to multi-loop control tasks. Several examples are given to compare the response of the new model to experimental data.

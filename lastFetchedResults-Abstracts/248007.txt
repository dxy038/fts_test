This paper is the second part of a two-part article about shape optimization of metal forming processes. This
part is focused on numerical applications of the optimization method which has been described in the first
paper. The main feature of this work is the analytical calculations of the derivatives of the objective function
for a non-linear, non-steady-state problem with large deformations. The calculations are based on the
differentiation of the discrete objective function and on the differentiation of the discrete equations of the
forging problem. Our aim here is to show the feasibility and the efficiency of such a method with numerical
examples. We recall the formulation and the resolution of the direct problem of hot axisymmetrical forging.
Then, a first type of shape optimization problem is considered: the optimization of the shape of the initial
part for a one-step forging operation. Two academic problems allow for checking the accuracy of the
analytical derivatives, and for studying the convergence rate of the optimization procedure. Both constrained
and unconstrained problems are considered. Afterwards, a second type of inverse problem of design
is considered: the shape optimization of the preforming tool, for a two-step forging process. A satisfactory
shape is obtained after few iterations of the optimization procedure.

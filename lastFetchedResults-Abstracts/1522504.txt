To guarantee that an analytical procedure gives reliable, exact and interpretable information about a sample, it must be validated. Two ambiguous parameters are detection limit and quantification limit. The determination of these limits is still of great concern and there are still a variety of procedures described in the current literature. The fundamental objective of the present work is to apply the different recommendations suggested by official guidelines for the quantitative determination of omeprazole and its impurities (omeprazole sulphone and 5-hydroxy-omeprazole) in capsules and tablets using high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. The importance of calibration linearity in the context of the quantification limit is considered, since one of the approaches, the estimated concentrations of this limit, are deduced from the regression line. The values of the detection limit and the quantification limit obtained show that, in chromatographic analyses, the best method is that based on the use of the parameters obtained from the analytical curve, which are statistically reliable. It was shown that smaller values of the detection limit and the quantification limit were obtained by the visual approach and by the method using the signal-to-noise ratio. However, these values may reflect a subjective evaluation, prone to error and large variations. This was confirmed by showing that these methods result in values that fall outside the linear range of the method.

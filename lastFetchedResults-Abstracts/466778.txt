Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the literature that was pertinent to cardiovascular risk in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. Study Design:Medline, Current Contents, and Pub-Med were searched for human studies from the time of our original interest in this issue in 1975 to the present. Only pivotal articles are presented because of page constraints and reference number limits. Results: Current literature supports the fact that women with this syndrome have risk factors for premature cardiovascular disease. Conclusion: Large multisite cooperative studies are necessary to evaluate cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates from this syndrome. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:35-43.)

Microgrids are small-scale power systems including distributed generation (DG) units, storage devices and controllable loads, and can operate either connected or isolated from the utility grid. Ensuring an efficient, reliable, economic and environmentally friendly microgrid operation, an environomic power dispatch system is needed. In this paper, a formulation of an environomic scheduling approach in microgrids is proposed using multi-objective decision making method. The application aims to fulfill the time-varying energy demand while minimizing the costs and emissions of the internal production and imported energy from the utility grid. Operational constraints such as generator limits, operation and maintenance costs and the intermittency renewable energy sources (RES) will be satisfied. A representative microgrid structure, including measurement data, is studied as an example and some simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the environomic scheduling approach.

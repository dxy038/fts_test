The main objective of the present study is to evaluate variation, contamination and speciation of heavy metals in bed sediments of the Siahrood River in Mazandaran Province. For this purpose, fifteen sediment samples were collected along the main channel of the river. In addition to total content of heavy metals and selected physiochemical properties of the sediments, geochemical species of heavy metals were determined operationally using the modified BCR method. The obtained results generally showed that there is a wide variation in heavy metal concentrations in the sediments, probably due to anthropogenic inputs into the river and effect of physicochemical properties of the sediments (organic matter and clay content) on the heavy metals variability. The calculated Igeo (Geoaccumulation index) for each metal also revealed that sediments are moderately or strongly contaminated in terms of Pb and Cd whereas not or slightly contaminated with respect to other heavy metals, suggesting an anthropogenic source for Pb and Cd and a mostly geogenic origin for Ni, Zn, and Cr (Arsenic is probably  of a mixed source). The results of BCR method  indicated that Pb and Cd are predominately incorporated into the first fraction (F1, acidsoluble fraction) while Zn and Ni are mainly associated with residual fraction (F4) confirming the concluded remarks on discrimination of heavy metals origins in the sediments.

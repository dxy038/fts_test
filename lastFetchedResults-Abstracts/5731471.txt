The Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) conducted a joint trial involving multiple sensors in the detection and tracking of ships in the Grand Banks of Canada in March 2000, including the HF surface wave radar (HFSWR) system at Cape Race, Newfoundland. One objective of the trial was to evaluate the detection and tracking capabilities of the HFSWR system. Three co-operative ships were used: a Canadian Navy patrol frigate named Ville de Quebec and two small fishing vessels named Anne S. Pierce and Arctic Pride. We present some results of the detection and tracking of these co-operative ships using the HFSWR. The radar had difficulties tracking ships near Bragg lines, i.e., the first-order sea echoes of the radar. A revised algorithm is also presented to detect ships near Bragg lines.

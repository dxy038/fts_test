Objective: Herbal medicine and medical plants such as Ziziphus Jujuba are widely used in the treatment of diseases such as diabetes mellitus. We investigated the effects of ethanol extracts of Ziziphus Jujuba fruit on serum glucose, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, cholesterol and activities of aminotransferase enzymes in streptozocin-induced diabetic adult male rats.
Materials and Methods: Adult Wistar rats were rendered hyperglycemic. Animals were divided into four equal groups (7 per group). Animals in all groups were treated for 14 days. Blood samples were collected from the heart of the animals.
Results: Continuous supplementation of ethanol extract in drinkable water of diabetic rats resulted to a significant decrease of fasting blood glucose, cholesterol and increase in high density lipoprotein levels after 14 days (P < 0.05), but the levels of triglycerides, LDL-cholestrol, activities of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase did not changed significantly in treatment group compared to control group(P > 0.05).
Conclusion: This paper discussed the antidiabetic effect of an alcoholic extract of Ziziphus Jujuba on streptozocin-induced diabetes in rats. Researchers showed that Streptozocin injection led to diabetes mellitus, which may be due to destruction of B cells of the islets of Langerhans.

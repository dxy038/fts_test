Objective To study the role of religious advisors in
mental health problems in six European countries and to
compare it to data from the USA.
Methods Data were derived fromthe European Study of the
Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD) study, a crosssectional
study, conducted in Belgium, France, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. 21,425 individuals, 18 and
older, were interviewed with the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview 3.0. Findings were compared to the
National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) and replication of the
NCS (NCS-R) in the US.
Results In ESEMeD, 0.6% of individuals (0.3% exclusively)
sought help from religious advisors concerning
mental health problems during the previous year, compared
to 2.6% in NCS and 3.4% (for human services) in NCS-R
in the US. Among those using any form of service, 6.9%
consulted religious advisors (12.2% in Germany to 2.1% in
Spain) compared to 18.8% in the US. Being younger (less
than 25 years old), being older (more than 64) and religiosity
are associated with the use of religious advisors,
whereas being a student is associated with a lower
probability.
Conclusions Seeking help from religious advisors for
mental health problems varies dramatically among ESEMeD
countries. Except for Germany, organised religion
in the ESEMeD countries could not be considered as an
alternative.

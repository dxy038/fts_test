The objective of the present work is to investigate the characteristics of the airflow and heat/contaminant transport structures in the indoor air environment by means of a convection transport visualization technique. Laminar double-diffusive mixed convection in a two-dimensional displacement ventilated enclosure with discrete heat and contaminant sources is numerically studied. Based on the governing equations, the fluid, heat, and contaminant transport processes are respectively described by the corresponding streamfunction, heatfunction, and massfunction. Attentions are given to analyze the effects of the main factors—the strength of heat source indicated by the Grashof number (Gr), the strength of contaminant source by the buoyancy ratio (Br), the strength of ventilation by the Reynolds number (Re), and the ventilation mode—on the indoor air environment. Numerical results, presented by the contour function lines, namely, streamlines, heatlines, and masslines, illustrated that the indoor air, heat and contaminant transport structures are mainly determined by the interaction between the internal buoyancy natural convection induced by the discrete heat/contaminant sources and the external forced convection driven by the mechanical ventilation. It is found that the convection transport method could explicitly disclose the complicated philosophy of indoor air environment, and thus provides a simple but practical approach to see the indoor airflow and heat and contaminant transport structures.

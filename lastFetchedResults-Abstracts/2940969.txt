The cyclotomic polynomial (CP) prefilter design problem is formulated as an optimization problem with linear objective functions by applying the logarithm to the transfer function of the CP prefilter. Then this problem is solved by mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Design examples demonstrate that this method leads to more efficient cascaded FIR prefilter-equalizers than existing methods

The construction activity level intricacy makes the whole construction process quite complicated and difficult for planners and builders. 4D (3D+Time) construction planning is a promising area, and it presents the ability to represent the construction process with the additional sequential dimension. It makes the virtual models easy to analyze and plan for the sequence of activities. Traditionally, architectural/construction engineering and technology education, especially construction scheduling has been dependent on bar charts and network diagrams. However, students can hardly understand the schedule-construction progress relationship using a CPM network or a bar chart. Using 4D visualization students can learn time-space relationship in construction schedule more effectively. The objective of this research was to create a user-friendly 5D (3D+time+cost) model by adding the cost of project with reference to the time line so that the planners would be able to peg the cost control measures with the schedule. The study provides a structured method and a systematic approach that will enable the students and planners to develop 5D models without worrying about the errors and software hitches. This 5D visualization model will facilitate developing a more realistic approach to the whole construction process. The entire model is integrated to produce an interactive visualization to make the process fairly easier for students as well as the construction industry professionals. In addition to this, changes to the 5D model can be done easily by triggering changes at one level. The techniques demonstrated through 5D virtual construction models can potentially be a valuable tool not only in the classroom, but also as an effective learner-centered self-directed tool to learn planning and construction processes.

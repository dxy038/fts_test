Introduction: Gynecologic disorders are the most common health problems among women. If drug treatments lead to faij hysterectomy was considered.

Objective: Determine and compare the women's quality of life before and three months after hysterectomies. Materials and Methods: According to chronic disorders (diabetes mellitus, cardio-vascular diseases) fifty five women were selected. Subjects were selected upon a pilot study and by consecutive non-probability sampling. Data were collected by a predetermined questioner; and processed and analyzed with SPSS. Chi- square and t test were used for analyzing accordingly.

Results: There was statistically different between mean scores of general health quality before and after hysterectomies (P<0/0001) but its depression component had no different. General disorders and clinical symptoms were different with different statistically degrees. (p=0.0005 for urinary incontinence to p=0.023 for urinary urgency).Pelvic pain (p=0.056) and vertigo (p=0.21) showed no statistical differences. Conclusions: After hysterectomy total health quality scores statistically improved but anxiety score showed less, and depression score showed no statistical difference. In order to more generalizing findings, recommended carrying out a larger study with benign and malign disorders separately.

In order to produce long-term aerosol optical depth (AOD) dataset over land from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), AVHRR data quality in terms of radiometric calibration must be maintained. A vicarious calibration method have been developed by incorporating well calibrated Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) radiance data over several pseudo-invariant targets to inter-calibrate the channel 1 of AVHRR based on Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) and spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) models for different targets. Comparison of our calibration coefficients with those of Pathfinder Atmospheres Extended (PATMOS-x) indicate the calibration accuracy to be within 2.5%. The operational L1B and recalibrated AVHRR radiance are applied to derive AOD maps over East America (dark surface) and West Africa (bright surface) using the land aerosol and bidirectional reflectance inversion by times series technique (LABITS) algorithm. Preliminary comparisons show that significant difference in the retrieved AOD from the two different calibration is expected, while the spatial distribut ion of AOD difference is complicated due to different surface brightness and deficiencies of numeric solutions.

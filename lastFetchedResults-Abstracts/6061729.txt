As a multi-objective decision method, the TOPSIS method was applied for optimization for enterprisesÂ´ service plan of environmental emergency in this paper, with the method of entropy-value to determine the index weights. According to the situation of some chlor-alkali enterprises in China, 3-level evaluation index system of the environmental emergency service plan was established and the optimization calculation was carried out by Matlab. In addition, the key factors of service plan of environmental emergency were analyzed to assure timely and efficient emergency action for emergencies with emergency plan.

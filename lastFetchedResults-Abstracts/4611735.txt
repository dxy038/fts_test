In this paper, we propose a link outage probability based resource allocation scheme for multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh networks. The objective is to optimize the link outage probability under the effect of channel variation and external interference while preserving the end-to-end traffic demand requirements. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which is solved by decomposing it into a feasibility- checking problem and an outage probability search problem so that the original problem can be solved iteratively with reduced complexity. Numerical results are provided to show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing scheme in reducing the outage probability.

A semi-empirical battery wear model is proposed for an EV charging application. From a practical perspective, the design parameters are investigated for EV charging control. The proposed battery wear model is based on pervasive experimental cycle life data provided by manufacturer and is formulated in a mathematical expression. Therefore, the developed model yields practical and accurate results. The return value of the model directly indicates the wear cost, and thus it can be combined with other criterions for multi objective optimization. In the latter part, an application is introduced by applying the wear model to an EV energy arbitrage. From the results, it appears that charging control without considering the wear may lead to an erroneous result increasing the effective cost.

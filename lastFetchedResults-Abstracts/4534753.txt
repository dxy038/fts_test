For the cloud computing, task scheduling problems are of paramount importance. It becomes more challenging when takes into account energy consumption, traditional make span criteria and users QoS as objectives. This paper considers independent tasks scheduling in cloud computing as a bi-objective minimization problem with make span and energy consumption as the scheduling criteria. We use Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) to minimize energy consumption and propose two algorithms. These two algorithms use the methods of unify and double fitness to define the fitness function and select individuals. They adopt the genetic algorithm to parallel find the reasonable scheduling scheme. The simulation results demonstrate the two algorithms can efficiently find the right compromise between make span and energy consumption.

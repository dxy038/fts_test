Background and objective: Due to the necessity of oral health in the preschool
children and incorrect beliefs of mothers and more perceived barriers to perform
it, this research was performed to study the effect of education intervention
in changing mothers’ attitudes, perceived self-efficacy and perceived barriers
regarding oral health of preschool children.
Methods: In this quasi-experimental study 120 female preschool children from
district 7 of Tehran city were selected by one stage cluster sampling from each
school and then their mothers were included in the study. A researcher-made
questionnaire was designed and validated by researchers for assessing mothers’
self-efficacy, perceived barriers and attitudes regarding oral health among
preschool children. Two test (intervention) and control groups completed the
questionnaire before educational intervention. Based on the pre-test results
the educational intervention was designed and implemented in 4 sessions
(each 45 minutes) for mothers in test group. Both groups were followed up
one month after the intervention and then completed questionnaires. Data was
analyzed by independent sample t-tests and student’s t test for paired sample
through SPSS16.
Results: Significant differences were observed in the mean score of attitude
(p=0.001), perceived self-efficacy (p=0.011) and perceived barriers (p < 0.0001)
in the intervention group as compared to the control group.
Conclusion: Educational intervention may reduce perceived barriers to oral
health among mothers having pre-school children regarding oral health and
increase their perceived self-efficacy and positive attitude.

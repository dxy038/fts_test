
Objective: In recent years, there has been a rising interest in cognitive behavioral research
to explore the role of emotion regulation in the development and maintenance of mental
disorders and resiliency against or recovery from them. Particularly, different strategies people
use to regulate their emotions may have more important role in emotional disorders including
depression. The aim of this article is to review the recent literature focusing on the role of ER
in depression. Methods: In this paper, we present a brief review of the latest studies (in English and Persian)
regarding depression and 6 relevant emotion-regulation strategies (i.e. suppression, rumination,
experiential avoidance, reappraisal, mindfulness, and acceptance). Then, we attempt to
integrate findings of these cognitive-behavioral and neurobiological investigations utilizing
the Gross`s process model of emotion regulation. Results: According to the research results, we can generally conclude that emotion regulation
may be an important mediator/moderator mechanism in the pathogenesis of depression that
could also be a good target for intervention in psychotherapy. Conclusion: Some challenging issues in this area are noted and their implications for cognitivebehavioral
research and therapies are discussed.

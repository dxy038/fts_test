Background: Recently, there has been an increase in the incidence of major vascular complications such as infected pseudoaneurysm due to intravenous drug use. Objective: For better understanding of the existing controversies regarding the optimal surgical management of infected pseudoaneurysm, the present study was conducted. Methods: Medical charts of 36 consecutive patients who underwent surgery in Taleghani Hospital, Tehran, Iran from 1996 through 2003, were retrospectively analyzed. Results: We studied the hospital records of 33 cases; two patients had bilaterally infected pseudoaneurysms and one underwent an emergency reoperation. The total number of operations was 36. Eleven cases (30.5%) underwent ileofemoral reconstruction and 25 (69.5%) arteries were ligated. All patients presented with infected femoral or brachial pseudoaneurysms due to intravenous drug abuse. Postoperatively, there was no hemorrhage, vascular thrombosis, amputation, or mortality. Three cases (8%) had incisional infections (2 [18%] after reconstruction and 1 [4%] after ligation operation) and 7 patients (19%) had claudication (all after ligation). Conclusion: Ligation is the optimal management for infected pseudoaneurysm, because it is easy, cost-effective, and safe. Reconstruction is not recommended, because of an extended infection at the location of pseudoaneurysm and at the artificial graft site.

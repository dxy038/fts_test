Inroduction & Objective:Temperature is one of the key factors that will control the physiological mechanisms of the organism. These factors increase or decrease the stimulatory activity of enzyme digestion and metabolic activity at the cellular activity and can significant effects on fish growth. This study was conducted for 6 weeks aim to study effects of diffrents temperature.Rutilus rutilus caspicus. 
Materials and Methods: Experiments were performed in 4 groups and 3 replications as follows: group 1: temperature 26 °C, group 2: temperature 28 °C, group 3: temperature 30 °C and group 4: temperature 32 °C. Rutilus rutilus caspicus fingerlings during the study were fed Biomar diet. Feeding rate of 10% based on the total weight of the fish was on.
Results: The results showed that there are significant differences with regard to the amount of body weight and body length in different groups (p  < 0.05). So, the maximum body weight and body length was in group 3: temperature 30 °C. Results also showed that there is a significant differences in feed conversion ratio, condition factor, specific growth rate, body weight index, growth rate and survival among groups (p  < 0.05).
Conclusion: This study showed that best temperature for growth and survival of Rutilus rutilus caspicus is 30 °C.

The design problem of a shaded -pole induction motor is represented as a vector optimization problem. The problem is solved using the nonlinear programming technique. The motor is designed with different requirements. These requirements are represented by weighted elements of an objective function vector and a set of constraints. The objective functions are the goals of design procedure that the designer tries to achieve their extreme (optimal) values. The adopted approach gives the designer the flexibility to represent the importance of goals in "weights" and find the optimal design according to these weights. Implementation of this approach is presented by designing a motor with two objective functions (starting torque and cost). The results obtained verify the ability of this approach to achieve valuable improvements.

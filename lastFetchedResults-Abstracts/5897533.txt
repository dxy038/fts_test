In this paper we present a spatio-bi-temporal fading scheme for block loss recovery in block-based video decoding systems. In the first part of the algorithm, based on two different boundary error criterions obtained from bi-temporal error concealment, either the previous, the future, or fading between both temporal methods is used for bi-temporal macroblock estimation. A weighted absolute difference between motion compensated image samples and macroblock boundary samples of the current frame represents one boundary error. In the second part of the algorithm, based on a boundary error criterion obtained from bi-temporal concealment, spatial, bi-temporal, or fading between both methods is used for recovering a lost macroblock. The advantage of this method is that one lost macroblock can be recovered pelwise spatially from the current or bi-temporally from the previous and the future frame by weighted averaging both error concealment results. The simulation results have shown that for recovering a lost macroblock this method outperforms the reference methods both in subjective and objective video quality

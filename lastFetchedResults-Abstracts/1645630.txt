        Fabric friction has been thought to be the principal component that determines the handle of fabric. During the last century numerous test instruments and systems has been developed to study the frictional properties of fabrics such as: Kawabata Evaluation System, sliding friction apparatus, cycling sliding method and etc. Most of researchers have used an Instron tensile tester with some attachments to measure the fabric to fabric or fabric to metal friction. The main objective of the present paper is to modify frictional measuring method. To develop a new method for measurement, perform two changes: 1- perform best controlling the slippage of slider 2- we can use the inclined plane to measure the coefficient of friction in non-linear equation. The standard error of linear regression with new test method (combination CRE and CRL Friction testing) lowers than previous method and show higher correlation coefficient.

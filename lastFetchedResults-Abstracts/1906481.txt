Introduction: 
Tuberculosis of the foot is an unusual type of skeletal tuberculosis. 
Case Presentation:
 We report on an eighty-six-year-old woman, who presented pain and purulent discharge from the right foot for 10
months. The final diagnosis was confirmed with a culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
Discussion: 
Diagnosis of this form of tuberculosis is established with some delay due to the uncommon site of involvement, lack
of awareness about the condition and its ability to mimic other disorders. Diagnosis and appropriate treatment can often be delayed,which may lead to significant consequences for the patient. Our case was treated with anti-tuberculin medications for nine months andconservative management of the bony lesions resulting complete resolution of symptoms

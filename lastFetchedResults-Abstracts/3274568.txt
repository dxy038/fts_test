Objective: In this paper, Electroglottograph (EGG) is adopted to improve the naturalness of low bit-rate formant speech synthesis. Methods: EGG inverting waveform is used as glottal excitation of the formant speech synthesis. A new SUV divided method combining with EGG and speech signal is recommend, to increase the accuracy of the extraction of formant. Results: According to the subjective MOS score and comparative experiment with the original speech signal, the naturalness of voice formant synthesis combined EGG is considerable higher than the traditional use of the pulse signal and the inverse filtered signal as the glottal excitation. Conclusion: The combination of EGG formant speech synthesis improves the naturalness of synthetic speech.

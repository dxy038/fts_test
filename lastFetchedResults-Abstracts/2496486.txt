Abstract
Introduction: Hemodialysis patients require effective education to improve their quality of life. Flexible educational strategy via internet (computer) is essential.
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of multimedia based education and traditional methods on life quality of hemodialysis patients.
Methods: In this quasi- experimental study, all of the patients (n=62) who referred to four hemodialysis centers in Tabriz City from May to Sept 2013 were divided randomly in tow groups, intervention and control. Quality of short life questionnaire (Sf-36) were completed before and three months after the educational program. The intervention group navigated their way through the Research Development Hemodialysis and Essentials Care Application using laptop during their hemodialysis. The control group received the same content in the traditional way (face to face education & pamphlet). Data were analyzed by conducting the independent- and the paired samples t, the Chi-square, and ANOVA tests. 
Results: There were no statistically significant difference between the study groups in pre- and post-education life quality mean scores, but inter group comparison findings showed that all post-education quality of life scales mean scores had changed statistically in both the intervention and control groups except Apperception general health scale (p > 0/05).
Conclusion: The Hemodialysis and Essentials Care application based education can improve patientsâ€™ life quality as well as traditional method. This application could be used to facilitate the patient education process to improve their life style.

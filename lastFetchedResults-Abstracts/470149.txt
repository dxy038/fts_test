Objective
To compare objective and subjective parameters of surgical stress following laparoscopic and open adnexectomy in patients older than 60 years old.
Study design
Twenty patients with a benign ovarian tumour were prospectively randomized to undergo adnexectomy by a laparoscopic or an open surgical procedure. Measurements included C-reactive protein; interleukin-6 before, during, and after surgery; intensity and duration of postoperative pain; and complications and recovery period. Statistical analysis consisted of analysis of variance and a Mann-Whitney U test.
Results
The levels of the interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein differed significantly between the 2 operative procedures (P = .013) in favor of the laparoscopic approach. The laparoscopic approach was associated with a reduction in operative morbidity, postoperative pain, analgesic requirement, and recovery period.
Conclusions
Minimally invasive surgery is of particular benefit to elderly patients if there is a plan in place for appropriate staging and treatment by laparotomy for malignancy. It should be the first choice and may help to reduce postoperative complications.

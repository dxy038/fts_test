We describe two intelligent systems which have been developed to provide an objective interpretation of data, to match available technology to the needs of the user, and to assist in decision making. The INFANT (Intelligent Fetal Assessment) interfaces to electronic fetal monitors for objective analysis of CTG and provides advice to clinicians on the appropriate management of labour. The DataCare expert system interfaces to a blood gas machine to validate and analyse the chemical acid-base status of blood taken from the umbilical cord immediately after delivery. We aim to share our experience of the development and use of the two systems

In the present paper suboptimal boundary control strategies for the time-dependent, incompressible flow over the backward-facing step are considered. The objective consists in the reduction of the recirculation bubble of the flow behind the step. Several cost functionals are suggested and a frame for the derivation of the optimality systems for a general class of cost functionals is presented. Numerical examples are given.

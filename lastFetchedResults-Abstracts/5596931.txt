To improve the robustness of Dual-steering Control, which is effective to enhance mobility of 4WD EV, MPC controller is proposed. The reference model, calculating the control reference value, adopts 3dof vehicle reference model. The predictive model of MPC controller applies the improved 2dof vehicle model, and objective function is proposed based on yaw rate and power consumption. A feedback correction method is designed to improve the robustness of the closed loop system to the model uncertainties. The output of MPC controller is solved by quadratic programming. Simulation results show that the MPC controller can enhance mobility of vehicle, the output of direct yaw moment is smooth and the control strategy shows good adaptability with system parameters uncertainties.

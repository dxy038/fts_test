In this paper, the amorphous barium titanate precursor was prepared by the peroxo-hydroxide method and post-treated by various drying procedures, such as: room temperature drying, room temperature vacuum drying and vacuum drying at 50 °C. The objective in the latter two treatments was to increase the Ti–O–Ba bonds of the precursor. The post-treated precursors were compared with the untreated (i.e., ‘wet’) precursor. Also, a barium titanate precursor was prepared by an alkoxide route. Afterwards, the precursors were hydrothermally treated at 200 °C in a 10 M NaOH solution. Vacuum drying of the precursor seemingly promoted the formation of Ti–O–Ti bonds in the hydrothermal end-product. The low Ba:Ti ratio (0.66) of the alkoxide-route prepared precursor lead to a multi-phase hydrothermal product with BaTiO3 as the main phase. In contrast, phase pure BaTiO3, i.e. without BaCO3 contamination, was obtained for the precursor which was dried at room temperature. Cube-shaped and highly crystalline BaTiO3 particles were observed by electron microscopy for the hydrothermally treated peroxo-hydroxide-route prepared precursor.

Interpolation is required in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing for coregistration of complex signals. Straightforward system theoretical considerations provide objective figures of merit for interpolators, such as interferometric decorrelation and phase noise. Theoretical and simulation results are given for nearest neighbor, piecewise linear, four- and six-point cubic convolution, and truncated sinc kernels

The objective of this work is the calculation of the static effective permittivity for two-dimensional pseudorandom composite media. We consider a periodic lattice composed of conducting and/or dielectric cylinders in a host medium. These cylinders are infinitely long and parallel to each other. It is assumed that there is no free charge everywhere in the space, and that the whole mixture remains effectively isotropic and is illuminated by a constant electric field. In order to simulate a random medium we randomly change the locations of the inclusions within the unit cell while fixing number and sizes. This step is repeated a sufficient number of times. During the whole procedure, one realization is sampled out every fixed number of iterations (large enough to enable sufficient amount of particle displacement) and the effective permittivity is recalculated. The running average is then updated. The randomizing procedure is terminated once convergent /spl epsiv//sub r/,/sub eff/ results are obtained. The converged value, which is the running average of the effective permittivity of all realizations, represents the effective permittivity of a pseudorandom medium with the same volume fraction as each realization.

This study introduces a hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) for the optimization of aircraft control system design. The strategy suggested is composed mainly of two stages. The first stage consists of training an artificial neural network (ANN) with objective values as inputs and decision variables as outputs to model an approximation of the inverse of the objective function used. The second stage consists of a local improvement phase in objective space preserving objectives relationships, and a mapping process to decision variables using the trained ANN. Both the hybrid MOEA and the original MOEA were applied to an aircraft control system design application for assessment

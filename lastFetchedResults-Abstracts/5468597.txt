A comprehensive analysis of a resonant switching cell based converter that combines the advantages of those of quasi-resonant (QR) and a bidirectional source (BS) based converter is presented. This converter has the following characteristics: (1) filtering is achieved by a capacitor and a very small inductance, (2) the range of load variation is very high under soft commutated conditions, and (3) there are limited voltage stresses on the main switch.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

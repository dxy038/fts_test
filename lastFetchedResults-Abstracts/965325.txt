Background and Objective: Bleeding tendency is a complication among patients with renal failure. Many studies show the benefit effect of high dose of conjugated estrogen infusion in prevention of bleeding among uremic patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect low dose orally administered conjugated estrogen in patients with acute renal failure who underwent kidney biopsy
Subjects and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the patients were divided in two groups. In group 1, ten units of cryoprecipitate was infused on the day of biopsy and in group 2, 0.06 mg/kg conjugated estrogen in three oral divided dose was administered for 5 days before biopsy. 
Results: Overall 36 patients, group 1 (9 males and 9 females) with mean age of 39.7 ±1.42 and group 2 (12 males and 6 females) with a mean age of 35.3 ± 1.13 were investigated. No significant differences between these groups in terms of mean age (P= 0.172) and males and females (P=0.310).
In both groups, hematuria was the most common complication, 15 (83.3%) in group 1 and 13 (72.2%) in group 2 with no significant differences between them (P=0.691). In group 1, two patients (11.1%) and in group 2, one patient (5.6%) had major bleeding (P=0.990). Major bleeding with hemodynamic instability occured in one case in both groups but they did not need surgical intervention. 
Conclusion: According to the study, oral low dose conjugated estrogens can prevent bleeding among patient with acute renal failure who underwent kidney biopsy.

Background&Objective: The deterious effects of pressor response (tachycardia and hypertension) are not hidden from any personal of anaesthesia group. The present study is performed in Chamran Hospital affiliated to the university of medical sciences, Shiraz, with the aim to introduce the most effective, cheapest as well as the easiest method to prevent or reduce the pressor response to direct laryngoscopy and intubation.
Materials&Method: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Chamran hospital in Shiraz. Ninty patients scheduled for elective surgical fixation of femur or tibia were randomly divided in group A (30 patients), group B (30 patients) and group C (30 patients). In-group A patients were directly sprayed with lidocaine 10%, hypopharyngealy, after induction of anaesthesia and three minutes before tracheal intubation. Patients in group B were sprayed with lidocaine 10% oropharyngealy before induction of anaestheisa while the patients, were awake. patients in group C were not sprayed with lidocaine (control group). Premedication and drugs used for induction of anaesthesia were same in three groups. The heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded in all patients included in the study, before tracheal intubation (base line) just after tracheal intubation and 3 and 5 minutes after intubation.
Results: Spraying lidocaine oroharyngealy before induction of anaesthesia and hypopharyngealy after induction of anaesthesia both were effective in controlling the pressor response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubaiton, but spraying lidocaine oropharyngealy before induction of anaesthesia is more effective than spraying lidocaine hypopharyngealy after induction of anaesthesia (P<0.05).
Conclusion: According to the results of present study. applying lidocaine spray. oropharyngealy is a simple, very effective as well as cheap method for controlling pressor response to tracheal intubation.

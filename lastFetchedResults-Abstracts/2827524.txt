In this work, it has been demonstrated how artificial bee colony algorithm can be successfully utilized to solve an optimal DG placement problem, considering both technical and economic objectives. The technical objectives try to minimize line loss, the effect of voltage sag problem, and the variation in node voltage deviation in the distribution network. The economical objectives try to minimize operational costs of DG placements. This problem has been formulated as a constrained, multi-objective optimization problem using weighting method and penalty function approach and it has been successfully implemented for a 34-bus radial distribution system. The results are compared with that of the GA method and aptly demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm.

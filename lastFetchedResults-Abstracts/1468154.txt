Background: Although much effort has gone into decreasing insulin resistance and inflammatory factors by consumption of probiotic-containing products in pregnant women, limited data are available assessing the effects of synbiotic foods.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of synbiotic Gaz consumption on insulin function and serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in Iranian pregnant women. 
Methods: This randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 52 primigravida pregnant women aged 18-35 years old in the third trimester during 2012. After a 2-week run-in period, subjects were randomly allocated to consume either synbiotic (n=26) or control Gaz (n=26) for 9 weeks. Each gram synbiotic Gaz consisted of a probiotic Lactobacillus sporogenes (1×107 CFU), 0.04 g inulin as prebiotic with 0.38 g isomalt, 0.36 g sorbitol and 0.05 g stevia as sweetener. Control Gaz (the same substance without probiotic bacteria and inulin) was packed in identical 9-gram packages. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin function and serum hs-CRP levels were measured at baseline and after a 9-week intervention. Data were analyzed using independent sample T-test, paired T-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, Mann Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Findings: The following changes were statistically significant compared with the control group: decrease in insulin levels (-0.26 vs. 6.34 µIU/mL, P=0.014) and HOMA-IR (-0.13 vs. 1.13, P=0.033), difference in HOMA-B (5.30 vs. 34.22, P=0.040) and increase in QUICKI (0.002 vs. -0.02, P=0.022). The differences for FPG and hs-CRP levels were not statistically significant. 
Conclusion: With regards to the results, consumption of synbiotic Gaz for 9 weeks had beneficial effects on insulin function among pregnant women, but did not affect FPG and serum hs-CRP levels.

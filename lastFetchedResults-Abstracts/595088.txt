Objective: This study was conducted to observe the effects of extracts from the seeds of medicinal plant "Myristica fragrans" (which has documented calcium channel blocker) on volume and acidity of carbachol induced gastric secretion, liver and kidney function in fasting rabbits.Material and Methods: Thirty rabbits of local breed were included in the study and they were divided into three equal groups. Group A was injected with Carbachol. Group B was injected with extract and carbachol and group C was injected only extract and liver & kidney function was determined. The drugs and extract were injected intraperitoneallyResults: It was observed that the extract inhibited volume, free and total acidity of gastric secretion in group B. This inhibition was statistically highly significant for all the three parameters (P< 0.001). It was also noticed that there were non significant changes in liver function and kidney function test before and after 45 days treatment with extract in group C.Conclusion: It is concluded that the extract is an excellent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion and can be safely used for peptic ulcer and other diseases which need calcium channel blockers for their treatment. This will also enable a lay man to use the crude drug obtained from easily available local plant.

Objective
Mirror movements (MM) have been described in several pathological conditions. Their association with neural tube defects is rare, and only 5 cases have been reported in literature to date. We report on a case of MM associated with cervical myelomeningocele, and we discuss the diffusion tensor imaging findings and the underlying mechanism.

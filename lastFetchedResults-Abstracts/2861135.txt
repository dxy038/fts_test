The hyper-sampling mode was recently proposed and studied in the community of networked control systems (NCSs). Compared with its widely-used single-sampling counterpart, the hyper-sampling mode brings a more flexible sampling mechanism. However, the relation between the dynamic performance of the NCS and the hyper-sampling period has not been fully investigated so far. The objective of this paper is to study how to design the hyper-sampling sequence such that: under a given average sampling frequency, the system dynamic performance is optimal. The approach is based on the analytic relation between the performance index and the hyper-sampling period and a parameter-sweeping technique. As a byproduct of the prosed approach, we may optimize the feedback gain matrix of an NCS using the similar idea.

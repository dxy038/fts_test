A model, coupling the STICS crop growth model, the ISBA SVAT model and radiative transfer models in various spectral domains, is used for simulating remote sensing signals at the same time as crop canopy processes. It is shown that remote sensing data are very sensitive to initial water content, mainly because of variations in vegetation growth. When compared to measurements, the coupled model works quite well. Then, it may be proposed for assimilating remote sensing data with the objective of monitoring canopy processes

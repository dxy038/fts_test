As a continuing work on G<sup>3</sup>-continuous path planning for nonholonomic wheeled unicycle-type nonholo-nomic mobile robot in the predefined static environment, this paper accounts for a multi-objective path optimization problem that directly incorporates the objectives of simultaneously minimizes the total path length and the maximum curvature along the path. Using easily customized variable-length Island-based Parallel Genetic Algorithm (IPGA) as a path computing framework and &#951;<sup>3</sup>-splines as the path primitive for waypoint interpolation, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is implemented to find and optimize multiple collision-free paths to obtain a G<sup>3</sup>-continuous composite &#951;<sup>3</sup>-spline path with each &#951;<sup>3</sup>-spline segment shorter and a larger minimum turning radius along the whole path. By comparing with the corresponding single-objective implementation, the experimental result demonstrates the effectiveness of the evolutionary multi-objective path planner in finding paths of more practical value in complex environments.

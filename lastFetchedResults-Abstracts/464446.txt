OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the physical signs and clinical symptoms associated with endometriosis in infertile women. STUDY DESIGN: This case-control study was carried out in an academic tertiary hospital. There were 174 infertile women with endometriosis and 174 infertile women without endometriosis, all of them studied by laparoscopy. Before laparoscopy a standard interview and a standard physical examination were performed. RESULTS: Cul-de-sac nodularity was more frequent in infertile women with endometriosis than in infertile women without endometriosis (6.3% vs 0%). Although uterosacral tenderness was also more frequent in infertile women with endometriosis (7.5% vs 1.7%), uterosacral tenderness without nodularity was similar in both populations. Uterine retroversion and cul-de-sac obstruction frequencies were somewhat higher in the endometriosis group (p< 0.10). The remaining signs and symptoms analyzed, including pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, were similarily frequent in both populations. Symptoms were similarily frequent in all American Fertility Society stages, although adnexal mass was higher in stage IV. CONCLUSION: Uterosacral nodularity was pathognomonic of endometriosis in infertile women. Uterosacral nodularity and uterosacral tenderness (associated with uterosacral nodularity) were the only symptoms or signs of value to indicate endometriosis in infertile patients. The remaining clinical signs, as well as the clinical symptoms, were of no value in diagnosing endometriosis in infertile women. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:620-3.)

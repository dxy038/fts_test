Objective: This study examined changes in lipid profile in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in comparison with non-sepsis patients admitted to the medical ICU and its association with mortality.

Materials and Methods: Through sampling of  internal ICU admitted patients in Seman Kostar hospital, patients were divided into two groups of sepsis (n=107) and non-septic (n=115). Then, serum level of total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL and LDL with specific kit was evaluated randomly at first and fifth day after ICU admition.Then, two groups was compared.

Results: In sepsis and non-septic groups, 51.4% and 47% were men and the remainder was women, mean age was 74.2 and 68 years, mortality rate was 76.6% and 46.9% ,respectively. In the first instance, compared with non-septic, lipid variables except triglycerides and cholesterol decreased significantly and in the second instance, cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL reduced and HDL increased. HDL in sepsis and TG at fifth day and LDL at fifth day in non-septic group was associated with mortality rate.

Conclusion: Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock had lower levels of serum lipid profiles compared with patients without sepsis in ICU. Serum HDL in sepsis and LDL and TG in non-septic patients had prognostic role.

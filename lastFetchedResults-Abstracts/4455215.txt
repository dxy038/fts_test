The main objective of this paper is to develop a power conditioning system, which can be used to extract the variable solar DC power from sun and convert it into AC power to feed a 3-phase AC load effectively. This paper presented the simulation results of Photovoltaic (PV) power conditioning system for three phase AC loads. The conditioner consists of a diode clamped three level inverter fed by closed loop voltage controlled DC-DC Boost converter. This closed loop control of DC-DC converter is implemented by a conventional Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) in duty cycle ratio control method. This boost converter is designed to obtain regulated voltage from the variable solar power. A level shift sinusoidal PWM is used to control the multilevel inverter on FPGA.

Measurement of video quality is of fundamental importance to many image and video processing application. Neural network (ANN) is discussed. In this method, we evaluated different videos using both objective and subjective test. Three objective measurements which are Bit rate Structural Similarity Index Method (SSIM) and Interframe Transformation Fidelity (ITF) for different videos are calculated and these measurements are fed to feed forward neural network. The neural network was used to obtain the mapping functions between are objective quality assessment indexes (Mean Opinion Score) and subjective quality assessment Then output score of neural network is compared with Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of the Human Visual system.

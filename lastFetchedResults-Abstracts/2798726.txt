Enterprise decision-making ability play an important role in the enterprise competitiveness. In this paper, using a combination method of Analysis Network Process (ANP) and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), which called ANP-DEMATEL method, we analyze the influencing factors of decision-making ability for marine engineering equipment manufacturing enterprise. Based on ANP-DEMATEL method, we firstly determine the secondary influencing factors of decision-making ability. The four main influencing factors include external environment, endogenous elements, objective conditions, subjective qualities. Then structure the hierarchy model and propose the relationship between the secondary sub-factors. Finally, using the Matlab software, we analyze the data of influencing relationship and put forward the suggestions and countermeasures of improving the decision-making ability for marine engineering equipment manufacturing enterprise.

Superfine grinding technology is a new type of food processing that is employed to produce powders with outstanding properties such as high solubility, dispersion, adsorption, chemical reactivity and fluidity. The objective of this work was to study the superfine grinding technology on the silver carp bone and to optimize the operational parameters. The optimum processing conditions of superfine grinding were: feeding pressure of 0.85 MPa, grinding pressure of 1.0 MPa, feeding rate of 0.0325 g/s, feeding particle size of 150–300 μm and one pass through the grinder. Silver carp bone powder with average particle size (D50) of 7.65 μm was produced at these conditions. It was found that the smaller particle size of the powder, the higher its fluidity, solubility, solubility of protein, electric conductivity and water holding capacity of the powder were. So the quality of the products produced by the superfine grinding technology was said to be improved.

The paper presents a multi-purpose AC-AC power converter with thyristors applying the principles of soft switching. The proposed converter operates with a high-internal frequency of about 10 kHz applying low-cost and efficient thyristor switches. One objective is to improve the technology of polyphase AC power converters with controllable four-quadrant operation. The main content of this paper concerns the control of the external waveforms by means of a nonuniform and aperiodic sampling process. By simplifying the various modes of transfer of electrical energy through the converter, a simple and practical solution for the digital control electronics for a high-frequency AC-AC converter is realized. A resonant six-switch and twelve-switch DC-AC and AC-AC power converter topology is implemented. Results from simulation and experiments are presented

With the ever-increasing diversity of data related to highspeed milling, a need is bound to be felt to integrate them at a single platform, so as to be effective for industrial use. In this paper, an approach, to convert the heap of diverse and varied HSM data to a comprehensive knowledge-base has been presented. The system comprising of this knowledge-base along with fuzzy reasoning mechanism, for the purpose of optimizing parameters in HSM of hardened steels has been named as EXHARMIL. Expert system shell of fuzzy CLIPS and the strategy of ´stepwise determination of parameters´ has been used for the development of this system. The system provides the optimal values for speed, feed, depths of cut, tool-substrate, its coating, tool geometry and prediction of tool-life, surface-integrity and more, according to workpiece material, intended objective, and other inputs provided to it.

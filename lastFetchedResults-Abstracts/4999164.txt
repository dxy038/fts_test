The objective of this research is to develop an AI (artificial intelligence)-based CAD/CAM system which can systematically analyze the clinical, human, and design factors and automatically generate the specifications for the manufacture of a user-specific nonvocal communication device. AI techniques are integrated with standard CAD/CAM technologies to incorporate the system with both objective and subjective knowledge. This extends engineering analytical approaches beyond the systematic analysis of not only the system design factors, but also the clinical and human factors. It is expected this will lead to better design and lower production cost of the nonvocal communication devices for individuals with various disabling conditions

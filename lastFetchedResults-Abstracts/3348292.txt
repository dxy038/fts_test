Forward error correction techniques are commonly used for delay-sensitive video streaming applications. Streaming of compressed videos can usually withstand a certain level of packet loss, depending on the compression methods and error concealment techniques. In this paper, a QoS-driven optimization algorithm is proposed for the streaming of scalable videos using layer-aligned multipriority rateless codes over wideband wireless channels. Layer-aligned multipriority rateless codes provide controllable protection strengths for different layers of a scalable video. The coding is based on the N-cycle layer-aligned overlapping structure where each layer of scalable videos is protected by N windows. The objective of the proposed method in this paper is to decide a coding strategy by minimizing the total data rate for scalable video streaming, while fulfilling userÂ´s expectation of desired recovery rates of different video layers. The developed QoS-driven optimization algorithm is based on the prediction model of layer-aligned multipriority rateless codes. Its better performance is verified with simulations and real-world experiments over 4G wireless networks.

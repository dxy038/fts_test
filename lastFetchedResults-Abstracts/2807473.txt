Allocation of flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) devices to an electric power transmission network may be formulated as a nonlinear mathematical program. Solving such a nonlinear program for a large transmission network is computationally very expensive, and obtaining the optimal solution may be impossible. We present a Taylor series expansion approximation of the nonlinearities of the problem and propose a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for finding the optimum location and proper settings of a Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) in an electric power network. The objective of this problem is to minimize total generation cost based on the DC load flow model. The proposed method is implemented for the 118-bus IEEE test case and the results are discussed.

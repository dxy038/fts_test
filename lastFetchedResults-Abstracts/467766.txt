Objective: We evaluated the effect of lipid peroxidation on the calcium adenosine triphosphatase activity of red blood cell ghosts from normotensive pregnant women and compared it with the adenosine triphosphatase activity and lipid peroxidation in preeclampsia.
Study Design: Ten nulliparous normotensive and 10 nulliparous preeclamptic pregnant women (38 to 39 weeks of gestation) were used as blood donors. Preeclampsia was diagnosed on the basis of blood pressure (>140/90 mm Hg) and proteinuria (>0.5 gm of urinary protein per day). Red blood cell ghosts were prepared for both groups and used for calcium adenosine triphosphatase activity and lipid peroxidation determinations. Control ghosts (normotensive) were irradiated with ultraviolet light for different lengths of time.
Results: Calcium adenosine triphosphatase activity of red blood cell ghosts from normotensive women is sensitive to lipid peroxidation. The lipid peroxidation of red blood cell ghosts from preeclamptic women is higher than that from normotensive women.
Conclusion: The diminution of the calcium adenosine triphosphatase activity with preeclampsia could be explained by the sensitivity of this adenosine triphosphatase to lipid peroxidation.

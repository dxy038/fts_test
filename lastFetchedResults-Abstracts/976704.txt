With objective to enhance luminescence intensities of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), we hereby report the attachment of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) on to the surface of shortened Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes (sMWCNTs). The resultant QDs–sMWCNTs nanohybrid complex have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, optical microscopy (OM), ultraviolet (UV) light, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) diffraction spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Based on IR peaks characteristics of organic functional groups, optical brightness of sMWCNTs under polarized and UV light, the roughness of the sMWCNTs surface as observed in SEM images and black spots observed on the surface of sMWCNTs in TEM images, it is reasonable to conclude that CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were attached on to the surface of sMWCNTs. Additionally, signals of Zn, S, Cd and Se along with carbon on the surface of sMWCNTs in EDX data and onset of thermal degradation of QDs–sMWCNTs nanohybrid complex at much lower temperature than that of sMWCNTs under TGA analysis further confirms the formation of QDs–sMWCNTs nanohybrid complex.

This paper presents the error concealment (EC) feature implemented by the authors in the test model of the draft ITU-T video coding standard H.26L. The selected EC algorithms are based on weighted pixel value averaging for INTRA. pictures and boundary-matching-based motion vector recovery for INTER pictures. The specific concealment strategy and some special methods, including handling of B-pictures, multiple reference frames and entire frame losses, are described. Both subjective and objective results are given based on simulations under Internet conditions. The feature was adopted and is now included in the latest H.26L reference software TML-9.0.

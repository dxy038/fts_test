The design of a deflection network node is presented. Users can access the network via a bidirectional parallel port or through an interface to a local area network. The characteristics of the devices implementing the different functions and their interconnection are taken into consideration. One of the most critical steps is the design of a dedicated VLSI chip performing the switching function; this aspect is also outlined

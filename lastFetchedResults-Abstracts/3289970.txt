The Chinese social informationization should start from the premise that the E-Commerce risk is scientifically assessed. Through introducing axiomatic credibility measure and classical analytic hierarchy process, we construct a multilevel risk assessment model based on credibility theory. For the complexity of multi-objective decision making in the process of E-commercial risk assessment, we have established the multilevel indicators system, and then have evaluated the ECommerce risk by the risk assessment model proposed in this paper, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the model. The multi-level risk assessment model based on credibility theory can effectively avoid subjective problem for selecting membership function in fuzzy evaluation, and thus the result of assessment is more scientific and objective.

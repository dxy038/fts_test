The primary objective of this research was to determine changes in body and joint stiffness parameters and kinematics of the knee and body center of mass (COM), that result from wearing a backpack (BP) with a 40% body weight load at increasing speeds of walking. It was hypothesized that there would be speed and load-related increases in stiffness that would prevent significant deviations in the COM trajectory and in lower-extremity joint angles. Three independent biomechanical models employing kinematic data were used to estimate global lower-extremity stiffness, vertical stiffness and knee joint rotational stiffness in the sagittal plane during walking on a treadmill at speeds of 0.6–1.6 m s−1 in 0.2 m s−1 increments in BP and no backpack conditions. Kinematic data were collected using an Optotrak, three-dimensional motion analysis system. Knee angles and vertical excursion of the COM during the compression (loading phase) increased as a function of speed but not load. All three estimates of stiffness showed significant increases as a function of both speed and load. Significant interaction effects indicated a convergence of load-related stiffness values at lower speeds. Results suggested that increases in muscle-mediated stiffness are used to maintain a constant vertical excursion of the COM under load across the speeds tested, and thereby limit increases in metabolic cost that would occur if the COM would travel through greater vertical range of motion.

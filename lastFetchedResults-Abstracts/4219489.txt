Matrix Converter, a direct AC/AC Converter replaces the multiple conversion stages and the intermediate energy storage element of the indirect converters by a single power conversion stage, thus being a single stage converter. Matrix Converters employ an array of controlled bidirectional switches as the main power elements to create a variable output voltage system with unrestricted frequency. This paper attempts to give an overview of Matrix Converters and examines the types, features, merits and limitations of such Converters. It presents the basic operating principle of a Single Phase Matrix Converter, Two Phase to Single Phase Matrix Converter, Three Phase to Single Phase Matrix Converter and Three Phase to Three Phase Matrix Converter. The paper also introduces a topology of a Single Phase Matrix Converter, Two Phase to Single Phase Matrix Converter, Three Phase to Single Phase Matrix Converter and Three Phase to Three Phase Matrix Converter in PSIM software environment and analyses the output of the converter for different frequencies. Further, it examines the output voltage of a Single Phase Matrix Converter synthesized using the Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) technique. All simulations have been carried out in POWERSIM.

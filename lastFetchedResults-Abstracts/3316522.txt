The objective is to analyze some of the issues in the transforming landscape of distribution networks, especially micro grids, and some power quality implications - the harmonic distortion levels and reduction methods with increased penetration levels of the Photovoltaic Generators (PVGs) in the distribution network. This paper has shown that the worst voltage distortion may be found to be outside the acceptable level of the IEEE Standard 519. The investigation is carried while PVGs are added into network at different capacities and a variety of locations. The analyses presented herein can be applied to any utility at a system planning stage.

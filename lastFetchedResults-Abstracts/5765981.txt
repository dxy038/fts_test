As we know in land battle tank member must perform many diverse tasks in their missions: navigation, system control, enemy engagement, and communication. As human capabilities are limited, the members will find themselves in situations where task load and other factors raise their mental burden severely. In turn, such stress has documented effects on quantitative and qualitative changes in task performance that could lead to mission failure. This paper describes the process of simulating tank member in a mission where mental burden is a key factor to the outcome of performance. Mental burden is represented as a behaviors moderator, which can be manipulated to demonstrate and predict behavioral effects. The cognitive models of the tank member are implemented as agents, interacting with tanks in a simulated battlefield. With high empirical validity as a main objective, the data acquired for the model was collected from experiments with tank member, including observations and task analyses. Afterwards, the simulation was verified with two subject matter experts.

The problem addressed in this paper is how to design an efficient network protocol specially suited for SFN based master-slave PLC system [Bumiller, G, 2002]. Since the power-line is a complex medium not suited for data transmission, hence classical routing is not efficient For this purpose, and thanks to the physical layer emulator [Bumiller, G, 2004] implemented by iAd, we used the simulation approach to derive important design parameters such as repeater level variation, packet error rate, etc. The understanding of the influence of these parameters allowed us to develop an efficient protocol. This work has been carried out as part of the REMPLI project (European program NNE5-2001-00825, www.Rempli.org). The main objective of REMPLI is to develop a distributed infrastructure suitable for real-time monitoring and control of energy distribution and consumption. PLC technology has been chosen to form the main communication infrastructure.

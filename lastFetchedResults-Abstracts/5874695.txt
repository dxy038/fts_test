The objective of this paper is to develop an intelligent autonomous mobile robot to reach a set destination without human intervention, in an environment not specially designed for it. A fuzzy navigational algorithm using a mapped environment is developed for the intelligent system. The navigational algorithm uses a layered motion controller. The motion controller is made up of three layers. The first layer, Orientation layer, assists the robot in keeping it pointed in the general direction of the goal frame to achieve the final destination. The second layer, PD (Proportional-plus-Derivative) layer, directs the robot through passageways efficiently. Depending on the type of passageways, there are three different modes that the robot may use: Wall-Hugging, Centering and Blind modes. The third layer is the obstacle avoidance layer. Ultrasonic sensors are used for obstacle avoidance and to counter unexpected changes in the environment. A basic platform has been developed for this robot that uses a modular approach. It consists of three separate modules, the supervisor module, the motor driver module, and the sensor module.

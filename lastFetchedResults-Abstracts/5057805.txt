In this work, we analyze different approaches to store the coefficient twiddle factors for different stages of pipelined Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). The analysis is based on complexity comparisons of different algorithms when implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and ASIC for different radix-2<sup>i</sup> algorithms. The objective of this work is to investigate the best possible combination for storing the coefficient twiddle factor for each stage of the pipelined FFT.

Web forums are a huge data source. They allow people to interact with unknown individuals. Studying forums shows that the interaction is not obvious only through the structure but also through the content of the post. Taking into account this observation, we extract a social network with different kinds of relationships i.e. the structural relation, the name and the text quotations relation. We present here the promising results we obtain, and the difficulties we face while extracting the quotations in this kind of textual content. These results are obtained from real data (from two information websites) which make the validation difficult. So, we create a validation protocol composed of two steps and based on human raters. Finally, we will see the objective of this work which is understanding interactions in order to extract the social roles of individuals.

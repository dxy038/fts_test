There is need to investigate new technological directions to make the metro network more efficient at a lower cost. We have proposed a Packet-Optical Add/Drop Technology combining packet granularity and optical bypass to reach this objective. A system analysis shows that this new technology requires less transmitters/receivers than any other alternative technology, reducing the cost and the overall power consumption.

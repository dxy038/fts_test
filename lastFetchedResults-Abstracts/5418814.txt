A new approach to using distributed intelligent system techniques for air-traffic control facilities maintenance is developed, and the intelligent maintenance support system (IMSS) architecture is proposed. The primary objective is to use an interdisciplinary approach to identifying the opportunity for applying existing and emerging technologies to facilitate automation of maintenance support operations for air-traffic control facilities. The IMSS framework, which includes several individual expert systems, numerical processing programs, and a metasystem to coordinate these software programs, is developed. IMSS can serve in an advisory or consultant capacity, making the best use of both human and machine intelligence

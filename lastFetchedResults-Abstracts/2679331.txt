This paper presents a method for optimizing the design cost of a doubly
reinforced High Strength Concrete (HSC) T-beam. The objective function used in the
model includes the costs of HSC, steel, and formwork. The constraint functions are set
to satisfy design requirements of Eurocode 2 (EC-2). The cost optimization process is
developed by the use of the Generalized Reduced Gradient algorithm. An example problem
is considered in order to illustrate the applicability of the proposed design model and
solution methodology. It is concluded that the present approach is economically more
eective when compared to conventional design methods and can be extended to deal with
other sections without major alterations.

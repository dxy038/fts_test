The paper is based on the results achieved on a project for the MECE5 82 (Smart Materials) and EE565 (Introduction to Robotics) courses at the University of Alberta. The objective of this project is simple: designing a robotic arm actuated by shape memory alloys. First we designed the arm. We then studied its workspace, kinematics, dynamics and control. Then we designed the actuation, using shape memory alloys. Finally, from the results of the actuation, we optimized the design of the arm to increase its performance.

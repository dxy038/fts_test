This paper describes a landuse modelling approach developed for the Makiling Forest Reserve in the Philippines. The process includes application of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) but extends this approach to include objective process based modelling – in the form of the universal soil loss equation (USLE) – in the subjectively oriented framework of AHP. A geographic information system was used for data assembly and to define decision zones and a PC based interface developed to accommodate interactive application of the AHP and USLE models. Having successfully combined the objective and subjective elements for evaluation of landuse alternatives, the paper explores the options for landuse allocation based on the suitability assessments of a participating decision group.

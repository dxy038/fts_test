Under voltage load shedding is one of the most important tools to avoid voltage instability. In this paper an optimal load shedding algorithm is developed. This approach is based on the concept of the static voltage stability margin and its sensitivity value at the maximum loading point or the collapse point. The traditional load shedding objective is extended to incorporate both technical and economical effects of load shedding. The voltage stability criterion is modeled as a soft constraint into load shedding scheme. The proposed methodology is implemented over the IEEE14 bus system and solved using a mathematical (GAMS/CONOPT) and two heuristic (P.S.O &amp; GA) methods

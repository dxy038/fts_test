As research in biped gait, human interaction, and social robotics expands, hardware to explore these fields is becoming valuable. The high cost and risk of full-sized humanoid robots prevents many small laboratories for exploring these areas, however. In recent years, many models of miniature humanoid robot have been introduced to the pro-sumer market. These small humanoid robots cost 1000 to 2000 USD. They are easy to operate and maintain, yet lack articulation and processing power of full-size humanoids. The objective of the authors´ research is to implement a miniature humanoid robot as a surrogate for larger humanoid robotics. To demonstrate this, a miniature humanoid was used to explore creativity and dance with a humanoid robot. The authors´ particular interest in humanoids is dance as an expression of creativity and hence intelligence. To move beyond preprogrammed choreography requires the ability to listen to music, interpret rhythm and express a message through dance. Employing miniature humanoids as surrogate test platforms reduces risk before algorithms are ported to full-size ones. Experimental results are presented that support the viability of this approach.

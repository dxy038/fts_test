The expanded job-shop scheduling problem (EJSSP) is a practical production scheduling problem with processing constraints that are more restrictive and a scheduling objective that is more general than those of the standard job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP). A hybrid approach involving neural networks and genetic algorithm (GA) is presented to solve the problem in this paper. The GA is used for optimization of sequence and a neural network (NN) is used for optimization of operation start times with a fixed sequence.
After detailed analysis of an expanded job shop, new types of neurons are defined to construct a constraint neural network (CNN). The neurons can represent processing restrictions and resolve constraint conflicts. CNN with a gradient search algorithm, gradient CNN in short, is applied to the optimization of operation start times with a fixed processing sequence. It is shown that CNN is a general framework representing scheduling problems and gradient CNN can work in parallel for optimization of operation start times of the expanded job shop.
Combining gradient CNN with a GA for sequence optimization, a hybrid approach is put forward. The approach has been tested by a large number of simulation cases and practical applications. It has been shown that the hybrid approach is powerful for complex EJSSP.

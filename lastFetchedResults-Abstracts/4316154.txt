This paper addresses the problem of decentralized robust output-feedback control with disturbance attenuation for a class of large-scale dynamic systems with strong nonlinear interconnections. The control objective consists of achieving internal global asymptotic stability in the sense of Lyapunov and external stability in the sense of SontagÂ´s input-to-state stability and integral-input-to-state stability properties. A novel systematic algorithm is proposed to construct a decentralized output-feedback controller which achieves the desired goals for all systems within the considered class

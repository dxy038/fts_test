Background: Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glandular and stromal cells
outside of the uterine cavity. Our previous study showed that in vitro culture of human
endometrial tissue in a three-dimensional (3D) fibrin matrix could mimic the early
stages of endometriosis with invasion, gland and stroma formation and sprouting of new
vessels.
Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the expression of
aromatase in in vitro cultured endometrial fragments.
Materials and Methods: Endometrial samples obtained from the fundus of the uterine
cavity of ten normal ovulating women on cycle days19-24 that referred to Toronto
Center for Advanced Reproductive Technology (T.C.A.R.T) for infertility treatment and
cultured in vitro by a three-dimensional fibrin matrix culture system. Cultures were
performed in 24-well culture plates.
Results: After 4 weeks, the tissues were fixed and blocked for immunostaining. They
were stained by anti-aromatase antibodies. Although a fine anti-glycodelin positive
glandular epithelium and anti-cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) positive new vessels were
detected and reported in our previous study, we were unable to detect any aromatase
activity in the cultured fragments.
Conclusion: No aromatase activity was detected in the 3D cultured endometrial tissue.
Although it is reported that aromatase is expressed in endometrial disease, it is possibly
not expressed in this phase in normal endometrium.

Abstract

Background: Rapid and efficient diagnosis is one of the crucial issues in the control of tuberculosis. Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a simple and rapid technique for nucleic acid amplification. In this study, we evaluate a LAMP assay targeting IS6110 gene for diagnosis of M. tuberculosis in clinical samples. 
Materials and Methods: 155 clinical sputum specimens were collected from suspected patients with tuberculosis. Six specific primers were designed for LAMP assay. LAMP reaction was performed under optimal condition. Sensitivity and specificity of LAMP were determined. 
Results: A successful LAMP reaction with newly designed primers was carried at 66?C for 60 minutes. The detection limit of LAMP was 5fg DNA per tube. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay in clinical sputum samples were 100% and 95.9%, respectively. 
Conclusion: LAMP is a rapid, sensitive and low cost technique that can be suitable for routine usage in diagnosis of TB.

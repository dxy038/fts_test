It is increasingly believed that substantial soil organic carbon (SOC) can be sequestered in conservation tillage system by manipulating the functional groups of soil biota. Soil aggregates of different size provide diverse microhabitats for soil biota and consequently influence C sequestration. Our objective was to evaluate the contributions of soil biota induced by tillage systems to C sequestration among different aggregate size fractions. Soil microbial and nematode communities were examined within four aggregate fractions: large macroaggregates (&gt;2 mm), macroaggregates (2–1 mm), small macroaggregates (1–0.25 mm) and microaggregates (&lt;0.25 mm) isolated from three tillage systems: no tillage (NT), ridge tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT) in Northeast China. Soil microbial and nematode communities varied across both tillage systems and aggregate fractions. The activity and abundance of microbes and nematodes were generally higher under NT and RT than under CT. Among the four aggregate fractions, soil microbial biomass and diversity were higher in microaggregates, while soil nematode abundance and diversity were higher in large macroaggregates. Structural equation modelling (SEM) revealed that the linkage between microbial and nematode communities and their contributions to soil C accumulation in &gt;1 mm aggregate fractions were different from those in &lt;1 mm aggregate fractions. Higher abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) could enhance C retention within &gt;1 mm aggregates, while more gram-positive bacteria and plant-parasitic nematodes might increase C accumulation within &lt;1 mm aggregates. Our findings suggested that the increase in microbial biomass and nematode abundance and the alteration in their community composition at the micro-niche within aggregates could contribute to the higher C sequestration in conservation tillage systems (NT and RT).

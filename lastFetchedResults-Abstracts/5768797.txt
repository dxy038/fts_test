Nowadays more and more pulsed loads and nonlinear loads are carried on the medium-voltage (MVDC) shipboard power system, the pulse and non-linear current in different frequency ranges might induce voltage oscillations on the MVDC bus. In this paper, a novel galvanic isolated bidirectional dc/dc converter based on modular multilevel converter (MMC) with energy storage and dc active power filter function is proposed which features smoothing load current on the MVDC bus. Detailed system analysis and control strategy are presented. The simulation results are provided as well to verify the operation and functionality of the proposed system.

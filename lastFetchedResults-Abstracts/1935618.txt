BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With regard to dental plaque control is always important; various methods have been proposed for this purpose. Recently, new toothpastes with propolis introduced for preventing plaque formation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of toothpastes containing propolis compared with normal toothpaste on the plaque. 
METHODS: This study was done by double blind clinical trial and crossover method on 40 dental students. Initial plaque was evaluated and recorded for each individual. The first group used propolis toothpaste (Colgate) and second group used regular toothpaste (Colgate). At the end of two weeks, plaque value was assessed by O?leary plaque index. Then toothpastes of two groups were exchanged and then they used them for two weeks. After two weeks the plaque index was measured for third time and compared. 
FINDINGS: In this study, 40 students containing 20 men and 20 women with the mean age of 22±1.2 years participated. Mean of plaque index was 74.5±7.7 at baseline. Statistically, it has significant difference in compare to amount of secondary plaque (p < 0.001). The value of secondary plaque in propolis toothpaste was 28.8±6.1% and in regular toothpaste was 39.7±6.3. Significant difference was observed between the two values. (p < 0.001) 
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that toothpastes reduce plaque index and this reduction is more in propolis tooth paste than normal tooth paste.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to develop a molecular assay to determine the fetal RhD blood type on single diploid cells, including blastomeres.
STUDY DESIGN: Polymerase chain reaction amplification of a 99 bp deoxyribonucleic acid fragment of the RhD gene or a 113 bp fragment from the RhCE gene was performed from 20 venous blood samples and 20 amniotic fluid samples and from 60 single-cultured lymphoblasts and 12 media blanks mixed in a blinded fashion. This reaction was similarly tested after whole-genome amplification on 10 lymphoblasts and seven human blastomeres.
RESULTS: Deoxyribonucleic acid amplification was successful and correct from all genomic deoxyribonucleic acid samples. Ninety-seven percent of single cells amplified: correct diagnosis was made in 96%. Five blastomeres successfully amplified. No media blanks produced amplified, contaminating deoxyribonucleic acid.
CONCLUSIONS: The RhD blood type can be determined reliably from single cells and can be used for preimplantation genetic diagnosis for the prevention of rhesus hemolytic disease.

Energy consumption efficiency is important in the design of the ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) propelled biomimetics robotic fish since it concerns about the cruising time in the water. IPMC energy consumption model is pretty critical to help improve it. Based on the physical properties of the IPMC material and the hydrodynamic reactive force theory, the energy consumption and accelerating velocity models are proposed. The model shows its precision by comparing with the experimental data. By embedding in the multi-objective compatible control algorithm, the model is applied to the energy-saving control of the IPMC propelled robotic fish. The control result shows the validity of the model and control algorithm.

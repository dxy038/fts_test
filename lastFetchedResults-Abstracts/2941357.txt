A half bridge for direct converters in high frequency link systems, suitable for integration because resonant snubber components are lacking has been designed and successfully tested in a discrete laboratory set-up using a 25 kHz high frequency link. Switching patterns for safe operation under all conditions have been found, and a special current direction detection circuit for control of the bidirectional switches was developed. Because of the utilization of natural current commutation the converter shows bidirectional power flow capabilities and the switching losses are low

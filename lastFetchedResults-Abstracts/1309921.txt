Background: Various studies have been conducted to show the effects of essences and enzymes on foodborne pathogens in culture media.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil and lysozyme alone and in combination on preventing growth of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in culture media.
Methods: In this study, the MIC of Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil and lysozyme, together and alone, on Vibrio parahaemolyticus, was determined by using macro and microdilution methods.
Results: The MIC of Zataria multiflora essential oil determined 0.01% and 0.02% by using macro and microdilution methods, respectively and lysozyme at 1000 mg/mL concentration could not inhibit the growth of V. parahaemolyticus.
Conclusion: According to the results of current study, Zataria multiflora essential oil showed better results in comparison with lysozyme, moreover Applying lysozyme and essential oil together did not decrease MIC, but extended the latent phase of V. parahaemolyticus, which considered an important factor in microbiology.

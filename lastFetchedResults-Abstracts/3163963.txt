Emotional Quotient (aka. Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EIQ)) can be described as the capacity for recognizing our own feelings and those of others, for motivating ourselves, and for managing emotions well in us and in our relationships. The primary objective of this work is to study the impact of EQ on the primary cognitive processes namely comprehension in Object oriented Systems. Comprehension is an understanding of the program code. The PG students were involved in all the experiments conducted. Java programs with various features of OO programming were given for comprehension. From the experiments that were conducted to find the relation between the program comprehension ability and the EQ values, it is identified that the EQ values have an impact on the program comprehension in the various OO features such as Inheritance and Polymorphism. The results of the experiments conducted may be used by the recruiter to carefully select the candidates for OO software development.

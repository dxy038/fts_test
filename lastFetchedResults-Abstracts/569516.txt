Plant Diversity conservation is a main objective in rangeland management. Plant diversity is a suitable index for showing the changes of vegetation in rangelands and has a high correlation with ecosystem parameters. Therefore, using this index it is possible to find the changes and manage the ecosystem correctly. The current research was performed to determine the species diversity in Fashandak rangelands of Taleghan. To do this, 110 plots each one with an area of 1 m2 were established based on randomized-systematic method and density of the species within each plot was recorded. Species properties including the related genus and family in addition to life form, growth form and biological type were determined. Shannon, Simpson and McIntosh diversity indexes were used. Results showed that diversity of Fashandak rangelands could be considered as moderate. The highest distribution frequency was related to the species of Bromus tomentellus, Hypericum perforatum and Thymus kotschyanus.

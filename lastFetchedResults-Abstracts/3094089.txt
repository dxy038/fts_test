Cleft lip is a congenital deformity condition with separation of the two sides of the lip and causes nose deformity. Evaluation of surgical corrections and assessment of prognosis in nose deformity depend mainly on doctorÂ´s subjective judgment. Development of an objective assessment tool in evaluation of the cleft lip nose deformity patients will help in advancement and evaluation of surgical techniques. Therefore, our study aimed on quantitative assessment of a cleft lip nose deformity by comparing following parameters gathered from a photographic image of a cleft lip patient: (1) angle difference between two nostril axes, (2) center of the nostril and distance between two centers, (3) overlapped area of two nostrils and (4) the overlapped area ratio of two nostrils. Assessment results of the nose deformity were statistically analyzed with evaluation results from three highly experienced plastic surgeons. In addition, regression model was developed using correlation relationship and factor analysis of parameters from the results of image analysis

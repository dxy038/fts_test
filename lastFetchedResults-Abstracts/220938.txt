In this paper, we address the issue of recovering and
segmenting the apparent velocity field in sequences of images.
As for motion estimation, we minimize an objective function
involving two robust terms. The first one cautiously captures
the optical flow constraint, while the second (a priori) term
incorporates a discontinuity-preserving smoothness constraint. To
cope with the nonconvex minimization problem thus defined, we
design an efficient deterministic multigrid procedure. It converges
fast toward estimates of good quality, while revealing the large
discontinuity structures of flow fields. We then propose an extension
of the model by attaching to it a flexible object-based
segmentation device based on deformable closed curves (different
families of curve equipped with different kinds of prior can be
easily supported). Experimental results on synthetic and natural
sequences are presented, including an analysis of sensitivity to
parameter tuning.

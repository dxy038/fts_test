As wireless technology evolves towards LTE-Advanced, the prospect of offering multimedia services such as video streaming on-demand and video conferencing to wireless mobile clients becomes increasingly more viable. Whether these applications work well depends on the efficient management of the limited system resources. In this paper, we present a cross-layer optimized coding rate adaptation and user scheduling scheme for multi-user wireless video streaming, which is aiming for maximum QoS for users, maximum system video throughput, and QoS fairness among users. Further, these three objectives are jointly optimized through a multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework. In this framework, we solve the multiple objective functions through fuzzy estimating decision-making. Finally, Simulations show that our algorithm works well for multi-user video streaming service in LTE- Advanced, and the cellular networks achieve optimal management of system resources and optimal coding rate for each user simultaneously.

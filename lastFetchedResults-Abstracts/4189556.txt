There are currently no orthopedic materials which are made to prevent either the occurrence or reoccurrence of cancer. Due to the above, the objective of this study was to create a new biomaterial which can both restore bone and, at the same time, prevent cancer growth at the implant interface. In the present study, three types of surfaces with different surface densities were prepared. Competitive cell co-culture studies showed promoted growth of healthy bone cells and inhibited growth of cancerous cells when they were co-seeded on high dose selenium (Se) coated titanium (Ti) substrates. Thus, this study provided for the first time a material to the orthopedic community which may inhibit bone cancer growth and promote healthy bone growth.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Adolescence obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) as a clustering of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are associated with adulthood type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD. The aim of this study was to compare body fat percent (BFP) and anthropometric indices for MetS and its components identification in 10 to 18 years old Tehranian adolescents.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 131 adolescents from medical health centers of Tehran. Blood pressure, biochemical measurements including triglycerides (TGs), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), BFP, and anthropometrics indices including height, weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and waist to height ratio (WHtR) were evaluated. 
RESULTS: The mean±SD was 14.5±2.3 and 13.0±2.9, (P=0.001) and the prevalence of MetS was %32.3 and %6.5, (P=0.001) in boys and girls, respectively. The highest odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) for MetS and hypertriglyceridemia after adjusting sex and physical activity were for WC, 6.27 (2.63-14.94; P < 0.05) and 3.14 (1.87-5.27; P < 0.05), respectively, and for low HDL-C and hypertension were for BMI, 2.91 (1.73-4.90; P < 0.05) and 2.26 (1.27-4.02; P=0.05), respectively. Regarding area under ROC curve, WC had the highest for MetS (AUC = 0.89) and hypertriglyceridemia (AUC = 0.88); BMI had the highest for hypertension (AUC = 0.78), and WC and BMI were both had the highest for low HDL-C (AUC = 0.78).
CONCLUSION: It seems that both WC and BMI are appropriate indices to identify the risk of MetS and its components in adolescents aged 10 to 18 years old.

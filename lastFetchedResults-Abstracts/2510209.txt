Isfahan metropolis is faced with several environmental problems (such as air pollution, reduced groundwater level, reduced quality of surface and subsurface waters, soil erosion, etc.) because of the following factors: its arid and semi-arid climate; recent droughts; air stagnation in half of the year; the increasing demand for residence and activity; capacity for tourism; rapid physical development; presence of heavy industries and mines within the boundaries of the city; etc. Hence, the present research was aimed at examining the environmental condition of Isfahan metropolis within the framework of the green city approach. This study is considered an applied study regarding its objective and is considered a descriptive-analytical study regarding its nature and method. The time and space scope of the research includes Isfahan metropolis from 2008 to 2012. In this research, in order to determine the green city indicators the Delphi method and a questionnaire were employed. In this study, the environmental condition of Isfahan metropolis was examined within the framework of the green city approach using a combination of the pressure-state-response framework and multi-criteria decision-making models. Results of this research indicated that the environmental condition of Isfahan metropolis had fluctuations during the study period. That is to say, in 2009 the environmental condition of this metropolis tended toward instability, in 2010 and 2011 it showed a tendency to stability, and in 2012 it once again declined. Therefore, it is recommended to develop and arrange the Isfahan metropolis strategic program within the framework of the green city approach and national documents in order to be able to attain the final goal of the green city approach, which is to achieve sustainable urban development and improve the life quality of citizens.

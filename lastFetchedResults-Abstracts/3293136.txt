Biomedical Engineering (BME) is one of the fastest growing fields with an impressive multidisciplinary dimension and direct consequences not only for the health care sector but for the society in general, since it is the basis of the impressive advancement and progress of health care delivery. Nowadays, Biomedical Engineers must be prepared to meet existing and forecasted needs by means of knowledge, skills and attitudes that address the demands of the work environment in the broader health care related sector. The objective of the TEMPUS IV BME-ENA project is to promote BME Education in the Eastern Neighbouring Area, through the creation of 4 joint multidisciplinary MSc programs in BME, with major positive effects in both the health technology industry and the health delivery system. The BME-ENA project will enable Armenia, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine to face the challenges of biomedical technology through capacity and institutional building measures.

To compare Persian language to other languages. Recently, there are many jobs accomplished which are concerned with contrastive analysis in different fields, such as: grammar, phonology, discourse, lexicon and even, contrastive analysis of two texts of two languages. In this study, the objective was to show Persian, Kordish measure words (Length, Width, Depth, Thickness, and Height) and their respective adjectives and also to consider the similarities and differences of the two languages (Persian, Kurdish).

In this paper we present two approaches for solving Multiobjective programming problems with fuzzy objective functions, while caring about both tractability and faithful representation of the reality. The first approach follows an approximation path and brings more efficiency. The second one pursue, an equivalence avenue and permits more effectiveness. We also advocate for an integration of the two approaches within a Decision Support System for helping adequately a Decision maker facing a problem that may be cast into a Fuzzy multiobjective program framework.

A software breadboard is a means of simulating power electronic circuits at the device-level. The objective is to obtain detailed performance information such as device voltage and current waveforms and power dissipations. The intent is to accurately model the circuit for use in place of measurements to assess performance and even in a design mode to pick component values. The issues involved in device level simulation, such as applications, problems, limitations, and advantages, are discussed. An example full bridge power converter is simulated and used for illustration

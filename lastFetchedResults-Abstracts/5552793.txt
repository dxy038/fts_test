Active filters are an effective means for harmonic compensation of nonlinear power electronic loads, which is of particular importance as utilities enforce harmonic standards such as IEEE 519. Harmonic compensation is an extremely cost sensitive application since the value-added to the user is not apparent. This paper addresses the cost effectiveness of various active filter topologies for utility interface of industrial loads and their application. Pure active filter solutions and hybrid active filter solutions are both seen to have merit in realizing a harmonic free utility interface for industrial loads rated at 100 kW to 100 MW. The objective of this paper is to present a methodology, for both the industrial user and the utility, to match the optimal active filter solution to their application

The main objective of this study was to look into the phenotypic plasticity of the semi-deciduous Mediterranean shrub, Halimium halimifolium. We studied morphological, allocation and physiological traits to determine which characters were more plastic and contribute in a greater extent to the acclimation ability of the species.

sent a phenotypic plasticity index for morphological, physiological and allocation traits, which we have applied in the most contrasted plant communities where the species grows naturally.

ypic plasticity index showed that the highest plasticity of the species was physiological, and especially for the traits related with water control. This high physiological plasticity appears mainly between seasons (September–November) rather than between sites. Plasticity in allocation traits showed intermediate values between physiological and morphological traits.

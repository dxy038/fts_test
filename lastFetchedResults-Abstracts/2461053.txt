A sensitivity analysis has been performed for a 14 MeV neutron benchmark on an iron assembly, typical for a fusion neutronic integral experiment. Probabilistic and deterministic computational methods have been used in the sensitivity calculations with the main objective to check and validate the novel Monte Carlo technique for calculating point detector sensitivities. Good agreement has been achieved between the Monte Carlo and the deterministic approaches for the individual calculated sensitivity profiles, the uncertainties and the neutron flux spectra. It is thus concluded that the Monte Carlo technique for calculating point detector sensitivities and related uncertainties as being implemented in MCSEN, a local version of the MCNP4A code with the capability to calculate point detector sensitivities, is well qualified for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of integral experiments.

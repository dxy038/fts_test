We extend our previous work on soft margin estimation (SME) to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition in two aspects. The first is to use the extended Baum-Welch method to replace the conventional generalized probabilistic descent algorithm for optimization. The second is to compare SME with minimum classification error (MCE) training with the same implementation details in order to show that it is indeed the margin component in the objective function with margin-based utterance and frame selection that contributes to the success of SME. Tested on the 5 k-word Wall Street Journal task, all the SME methods work better than MCE. The best SME approach achieves a relative word error rate reduction of about 19% over our best baseline performance. This enhancement can only be demonstrated because of our use of margin-based objective function and the extended Baum-Welch parameter optimization method.

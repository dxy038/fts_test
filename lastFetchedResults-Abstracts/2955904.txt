Many environmental engineering curricula across the nation are being redesigned to emphasize fundamentals of environmental engineering process dynamics and to acquire familiarity with the procedures for obtaining and determining design parameters for design of full-scale systems for treatment and remediation of water and wastewater. The objective of this proposal is to develop multimedia laboratory courseware to supplement these types of courses and provide students with an active learning environment in which conceptual theories can be visually observed and controlled

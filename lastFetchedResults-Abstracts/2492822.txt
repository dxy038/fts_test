Objective (s): To assess mental health in Iranian adults.
Methods: This was a national cross-sectional study carried out in 2015, in Iran. A sample of Iranian adults aged 18 to 65 years was entered into the study. The 12-item General Health questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to assess mental health. In addition to descriptive analysis, logistic regression was performed to examine the association between mental health and demographic variables.
Results: In all 19949 individuals were studied. The mean age of participants was 34.9 (SD = 11.8). Using the cut-off point score for the GHQ-12 (3/4) the findings indicated that 29.8% of the study sample reported mental health problem. Logistic regression analysis showed that older age (OR = 0.992, P  <  0.001) and having more education (OR = 0.929, P  < 0.001) were associated with better mental health. Unemployed people were twice more likely to report mental health problem (OR = 2.008, P  <  0.001).
Conclusion: The findings indicated that a considerable proportion of the study sample did not perceive their mental health status satisfactory. Perhaps reducing political tensions and creating more peaceful environment by mass media might help to improve mental health among Iranian adults.

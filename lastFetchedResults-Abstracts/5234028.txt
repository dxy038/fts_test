This paper presents a study performed to investigate steady-state operational strategies of UPFC in the Jeollanam-Do system in Korea. The objective of the study was to determine the UPFC operating points in normal and contingency conditions. The study consists of developing load flow models to simulate different load levels with and without UPFC in the system, assessing the effectiveness of UPFC by contingency analysis, and introducing corrective actions by optimization for removing voltage problems caused by contingencies. The paper describes analytical tools, model and approach. It also includes analysis and discussion of the study results. The paper contributes to the area of transmission operational studies with FACTS applications

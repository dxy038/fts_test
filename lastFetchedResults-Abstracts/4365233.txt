This paper presents an overview of a satellite image fusion system for mapping applications. The map features to extract include roads, railroads, energy transmission lines and some types of rivers. Actually, the only data source used for their extraction is aerial black and white photographs. The objective here is to fuse multi-source and multi-type information in a semi-automatic intelligent system. The used information ranges from satellite images (visible and radar) to domain-based models and expert modeled knowledge, strategies and rules

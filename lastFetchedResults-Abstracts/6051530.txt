The objective of this study is to analyze the differences between split post-crown rehabilitation system and split post-core-crown rehabilitation system. Stress distributions of the models in different rehabilitation systems could be obtained through reverse engineering, virtual surgery and three-dimensional finite element analysis. Results showed that strong stress concentration appeared at the contact position between the post and the root canal in the post-crown rehabilitation system, while strong stress concentration of the adhesive appeared between the crown and the post in the post-crown rehabilitation system.

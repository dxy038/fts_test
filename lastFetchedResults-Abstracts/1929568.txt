The objective of this study was to examine the effects of nutrition and management practices on reproductive performance in 31 Irish dairy herds participating in the Moorepark Dairy Management Information System (DairyMIS) during the period 1991–1998. Fifty variables relating to herd reproductive indices, calving events, stocking rate, disease, concentrate feeding, fertiliser usage, milk production and economic performance were studied using factor analysis. A factor analysis, followed by varimax rotation, identified 13 factors, which accounted for 83% of the total variance of the original variables. A regression model was used to predict calving rate from the orthogonal factor scores identified by factor analysis. Calving rate was defined as the proportion of services, for which an outcome was known, which resulted in a subsequent calving. Year, farm code and factor 3 (labelled herd size) together accounted for 40% of the observed variation in calving rate. The factor scores for factor 3 (herd size) were plotted against calving rate and because the plot was not linear, it was decided that dividing the factor scores into quartiles would produce a better fitting model. The factor scores for herd size were sorted and assigned to four equal categories (n=47 per category), from lowest to highest. The ranges in herd size according to category were as follows: category 1 (34–96), category 2 (47–103), category 3 (66–152) and category 4 (108–359). The calving rate (%), (±S.E.) was 67.0±2.5 for category 1, 61.8±1.8 for category 2, 56.9±1.5 for category 3 and 53.2±2.85 for category 4. Using pair-wise comparisons, calving rates differed significantly (P&lt;0.05) between all categories except between categories 3 and 4 (P&gt;0.05). Herd-level milk production was not associated with calving rate indicating that good management may overcome any adverse effects of high milk production on reproductive performance. Larger herds, in combination with other associated herd characteristics, are likely to have poorer calving rates than medium or small herds.

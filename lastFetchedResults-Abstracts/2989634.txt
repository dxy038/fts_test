Nowadays simulation has become one of the most used aided tools in all fields of science and technology in general. Professionals and researchers use it in their work as an essential tool. The analysis and design of actual systems, which are becoming increasingly complex, would be very complicated or impossible without simulation. So that, for the past five years the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department (DIEEC) of the Spanish University for Distance Education (UNED) have a research area of work which main objective is to promote the use of simulation as a tool to support the teaching of electronic engineering. Within this objective, guided exercises via simulation have been developed based on these principles. The project is also working on the application of multimedia tools within electronic engineering teaching allowing integrating it with simulation.

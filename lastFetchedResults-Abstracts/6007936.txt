A hierarchical control structure for optimal dispatch of distributed energy resources within different levels of the distribution network has been presented and a deterministic optimization and agent coordination algorithm has been proposed for optimizing the operation of flexible resources at the community cell level. Coordinated optimal dispatch of resources ensures that only the required number of loads/resources are dispatch at every moment, which contributes towards alleviating simultaneous load reconnection which would otherwise occur if all loads/resources were dispatched independently (in an uncoordinated manner). It has also been shown in this paper how number of cold loads and a community storage unit, could be dispatched in a coordinated and cooperative manner to contribute towards the objective function of maintaining the communityÂ´s power flow below a pre-specified threshold.

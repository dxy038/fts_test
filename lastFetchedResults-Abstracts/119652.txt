The potential of radiative transfer modelling and inversion techniques for operational uses is investigated in order to retrieve leaf area index in a poplar plantation. The 1-D bidirectional canopy reflectance model SAIL, coupled with the leaf optical properties model PROSPECT, was inverted with hyperspectral airborne DAIS data by means of an iterative method. The root mean square error in LAI estimation was determined against in situ measurements in order to evaluate the impact of different inversion strategies on the LAI retrieval accuracy. These included the selection of an optimal spectral sampling set, the exploitation of prior knowledge in the inversion process and the use of multiview angle data. We claim that the best configuration is achieved by exploiting multiview DAIS data and prior knowledge information about the model variables (RMSE of 0.39 m^2 m^-2). It is also shown that the use of prior knowledge and the selection of a limited number of bands forming the optimal spectral sampling are instrumental in increasing the accuracy of the inversion process. Our analysis confirms the operational potential of model inversion for biophysical parameter retrieval.

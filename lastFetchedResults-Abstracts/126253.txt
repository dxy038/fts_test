Introduction & Objective: Relaxation is one of the efficient methods in decreasing the occurance of ventricular arrhythmia. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of relaxation methods on the rate of ventricular arrhythmia in patients swith myocardial infarction. Materials & Methods: This study is a clinical trial in which 60 patients with myocardial infarction have been randomly divided into two, experimental and control groups. Data collecting tools were a demographic characteristics form and also a ventricular arrhythmia checklist. In order to assess the effect of relaxation, relaxation method was performed on experimental and control groups and the rate of occurance of ventricular arrhythmia was compared before and after relaxation in both groups. Results: Most of the studied cases were married with primary education level and their monthly income was more than 2000000 Rials. The findings of this study showed that the rate of ventricular arrhythmia in the experimental group was lower in comparison with the control group and this difference was statisticaly significant. Conclusion: Relaxation can be used as an efficient element in decreasing : ventricular arrhythmia in patients with myocardial infarction.

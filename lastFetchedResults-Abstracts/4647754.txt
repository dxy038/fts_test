Education in microelectronics technology ideally reaches beyond theoretical lecturing. After basic information is reviewed, practical activities allow for clarification of learned concepts. Therefore, e-learning environments in microelectronics must allow for such activities. This is not easy to accomplish due to the fact that practical experience is, for most students, available only inside shared laboratory rooms. The objective of the present project is to address this problem by granting remote access of reconfigurable hardware to students. Using this concept, students can reach real reconfigurable hardware as a part of a model within a simulation tool, in this case Ptolemy II. They can upload their own or use existing configurations to the hardware, and then make it interact with other Actors of the simulation. Such a tool enhances e-learning systems where the students can also access design automation tools, libraries, and prototyping platforms. Moreover, through these systems, students can communicate with fellow students and instructors.

The present work concerns the problem of evaluating and quantifying the severity of Parkinson disease, by means of the identification and the analysis of objective biomedical parameters direct linked to the primary Parkinsonian symptoms. Previously, a simple, inexpensive and non-invasive measurement system with a suitable software able to record, to manage and to enterprise the acquired data, has been developed (Sasanelli et al., 2002) to measure the palmar grip strength in isometric conditions. Afterwards, a study that evaluates the filtering and phase noise effects and the performances of different methods used to estimate the characteristic parameters of the palmar grip, has been proposed. In this paper the authors propose a more detailed statistical analysis to investigate the statistical difference among the several defined biomedical parameters, with the aim to distinguish pathologic subjects from healthy ones. Moreover a compared study between the results obtained in our proposed analysis technique and the achieved from standard clinical test ones, has been carried out by highlighting the more meaningful correlations

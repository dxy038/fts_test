With the rapid development of electronic products, the high-speed computing and the personal mobile terminal all make greater demands the on-chip performance. Due to the limited bandwidth, the low communication efficiency and the bad scalability, the Network on Chip (NoC) has been unable to satisfy the requirements of the applications above. More recently, the Optical NoC (ONoC) is introduced as an efficient solution. Compared with NoC, ONoC has the higher bandwidth, the lower power consumption and the shorter latency. With the increasing number of IP cores on a single chip, the study of 3-Dimensional (3D) ONoC has already entered the preliminary stage. Thus in this paper, we design a new 3D ONoC topology structure called 3D X-Torus. Next, we design a bidirectional optical router and a vertical optical router for our topology. Finally, we propose the corresponding routing algorithm. Our simulation results demonstrate the performances of our 3D ONoC topology, optical router and routing algorithm.

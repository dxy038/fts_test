Metaheuristic approaches are the most selected technique to find optimization solution intelligently in many areas of timetabling and scheduling, space allocation, decision making and others. These approaches have promised a better solution in single objective optimization problem. However, there is no revealed discussion on the issue that has more than one problem. In agricultural land use planning, we found that there are two related problems need to be solved intelligently before obtaining the main objective of optimal solution for the land. The problems are i) to allocate the resources into agricultural land optimally, then ii) to arrange the plant in the planting area in order to find an optimal layout. The solution of the both problems will utilize the land and consequently maximize number of plant to be planted in an area respectively. This paper is preliminary investigation towards optimizing agricultural land, in order that we focus on the understanding of the issues in agricultural land and solution methods by referring to the similarity of the previous researches. We also promote the solutions idea and show the complexity of the problems, and finally find that the metaheuristic approaches are a necessity.

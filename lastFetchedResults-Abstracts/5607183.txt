The objective of this research is to develop a quartz resonator as a biosensor by a simultaneous formation of double identical convex lens-type shape on one quartz blank in order to compare measured receptor data with another control surface sample without any measuring error. When one quartz plate is processed to make two quartz pockets in the identical single-sided mesa type and two blanks are machined by a dual-face polishing tool, it was discovered that double convex lens-shape blanks grow toward the same convex lens shape. After two concave quartz pockets of single-sided inverted mesa type were made on one quartz plate by chemical hydrofluoric acid etching, they were machined from front and rear sides by a dual-face polishing table. Then, it was discovered that two identical pockets in the convex lens-shape formed at the same height on one quartz plate. Furthermore, the longer the two identical concave pockets were machined by the polishing table, the higher those same convex lens-shape blanks grew with identical geometry.

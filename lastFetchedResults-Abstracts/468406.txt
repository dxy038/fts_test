Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate our institutional experience with planned cesarean hysterectomy. Study Design: In this retrospective case-control investigation of a 16-year experience, 100 pregnant women who underwent planned cesarean hysterectomy were compared with 37 patients who underwent cesarean delivery followed by a hysterectomy performed within 6 months. Results: Women undergoing planned cesarean hysterectomy did not have any demonstrable increase in intraoperative or postoperative complications when compared with the cesarean delivery plus later hysterectomy group. Primarily as a result of significantly reduced hospital stay and shorter total operative time, there was a significant financial advantage associated with a single planned cesarean hysterectomy with respect to separate operations. Conclusions: A policy to undertake planned cesarean hysterectomy for carefully selected patients appeared to produce advantages without increasing risks for these patients. Secondarily, it provided resident physicians the opportunity to learn the operation with supervision and under controlled circumstances. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:1385-93.)

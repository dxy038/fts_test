Background and Objective: Febrile seizures (FS) are the most common seizures seen in childhood with a prevalence of 2-14% in different societies. This study was carried out regarding the possibility of the relationship between serum zinc levels and occurrence of FS.
Materials and Methods: 117 children ranging from 6 months to 5 years were divided into four groups: FS (n=39), febrile patients with no seizures (FNS) (n=40), control group of afebrile patients with no seizures (AFNS) (n=32), and patients with seizures without fever (n=6). After completion of a questionnaire and obtaining blood, serum zinc levels were measured. Data was analyzed using SPSS software. Results: The mean serum zinc levels in 39 FS patients was 75.67 mcg/dl, 40 febrile patients with no seizure had a mean serum zinc level of 87.58 mcg/dl. 32 afebrile patients with no seizure had a mean serum zinc level of 89.06 mcg/dl and in 6 afebrile patients with seizure; the mean serum zinc level was 96/67 mcg/dl. The serum zinc level in FS patients was significantly lower than the other groups (p=0.002 and p=0.001), whereas the 3 other groups had no significant difference (P= 0.971).
Conclusion: Regarding the high incidence of hypozincaemia in FS, low serum zinc levels may be associated with the occurrence of FS.

Electrification of vehicular technology (EVT) is promising technology of future transportation systems. Electrification of vehicles highly depends on high density energy sources system (ESS) and high power density electric propulsion system (EPS). Suitable power electronic interface to incorporate these systems is an essential requirement. In this paper, a bidirectional non-isolated multiple input DC-DC converter is proposed as an interface between energy source system and electric propulsion system. It has the capability to operate in buck, boost and buck-boost modes bidirectional and it can incorporate different sources for energy diversification. It offers simplicity and flexibility in control and has a low part count. The proposed concepts have been investigated through simulation and validated experimentally.

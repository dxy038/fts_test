Abstract

Background and objective: Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS)is one of themost commongastrointestinal diseases.Itisafunctional boweldisordercharacterized by chronic abdominalpain and change in bowel habitswithnostructuralabnormality. The prevalence of this disease was estimated 10-20 percent in the world. However, the cause of IBS is still unknown. Because of malabsorption of   the nutrients,   vitamin may not be absorbed correctly; therefore, we aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of IBS onserum levelsof vitaminAandE.
Material & Methods:This case - control study was conducted on 94 IBS patients diagnosed by a gastroenterologist in Golestan province. The control group was selected from healthy people, who didn't show any signs of digestive problems in past two years, matched by sex and age. Fasting blood samples were collected and the serum levels of vitamins A and E measured, using HPLC method. 
Results:the mean  of vitamin A in   case  and control groups  is  57.0 ± 114.8  and  55.9 ± 23.8 µg/dl  , and  the mean  of vitamin E  in  case  and  control groups is  0.50 ± 0.24   and 1.93 ± 1.86 mg/dl, respectively . The deficiency of vitamin A andE are 7.70 and7.10percent in males and 6.76 and 3.7 in females (P  < 0.05). In general, 1.1 percent ofIBSpatients show vitamin Adeficiency and93.6 percent of them vitaminE deficiency (P  < 0.05).
Conclusion: Conclusion: In this study, a significant decrease in vitamin E level is observed in patients with IBS. Due to antioxidant function of vitamin E, the deficiency of this vitamin can increase the oxidative factors leading to intestinal damages and it is expected to decrease the amount of vitamins, subsequently.

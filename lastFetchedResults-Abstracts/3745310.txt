Analyses and experiments have been carried out on heterodyne detection at 10.6 microns with the objective of obtaining IF bandwidth capability into the microwave region. UHF and microwave measurements on the quantum-noise-limited generation-recombination (G-R) noise spectrum of compensated copper-doped germanium photoconductive mixer elements, measured under operational conditions at 10.6 microns, have shown response to beyond 2 GHz. The experiments were carried out directly at 10.6 microns using a mixer geometry and circuit arrangement intended to yield large mixer conversion gain and IF bandwidth. Engineering design equations are given for noise equivalent power (NEP) and mixer conversion gain ( <img src="/images/tex/1043.gif" alt="G"/> ) in terms of such parameters as IF noise factor, carrier transit time, carrier lifetime, mixer resistance, local oscillator power, dc bias power, etc. An expression for quantum-noise factor (QF) is defined. Graphs are also presented showing the effect on NEP, <img src="/images/tex/1043.gif" alt="G"/> , and QF of various parameters, and the tradeoffs possible to achieve high-frequency IF capability. An alternative approach is presented in which mixer conversion gain is calculated directly from the mixer <img src="/images/tex/1041.gif" alt="I-V"/> characteristic in a manner analogous to microwave mixers.

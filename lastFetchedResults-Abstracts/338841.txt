Objective. Human CD5+  B cells are the major B cell subset in fetal spleen and umbilical cord blood (CB), and their number gradually diminishes in both spleen and peripheral blood from infancy through childhood while conventional B cells increase. In this study, we investigated whether CD5+ cells differentiate from adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as well as fetal ones in immunodeficient mice.

Methods. In our system, NOD/SCID/γcnull (NOG) mice were transplanted with CD34+ cells from CB (hCB model), adult bone marrow (hBM model), and mobilized peripheral blood (hMPB model).

Results. In these model mice, a high proportion of CD19+IgM+CD5+ mature B cells appeared in the spleen, regardless of the CD34+ cell origin, 4 to 8 weeks after transplantation, while the majority were CD19+IgM−CD5− immature B cells in BM. The CD19+CD5− BM cells showed to express CD5 after the coculture with NOG spleen cells. In the sera of immunized hCB model mice with DNP-KLH, antigen-specific IgM but not IgG was enhanced.

Conclusion. Our results show that adult CD34+ cells develop into functional CD5+ B cells in NOG spleen as much as fetal CD34+ cells do.

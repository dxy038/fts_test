Objective
We used an established experimental model to evaluate the influence of intraperitoneal chemotherapy on the generation of laparoscopy-associated metastases and the effectiveness of chemotherapy.
Study design
Twenty-four nude mice underwent laparoscopy with carbon dioxide insufflation and the instillation of a tumor cell suspension with or without paclitaxel into the peritoneal cavity. Mice were allocated to 1 of the following groups (8 mice to each group): (1) controls; (2) paclitaxel given during the operation; (3) paclitaxel-given after the operation. Mice were killed 30 days after the procedure, and the peritoneal cavity and port sites were examined for the presence of tumors.
Results
Tumor implantation and port-site metastases were reduced more by the intraoperative intraperitoneal administration of paclitaxel during the operation than by administration after the operation.
Conclusion
Intraoperative intraperitoneal administration of paclitaxel may decrease significantly the occurrence of port-site metastasis and intraperitoneal dissemination in an animal study.

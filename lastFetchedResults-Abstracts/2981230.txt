Proposes an active vibration control method for multiple high-rise buildings arranged in parallel. According to the proposed method, some flexible buildings connected with control devices called &#8220;active control bridges&#8221;, are controlled through active interaction among them. This method has the merit of obtaining sufficient control force under low frequency. By this method, it is possible to control vibration of the super tall buildings against strong winds and large earthquakes. Four model buildings are connected with four actuators. The objective of this research work is to control the first bending and the first torsional mode of each building by this method. The control effect is evaluated by exciting the base of the structures with earthquake waves and measuring the response of the structures. Both simulation and experimental results show that fairly good control performance has been gained by this method

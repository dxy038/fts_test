This work has two important goals. The first one is to present a novel methodology for preventive maintenance policy evaluation based upon a cost-reliability model, which allows the use of flexible intervals between maintenance interventions. Such innovative features represents an advantage over the traditional methodologies as it allows a continuous fitting of the schedules in order to better deal with the components failure rates. The second goal is to automatically optimize the preventive maintenance policies, considering the proposed methodology for systems evaluation.

 the great amount of parameters to be analyzed and their strong and non-linear interdependencies, the search for the optimum combination of these parameters is a very hard task when dealing with optimizations schedules. For these reasons, genetic algorithms (GA) may be an appropriate optimization technique to be used. The GA will search for the optimum maintenance policy considering several relevant features such as: (i) the probability of needing a repair (corrective maintenance), (ii) the cost of such repair, (iii) typical outage times, (iv) preventive maintenance costs, (v) the impact of the maintenance in the systems reliability as a whole, (vi) probability of imperfect maintenance, etc. In order to evaluate the proposed methodology, the High Pressure Injection System (HPIS) of a typical 4-loop PWR was used as a case study. The results obtained by this methodology outline its good performance, allowing specific analysis on the weighting factors of the objective function.

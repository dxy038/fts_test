In this paper, we propose the use of black box models for the system identification of the cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of arterial resistance and of ventricular contractility and of arterial baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) from invasive, continuous measurements of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and central venous pressure (CVP), and non invasive, continuous recordings of ECG and respiration. Two crucial phases of the abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA) repair were investigated: the clamping and declamping of aorta. The objective of the present work is to evaluate and to test the ability to monitor baroreflex responses to clamping and declamping maneuvers preceding and following aneurism removal.

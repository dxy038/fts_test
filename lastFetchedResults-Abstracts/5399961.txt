In this paper, the interest is on cases where assessing the goodness of a solution for the problem is costly or hazardous to construct or extremely computationally intensive to compute. We label such category of problems as &#8220;expensive&#8221; in the present study. In the context of multi-objective evolutionary optimizations, the challenge amplifies, since multiple criteria assessments, each defined by an &#8220;expensive&#8221; objective is necessary and it is desirable to obtain the Pareto-optimal solution set under a limited resource budget. To address this issue, we propose a Pareto Rank Learning scheme that predicts the Pareto front rank of the offspring in MOEAs, in place of the &#8220;expensive&#8221; objectives when assessing the population of solutions. Experimental study on 19 standard multi-objective benchmark test problems concludes that Pareto rank learning enhanced MOEA led to significant speedup over the state-of-the-art NSGA-II, MOEA/D and SPEA2.

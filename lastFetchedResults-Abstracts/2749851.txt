This paper proposes a novel multiple-input bidirectional dc-dc power converter to interface more than two dc sources of different voltage levels. This finds applications in hybrid electric/fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), where different dc sources of unequal voltage levels need to be connected with bidirectional power flow capability. The converter can be used to operate in both the buck and boost modes with bidirectional power control. It is also possible to independently control power flow between any two sources when more than two sources are actively transferring power in either directions. The operation, analysis, and design of the converter are presented with different modes of power transfer. The proposed converter is demonstrated for FCV application using real-time hardware-in-the-loop system. Experimental results for a 5-kW system are presented, validating the theoretical analysis.

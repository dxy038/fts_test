In real-world applications, service robots need to locate and identify objects in a scene. A range sensor provides a robust estimate of depth information, which is useful to accurately locate objects in a scene. On the other hand, color information is an important property for object recognition task. The objective of this paper is to detect and localize multiple objects within an image using both range and color features. The proposed method uses 3D shape features to generate promising hypotheses within range images and verifies these hypotheses by using features obtained from both range and color images.

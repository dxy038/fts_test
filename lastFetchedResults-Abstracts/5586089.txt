The main objective of this research was to identify factors that affected worker productivity, occupational health and safety in thermal power plant in Maharashtra. Thirty production managers participated in the study. Fifty-two percent of the managers reported hot environmental conditions, 30% reported noisy environment, and 26% reported lack of resources and facilities. Managers received worker complaints of fatigue, back pain, upper-body pain, hand and wrist pain and headaches. Management (85%) acknowledged not having knowledge or access to ergonomics information. Ninety percent of the companies did not carry out ergonomic assessments. A significant correlation (p &#194;&#191; 0:01) was found among productivity indicators and health and organizational attributes. Lack of skills in ergonomics and training, communication and resources are believed to be some of the factors contributing to the poor ergonomic conditions and consequent loss of worker productivity and reduced health and safety in the Thermal Power plants.

The main objective of this article is to demonstrate the ability of our technique in estimating the probabilistic-based time-history to be used in dynamic analysis of structures. The result of using our technique is compared with that of traditional approach proposed by Cornell (Cornell, 1968), in the form of response spectrum through a case study. Good agreement of the two approaches confirms the applicability/reliability of our technique having the merit of being dynamic form to be used in recognizing the vulnerability as well as performance evaluation of exiting important structures particularly in regions with lack of destructive earthquake information such as the region under study, Arge-Bam which was highly damaged through the destructive Bam earthquake in 2003.

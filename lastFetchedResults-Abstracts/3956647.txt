This paper proposes a new topology for bidirectional multiinput direct dc-ac converter for clean-power-generation system, therefore, at the input port, a boost converter is used to meet the requirement of many distributed generation systems, such as photovoltaic, and fuel cell systems. The boost converter can increase the dc input voltage. This point results in a turn ratio reduction of high-frequency isolating link transformer. Furthermore, the boost inductor reduces the input current ripple, therefore, the saturation of the transformer can be avoided for higher output currents. The count of used devices has been reduced in the proposed converter. As a result, the cost, size, and the volume of the converter can be reduced. The reduced conversion steps increase the efficiency of the converter. The converter is analyzed step by step to show the principles of the operation in providing energy management based on duty-cycle variations. The system capability in different operation conditions has been simulated, and the simulation results have been compared with measurement results. Dynamic analysis and control design of the bidirectional dc-ac converter is presented based on nonlinear control by input-output feedback linearization.

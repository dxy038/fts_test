Three heuristic algorithms for state assignments in the design of synchronous finite state machines (FSMs) have been developed. The objective is to minimize the estimated area of the implemented FSM. The first method, called look ahead for states (LAS), chooses a state to be assigned and then selects a (locally) optimal code for the state. The second method, called look ahead for codes (LAC), chooses a code and then selects a (locally) optimal state for the code. The third method, called look ahead for states and codes (LASC), considers concurrently states and codes. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms generate better results on the average than those of several previous approaches

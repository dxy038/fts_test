Objective
mine the efficacy and speed of action of short-term psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy (SPSP) in comparison to pharmacotherapy (PhT) in the acute treatment of depression.

tudy reported on the first 8 weeks of a treatment algorithm for depression. 70 patients with a depressive episode according to DSM-IV were randomized to PhT, 71 patients were randomized to SPSP. The acceptability of the psychotherapy was greater than pharmacotherapy.
s
 end of the first 8 weeks of treatment, attrition rates were similar in both conditions. PhT-patients were better off at 4 weeks according to two of the four measures The superiority of PhT was clearer on the self-report than on the independent measure.
sions
are signs that the benefits of PhT over SPSP—where detected—are short-lived and cover mostly the first month of treatment. The progression of these patients through the rest of their treatments, and afterwards, will be reported in further contributions.

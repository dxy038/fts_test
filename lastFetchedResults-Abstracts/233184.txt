This paper provides a detailed examination of the energy and greenhouse emissions associated with the on-site construction of a selection of alternative wood, steel and concrete structural assemblies. The primary objective of the work is to ascertain the relative proportion that the construction process represents of the total initial embodied energy and greenhouse gas emissions and whether there are significant differences between the structural material alternatives.

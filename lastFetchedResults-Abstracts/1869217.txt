Mycobacterium genus includes pathogenic and environmental species, the later called as non-tuberculous mycobaceria. In this review we analyzed 42 published papers that considered the frequency of non-tuberculous mycobaceria in Iran during 1976-2013. The analyses showed there are 16 and 28 mycobacterial species isolated in water and soil samples, respectively. The most frequent mycobacterial species in water were M. fortuitum (25.4%) and M. chelonae (25.4%), and in soil it was M. fortuitum (19.7%). The most frequent species in clinical samples was M. fortuitum, too. The frequency of non-tuberculous mycobaceria in various clinical samples was different and in average it was isolated in 1.1% of tuberculosis suspected patients that refferd to the healthcare centers.

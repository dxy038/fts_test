A linear FM sonar system was developed to support the objective of remote acoustic classification of seafloor sediments. It is a calibrated, wideband, digital, frequency modulated sonar that provides quantitative, high-resolution, low-noise sub-bottom data. Since the linear sonar system can precisely transmit a specified waveform, the calibrated digitally recorded reflection data can be processed to estimate the acoustic impulse response of the seabed and sediment attenuation. An acoustic pulse with special frequency domain weighting characteristics is designed to provide low temporal sidelobe levels and a nearly constant resolution with depth even after passing through a sediment with high losses such as sand. After correlation processing, the wideband acoustic pulse yields an effective beam pattern with high spatial resolution and insignificant sidelobe levels. Data sets generated with the FM profiler indicate that the required temporal and spatial characteristics of the sonar are realized in practice

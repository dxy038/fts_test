A multi-user platform, based on standards like CORBA, XML and JAVA, has been developed for remote control and data acquisition experiments. The main objective is to detach the machine operation from a single computer, allowing hardware configuration, experiment follow and data share by all the connected users. Among the main features it has a built-in chat, profile saving and sharing and remote calculation invocation. Since it was developed in JAVA and deployed with JAVA Web-Start technology, it can run in all the most common operating systems and computer platforms like PCs, Solaris and Mac in a very intuitive way. The software is plugin based, providing an easy way of adding new hardware, data viewers and data calculation algorithms

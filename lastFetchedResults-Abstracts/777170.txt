The main objective of the present study was to assess the photocatalytic degradation over TiO2 of an aqueous solution containing
20 mg L 1 of the antibiotic Oxytetracycline (OTC) using simulated solar radiation, seconded by a solar radiation experiment carried
out in a pilot plant equipped with Compound Parabolic Collectors (CPCs) under the optimal conditions found in preliminary lab-scale
experiments. These comprehended a set of 1 L aqueous experiments with TiO2 loads ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 g L 1 starting from different
initial pH values. These experiments were carried out in a Solarbox equipped with a 1000 W Xe-OP lamp. OTC degradation was followed
by HPLC-DAD, while its mineralization was followed by the removal of Total Organic Carbon.
Results suggested that 0.5 g L 1 of TiO2 with no initial pH adjustment (pH   4.4) was the best combination for the removal of bothOTC
(100% after 40 min of irradiation; 7.5 kJ L 1 of UV dose) and TOC (>90% after 180 min of irradiation; 38.3 kJ L 1 of UV dose). Under
these conditions, theBOD5/COD ratio rose from almost 0 to nearly 0.5, showing a remarkable improvement in biodegradability, while inhibition
percentage of bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri after 15 min of exposition measured by Microtox  decreased significantly from 35%
down to 7%. A scheme of the OTC degradation pathway is proposed, based on the results obtained from this particular experiment.
The solar photocatalytic experiment done under the same conditions was carried out in a solar pilot plant equipped with CPCs. OTC
and TOC removal was followed as a function of accumulated UV energy entering the reactor. Results showed a 100% OTC and almost
80% TOC removal with 1.8 kJ L 1 and 11.3 kJ L 1 of photo treatment energy, respectively.

In this paper, we are interested first in the application of variables structures control for induction motor. This type of control is applied to replace the speed PI controller in the vector control scheme; this is done in order to give more robustness of the overall process towards internal parameter variations and external disturbances. However, this technique has a major inconvenient called &#8220;chattering phenomenon&#8221;. To overcome this later, we propose a new control scheme based on synergetic control technique. Indeed, the simulation results have shown the benefits of this new technique, especially in terms of elimination of chattering which is the main objective of this article.

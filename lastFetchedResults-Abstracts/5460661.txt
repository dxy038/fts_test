This paper provides a high secured authentication system based on biometric authentication using microcontrollers. The main objective of the project is to design a two layer biometric authentication system. The authentication kernel is built of two layers namely fingerprint authentication voice recognition and logical control unit The layers are implemented separately and are interfaced to the kernel using standard board. The authentication and controlling task of the embedded biometric system consists of two microcontrollers controlling each task separately. Another logical microcontroller controls the output of all the tasks. After completion of one authentication process the control switches over to the next authentication process. Failure of any one process causes the system to be stopped. The designed fingerprint sensor is based on the formulation of active capacitance sensor. New chip architecture is proposed that integrates the sensor and microprocessor in a single chip.

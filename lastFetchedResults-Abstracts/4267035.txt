To solve nonlinear multi-objective dynamic optimization problem originates from process control, a modified frame of dynamic modular multivariable controller based on lexicographic optimization strategy is proposed, which had control modules with different priorities. A modified one-step fast nonlinear predictive control algorithm is used to solve control input in every module. Strategy of the selection of final control input is also proposed. The computer simulations on a two-tank system are carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm.

In order to support process construction in wireless migrating workflow system, this paper presents an approach based on task components for resource-limited executing environment. First, we propose a business process construction model based on the idea that the process logic is separated from the process instances, and then abstract the process generation as a resource-constrained combinatorial optimization problem whose objective is to maximize the QoS of the whole process. For the problem solving, a novel discrete differential evolution (DDE) algorithm is detailed and the simulation experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

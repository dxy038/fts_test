The objective of reconfiguration is to re-route power during failure or compromised conditions to improve fight through capability and survivability. Rapid algorithms for the task may serve the dual purpose of managing power flow under dynamic load change. Among the critical constraints of power redirection is the line current rating. Reconfiguration algorithms serve an equally useful task in system grid design. An exhaustive search optimization routine can be used to specify grid layout necessary to guarantee 100% performance in the face of single and multiple line loss. A genetic optimization routine is employed to determine required line rating and switch configuration during generator loss to satisfy critical load demands. The combination of these tests results in line current rating and switch locations necessary for reliable ship operation for the least cost.

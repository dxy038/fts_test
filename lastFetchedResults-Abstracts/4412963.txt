In this paper, we presented a novel quantification tool for the mental engagement of patients during rehabilitation. This method is based on eye-movement analysis, which can perform automatic, objective, and real-time quantification with a simple setup. Using this quantification tool, the therapists can monitor the patients´ engagement in real time and adjust the rehabilitation exercises to maintain the patients´ engagement at a certain level for the best rehabilitation outcome. A preliminary study was performed, in which the presented method successfully distinguished the different engagement levels in different rehabilitation games.

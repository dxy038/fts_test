Virtual screening of a library of commercially available compounds versus the structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lumazine synthase identified 2-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydrobenzo[cd]indole-6-sulfonamido)acetic acid (9) as a possible lead compound. Compound 9 proved to be an effective inhibitor of M. tuberculosis lumazine synthase with a Ki of 70 μM. Lead optimization through replacement of the carboxymethylsulfonamide sidechain with sulfonamides substituted with alkyl phosphates led to a four-carbon phosphate 38 that displayed a moderate increase in enzyme inhibitory activity (Ki 38 μM). Molecular modeling based on known lumazine synthase/inhibitor crystal structures suggests that the main forces stabilizing the present benzindolone/enzyme complexes involve π–π stacking interactions with Trp27 and hydrogen bonding of the phosphates with Arg128, the backbone nitrogens of Gly85 and Gln86, and the side chain hydroxyl of Thr87.

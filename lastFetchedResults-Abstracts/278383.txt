Inverse dynamic optimization is a popular method for predicting muscle and joint reaction forces within human musculoskeletal joints. However, the traditional formulation of the optimization method does not include the joint reaction moment in the moment equilibrium equation, potentially violating the equilibrium conditions of the joint. Consequently, the predicted muscle and joint reaction forces are coordinate system-dependent. This paper presents an improved optimization method for the prediction of muscle forces and joint reaction forces. In this method, the location of the rotation center of the joint is used as an optimization variable, and the moment equilibrium equation is formulated with respect to the joint rotation center to represent an accurate moment constraint condition. The predicted muscle and joint reaction forces are independent of the joint coordinate system. The new optimization method was used to predict muscle forces of an elbow joint. The results demonstrated that the joint rotation center location varied with applied loading conditions. The predicted muscle and joint reaction forces were different from those predicted by using the traditional optimization method. The results further demonstrated that the improved optimization method converged to a minimum for the objective function that is smaller than that reached by using the traditional optimization method. Therefore, the joint rotation center location should be involved as a variable in an inverse dynamic optimization method for predicting muscle and joint reaction forces within human musculoskeletal joints.

As the development of in-car electronics and automatic parts, the capacity of current 14 V voltage system no longer meets the demand of onboard devices. An upgrade is imminent. In order to be backward compatible with the existing system (14 V) and not to introduce extensive modification, a dual 14/42 V system is being developed as a compromising solution. Based on this new system, this article proposes a new bidirectional DC/DC converter. An experimenting model based on UC3525 controller has been built. Research on stability, reliability, and capability etc indicate that under changing power directions, this new converter is able to conduct closed-circuit control depending on current direction without changing the hardware control system of the vehicle.

Inroduction & Objective: The purpose of current research is to study effect of a selected endurance training period on alanineaminotransferase (ALT) of plasma in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Materials and Methods: So 20 subjects (10 males & 10 females) were grouped randomly to 10 people experimental group and 10 people control group. The experimental subjects participated in 12 week endurance training (3 day a week, each session 45 minute and at 60% maximal heart rate) despite of control group. Blood sampling was done before and after 12 week period in order to measure plasma ALT using the colorimetric method. Data were analyzed using dependent and independent paired t-tests at   significance level. 
Results: The results of research demonstrated that endurance training period cause significant reduction on ALT of plasma in experimental group, while that wasn't changed in control group. 
Conclusion:It was concluded that we can utilize to perform endurance training to reduce ALT of plasma in NAFLD and improve them.
Key words: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Selected Endurance Training Period, Alanineaminotransferase (ALT) of Plasma

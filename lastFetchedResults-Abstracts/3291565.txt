In this paper, we consider the cooperative global robust output regulation problem for nonlinear multi-agent systems in feedback form by distributed output feedback control. The main result can be summarized as follows: assuming that the information of the leader can reach every follower through a path and the communication between two neighboring followers are bidirectional, then the problem can be solved by a distributed output feedback control law if the global robust output regulation problem for each subsystem can be solved by an output feedback control law.

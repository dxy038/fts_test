The spatial correlation among the images retrieved from distributed video sensors leads to considerable data redundancy, thus resulting in significant performance degradation in energy efficiency and QoS satisfaction. In this paper, a correlation-aware QoS routing algorithm (CAQR) is proposed to efficiently deliver visual information under QoS constraints by exploiting the correlation among video sensors. Firstly, a correlation-aware differential coding scheme is designed to reduce the amount of traffic generated by correlated video sensors. Then, a correlation-aware load balancing scheme is proposed to prevent network congestion by splitting the correlated flows that cannot be reduced to different paths. Finally, these correlation-aware schemes are integrated into an optimization QoS routing framework with an objective to minimize energy consumption subject to QoS constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves efficient delivery of visual information under QoS constraints in wireless video sensor networks.

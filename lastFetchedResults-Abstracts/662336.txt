The overall objective of this research is to investigate competitive adsorption between atrazine (AT) and dye compounds in the natural aquatic sediment. The sorbent was sediment obtained from Guanting Reservoir (Beijing, China), which contained 25% sand, 67% silt, 8% clay, and 2.06% organic carbon. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted at various Ca2+ concentration, pH levels, temperatures, and introducing conditions of dye compounds. Compared with the dye-free system, both of dyes including Congo red (CR) and methylene blue (MB) reduce the adsorption of atrazine over the range of dye concentrations examined, with the adsorption percentage of atrazine decreasing about 14–30%. And the competition between AT and MB is much stronger than that between AT and CR. The adsorption experimental data points have been fitted to the Freundlich equation in order to calculate the adsorption capacities (Kf) of the samples; Kf values range from 1.669 μmol/kg for the MB–AT sample up to 3.738 μmol/kg for the AT-alone sample. By contrast with the single-solute adsorption isotherm, both simultaneous adsorption and dye preloading inhibit the adsorption of atrazine. As for AT preloading, the impacts of CR and MB are different on the desorption of atrazine. As compared to the atrazine desorption without dye compounds, a certain amounts of atrazine molecules are replaced by MB in AT preloading system, while in CR solution AT is adsorbed strongly on the sediment and could not be replaced by CR. The result suggests that micropore constriction by CR reduces the desorption rate of atrazine.

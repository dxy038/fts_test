This study is focused on integration and operation of a single-phase bidirectional inverter with two buck/boost maximum power point trackers (MPPTs) for dc-distribution applications. In a dc-distribution system, a bidirectional inverter is required to control the power flow between dc bus and ac grid, and to regulate the dc bus to a certain range of voltages. A droop regulation mechanism according to the inverter inductor current levels to reduce capacitor size, balance power flow, and accommodate load variation is proposed. Since the photovoltaic (PV) array voltage can vary from 0 to 600 V, especially with thin-film PV panels, the MPPT topology is formed with buck and boost converters to operate at the dc-bus voltage around 380 V, reducing the voltage stress of its followed inverter. Additionally, the controller can online check the input configuration of the two MPPTs, equally distribute the PV-array output current to the two MPPTs in parallel operation, and switch control laws to smooth out mode transition. A comparison between the conventional boost MPPT and the proposed buck/boost MPPT integrated with a PV inverter is also presented. Experimental results obtained from a 5-kW system have verified the discussion and feasibility.

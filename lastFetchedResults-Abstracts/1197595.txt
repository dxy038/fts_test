The objective of this paper is to investigate the conjugated heat transfer in a thick walled cavity filled with copper–water nanofluid. The analysis uses a two-dimensional rectangular enclosure under conjugated convective–conductive heat transfer conditions and considers a range of Rayleigh numbers. The enclosure was subjected to a constant and uniform heat flux at the left thick wall generating a natural convection flow. The thicknesses of the other boundaries are assumed to be zero. The right wall is kept at a low constant temperature while the horizontal walls are assumed to be adiabatic. A moveable divider is located at the bottom wall of the cavity. The governing equations are derived based on the conceptual model in the Cartesian coordinate system. The study has been carried out for the Rayleigh number in the range of 105 ≤ Ra ≤ 108, and for the solid volume fraction at 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 0.05. Results are presented in the form of streamlines, isotherms, average Nusselt number and input heat absorption by the nanofluid. The effects of solid volume fraction of nanofluids, the location of the divider and also the value of the ambient convective heat transfer coefficient on the hydrodynamic and thermal characteristics of flow have been analyzed. An increase in the average Nusselt number was found with the solid concentration for the whole range of Rayleigh number. In addition, results show that the position of the divider and the ambient convective heat transfer coefficient have a considerable effect on the heat transfer enhancement.

Objective: The aim of the study was to develop a mathematical model of the motor nerve and the action potentials generated from its axons, in order to simulate conditions seen in neurography. The model should be used for the detailed study of the relationship between various nerve characteristics and the electrophysiological recordings obtained.
Methods: The model was developed as a software tool. The signals from individual motor units were real recordings using conventional surface electrodes. There was good agreement between the constructed compound muscle action potential and the one recorded live for the subject from whom the individual signals were obtained.
Result: A number of physiological characteristics can be changed, including the number of axons, their conduction properties, excitability properties, degree of proximo-distal velocity slowing. F-waves and A-waves can be generated.
Conclusion: The model gives a good similarity to findings obtained in live recordings. A number of physiological characteristics can be studied individually, something that cannot be done in live recordings. The model can be used in teaching and in research studies of the relationship between nerve properties and neurography parameters.

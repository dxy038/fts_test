In this paper, a model describing dynamics of Cohen-Grossberg-type bidirectional associative memory neural networks with neutral time-varying delays is investigated by using the continuation theorem of MawhinÂ´s coincidence degree theory and the properties of an M-matrix. Without assuming the continuous differentiability of time-varying delays, some sufficient conditions on the existence of the periodic solutions are obtained. The result of this paper is new and extent previously known result. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained result.

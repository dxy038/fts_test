The objective of this paper is to design a neural fuzzy controller for a four-link robot to stand up vertically and stably from a flat horizontal surface. There are a structural mechanism, a PC, a tilt sensor and three stepping motors in this robot system. The sequence of standing behavior of this robot is designed and assigned by a developed software program in a PC. The artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy control algorithm are applied to develop the standing controller for this robot. The position of the center of gravity (COG) is an important factor to determine the stability of the robot. Finally, the robot links are driven by the corresponding motors to demonstrate its dynamic behaviors successfully and automatically.

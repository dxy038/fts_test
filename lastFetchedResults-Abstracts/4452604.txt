This paper describes narrowband propagation measurements at 880 MHz and 1922 MHz at four cell sites in the vicinity of Philadelphia, PA, USA. The objective of the measurements was to compare the large cell (macrocellular) propagation characteristics of 880 MHz and 1922 MHz radio waves in heavy-urban, urban, suburban, and semi-rural areas. Investigations include coverage, path loss, and shadowing comparisons, as well as analyses of slow and fast fading. Statistical comparisons include Level Crossing Rate (LCR), Average Duration of Fade (ADF), and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of signal envelope fading.

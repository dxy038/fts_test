Choosing the active power passing through TCSC as the control objective and the other measurable signals as the feedback variables, this paper proposes an improved ANN-inversion TCSC control strategy which can linearize the controlled TCSC system into a first-order integral system in a wide range. As the improved controller is based on only the local measurements and is independent of the system´s topology and precise parameters, it can be applied to arbitrary power system topology and is easy to be constructed in practical use. By directly controlling active power through TCSC, both goals of indirectly controlling remote generator´s power angle and enhancing the system´s transient stability are simultaneously reached. The simulation results of both single- and two-machine infinite-bus power system demonstrate its validity.

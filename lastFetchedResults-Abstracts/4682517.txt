In order to evaluate digital color images and videos, many objective metrics have been developed over the years. Some of these metrics correlate well with the subjective perception of distortions caused by a given digital processing on such color images or videos. This work presents a comparison between subjective assessment and objective metric based on SCIELAB color space. Color image samples as well as color video samples were used in this work. The results point out that SCIELAB is better than PSNR when using still images. For motion pictures (videos), further investigations is needed.

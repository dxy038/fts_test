In this paper, it will be presented a strategy of localization of one mobile robot in a closed environment using the neural network toolbox of the Matlab/Simulink. The objective of the strategy is determine positions (x,y) in a closed environment, through of artificial neural networks (ANN). The paper describes the use of one of these tools, Matlab/Simulink, used in order to simulate and validate the results concerning the localization applied to a mobile robot.

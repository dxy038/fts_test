The objective of this paper is to present an iterative solution strategy for implicit immersed boundary/continuum methods. An overview of the newly proposed immersed continuum method in conjunction with the traditional immersed boundary method will also be presented. As a key ingredient of the fully implicit time integration, a matrix-free combination of Newtonâ€“Raphson iteration and GMRES iterative linear solver is proposed.

In this paper, the concept and the mathematical model of distribution network optimal operation are proposed, and a genetic algorithm based solution is presented. The objective is to minimize the system total power losses and harmonic distortion levels by properly adjusting the transformer taps changing the status of switches, capacitor banks and LC-filters, while satisfying bus voltage constraints, harmonic distortion constraints and security constraints of both capacitor banks and LC-filters. Test results on a 16-bus distribution network reveal the superiority and effectiveness of this method.

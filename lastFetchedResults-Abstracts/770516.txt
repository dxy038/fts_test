We propose an objective method for assessing the vulnerability of species and for prioritizing species and populations for conservation, especially insects. Species of water beetles from two Spanish provinces of the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula were ranked according to their conservation priority at the local, national and global levels taking into consideration a set of six variables: general distribution, endemicity, rarity, persistence, habitat rarity and habitat loss. Each variable was categorized into four ranks (0–3) of increasing risk for survival. Ochthebius glaber, Ochthebius irenae, Ochthebius montesi, Ochthebius albacetinus and Hydraena mecai were seen to be the most vulnerable, for which reason we propose they should be included in the national red list. Furthermore, O. glaber, O. irenae and O. montesi are proposed for inclusion in the IUCN red list as “Vulnerable”. These species are Iberian endemisms, with geographic ranges restricted to the southeast, and are threatened by habitat loss. Effective protection of these species requires measures directed at the conservation of their habitats. Crucial target habitats for protection in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula include freshwater streams at medium altitudes, saline streams and endorreic lagoons.

The main objective of this paper is to extend EXIT charts performance analysis technique to turbo iterative decoders with practical arithmetic limitations. We first discuss the methodology for using EXIT charts in this type of a problem. Consequently, we present numerical and simulation results for a turbo compressive coding scheme using different finite precision decoders.

The objective of the present study was to investigate genotype and allele frequencies of Calpastatin gene in six Iranian sheep breeds using PCR-RFLP technique. A total of 292 individuals (male and female) from six Iranian indigenous sheep breed namely Afshari, Ghezel, Makui, Arkhamerino, Sanjabi, and Mehraban were genotyped for identification of MspI polymorphisms in Calpastatin gene. The observed allele sizes at the investigated locus were similar to those previous reports. The genotype and gene frequencies for each breed were determined and shown to be variable among the breeds. The allele M in Shanjabi, Afsahri, Ghezel and Mehraban sheep breeds was more predominant than other allele at this locus. Highest to lowest observed heterozygosity value were 0.47 (Arkhamerino), 0.37 (Sanjabi), 0.25 (Ghezel), 0.17 (Afshari) and 0.12 (Makui), respectively. This polymorphism could be further evaluated for marker assisted selection and developed PCR methodology would expedite screening of large numbers of animal required for such studies.

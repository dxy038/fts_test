Objective
Histamine, a derivative of histidine, decreases food intake by activation of histamine neurons. The aim of the present study was to clarify gender-related differences in food intake through the histidine-histamine neuron system.
Methods

Male, female, and ovariectomized rats were fed a histidine-enriched diet or a control diet with the cafeteria method.
Results

The suppressive effect of histidine on food intake was greater in female rats than in male rats, and the suppressive effect of histidine on food intake was less in ovariectomized rats than in female rats.
Conclusion

Our results indicate that females are more sensitive than males to dietary histidine-induced anorexia.

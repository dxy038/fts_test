An algorithm is presented for the determination of loading schedules, for a 24 hour period, for a purely hydro-electric generation system. The scheduling problem is expressed as the minimisation of a nonlinear function subject to nonlinear equality and inequality constraints, and solved by a nonlinear programming procedure based on a gradient search method. The application of this algorithm to an actual system consisting of 44 hydro-electric power stations, containing some 73 turbines, is described. Typical results for this system are presented and the computational requirements discussed. Finally, the use of different objective functions, and the effects of these on power system performance, are considered

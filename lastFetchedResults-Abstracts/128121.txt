The aim of this study is to determine the pregnancy outcome and corticosteroid effects for prevention prophylaxis in pregnant women with premature labour between 34-37 weeks gestational age.
Materials&Methods: This semi experimental single blind clinical trial Study was performed on hundred 34-37 weeks pregnant women who were referred with labour pain or rupture of membrane. These women divided in two almost similar case and control groups. The control group received 5mg dexamethasone 6 hours to delivery time (maximum 4 doses). Data was entered to SPSS and analyzed by Chi-Square and T-Test.
Results: There wasn't any significant difference between administration of dexamethasone and incidence of RDS in 34-37 weeks newborn (p=O.6). The Frequency of RDS was similar in two groups (in all women: 4%) the mean weight of newborns with RDS diagnosis was 2675 Â± 263. 76% of women had vaginal delivery.
The mean weight of newborn was 2672 gr and mean gestational age was 35.4 weeks). Conclusion: The frequency of RDS in newborn with 34-37 weeks gestational age was 4% and administration of one or more dexamethasone had no effect on reduction it.

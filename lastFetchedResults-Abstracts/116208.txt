The objective of this study is to develop a low-cost manufacturing process for recycling and circulating wasted glasses into a high added value product. Waste glass was used to synthesize Mg2Si and MgO by reaction with magnesium, and Mg2Si/MgO/Mg composites with high properties were produced. In the first stage of the study, the occurrence of solid-state synthesis between magnesium and wastes glasses was confirmed. The effect of repeated plastic working (RPW) on the refinement of grains and the composites was investigated. It was demonstrated that Mg2Si/MgO/Mg composites with excellent mechanical properties could be fabricated by RPW and hot extrusion using a mixture of magnesium powder and wasted glasses.

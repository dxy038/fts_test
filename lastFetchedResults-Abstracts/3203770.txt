The consensus speed of the leader-following multi-agent system (LFMAS) is considered in this paper. An improved algorithm is given to make the LFMAS achieve a faster maximum consensus speed (maximum convergence speed) than existing algorithms with undirected topology, and some conditions to achieve this objective are discussed. Furthermore, the conditions of the LFMAS achieving maximum consensus speed with directed topology which has no directed loop are presented. Simulation shows the effectiveness and the correctness of the proposed results.

The main objective of this work is to analyze the computing capabilities of human neuroblastoma cultured cells and to define stimulation patterns able to modulate the neural activity in response to an image for controlling an autonomous robot. Multielectrode Arrays Setups have been designed for direct culturing neural cells over silicon or glass substrates, providing the capability to stimulate and record simultaneously populations of neural cells.  If we are able to modify the selective responses of some cells with an external pattern stimuli over different time scales, the neuroblastoma-cultured structure could be trained to process image sequences.

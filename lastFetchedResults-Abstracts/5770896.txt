Although numerous methods of distribution system loss reduction are available, system reconfiguration for loss reduction is one of the more promising alternatives. The size and complexity of the distribution system make real-time reconfiguration an unrealistic objective if exhaustive search techniques are to be used. This paper proposes the basis for a new method of distribution system reconfiguration for loss reduction, that has the potential to be suitable for real-time implementation. The method proposed by this paper is based upon a series of heuristic rules determined specifically for the purpose of loss reduction. Whereas in the past, heuristics rules have been used in the reconfiguration problem, the method introduced by this paper quantifies the status of the distribution system with a set of numerical indices. These indices are used to rapidly order the possible switching combinations, with respect to the potential loss reduction associated with them. The proposed method is suitable for use at the subtransmission and primary distribution levels where the network is radial in topology. The presence of transformers, capacitors, voltage regulators, and other distribution system line equipment can easily be accounted for in the proposed algorithm

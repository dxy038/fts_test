The main objective in this paper is twofold: measuring technical efficiency and indicating its determinant factors for the Iranian insurance companies. We utilize stochastic frontier function and two alternative models: the " error component frontier "model proposed by Battes and Coelli (1992) and "technical inefficiency effect" model proposed by Battes and Coelli(1995) . the parameters of both models are estimated by maximum likelihood method. Earned premium and investment income selected as outputs of insurance industry. Panel data of Iran, Asia, Alborz and Dana -the four insurance companies-over 10 years,(1922-2001); used to measure their technical efficiencies. The findings of this paper show that technical efficiency is equal to 79.30% in error component model and 81.71% in technical inefficiency model from earned premium point of view and 58.51% in error component model and 59.64% in technical inefficiency model from investment income point of view. Further results indicated that technical efficiency has direct relation with respect ratio of the number of branches located in Tehran, total assets, ratio of life insurance premium, ratio of non- life insurance premium and inverse relation with respect to ratio of employees qualified with bachelor's degree.

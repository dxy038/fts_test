In this paper, a discrete-time interval general BAM bidirectional associative memory neural networks model is considered. By employing the theory of coincidence degree and using Halanay-type inequality technique we establish new sufficient conditions ensuring the existence and global exponential stability of periodic solutions for the discrete-time interval general BAM bidirectional neural networks. The results obtained generalize and improve known results in [23]. An example is provided to show the correctness of our analysis.

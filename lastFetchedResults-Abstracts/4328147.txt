Presents a new approach to genetic programming (GP). The aim of this study is to indicate an approach to make GP fit for practical use. The objective of our study originates in the fact that human-created programs tend to be divided into subroutines that are reused frequently. In traditional GP, the program is structured as a single sequence. Moreover, there is no room to reuse the subroutines in traditional GP. There have been a few techniques proposed for dividing such programs into subroutines, which attempt to discover certain subroutines. However, the reusability of genetic programs has not yet been discussed. In this paper, we propose an approach for reusability. The proposed method has a library for keeping the subroutines in order to share and reuse them. We make use of the wall-following problem to indicate the efficiency of the method experimentally

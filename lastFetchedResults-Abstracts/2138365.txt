The phenomenon of Meyerâ€“Neldel rule (MNR) can occur in any situation which involves an activated process. However, the rule is still most commonly referred to in connection with diffusion and electrical conduction phenomena. As the rule still tends to exist in an indeterminate state between fully accepted physical law and unexplained correlation, this review presents a survey of relevant work done in this direction. The main objective of the review is to highlight the recent observations of MNR in chalcogenide glasses for different types of thermally activated phenomena and their consequences.

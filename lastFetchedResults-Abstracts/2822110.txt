Aiming at achieving robust control of an Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) system and based on an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> loop-shaping algorithm, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization framework to ensure an optimal performance. Three objectives and constraints related to the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> loop-shaping design and singular structured value are defined to optimize the robust stability and robust performance. A time-domain objective, that is Integral of Time-weighted Squared Error (ITSE), is presented to achieve optimal transient response with low overshoot and zero steady-state error. Then an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm is presented as a computational method to search for a set of non-dominated H<sub>&#8734;</sub> loop-shaping controllers automatically. Experimental results verify the optimality of the designed method.

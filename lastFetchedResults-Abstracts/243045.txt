Phase equilibrium computations constitute an important problem for designing and optimizing crystallization processes. The Gibbs free
energy is generally used as an objective function to find phase amount and composition at equilibrium. In such problems, the Gibbs free
energy may be a quite complex function, with several local minima. This paper presents a contribution to handle this kind of problems by
implementation of an optimization technique based on the successive use of a genetic algorithm (GA) and of a classical sequential quadratic
programming (SQP) method: the GA is used to perform a preliminary search in the solution space for locating the neighborhood of the
solution. Then, the SQP method is employed to refine the best solution provided by the GA. The basic operations involved in the design of
the GA developed in this study (encoding with binary representation of real values, evaluation function, adaptive plan) are presented. Several
test problems are first presented to demonstrate the validity of the approach. Then, calcium phosphate precipitation which is of major interest
for P-recovery from wastewater, has been chosen as an illustration of the implemented algorithm

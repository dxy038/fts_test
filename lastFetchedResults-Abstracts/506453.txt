The objective of this study was to compare water and nitrate losses and water use efficiency in two alternate furrow irrigation regimes (fixed and variable) with conventional every-furrow irrigation under fertigation. Field experiments were carried out at the Experimental Station of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj, in 2010. Three fertigations were applied for maize during the growing season. The results indicated that water losses in runoff were smaller in the alternate furrows method compared to the conventional every-furrow irrigation. Nitrate losses in runoff for the first, the second, and third fertigations were, respectively, 32.4%, 44.3%, and 80.3% in the conventional furrow irrigation, 31.2%, 35.1% and 40.2% in the fixed alternate furrow irrigation, and 25.7%, 32.7% and 36.9% in the variable alternate furrow irrigation, respectively. There was no significant difference between the conventional and the variable alternate furrow irrigation in terms of biomass and dry matter yields. Water use efficiency for the conventional, fixed alternate and variable alternate furrow irrigations were 1.61, 1.31 and 2.82 kg/m3, respectively. Variable alternate furrow irrigation not only decreased water and nitrate losses in fertigation but also significantly increased water use efficiency.

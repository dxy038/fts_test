In WBAN environment, it is important to achieve energy efficiency of nodes implanting into human body. At the same time, a master also plays an important role in collecting data from nodes and controlling the nodes. By maintaining a master properly, any kinds of situation can be handled. Therefore, low power MAC protocol between a master and a node is highly required appropriately. A MAC protocol proposed in this paper aims to satisfy with these requirements and improve energy consumption rate that tends to grow high as the number of nodes increases. For the efficient and objective evaluation of the proposed MAC protocol, IEEE 802.15.6 MAC is used to compare with it and we show that the advantage of the proposed MAC meet our expectation.

This paper presents the design and performance analysis of proportional integral derivative (PID) controller for the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) system using multi objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II(NSGA-II). The results obtained by this method are compared with the recently published results. The superiority of the proposed system is stated in terms of the reduced settling time and maximum peak over shoot by comparing with Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, Partical Swarm Optimizatio (PSO) algorithm, Differential Evolutionary (DE) algorithm, Many Optimizing Liaisons (MOL) algorithm. The Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) is widely used in electrical power system to obtain the stability and good regulation. The characteristics of alternator output required power transfer at constant voltage and constant current. The Automatic Voltage Regulator maintains the constant voltage up to certain level of load current independently of generator speed and load. This paper also deals with the robustness analysis of the AVR system tuned by NSGA-II algorithm is performed by varying the time constants of amplifier, exciter, generator and sensor in the range of &#8722;50% to +50% insteps of +25%.

Determination of different facies is one of the important and basic tasks of geological engineering characterization of reservoir rocks from well ‎logs and core data. Our objective is to identify and determine different facies of the South Pars Field using RBF and PNN neural networks in ‎order to perform static and dynamic simulation. These networks are utilized to identify facies of the South Pars Field for the first time in Iran. In ‎this study, we use different parameters of mentioned networks such as ‘spread’ and ‘goal numbers’ to improve networks operation. In this ‎regards, the optimum values of these two parameters were 0.01-10 and 0.02-0.04 respectively. The results show that the RBF and PNN neural ‎networks are robust means to determine and model the facies of the South Pars Field in Iran. ‎

This paper gives an X-Q nonlinear controller and CAD method for the multi-objective control systems. Then discusses how to use the X-Q controller to perform it. Finally, in this paper, an example of servo system designed with CAD multi-objective optimal design method is given. The performance checked by computer simulation shows that the performance of multi-objective optimal system is better than that of linear optimal system. The design method is simple and easy, universal and suitable for engineering design

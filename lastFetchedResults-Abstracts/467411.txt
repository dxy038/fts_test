Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify clinical signs and symptoms associated with detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in the female genital tract. Study Design: A total of 516 university students (18 to 24 years old) enrolled in a cohort study that included the collection of genital specimens for HPV DNA testing every 4 months for up to 4 years. Reported symptoms and objective clinical findings of women with and without HPV DNA were compared by multivariate analysis. Results: Acute and persisting HPV infections were not associated with discharge, itching, burning, soreness, or fissures. Clinical evidence of genital warts was statistically associated only with HPV types 6 and 11. Detection of any HPV DNA was associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Furthermore, a time lag analysis suggests that HPV infection usually precedes detection of BV. Conclusion: Most women who acquire genital HPV infection are asymptomatic; some, however, are at increased risk for BV. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:677-84.)

This paper proposes a novel multi-objective route planning approach within the framework of a Vehicle-to-Cloud-to-Vehicle (V2C2V) architecture. Time and road risk index (RRI) are both considered as metrics. To evaluate road segment risk, an accident database from the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) is processed to build a comprehensive road risk assessment model. Route planning is formulated as a multi-objective network flow problem and further reduced to a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem. A real-world case study, route planning through the city of Columbus, Ohio, is presented. The Vehicle-to-Cloud-to-Vehicle (V2C2V) based implementation of our safety-based route planning approach is proposed to facilitate access to real-time information and computing resources.

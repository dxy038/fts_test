The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of some transition metal ions on the thermal behavior of polyurethane materials. The interaction products of a segmented polyesterurethane prepared from 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, poly(ethylene-co-diethylene adipate)diol and ethylene glycol, with manganese and copper ions were synthesized and their thermal decomposition was studied in comparison to that of the original polyurethane by using thermogravimetric analysis. The activation energy of the thermal degradation was evaluated by Coats–Redfern and Levi–Reich methods. It was revealed that the thermal decomposition of the polyurethane is affected by the presence of both metallic ions and that each ion has a specific influence on the process. By modification with manganese and copper ions, changes in the degradation mechanism of the polyurethane are induced. It was found that manganese ions have a catalytic effect on the overall decomposition process, whereas copper ions reduce the initial thermal stability of the polyurethane and catalyze the final stage of its decomposition, but enhance the thermal stability of the intermediate products. In general, the influence of metallic ions on the thermal behavior of the polyurethane becomes more significant as their proportion increases.

The objective of this paper is to estimate the spectral content of coding and non-coding segments of DNA sequence by Parametric method. An attempt has been made so that by analyzing this estimated spectral content, the hidden internal properties of the DNA sequence can be brought into light in order to identify coding regions from non-coding ones. In this approach the DNA sequence from various Homo Sapien genes have been identified for sample test and assigned numerical values based on strong-weak hydrogen bonding of nucleotides. DSP analysis of DNA sequences by Parametric Spectral Estimation methods show satisfactory results.

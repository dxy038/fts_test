Objective
s work we evaluated the bone-forming potential of BMP4, TGFβ1 and BMP4/TGFβ1 mixed by performing histological and morphometric analysis. We also evaluated the immunolabelling of fibronectin (FN) and collagen type III (Col III), two determinant proteins for the early phase of bone repair.

ogical, histomorphometric and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to evaluate new bone and blood vessels formation as well as fibronectin and collagen type III expression. 112 male Wistar rats weighing 250–300 g had their maxillary second molar extracted. Sockets filled with blood clot (BC) or treated with L (empty liposome), P (PBS), BP (BMP-4 in PBS) and TP (TGF-β1 in PBS), as well as with BL (BMP-4 in liposome) and TL (TGF-β1 in liposome) administered isolated or in association (BTL) were obtained. The animals were sacrificed at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after surgery.
s
reased percentage of bone trabeculae, and a higher number of blood vessels were observed in groups BL or TL administered isolated or in association when compared to groups BC, L, P, BP and TP. Fibronectin and collagen type III analysis revealed enhanced expression firstly detected at 3 days followed by a peak at 7 days. Lower levels of immunoreactivity were observed in the sockets filled with blood clot, and treated with L, P, BP and TP when compared with sockets from groups BL, TL and BTL.
sion
esent study indicates growth factors carried by liposomes, either in isolated or associated forms, as successful enhancers of the healing process in rat tooth sockets. We also conclude that the expression of fibronectin and collagen type III increases during the early phases of bone repair.

Ergonomics is the application of scientific information related to humans to the design of objects, systems and environment for human use. The objective is to apply human characteristics to the design of computer-based work environments to reduce problems of people at work. Lack of ergonomics has serious repercussions on end-users, including physical and mental illnesses. Using ergonomics to design computer-intensive environments would maximize efficiency, productivity and job satisfaction of employees. Unfortunately, in the Government Sector in Pakistan, there is no application of ergonomics in computer-based environments, and this leads to inefficiencies, errors, and safety and health issues. The purpose of this research paper is to highlight the implications of ergonomics on employees working in a computer-based environment in Pakistan. I will be studying the effects of ergonomics on employee productivity and morale by investigating the problems that occur due to the absence of ergonomics when designing computer-based environments in Government organizations in Pakistan. To conduct the research, I aim to choose an ergonomic model organization, specifically a Multinational company, and study its computer-based environment, studying the ergonomic factors that lead to their increase in employee productivity and morale. I would use these factors to do an extensive survey of 3 Government organizations to highlight the problems that arise because of the lack of ergonomically-designed computer systems and environments.

This paper presents the development of a novel functional electrical stimulation (FES) system. New approaches in emerging rehabilitation robotics propose the use of residual muscular activity or limbs movements during the rehabilitation process of neuromotor. More ambitious projects propose the use of FES systems to restore or compensate motor capabilities by controlling existing muscles or subject limbs. These emerging approaches require more sophisticated FES devices in terms of channels, signals controls and portability. In the framework of HYPER project, such devices are being developed to support the main objective of the project: the development of neurorobots and neuroprosthetics to restore functional motor capabilities in patients who suffered cerebrovascular accidents or spinal cord injury. The presented portable FES system includes novel elec-trostimulator circuits and improved channel switching capacities to enable emerging approaches in rehabilitation robotics.

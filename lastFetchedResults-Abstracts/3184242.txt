In GSM Telecommunication networks it is important to efficiently utilize the scarce radio spectrum using a proper channel assignment scheme. The objective of a Channel Assignment problem is to assign a required number of channels to each cell in a way to achieve both efficient frequency spectrum utilization and minimization of interference effects (by satisfying a number of channel reuse constraints). Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) assigns the channels to the cells dynamically according to traffic demand, and hence, can provide higher capacity (or lower call blocking probability), fidelity and quality of service than the fixed assignment schemes. Devising a DCA, that is practical, efficient, and which can generate high quality allocations, is challenging. This paper presents an effective and efficient Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA) for the solution of DCA Problem.

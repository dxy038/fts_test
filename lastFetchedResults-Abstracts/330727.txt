Objective. The purpose of this study was to investigate the suitability of different synthetic calcium phosphate based substrates as a biomimetic enamel surface model for orthodontic bond strength testing.

Methods. Carbonated apatite, amorphous calcium phosphate and commercial hydroxyapatite specimens were prepared as substrates for orthodontic bond strength testing. Carbonated apatite specimens were prepared by pressing, sintering and treatment with NaF. The shear bond strength was measured with a universal testing machine.

Results. Hydroxyapatite, amorphous and cold pressed carbonated hydroxyapatite exhibited fractures within the substrate after debonding. Mean bond strength values for carbonated hydroxyapatite were 7.38 (1.75) MPa for specimens pressed at 300 °C and 9.55 (2.23) MPa for specimens pressed at 300 °C and then sintered at 600 °C. An additional NaF treatment after sintering resulted in lower bond strength measurements of on average 6.52 (1.03) MPa.

Significance. Hot pressed and sintered carbonated hydroxyapatite showed acceptable shear bond strength values and may represent a suitable biomimetic model for orthodontic bond strength testing.

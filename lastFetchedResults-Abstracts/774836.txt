The objective of the present study was to investigate fungal pathogens associated with turfgrass decline in Shiraz parks and other city landscapes. During 2007-2008 numerous samples of turfgrass showing chlorosis and decline were collected from different turfgrass growing regions. Several fungi were isolated from root and leaves of declining turfgrasses. The results showed that the prevalent species were as follows: Fusarium culmorum, F. equiseti, F. solani, F. crookwellense, F. semitectum, F. polyphialidicum, F. sambucinum, Pythium aphanidermatum, P. vexans, P. torulosum, P. oligandrum. P. ultimum var sporangiiferum, P. vanterpoolii,P. deliense , Bipolari australiensis, B. sorokiniana, B. cynodontis, B. spicifera, Exserohilum rostratum, Curvularia lanuta and species of Rhizoctonia solani, R. zeae and binucleate Rhizoctonia species. Pathogenicity test for each species was carried out under greenhouse condition using standard methods. The virulence of the fungal isolates was evaluated and the means of disease incidence were compared using Duncan multiple rang test. Among fungal species recovered, F. semitectum, P. aphanidermatum , R. solani AG2-2IIIB and B. sorokiniana were more pathogenic than others.

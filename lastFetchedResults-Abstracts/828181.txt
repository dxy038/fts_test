Knowledge and certainty are two key terms in philosophy, logic and epistemology with various applications. The present article seeks to cast light on the relation between these two terms. It deals first with the applications of knowledge and certainty and then with its kinds (intuitive (mystical), tendency (faith based) certainty general (general dogmatism), particular (foundationlist) certainty and more particular (necessary) certainty). 
     It also deals with other divisions of certainty such as logical certainty and essential certainty proposed by Muslim philosophers and objective certainty (proposed by Shahid Sadr), metaphysical certainty and moral certainty (proposed by Descartes), subjective certainty and objective certainty (proposed by Wittgenstein), psychological certainty and epistemic certainty which in turn is divided into a priori certainty and a posteriori certainty (proposed by Chisholm), and logical certainty and psychological certainty. (Proposed by Misbah-e Yazdi) Similarly the article looks at the relation between kinds of knowledge and kinds of certainty. 
     In addition to the above mentioned items, it explains the need to separate logical aspect of certainty from its epistemological aspect.

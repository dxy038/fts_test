On-board bidirectional battery charger is a key component in a plug-in vehicle with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability. In a high-performance on-board battery charger, volume and weight should be minimized. Battery charger topologies are generally classified under the two main categories of single-stage and two-stages. Each category has its own merits and drawbacks. This paper attempts to make a review of the existing bidirectional battery charger topologies.

Survivable service provisioning design has been an important issue in communication networks. In this work, we study survivable service provisioning using shared path based protection under a scheduled traffic model in wavelength convertible WDM optical mesh networks with Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs). In the scheduled traffic model, a set of demands is given, and the setup time and teardown time of a demand are known in advance. The objective is to minimize the total network resources (e.g., the number of wavelength-links) used by working paths and protection paths of the given set of demands while 100% restorability is guaranteed against any single SRLG failure. This problem is known to be NP-hard. We therefore study a time efficient approach to approximating the optimal solution to the problem. Our proposed approach is based on an iterative survivable routing scheme that utilizes a capacity provision matrix and processes demands sequentially. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed ISR-SRLG algorithm achieves excellent performance in terms of the total network resources used.

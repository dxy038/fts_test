The problem of robust reliable control with multi-objective requirements and static-output-feedback (SOF) form is studied for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems subject to vector-bounded nonlinear dynamics, norm-bounded disturbances and actuator faults or the loss of actuator effectiveness. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and multi-objective optimization strategy, a sufficient condition for the reliable controller design with SOF-form is developed. It can guarantee the robust stability, the given magnitude constraints on control input and system output, the prescribed level on the disturbance attenuation and the optimized quadratic cost performance of the closed-loop system under all possible faults. Thus, the comprehensive performance of the post-fault system is ensured by the designed controller. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed design algorithm.

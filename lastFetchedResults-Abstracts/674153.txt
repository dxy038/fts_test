Objective: A study of the histological events under interleukin-1? (IL-l?) induction of bovine
nasal
cartilage
(BNC)
could
result
in
useful
data
to
better
understand
the
mechanisms

involved
in

tissue breakdown in joint diseases.  The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IL-l? on chondrocyte phenotype and extracellular matrix (ECM) changes in BNC explants.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, samples were divided into two groups. Group I (control group) BNC explants were cultured only in Dulbecco’s modified

Eagle’s medium (DMEM). In group II, BNC explants were treated with IL-l? (10 ng/
ml) for 28 days. Then, samples were harvested on culture days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 and chondrocyte morphology and ECM alterations were assessed by invert microscopy and histology by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Alcian blue. Cell viability was evaluated by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay test. Data were analyzed by the t test and p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: IL-l? induced significant morphological changes in cartilage. In the presence of IL-l?, most chondrocytes transformed into a fibroblast-like morphology with a granular black point appearance. An increase in the cell: matrix ratio was observed and there were decreased numbers of chondrocytes.IL-l? induced breakdown of ECM. We observed partial
degradation
of
ECM
between
days
7-14
and
complete
degradation
occurred
between

days
21-28 of culture. The
LDH levels increased. 
Conclusion: IL-1? induced morphological changes in chondrocytes and increased destruction
of
cartilage
ECM.
There
was
a
parallel
correlation
between
proteoglycan
degradation
and changes in chondrocyte morpholgy.

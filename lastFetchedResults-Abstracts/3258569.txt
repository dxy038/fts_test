The paper presents a control strategy concept of a piston engine fueled by Natural Gas as a DG unit obtained by using an Artificial Neural Network. The control strategy is based on several factors and directs the operation of the unit in the context of changes occurring in the market, while taking into account the operating characteristics of the unit. The control strategy is defined by an objective function: for example, work at maximum profit, maximum service life, etc. The results of simulations of the piston engine as a DG unit at chosen loads are presented. Daily changes in the prices of fuel and electricity are factored into the simulations.

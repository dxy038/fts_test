This  paper  proposes  a  new  hybrid  method  namely  SA-IP  including  simulated  annealing  and  interior  point  algorithms  to 
find the optimal toll prices based on level of service (LOS) in order to maximize the mobility in urban network. By considering 
six  fuzzy  LOS  for  flows,  the  tolls  of  congested  links  can  be  derived  by  a  bi-level  fuzzy  programming  problem.  The  objective 
function of the upper level problem is to minimize the difference between current LOS and desired LOS of links. In this level, to 
find optimal toll, a simulated annealing algorithm is used. The lower level problem is a fuzzy flow estimator model with fuzzy 
link costs. Applying  a famous defuzzification  function, a  real-valued multi-commodity flow  problem can be  obtained. Then  a 
polynomial time interior point algorithm is proposed to find the optimal solution regarding to the estimated flows. In pricing 
process, by imposing cost on some links with LOS F or E, users incline to use other links with better LOS and less cost. During 
the iteration of SA algorithm, the LOS of a lot of links gradually closes to their desired values and so the algorithm decreases 
the number of links with LOS worse than desirable LOS. Sioux Falls network is considered to illustrate the performance of SA-IP method on congestion pricing based on different LOS. In this pilot, after toll pricing, the number of links with LOS D, E and 
F are reduced and LOS of a great number of links becomes C. Also the value of objective function improves 65.97% after toll 
pricing process. It is  shown optimal toll for  considerable network is 5  dollar and by imposing  higher toll, objective  function 
will be worse.

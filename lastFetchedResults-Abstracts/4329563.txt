Many interactive applications running in data centers such as web search, social networks, online gaming, and financial services are delay-sensitive, and often have a deadline. These deadlines vary across users and applications, which makes the job scheduling problem very challenging when the overall system performance needs to be optimized. In this paper, the performance of interest is the total utility gain of multiple interactive jobs, and our objective is to maximize the total utility gain. The interactive jobs arrive to the system over time, and are allowed to be partially executed before their deadlines. We focus on the preemptive scenario, where a job in service can be interrupted by other jobs, and its service can be resumed later. We propose a deadline agnostic scheduler, called ISPEED (Interactive Services with Partial ExEcution and Deadlines). Being deadline agnostic is an attractive property of ISPEED because data center schedulers are often not privy to individual job deadlines, and thus schedulers that are deadline dependent may not be amenable to implementation. We first prove that ISPEED achieves the maximum total utility when jobs have homogeneous deadlines and their utility functions are non-decreasing and concave. Then, in the case of heterogeneous job deadlines we prove that ISPEED achieves a competitive ratio of 2 + &#945; , where &#945; is a shape parameter for a large class of nondecreasing utility functions. In the special case of &#945; = 0, i.e., the utility functions are concave, ISPEED has a competitive ratio of 2, while no causal scheduler can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than &#8730;(5+1)/2. Finally, we show through trace-driven simulations that ISPEED outperforms the state-of-the-art schedulers in a wide range of scenarios.

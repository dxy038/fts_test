Nonlinear active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) tuning problem is investigated based on synthesis optimization method which including intelligent optimization method-NSGA_II and The typical nonlinear least square method-Levenberg-Marqudart algorithm. Based on multi-objective optimizing algorithm-NSGA_II the parameters of extended state observer is tuned. Nonlinear least square method is adopted to obtain the optimal parameter of Nonlinear PD controller parameters of active disturbance rejection controller. The results of simulation indicate the synthesis optimal tuning method of ADRC is effective.

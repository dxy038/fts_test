Research at InterDigital Communications Corp. on a distributed control wireless broadband-code division multiple access (B-CDMA) mobile multimedia cellular network (MMC-NET) using an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) cell based architecture and connected to various backbone networks, such as ATM/SONET, is discussed. The main objective of the MMC-NET architecture is to provide secure, seamless, theater-wide, multimedia communications. Some attributes of this wireless B-CDMA based MMC-NET are: mobility, multimedia capabilities, distributed control, B-CDMA, security, scalability, interoperability, reconfigurability, LPI/LPJ, ability to work as part of the global grid system and capable in being incorporated into the synthetic theater of war (STW) mobile defense simulation internet (DSI). The design specifications of the network along with its interface to ATM/SONETs are based on the OSI model. Some system characteristics and strategies in meeting the above objectives are discussed

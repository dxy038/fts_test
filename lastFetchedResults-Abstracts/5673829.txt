By taking into consideration the road traffic congestion on urban center and a bottleneck junction, based on the flow-sharing and traffic management strategy, a mixed-integer linear programming model is established by using the method of time-space analysis, which can carry out green wave control and red wave control for different directions in arterial road. The various traffic control needs can be satisfied to adapt to different traffic conditions by adjusting the red wave weighting factor in the objective function. The optimal solution of the model can be achieved by use of LINGO software and programming language. Finally, the example effectively demonstrates that the model can maximize the bandwidths of green wave and red wave for different directions and obtain precise timing schemes with a strong scientific rationality.

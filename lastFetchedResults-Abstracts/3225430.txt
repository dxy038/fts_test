Electricity grids are adding the Smart Grid concept to the network. Utilities are engaged in this important investment in order to build Smart Metering networks, as a first step towards the Smart Grid. Nevertheless, the objective is to go further, and take advantage of all the inherent capabilities of this deployment obtaining additional operational applications. In this context, Low Voltage (LV) Distribution Electricity Grids are the most unknown and manually controlled elements of the electricity grid, so operation in this section of the grid needs to be improved. This paper describes a mechanism to obtain the LV feeder identification of all the connected smart electricity meters. The proposal contained in this paper is based on real field deployments with PRIME technology, and it is as a contribution to LV grid control with applications in electricity grid planning, transformer balance, fault location and accurate point of supply identification. The proposed approach, based in standard narrowband PRIME PLC smart meters, minimizes the investment. This paper describes the algorithm and the real field tests performed, showing how LV feeder detection concept has been successfully validated for PRIME PLC Smart Metering networks.

One of the European Union main goals of its energy policy is a 10% share of biofuels in fuel consumed for transport (petrol and diesel) in the year 2020. But the effort associated to this global target is not distributed among the member states (MS). Therefore, this study proposes a non-linear distribution method with dynamic objective targets for increasing the share of biofuels according to the particular characteristics of every MS (share of non-biofuels in fuel consumed for transport, non biofuels per capita and non-biofuels per GDP). The results were analyzed on three scenarios: the whole European Union (27 MS), the European Union 15 (the most industrialized ones) and the European Union 12 (those that joined the EU after 2004), with the objective of identifying differences in behavior between the different blocks inside the European Union.

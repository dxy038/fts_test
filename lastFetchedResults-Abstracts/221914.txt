Color mosaic sampling schemes are widely used in digital
cameras. Given the resolution of CCD sensor arrays, the image
quality of digital cameras using mosaic sampling largely depends
on the performance of the color demosaicking process. A common
problem with existing color demosaicking algorithms is an inconsistency
of sample interpolations in different primary color channels,
which is the cause of the most objectionable color artifacts. To
cure the problem, we propose a new primary-consistent soft-decision
framework (PCSD) of color demosaicking. In thePCSDframework,
we make multiple estimates of a missing color sample under
different hypotheseson edge or texture directions.Theestimates are
made via a primary consistent interpolation, meaning that all three
primary components of a color are interpolated in the same direction.
The final estimate of a color sample is obtained by testing different
interpolation hypotheses in the reconstructed full-resolution
color image and selecting the best via an optimal statistical decision
or inference process. A concrete color demosaicking method of the
PCSD framework is presented. This new method eliminates certain
types of color artifacts of existing color demosaicking methods. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the PCSD approach
can significantly improve the image quality of digital cameras in
both subjective and objective measures. In some instances, our gain
over the competing methods can be as much as 7 dB.

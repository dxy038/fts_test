LCL network is one of the best choices for compensating bidirectional inductive power transfer (BIPT) systems. However, H-Bridge power converter of the conventional BIPT systems generates highly distorted AC current which results in reduced overall system efficiency particularly in high power BIPT systems. In order to overcome this drawback, a multilevel converter (MC) with selective harmonic distortion (SHE) modulation method is presented in this paper to eliminate high order harmonic components in converter voltages at both sides of BIPT systems. The proposed MC topology is constructed using a modified H-Bridge converter with minimum number of power switches. The proposed topology is suitable for low to medium power applications. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

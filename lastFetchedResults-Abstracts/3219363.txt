Most digital cameras capture one primary color at each pixel by a single sensor overlaid with a color filter array. To recover a full color image from incomplete color samples, one needs to restore the two missing color values for each pixel. This restoration process is known as color demosaicking. In this paper, we present a novel self-learning approach to this problem via support vector regression. Unlike prior learning-based demosaicking methods, our approach aims at extracting image-dependent information in constructing the learning model, and we do not require any additional training data. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art techniques in both subjective and objective image quality measures.

A discrete tuberculosis model with different infectious compartments is formulated and studied. The basic reproduction number, R&#959; of the model is defined. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is proved if R<sub>0</sub> &lt;; 1 . The existence of endemic equilibrium and the persistence of TB is established if R<sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 . The main attention is paid on the influence of the infectivity proportion on the case number. The numerical simulations show that the infection cases increase as p increase.

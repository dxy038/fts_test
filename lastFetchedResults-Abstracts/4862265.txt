Variable-rate video-coding using a motion-compensated discrete cosine transform (DCT) and its characteristics are discussed, focusing on quality improvement and application aspects. An objective measure is proposed for quality estimation of variable-rate video coding. Subjective evaluation results, including the relationship between subjective and objective ratings, are also shown. Important points are considered with respect to the application of the coder to asynchronous transfer mode systems.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

This paper presents an objective picture quality measurement method based on the fragile digital image watermarking. Based on the DCT-based watermarking scheme, this paper presents a fragile digital image watermarking scheme that can work as an automatic quality monitoring system. We embed watermark in the DCT domain of original image, and the DCT blocks for embedding are carefully selected so that the degradation of the watermark can reflect the degradation of the image. The evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme against JPEG compression.

This paper proposes, power management of different types of renewable energy source is controlled by multiport DC-DC converter. In this each port of the converter is connected with controller switch to control the source input of converter. This is reduces the turn off switching losses by soft switching. The high frequency switches are used to control the power flow. This converter is proposed to control the hybrid energy generating system, with the ability of bidirectional power flow between battery and load. The diode bridge rectifier is applicable for high switching frequency operation with realizable component compare with existing converter. The efficiency of the converter is verified through MATLAB simulation. The operation and design performance is explained briefly. The proposed converter has reliability operate simultaneous power generation from different renewable energy source. Fuzzy controller controls the direction of power flow and load voltage of the converter.

Sonication for phenol degradation has proved to be an attractive process over the years at least on a laboratory scale but the rates of phenol degradation under sonication have always been quite low. The present work investigates the use of simple additives such as salt and carbon tetrachloride as process intensifying parameters with an aim of reduction in the treatment times and hence the cost of operation. The intermediates formed in the degradation process have been analyzed and it has been observed that these intermediates degrade faster as compared to phenol.

id technique of ozonation coupled with cavitation has also been investigated with an objective of finding the optimum conditions for the combination of ozonation and cavitation for synergistic effects. Analysis of the intermediates for the combination treatment scheme also indicates that the intermediates (hydroquinone, catechol, resorcinol, maleic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, formic acid, etc.) are more biodegradable prompting a possible combination of cavitation with aerobic oxidation for large scale treatment of phenol containing waste.

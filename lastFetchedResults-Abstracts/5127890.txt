This paper proposes a novel heuristic method known as Loop-Eliminating (L-E) method for Distribution System Network Reconfiguration. Network reconfiguration is the process of altering the topological structure of the electrical distribution system by changing the status of sectionalizing switches/tie switches. Network Reconfiguration can be used as a multi objective tool to solve various problems such as loss minimization, service restoration and load balancing in distribution systems. This paper presents an efficient algorithm based upon L-E method to solve the loss minimization problem for a given distribution system. The L-E method is a computationally attractive heuristic method, used to find out optimal configuration of a given radial distribution system. The proposed algorithm is coded in MATLAB 2009b version on a PC with 1GB RAM and Intel Core 2 Duo 1.8 GHz processor. To check the validity of the algorithm, the proposed algorithm has been tested on standard IEEE 33 and 69 bus distribution systems and the simulated results are used to confirm the capability of the proposed algorithm being applied to the systems.

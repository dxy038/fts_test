appropriate spaces and locations for services. Fire stations are one of these services
that are responsible for security. Identifying and prioritizing urban areas are necessary

models, some criteria such as access to communication networks, covered population,
residential, commercial, industrial units, area coverage, educational, administrative,
cultural, and transportation.
Findings: In Khorramdarreh city situation, population, and proposed prioritization
determined that the results of VIKOR model had higher value than TOPSIS model
and is more consistent with the objective realities of city.
In the situation of physical and population of Khorramdarreh, and proposed prioritize
determined that the results of the model has higher value than VIKOR and TOPSIS
model is more consistent with the objective realities of Khorramdarreh.
Conclusion: Considering the results of both models, district 3 in Khorramdarreh had
the maximum and district 2 in VIKOR model and district 5 in TOPSIS model had the
minimum requirement for fire stations respectively.

A description is given of a K/Ka-band 3-bit GaAs monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) phase shifter that uses passive MESFET switching elements and is bidirectional. The phase shifter uses high-pass/low-pass filter circuits in which MESFET off-state capacitances are incorporated as filter elements. This technique allows high-performance, broadband phase shifter response to be achieved. The K/Ka-band phase shifter uses MESFETs with the same characteristics as those used in amplifiers operating in the same band, for ease of future integration. The phase shifter operates from 18 to 40 GHz, with an average insertion loss of 9 to 10 dB.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

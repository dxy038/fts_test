In this paper, we investigate the problem of opportunistic spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks through transmission power control. Motivated by the random nature of Rayleigh channel fading, we model the QoS constraint function under a probabilistic form and then propose a method to convert it into an equivalent yet deterministic form. To solve the formulated problem, we introduce an algorithm based on differential evolution (DE). Simulation results show that the SINR at the primary receiver can be maintained under the proposed power control mechanism despite the fluctuations of channel conditions. The proposed algorithm also implies a better trade-off in terms of satisfying the probability constraint and maximizing the objective function compared to the baseline approach.

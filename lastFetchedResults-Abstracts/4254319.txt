The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of transmit array processing techniques using spatial or polarisation diversity. This study is made using channels measured simultaneously on two types of arrays. Under the considered conditions, the diversity gain brought by spatial diversity is slightly more important than the one brought by polarisation diversity. Nevertheless, polarisation diversity could be used for transmit array processing and gives, in our specific simulation conditions, the most important rejection gain compared to spatial diversity

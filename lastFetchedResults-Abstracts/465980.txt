Objective: The purpose of this study was a quantification of changes in endometriosis-associated pain and quality of life during the stimulatory phase of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy. Study Design: One hundred twenty women with significant endometriosis-associated pain participated in a 1-month double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Pain was measured at baseline and at 2 and 4 weeks with visual analog scales and the Endometriosis Symptom Severity score. Quality of life was measured with the SF-36 instrument. Group means and SEMs were calculated. Paired t tests were used after determination of data normality. Results: Compared with placebo-treated control subjects women treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist had a statistically (P< .0001) and clinically significant temporary increase in pain and a concomitant decrease in quality of life. Conclusion: The stimulatory phase of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy is associated with an increase in endometriosis-associated pain and a decrease in quality of life.

This study investigated what emotional feedback was effective for helping elderly drivers understand and modify their driving problems in the hypothesized driving re-education program using a driving simulator. A victimizer experience and the data review from the victim´s perspective were compared with the image review from the objective, bird´s-eye angle. The effect of combination of the victimizer and the victim methods was also measured. As results, the elderly participants in the victimizer-experienced group most modified their risky driving after the feedback. However, such great effect of the victimizer experience lessened when the victim-view data review was provided.

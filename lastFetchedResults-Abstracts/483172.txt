Objective(s): To develop and test clinical performance self-efficacy (CPSF) scale for nursing students. Methods: Literature review indicated there is no existing nursing clinical performance self-efficacy instrument for nursing students. A qualitative study was conducted to explore the self-efficacy concept in clinical performance of nursing students. A self-efficacy framework with well-developed theoretical constructs was formed. A methodological study design was used, consisting of two phases. A review of literature and also content analysis of the interview and focus group transcripts identified subscale and key items to be included in the instrument. CPSF scale was developed into 69 Likert-format items, which were evaluated by twenty nursing experts followed by testing in a random sample of 207 nursing students. The scale's validity and reliability were tested.
Results: After measuring content validity index and factor analysis, the final scale of four dimensions with 37 items was developed. In addition, concurrent validity was obtained (r= 0.73, P< 0.01). The overall scale internal reliability had a=0.96; Cronbach's a for scale's dimensions ranged from 0.90 to 0.92. Test-retest reliability with a 2-week time interval was: r=0.94.
Conclusion: The CPSF had demonstrated evidence of content validity, construct validity, concurrent validity, internal consistency, and stability. Statistical analysis provided an objective tool for assessing nursing students' clinical performance self-efficacy.

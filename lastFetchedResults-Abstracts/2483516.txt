Background and Objectives:  The lesion in periapical area is a clinical problem in with some difficulties in its diagnosis. Since the diagnosis of the periapical lesion is based on the observation of radiolucency in the teeth periapical area, the objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of indirect digital radiography (PSP) and the conventional radiography in diagnosis of periapical lesion in invitro condition. 
Subjects and Methods: In this experimental-laboratory research, 60 synthetic lesions (0.25, 0.5, 1mm) were formed under the apex of teeth by means of single-root premolar teeth replaced in the dried mandible bone of sheep. These lesions were imaged by two methods of digital and conventional radiography. Two maxillofacial radiologists examined the presence or absence of lesions in PSP radiographs and conventional processing in each periapical area.
Results: The average accuracy of observation in conventional radiography for 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mm was 30, 46 and 85 % respectively, which was increased respectively to 46.7, 63.5 and 93.3 % for PSP radiographs. The conventional radiography had the specificity of 85 % in comparison with 66% for digital radiography.
Conclusion: It seems that, particularly for small lesions, PSP has a higher diagnostic sensitivity in diagnosis of periapical lesions in comparison with conventional radiography

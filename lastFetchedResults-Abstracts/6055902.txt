We have demonstrated the feasibility of the bidirectional dual parallel linearization technique for reduction of the intermodulation distortion in broadband systems at millimetre-wave frequencies. Moreover, we have shown that the performance can be enhanced reducing the ripple level in the frequency responses. The technique offers less complexity than the standard dual parallel technique and can operate at higher frequencies thanks to the use of a single modulator which allows close control of the frequency responses of the two signal paths

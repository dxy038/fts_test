In this paper we propose a user-preference based evolutionary algorithm that relies on decomposition strategies to convert a multi-objective problem into a set of single-objective problems. The use of a reference point allows the algorithm to focus the search on more preferred regions which can potentially save considerable amount of computational resources. The algorithm that we proposed, dynamically adapts the weight vectors and is able to converge close to the preferred regions. Combining decomposition strategies with reference point approaches paves the way for more effective optimization of many-objective problems. The use of a decomposition method alleviates the selection pressure problem associated with dominance-based approaches while a reference point allows a more focused search. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of finding solutions close to the reference points specified by a decision maker. Moreover, our results show that high quality solutions can be obtained using less computational effort as compared to a state-of-the-art decomposition based evolutionary multi-objective algorithm.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Viola odorata is an important medicinal plant that used for the treatment of bronchitis, common cold and digestive diseases. Nowadays, due to the spread of bacterial resistance to antibiotics more attention is given to the activity of antimicrobial medicinal plants. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of environment temperature on the antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of different organs at different stages of viola odorata growth.
METHODS: In this experimental-laboratory study, plant after growth in three temperatures (10, 20 and 30 degree) was collected. Extraction was performed by percolation method, and antibacterial activity of extracts was investigated on three bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with disk-diffusion and macrodilution methods.	
FINDINGS: Aqueous extract has antibacterial activity on all three bacteria; so that has maximum effect on Staphylococcus aureus (concentration of 1µgr/ml) and minimum effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa (concentration of 8µgr/ml). Evaluation of antibacterial activity of organs showed that cold treatment has more effect than warm and control treatment. With plant growth, antibacterial activity decreases in leaf and root, but in flowering stage it increases in flower organ.
CONCLUSION: Results of study showed that water extract of the plant organs in two different temperatures on three bacteria has effective antibacterial activity. So, more effective components can be collected by creating optimal conditions for growth and using specious organs.

In this paper we consider the topology aggregation problem in hierarchical ASON networks. Usually, the requirement of scalability and security of the network is fulfilled by domain division. The relevant information exchanged among domains will be greatly increased for large scale networks. The topology aggregation aims at reducing the amount of link state information without losing accuracy for routing calculation. We propose to apply a bidirectional shuffle-net model to topology abstraction procedure, which can significantly reduce the size of link state information. A genetic algorithm is utilized to construct the optimal mapping relationship between shuffle-net and aggregated topology for accuracy purpose. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme has good performance compared with symmetric-star approach and heuristic shuffle-net algorithm.

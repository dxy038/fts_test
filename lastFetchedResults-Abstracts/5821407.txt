The scalar and vector finite difference beam propagation methods (BPMs) as well as a bidirectional BPM both for two-dimensional and for three-dimensional structures are presented. These can be implemented on the workstation level, and various modeling examples are demonstrated. The use of these techniques can enhance the design and analysis of various guided-wave circuit components.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

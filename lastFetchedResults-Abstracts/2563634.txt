Background: Colicins produced by colicinogenic Escherichia coli (CEC) are narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents that are able to kill or prevent closely related strains.
Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Colicin on the induction of treated mice in prevention of infection caused by E. coli K99.
Materials and Methods: The experiment was conducted on 2 mice groups of 2-week-old (30 in each group). All mice were administered streptomycin sulfate prior to treatment to eliminate resident E. coli. Group 1 was orally inoculated with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) as control and the second was fed with colicin solution as treated group. Both control and treated groups were challenged by 3 LD50 of E. coli K99 and followed up for 1 week.
Results: Treated mice did not show severe clinical signs. While diarrhea with different sings of colibacillosis was established in control group, infected mice showed different clinical signs.
Conclusion: The study indicates that the use of colicin and biotherapy instead of antibiotic may be more safe and efficient for control of E. coli K99 infection. Treated mice by colicin solution protected E. coli K99 colonization and reduced fecal shedding. Investigation on livestock for applying colicin in animal farms is recommended.

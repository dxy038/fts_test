Additional consumption of fuel in an intense traffic condition is inevitable. Excess fuel consumption may be avoided, if an optimal driving strategy is implemented subject to the surrounding condition of a vehicle and existing constraints. Development of an optimal driving strategy has been the subject of eco-driving. A model of optimal driving strategy has been developed and it has been applied for assessment of eco-driving rules. The model may be categorized as an optimal control and the objective function is minimization of fuel consumption in a given route. Vehicle speed and gear ratio are identified as control variables. The effect of working load has been considered according three engine running processes of Idle, part-load and wide open throttle. The model has then been applied to identify the optimal driving strategy of a vehicle in different traffic congestion based on eco-driving rules.

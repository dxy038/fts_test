ABSTRACT
Background and aim: Today we are witnessing social issues in the society which in addition to other problems have become one of the resources in the emergence and development of feeling insecurity among people, particularly women. However research results show that intensification of criminal law enforcement and strengthening of policing measures and comprehensive government investments have not had the desired result of moderating insecurity feeling. The main objective of this study was to find out which factors have influence on women's social security.
Method: The statistical population of this survey was 606 young women of Mashhad that were selected by multiple random sampling. Data was collected through a self-made questionnaire (?=0. 76). Descriptive and analysis statistics (multi-regression analysis) were used for data analysis.
Findings: Almost 14% of variable variance of women social security feeling was explained by the main research variables that respectively state functional variables (0.273), lifestyle (0.208) and the media paid (-0.168) were the most effective variables on women social feeling of security.
Conclusion: In order to increase the women's feeling of security in urban areas and create a safe and stress-free environment we should pay special attention to decisive factors such as respecting social discipline and adherence to social norms, women's lifestyle, development of social relations of this social stratum and attracting more and more women's participation in social, economic and cultural activities.

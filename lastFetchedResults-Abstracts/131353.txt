Objective: This research investigated several questions and hypotheses, the most important of which was: the relationship between learning aims (of students, families, teachers and classroom) and self-handicapping. Method: The target population of this cross-sectional/analytical survey was all students at first to third high school grades in Isfahan. The sample consisted of 190 girl and boy students, randomly chosen from 20 schools over 5 city quarters. The research instruments were the adjusted learning models scales. Results: The final results of this research indicated that the variables of student mastery, student performance avoidance, classroom mastery, and classroom performance avoidance had a meaningful relationship with self-handicatpping in boys. In girls, it was shown that student mastery, classroom performance, and parents mastery were asociated with self- handicapping. Also, it was indicated that boys use self- handicapping strategies significantly more than girls do. Conclusion: It is suggested that the system of education be inclined towards relying on the students' progress with qualifications and their level of mastery in the study subjects rather than class rankings and scores; and focus on students' progress and reward their learning improvement and curiosity.

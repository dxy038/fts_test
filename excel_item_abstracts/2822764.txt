To enable zero net-energy consumption and optimal power management for future homes or buildings, the dc electric distribution systems (dc nano-grid) finds feasibility and simplicity for integrating multi-type renewable energy sources. However, integrating all the sources and loads in a simple, reliable and smart way is still challenging. This paper introduces a 380V emulator testbed of 10kW, and then proposes a distributed droop control method to integrate all source converters. Control functions in components level and system level will be defined and discussed, and energy storage management and its control law in dc nano-grid is proposed. System level energy management control strategies in a day/24 hours are examined and discussed with considerations of residential load demand profile, local renewable energy source profile and schedules of electricity rate. System level static experiments within 24h are given for verification purposes.

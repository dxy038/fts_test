History and Objectives: Considering the increasing incidence of tuberculosis and its high rate of mortality and complications, this study was carried out to evaluate the clinical and paraclinical signs and drug complications in Loghman Hakim hospital in Tehran from 1993 to 1996.
Materials and Methods: The descriptive strategy of this study was carried out on patients with a diagnosis of tuberculosis. In this regard, their history was taken, clinical signs were recorded, and the tests Alk-Ph, SGOT, SGPT, PT, ESR, PPD, CBC, billirubin, and uric acid were done until the end of study. Data for drugs side-effects were analyzed using Mc-Nemar test.
Results: Out of 190 patients, 51% were male and 49% were female. Cases with an age less than 5 years had the least incidence and cases with an greater than 66 years had the highest incidence. In addition, 56.3% out of patients had pulmonary tuberculosis. The most important clinical signs were fever (82%), cough and sputum (62.5%), nightly perspiration (20%), respiratory distress (16%), and bloody sputum (11.2%).

Bilirubin level also increased up to 8.4% after treatment and in 7.6% out of them there was abnormal PT after treatment.
Conclusion and Recommendations: Considering the elevated level of hepatic enzymes in patients with tuberculosis and under treatment, especially in those with an old age, it is recommended to choose appropriate treatmentaccording to hepatic toxicity.

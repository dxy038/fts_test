
Objective: Working memory is the ability of maintaining and manipulating the required
information for operating generalization in future. The aim of the present research is to
investigate the effectiveness of neurofeedback therapy on the working memory in children
with ADHD. Method: 24 children with ADHD who had the required standards to participate in the study
were selected by accessible sampling and put randomly in an experimental group or a control
group. The experimental group attended 20 sessions of neurofeedback instruction for 2 months.
The individuals from both groups (experimental or control) were assessed and compared by
giving SWM test in two stages of pre-test and post-test. The obtained results were analyzed by
the statistic method of covariance analysis. Results: Neurofeedback instruction is able to recover the working memory of children with
ADHD. Conclusion: Neurofeedback instruction can be used as an intervening method for working
memory recovery in children with ADHD.

The increasing number of renewable energy sources and distributed generators requires new strategies for the operation and management of the electricity grid in order to maintain or even to improve the power supply reliability and quality. In addition, liberalization of the grids leads to new management structures, in which trading of energy and power is becoming increasingly important. The interconnection of DG inevitably changes the characteristics of the system to which it is being connected, due to the fact that distribution systems were traditionally designed with the assumption of a passive network. The consequence of the integration of DG is that this assumption is no longer valid. There are a number of technical challenges that needs to be addressed. The main objective of this Task is to study how to achieve a better integration of flexible demand (Demand Response, Demand Side Management) with Distributed Generation, energy storages and Smart Grids.

This paper proposes a new scheduling model for controlling traffic at intersection. These controls are based on new information and communication systems and perform to take into account all vehicle arrivals individually. Vehicles negotiate their time of access through an intelligent device embedded in the intersection, hence there is no traffic light planned by the city. The objective of control is to evacuate all vehicles as soon as possible while considering the emergence of important vehicles. The intersection control becomes to determine the best access order to the intersection for all vehicles which are approaching it. Since the intersection is a scare resource shared by vehicles, the problem of control can be solved by a novel scheduling model proposed in this paper.

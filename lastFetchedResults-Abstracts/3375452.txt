The article describes a digital control technique for real-time modeling and simulation of hybrid systems. The performance of the closed-loop real-time model is close to that of the original continuous-time model. To illustrate the technique, linear circuits equipped with diodes were considered. A voltage source model of the diode is represented as an analog controller in feedback with a linear, time-invariant system and serves as a starting point to a global digital redesign strategy. The objective of digital redesign is to obtain a discrete-time control system that behaves as closely as possible to the LTI continuous-time closed-loop system. The procedure was validated through real-time and off-line simulations of a three-phase diode rectifier.

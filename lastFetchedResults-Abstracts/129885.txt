Introduction & Objective: Previous studies have shown that gastrografin has the non operative resolution of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO). Injectable meglumine is less expensive in our community than gastrografin and there is no study indicating the effect of injectable meglumine on resolution of ASBO. Therefore the aim of this study was to test the effect of injectable meglumine administered orally on the non operative resolution of (ASBO).
Materials & Methods: Patients, diagnosed with ASBO on clinical and radiological grounds were randomized to receive injectable meglumin orally or no receive in a double blinded fashion. From 2001 until 2005 in Isfahan, Alzahra hospital. Data of resolution time of ASBO (clinically and Radiologically), need for surgery and length of hospital stay were collected and then analysed with Mann - Whitney and fisher exact tests and P<0.05 was meaningfal.
Results: Sixty six patients with ASBO were randomized to receive (group I, n=29) or no receive (group II, n =28) injectable meglumine orally and nine patients were excluded due to protocol violation.
%27.6 patients in group I and %64.3 patients in group II required surgery (p=0.005). Patients who were in groups I, had not significantly resolution of their ASBO clinically but had significantly resolution of their ASBO radiologically earlier than II patients (P=0.306 and P=0.025)
Conclusions: Injectable maglomine orally causes lack of need for surgery and accelerates resolution of ASBO by a specific therapeutic effect.

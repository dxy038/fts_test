Introduction & Objective: The infertility treatment by USing in vitro
matured oocyte has many potential applications. It minimizes the nsk of
ovarian hyper stimulation and is an alternative treatment for women with
polycystic ovarian syndrome who may have problems regarding
stimulation for IVF. This method may prove important for subjects in need
of fertility preservation and also provides information about the final stage
of oocyte maturation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of
HCG on the rate of in vitro matured oocyte and 8 cell embryos mediated
by ICSI.
Materials & Methods: This experimental study was done in
Montaseneh IVF center and Islamic Azad University at Mashhad. One
hundred sixty eight Immature oocytes aspirated from women undergoing
IVF cycles were divided into 3 equal groups and allocated for maturation in
3 medium cultures. All of 3 culture groups contained G1 medium
supplemented with HSA 10% (Human Serum Albumin). Control group had
no gonadotropin. but the first experimental group contained HCG 10 IUiml
and the second experimental group contained HCG 5 IU/ml. Matured
oocytes were fertilized by ICSI and numbers of 8-cell embryos were
investigated 72 hours after fertilizatron by invert microscope.
Results: The results showed that both of the HCG concentrations
significantly Increased the rate of matured oocytes and also the rate of 8cell
embryos with respect to control group (p<0.05). No significant
differences were found in rate of matured oocytes between the two
experimental groups (p.-O 05) whde the number of a-eel! embryos was
significantly higher in HCG 51U/ml with respect to HCG 10lU/mi and
control group (p<O.05)
Conclusion :The results suggests that both of the HCG concentrations
increase the rate of maturation of immature oocytes and the rate of 8-cel!
embryos but HCG (5IU/ml) has more effect on the number of 8-cell
embryos mediated by ICSI.

In this paper, the tuning of multivariable PID (MPID) controller using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is presented. To provide better performance in the industry, MPID implementation often uses heuristic approach, which is based on experience. However, this method of tuning is time consuming and inadequate for complex systems. To obtain a better performance in decoupling capabilities and closed loop performance, in this study, the MPID parameters are fine-tuned using Multi-objective PSO. Simulation results show tuning parameters of MPID controllers obtained via PSO yield better performance when applied to nonlinear system for different control strategies.

Abstract-In this paper optimal compensation strategies for active filtering under non-ideal voltages are studied using a constrained Pareto Optimal based multi-objective optimization. Where the voltages are distorted, there is some conflict between power factor improvement, current harmonics mitigation, and cost issues, calling for some compromise. Min-Max constraint handling technique is used to obtain feasible solutions being in comply with IEEE-519 standards. The result is a set (not a single point) of optimal and feasible results called Pareto Front. Designer can make decision to pick out one of the results which look more suitable considering some other requirements. Using constrained multi objective optimization provides a more comprehensive design scenario giving us much more broaden view to the compensation strategy at lower computation burden. The results are also compared to those obtained from SPEA multi objective optimization approach as a well-known Multi objective optimization approach. A set of different objective functions such as current THD, power factor, distortion factor (DF), K factor, and the filter kVA are considered for optimization. The extensive simulation results of the optimization for several objective functions and constraints exhibits the suitability of the presented method.

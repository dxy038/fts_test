The paper details the development of a cross disciplinary course in mechatronics between the Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering Departments at Clemson University. The course objective is to provide electrical and mechanical engineering students with the opportunity to work together on hardware design projects with substantially coupled, mechanical and electrical subsystems. The course structure, topical coverage and laboratory facilities are discussed

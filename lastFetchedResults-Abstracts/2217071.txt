Background: The increasing number of cesarean section is a great concern in many countries. In Iran cesarean section rate has been steadily rising from 35% in 2000 to 40% in 2005. Preferences for cesarean are often associated with some factors. Objective: To investigate factors associated with preference for cesarean delivery, with special emphasis on pregnant women’s preferences in first pregnancy in Neyshabur (Northeast of Iran). Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, written questionnaires were completed via face to face interview with 797 pregnant women in first pregnancy. Socio-demographic data, preference toward mode of delivery and factors associated with it were assessed by applying questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify the independent variables associated with preference for cesarean delivery. Results: In this study observed that 18.6% of pregnant women preferred caesarean delivery in first pregnancy. The mean age of pregnant women that they preferred cesarean delivery was upper than pregnant women that they preferred vaginal delivery and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.006). There was a statistically significant relation between preference for cesarean delivery and the following variables: educational level (p < 0.001), gestational age (p=0.003) spouse’s age of pregnant women (p=0.001), physician’s advice (p < 0.001), and fear of delivery (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The results of this study show that the majority of pregnant women do not prefer caesarean delivery to vaginal delivery. Nevertheless the preference rate for cesarean delivery exceeded 15% that suggested by WHO and most important factors in pregnant women prefer cesarean deliveries are fear of delivery and physician’s advice.

We are interested in this paper on the control of an electromechanical system consisting of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG), driven by a prime mover that can supply or extract mechanical power, e.g., a flywheel inertia, and an induction motor (IM). The stator of the induction machine is connected to the stator of the generator whose rotor voltage is regulated by a bidirectional converter. The main interest of this configuration is that it permits a bidirectional power flow between the motor, which may operate in regenerative mode, and the generator. We propose a passivity-based controller to regulate the motor mechanical speed. Since this kind of controller achieves stabilization via energy balancing, regulation of the power flow in the system is naturally incorporated. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the main points of our paper.

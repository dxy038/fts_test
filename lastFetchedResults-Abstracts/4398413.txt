This paper proposes a new method for optimizing allocation of dynamic VAr compensator (DVC) considering the risk of voltage sag. A Monte Carlo simulation method is used for the stochastical setting of fault types and locations. The probability of voltage sags and their severity is derived from the statistics results. The quality loss function in quality engineering theory is adopted to evaluate voltage sag economic losses in this paper. Moreover, a single objective optimization model is established, which includes the loss of voltage sag, the line active loss and investment cost of DVC. By increasing capacity of DVC, the corresponding total costs of different installed capacity are obtained. The CFTOOL is used to make the fitting curve in order to get the relationship between capacity and total cost and the optimizing capacity. A practical case of Guangdong Distribution Networks in China validated the efficiency of the proposed method.

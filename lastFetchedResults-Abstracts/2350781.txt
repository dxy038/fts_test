This paper presents the results of a comprehensive study on the efficiency of planar parallel mechanisms, considering their kinetostatic performance and also, their workspace. This aim is approached upon proceeding single- and multi-objective optimization procedures. Kinetostatic performances of ten different planar parallel mechanisms are analyzed by resorting to a recent index, kinematic sensitivity. Moreover, the greatest possible continuous circle in the constant-orientation workspace of the latter mechanisms is considered as another objective for the optimization procedures. Seeking the set of design parameters which compromises simultaneous optimal values for the two aforementioned objectives, i.e., kinematic sensitivity and workspace, necessitates launching a multi-objective optimization process. The mathematical framework adopted for the optimization problem is based on genetic algorithm. The results of multi-objective optimization are based on the sets of Pareto points, offering the most reliable decisions to reconciliate between some conï¬‚icting objectives. To this end, the ten planar parallel mechanisms are sorted into two sets based on their type of actuator, some of them with prismatic actuators and the other ones with revolute actuators. Finally, a comparison between performances of these mechanisms, according to the obtained results, is carried out.

We present an alternative approach for the set-point control of the Acrobot. The primary control objective is to regulate the first link at any desired position. A Lyapunov-based control algorithm, which is applicable to both the directly driven and the remotely driven types Acrobot, is proposed. The controller ensures that the first link is asymptotically driven to the desired set-point provided some sufficient conditions on the the controller gains and the physical parameters are satisfied. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control law

In this paper we present a new approach to the design of multihop lightwave networks with connectivity patterns that can be dynamically reconfigured. We introduce a practical algorithm that efficiently reconfigures the connectivity diagram by reassigning wavelengths to best fit the current traffic pattern. A newly developed stochastic optimization algorithm is used to obtain the mapping of a regular structure into a WDM star, while optimizing the system performance measures. The optimization tool is generated and can be used with any objective function which is a function of the traffic patterns, the system control and the system configuration. The results show that this is a practical tool and the resulting structures have a superior system performance

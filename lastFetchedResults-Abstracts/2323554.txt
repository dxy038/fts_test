We know that Martin Heidegger in "Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics" presented some ontological interpretation of "Critique of Pure Reason" as opposed to other epistemological interpretations. He tried to explain how all parts of the work of Kant (based on time as the necessary condition of schematism) are originally related to the basic problem of finite human being or Dasein. Immanuel Kant, from the perspective of Heidegger, is indeed the founder of fundamental ontology of Dasein. The main objective of this paper is related to the same problem. In this article, we have tried to briefly analyze and evaluate and criticize Heidegger's interpretation of Kant. Heidegger seems to neglect the other important side of Kant’s thought, namely the non-temporal aspect of apperception. We've noted that Being, in Emmanuel Kant’s view, is not based on time, but certainly on some unknowable and non-temporal foundation beyond human experience.

The operation, design and control of an isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter for hybrid electric vehicle energy management applications are discussed. Different operation modes and boundary conditions are distinguished by phase-shift angle and load conditions. The absolute and relative output voltage ripple was derived. The dead-band effect and safe operational area are further investigated. The relations between output power and leakage inductance and switching frequency are also presented. The proposed converter was simulated and a prototype was built and tested. Experiments on the converterÂ´s steady state and transient operations validated the design and simulation.

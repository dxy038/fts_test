Dyssynchronous myocardial contraction can be treated with surgical implant of a pacing device. Integrated information of coronary anatomy and mechanical delay may be extremely beneficial to success of the implant but it is not available in current cardiac imaging modalities. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a point-merge co-registration approach to overcome the limitation. This study shows that our method is a reliable and fast tool useful not only to attain optimal left ventricular implantation site but also to better select patients that undergo cardiac resynchronization therapy.

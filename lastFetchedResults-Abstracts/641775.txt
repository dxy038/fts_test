OBJECTIVE: Body weight and body mass index are easily obtainable indicators of nutrition status but do not provide information on changes in fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass with age. In this prospective controlled study, we investigated whether body composition measurements were useful in identifying moderately or severely depleted patients, as judged by the Subjective Global Assessment at hospital admission. In addition, the subjects were grouped by age (≤60 and >60 y) to determine whether there was an effect of aging on the prevalence of malnutrition.

METHODS: Nine hundred ninety-five consecutive patients were evaluated for malnutrition by body mass index, serum albumin, Subjective Global Assessment, and 50-kHz bioelectrical impedance analysis and compared with 995 age- and height-matched healthy volunteers for FFM and fat mass.

RESULTS: A body mass index less than 20 kg/m2 was found in 17.3% of patients. Low albumin (≤34.9 g/L) was found in 14.9% of all patients and 23.7% of those older than 60 y. In contrast, 23.1% and 38.3% of all patients were severely and moderately depleted, respectively, according to the Subjective Global Assessment. FFM was significantly lower in severely depleted men and women and moderately depleted women (P ≤ 0.001), and fat mass was significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) in well-nourished patients than in volunteers. Patients older than 60 y had lower FFM and higher fat mass than did patients 60 y or younger or volunteers (P ≤ 0.001).

CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition was greater in patients older than 60 y than in those 60 y and younger. Patients classified as severely depleted according to the Subjective Global Assessment were depleted of FFM. Body composition measurement can help to identify patients with low FFM and high fat mass.

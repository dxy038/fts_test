Evaluating in-field performances of our proposed MIMO turbo equalizer, soft canceller (SC) followed by MMSE (SC/MMSE) space-time (S/T) MIMO turbo equalizer, is the primary objective of this paper. The SC/MMSE S/T MIMO turbo MIMO turbo equalizer discussed in this paper performs joint MIMO channel estimation, SC/MMSE MIMO signal detection, and decoding of the channel code used, all in an iterative manner. Full diversity gain can be achieved with practical computational complexity in the presence of rich scattering in space and time domains in MIMO communication environments. A series of field measurement campaigns took place in an urban area of Tokyo using a channel sounder system, and sets of collected channel impulse response data were used in off-line simulations to evaluate in-field performance of the MIMO turbo equalizer. In 2-user 2-receive antenna MIMO uplink environments, bit error rate performance was evaluated for the two simultaneous users. Results of the simulations are presented in this paper.

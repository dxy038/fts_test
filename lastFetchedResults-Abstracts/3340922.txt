This paper presents a new extended modular structure of Transistor clamped multilevel inverter with minimum number of semiconductor switches and single voltage sources. Therefore, the number of semiconductor devices, cost and size are reduced. The proposed inverter comprises of an H-bridges clamped with modular structure of transistor as a bidirectional switch. It is capable of generating a multilevel voltage output. The series connection of each modular transistor clamped bidirectional switch increases level of inverter by two. This paper introduces a novel switching algorithm which has very simple arithmetic and logical operations. The novel switching algorithm is universal for any number of steps/levels. The operation and performance analysis of the proposed multilevel inverter is verified with the help of simulation using MATLAB/SIMULINK software.

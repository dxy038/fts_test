Objective
The purpose of this article was to propose guidelines for the design, execution, interpretation, and reporting of economic evaluation studies in obstetrics.
Study design
We performed a PubMed search of economic evaluation articles to identify those articles that deal with the quality of published economic evaluation studies, the development of guidelines, and the development of checklists/guidelines for the reporting of economic evaluation studies. All other articles were excluded from the review.
Results
We identified 160 articles. We included 8 articles in our review that reported on the quality of published economic analyses, 12 articles that reported on guidelines, and 3 articles that reported on checklists/guidelines that are used by journals. There were 2 articles that dealt with the quality of published economic evaluations in obstetrics and gynecology, both of which showed less than optimal quality. There were only 4 articles that provided some general guidelines for the reporting of economic evaluations in obstetrics and gynecology. We found no articles on any checklist/guidelines for the reporting of economic evaluation studies in obstetrics and gynecology.
Conclusion
There is a need to improve the design, execution, interpretation, and reporting of economic evaluation studies in obstetrics.

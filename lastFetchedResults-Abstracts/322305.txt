Tunas are known to be able to travel long distances. The aim of this paper is to propose new ethological models which reproduce some tuna movements using the dynamics of their environment. We use sea surface temperature animations (from remote sensing data) to model the South West Indian Ocean, and French purse seiners data are used to estimate movements of fish. The objective of the models will be to find a northern movement from the Mozambique Channel to the Seychelles Islands at the appropriate time (Mayâ€“July). The initial model uses our ecological knowledge of tunas, i.e. the search behavior for high concentrations of food commonly associated with thermal fronts. In some cases, this simple model creates some northern movements from the Mozambique Channel, but it cannot be used to reproduce large-scale movements between the Mozambique Channel and the Seychelles Islands. The next generation model is created where tuna behaviors are modeled by an artificial neural network, using a genetic algorithm to adjust the connection weights. The tuna school-network receives daily information from its local environment and chooses the best actions in order to be able to pass from the Mozambique Channel to the Seychelles Islands at the appropriate time. One neural network emerges and represents an adaptive behavior able to interpret daily sea surface temperatures to mimic large-scale tuna movements. This artificial behavior can be generalized to each possible departure position from the Mozambique Channel. This modelling represents a new tool to study large-scale movements of pelagic fish, and is a first step towards real-time management of fisheries.

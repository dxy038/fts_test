With 28% of the 350 species of parrots considered threatened, numerous conservation efforts have been initiated for these species. Among these, the restoration or establishment of new populations has increasingly relied on reintroductions as a conservation strategy, often with mixed or uncertain results. We reviewed the results and methodologies of 47 distinct releases and reintroductions of psittacines in nine different countries worldwide over the past 25 years to identify common denominators of successful efforts. To do so, we established a uniform and objective definition of reintroduction success (first-year survival &gt;0.50 and released birds breeding with conspecifics, either captive-reared or wild), and applied generalized linear models and information-theoretic model selection to multiple datasets to identify important predictor variables. We identified several likely predictors of successful psittacine reintroductions, relating to predation mitigation, habitat quality, and post-release supplementation that may provide guidance for future efforts. We also advocate SWOT analysis for objectively evaluating the suitability of potential reintroduction sites.

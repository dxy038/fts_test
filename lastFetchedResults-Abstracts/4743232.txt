Smart home technologies using visible light data transmission are presented. For multiple devices, orthogonal code based time division duplexed bidirectional Visible Light Communication (VLC) link is employed. The proposed model for smart home is an efficient technology with superior BER performance, subject to locations in a typical smart home environment.

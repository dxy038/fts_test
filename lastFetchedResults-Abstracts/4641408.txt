A key requirement for a dynamic organization is the need for precise and formal knowledge management of the available information. The main objective of our work is to provide an agent based model of an agile integrated business system, more specifically, of the marketing sector of the company, where the knowledge has to be acquired, shared both internally and externally, updated, processed, applied, used and reused in order to find correlations among knowledge from different company sectors. Agents are able to suggest certain operations to the users in response to the change in the data structures they are responsible for maintaining. They can adopt using prior knowledge about company objectives and available customer data. An important role of the agent is to learn and change its practice according to previous approved behavior. The use of fuzzy set theory, in order to maintain and analyze the knowledge kept in the company profiles, as well, as to calculate the reliability of the suggested actions, showed the first positive experimental results. We applied this model for the operation of the Center for Distance Learning, for analysis of the different marketing campaigns and as a consultant for future campaigns

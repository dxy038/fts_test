The visual quality obtained in wireless transmission strongly depends on the characteristics of the wireless channel and on the error resilience of the source coding. The wireless extensions of the JPEG 2000 standard (JPWL) and H.264 are the latest international standards for still image and video compression, respectively. However, few results have been reported to compare the rate-distortion (R-D) performance of JPEG 2000 and H.264. Conversely, comparative studies of error resilience between JPWL and H.264 for wireless still image transmission have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we analyse the error resilience of image coding based on JPWL and H.264 I-frame coding in Rayleigh fading channels. Comprehensive objective and perceptual results are presented in relation to the error resilience performance of these two standards under various conditions. Our simulation results reveal that H.264 is more robust to transmission errors than JPWL for wireless still image transmission.

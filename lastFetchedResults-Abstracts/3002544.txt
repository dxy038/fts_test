This paper presents residential video service quality of service (QoS) results obtained from an experimental testbed employing constant bitrate MPEG-2 transport streams on a real ADSL/ATM access network testbed. The experimental design addresses the choice of MPEG encoding parameters and the spatio-temporal characterization of video test content. The Institute Telecommunications Science video quality metric is used for objective video fidelity measurement. Our results demonstrate the complex multilayer propagation of QoS parameters, using deterministic and exponentially distributed cell losses, and their relationship to video quality and video bitrate. The paper provides a basis for developing and comparing these results with similar video service systems; for example, using MPEG encoded video over IP. These results provide an important insight into the factors relevant to the provisioning and management of new multi-service network infrastructures.

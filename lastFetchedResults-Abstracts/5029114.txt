A constructive high-performance control system design approach is presented. The design objective is to obtain a good step response for a nonlinear (or linear) system by finding an appropriate controller structure. The controller is designed in two steps. First, an ideal model is chosen so that when the model is embedded in a repetitive system with a fixed repetitive controller, the closed loop system has excellent performance in the sense of step response. Second, another controller is designed such that the input-output property of the real controlled process is forced to match that of the ideal model. With this technique, the control of linear or nonlinear systems is treated within the same framework. Simulation results show that the step response of the system designed with the proposed technique is promising

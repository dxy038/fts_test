Summary form only given. The central problem /"main objective"/ of the theory of electromagnetic radiation fields or plasma physics is the deformation of the space or the stability of plasma configurations. The present paper shows that the deforming electromagnetic radiation fields "photon gas" or deforming ionized plasma cannot be quantized, in general. Namely, in general, in deforming systems, the quantum structure of the fields collapses. Therefore, changing topology of quantum radiation fields or quantum plasmas cannot exist. In connection with these systems the following question is raised: can the general nature of the behaviour of the deforming electromagnetic radiation systems be investigated without quantum physics with the help of qualitative theory of second-order linear differential equations so that the results are true with respect to classes of fast-changing or singular deformations?.

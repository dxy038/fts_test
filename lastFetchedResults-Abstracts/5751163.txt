When standard coded video is transmitted over lossy channels it is vulnerable to transmission errors. The authors propose using multi-reference motion compensated prediction (MCP) to achieve robustness to transmission errors. It is shown that multi-reference MCP can greatly attenuate the propagation error. Additionally, the scheme facilitates the temporal concealment with small concealment error. Simulation under the typical packet loss rates of the Internet shows that the coding scheme employing multi-reference MCP provides much better objective and subjective performances than the conventional H.263 coding scheme in the lossy environment

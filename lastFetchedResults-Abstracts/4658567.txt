Larsson, Chiara Petriolo, Giancarlo Bongiovanni, Ole Grondalen, Kimmo Kansanen, Geir E. Oien, Torbjorn Ekman, Aawatif M. Hayar, Raymond Knopp, Baltasar Beferull Lozano<br/>in the ICT MobileSummit 2008<br/><br/>The increasing demand for wireless communication introduces efficient spectrum utilization. To achieve this, cognitive radio has emerged as the key technology, which enables opportunistic access to the spectrum. Towards dynamic spectrum allocation and cognitive radio, this paper proposes a new approach and innovative techniques to support the coexistence of licensed and unlicensed wireless users in a same area. The proposed concept, called Sensor Network aided Cognitive Radio, consists of a wireless sensor network able to assist the cognitive network by providing information on the current spectrum occupancy. This concept, that will addres- various operational scenarios in the future networks, involves a set of advanced wireless communications techniques like spectrum sensing, interference management, cognitive radio reconfiguration management, cooperative communications, end-to-end protocol design and cross-layer optimization. All these enabling techniques together will form a compound system able to improve the spectrum use in a significant way. The main target scenario we consider is the use of nomadic cognitive radios in urban and suburban areas. Our objective is to develop a proof-of-concept - scheduled in 2010 - of the Sensor Network aided Cognitive Radio technology by implementing such techniques and integrating them on a hardware radio platform, which will allow us to assess the efficiency of the technology in a realistic environment.

Development of the SMES using high temperature superconducting (HTS) coil has progressed as a Japanese national project since FY 2004. The objective of the project is to obtain around twice the normal energy density via an HTS-LTS "hybrid" coil system compared to an LTS coil system. The HTS coil is composed of sixteen double-pancake coils and the double-pancake coil is wound with a Bi2212 Rutherford-type cable. The HTS coil is operated at 4.2 K in liquid helium bath with the LTS coil, and operated at maximum field of 8.9 T. Before we made a hybrid coil system, we verified the design issues using HTS experimental coils. In this paper mechanical compression tests, DC operation tests and thermal runaway tests using the experimental coils are discussed.

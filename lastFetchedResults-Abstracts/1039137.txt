A screening method is presented for selecting optimal configurations for plate heat exchangers. The optimization problem is formulated as the minimization of the heat transfer area, subject to constraints on the number of channels, pressure drops, flow velocities and thermal effectiveness, as well as the exchanger thermal and hydraulic models. The configuration is defined by six parameters, which are as follows: number of channels, numbers of passes on each side, fluid locations, feed relative location and type of channel flow. The proposed method relies on a structured search procedure where the constraints are successively applied to eliminate infeasible and sub-optimal solutions. The method can be also used for enumerating the feasible region of the problem; thus any objective function can be used. Examples show that the screening method is able to successfully determine the set of optimal configurations with a very reduced number of exchanger evaluations. Approximately 5% of the pressure drop and velocity calculations and 1% of the thermal simulations are required when compared to an exhaustive enumeration procedure. An optimization example is presented with a detailed sensitivity analysis that illustrates the application and performance of the screening method.

Lifting body configuration is one of the typical layouts of Common Aero Vehicle(CAV), and the multi-objective optimization design of the airframe for lifting body configuration can greatly improve the integrated performance of Common Aero Vehicle. This paper establishes a numerical modeling of reentry vehicle to calculate these performance indexes such as the aerodynamic, the aerodynamic heating, the volumetric efficiency and the stability. Multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm is adopted to complete the aerodynamic shape optimization and design of hypersonic Common Aero Vehicle when under more variable and constrained condition in order to obtain the Pareto optimal solution of Common Aero Vehicle shape.

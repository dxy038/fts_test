The coordinated route planning problem for multiple unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), a cooperative optimization problem, also a norr cooperative game, is addressed in the framework of game theory. A Nash equilibrium based rout e planner is proposed. The rational is that the structure of U A V subteam usually provides some inherent and implicit preference information, which help to find the optimum coordinated routes and the optimum combination of the various objective functions. The route planner combines the concepts of evolutionary computation with problem specific chromosome structures and evolutionary operators and handles different kinds of mission constraints in hierarchical style. Cooperation and competition among U A V s are reflected by the definition of fitness function. Simulations validate the feasibility and superiority of the game theoretic coordinated routes planner.

Advances in information processing technologies have led to systems that integrate knowledge. The need for system flexibility demands that knowledge evolves through updates, but integrity needs require averting anomalies that may accompany updates. The objective of this paper is to consider a formal logic approach to model and sustain norms for knowledge integrity control. Specifically, deontic logic, the logic of normative concepts, is presented as a conceptual structure for expressing permissions and obligations related to knowledge updates. Resolution of conflicts is viewed as a model of dyadic bargaining, with obligated and permitted actions.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

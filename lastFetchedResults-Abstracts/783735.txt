Background During the past decades, extensive reformatory
changes in institutional psychiatric care have been
implemented in Norway.
Aims The objective of the present study was to investigate
whether these changes have resulted in shortened
length of psychiatric hospital stays for suicide attempters.
Further, to examine if length of hospital stay and time
period in which the patients received treatment were related
to the risk of a repeated suicide attempt and/or
committing suicide.
Methods All cases of suicide attempters hospitalised
between 1984 and 2006 in the municipality of Bærum, a
suburb outside Oslo, were examined. The period of
observation was further subdivided in two time intervals on
the basis of the de-institutionalisation of psychiatric care,
which started to plateau in 1996.
Results Among 1,574 patients consecutively admitted to
the local general hospital after a suicide attempt, 330 were
admitted to inpatient psychiatric care. Patients admitted in
the period 1996–2006 had significantly shorter hospital
stays than patients in the preceding period 1984–1995 (Log
Rank P\0.001). Neither the time period of treatment
variable nor the length of hospital stay variable was significantly
associated with the risk of a repeated suicide
attempt or suicide.
Conclusions Psychiatric de-institutionalisation appears as
not having affected suicide attempt repetition. It is possible
that reduced length of hospital stay has been compensated
by improved mental health care in general and extended
outpatient services in particular

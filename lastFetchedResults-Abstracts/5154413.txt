In this paper, we present Zuzie2, a computer application designed to help people extend their interpretation of the meaning of their activities, and propose that Zuzie2 is effective in cultivating the power of understanding and expression. In an earlier paper we presented the Constructive Scrapbook computer application which has the potential to make the user analyze expressions, extract significances to consider them deeply, and then create new expressions. Zuzie2 is an improved version of the Constructive Scrapbook. Using this tool, in the same way as with the earlier version, the user arranges compositions of pictures in a two-dimensional space, makes various compositions, and switches them freely. In Zuzie2, we have added a new function that enables users to import composition grounds that show the viewpoints of other users into their works. Our objective is to have children and ordinary people use various facets to analyze their activities and then create new expressions. Humans think and express something in a conceptual framework such as ordering, classification, or quantity. However, the thoughts of a single person have limitations due to the fixed frame of viewpoint. We have designed this tool so that the viewpoints of other persons combine with the userÂ´s work to form new expressive works. We held a workshop using the Zuzie2 application. The results show that this tool has the potential to make users analyze their activities, import other viewpoints to consider them deeply, and then create new expressions.

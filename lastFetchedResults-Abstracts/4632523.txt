Image and video coding in block-based image coding can cause blocking artifacts, which severely degrade visual quality in the compressed sequences. Loop deblocking filter method can reduce these artifacts and improve the video objective and subjective quality obviously. In this paper, we propose an efficient deblocking filtering method for multiview video coding, which considers the color bleeding distortion. Experimental results show that this proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional deblocking algorithm in terms of PSNR and subjective visual quality when QP value is relatively high.

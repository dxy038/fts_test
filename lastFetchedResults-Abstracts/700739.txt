Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disabling chronic disease of
the nervous system in which the myelin system of the central nervous
system is deteriorated. The objective of this study is to understand the
effect of Pilates exercises and aquatic training for a 12 week period on
the dynamic balance of MS patients.
Methods: The research method is semi-experimental. As a result,
among the female patients visiting the MS clinic of Kashani hospital in
Esfahan, 57 patients with disease intensity levels between 0 and 4.5 were
taken as samples. The average length of the disease was 8 Â± 2 years,
20;40 years old, and they were randomly divided into three groups of
Pilates exercise group, aquatic training group, and the control group.
The exercise schedule for the experiment groups consisted of 12 weeks,
three sessions per week, and 1 hour for each session. The dynamic
balance of the patients, before and after the exercises was measured by
Six Spot Step Test.
Results: The adjusted mean differences of Timed Up and Go Test
(TUGT) scores of the experimental groups are significantly different
(P < 0.05). Therefore, it can be said that Pilates exercise interventions
and aquatic training can significantly increase the dynamic balance of
the examinees in the post-experiment stage.
Conclusions: Performing the Pilate exercises and aquatic training
increases dynamic balance of the MS patients. Considering the role of
dynamic balance on physical fitness and enabling the person in doing
is daily chores and routines, and its direct effect on the quality of life,
it leads the specialists in applying these exercises as a supplementary
treatment along with the medicinal treatments for MS patients.

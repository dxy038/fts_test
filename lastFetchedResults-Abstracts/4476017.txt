The physical topology design (PTD) of optical networks is typically obtained as solution to a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that optimizes a performance measure, such as link length, total number of hops, maximum link load, number of wavelengths, etc. In this work, we investigate a multi- objective formulation to compute the Pareto set of solutions from static PTD or routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem. This approach allows a better perception of the gains and the losses of choosing any given solution. At last, we use a Pareto solution to preserve the open capacity of the network for the accommodation of future unknown demands.

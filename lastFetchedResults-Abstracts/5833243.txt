This paper presents a simple method to determine the performance of a Self-regulated, Self-Excited Six-Phase Induction Generator. The problem is formulated as multivariable unconstrained non linear optimization problem. The admittance of the equivalent circuit of the Six-Phase Self-Excited Induction Generator (SPSEIG) is taken as an objective function. Attention is focused on the influence of the different capacitor connections on the generator overload and output power capabilities. The generator voltage with simple shunt excitation connection collapses when it is overloaded. With short shunt excitation connection, the generator is able to sustain the load but at lower operating voltage and larger load current. The frequency and magnetic reactance or speed and magnetic reactance or frequency and capacitive reactance are selected as an independent variables depending upon the operational condition of the machine. The optimization problem is solved using Fmincon method. The developed mathematical model is quite simple and can be implemented for any type of load such as resistive or reactive with capacitor connected either across single three-phase winding set or both the winding sets. The computed results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.

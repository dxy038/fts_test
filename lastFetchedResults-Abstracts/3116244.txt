This paper presents a novel multi-objective optimization of printed microstrip-fed monopole antenna for ultra wideband (UWB) applications. Two objectives considered in this design are: low return loss and low transient distortion. By applying this method, a set of optimum antennas are achieved instead of a single design. Frequency and time domain performance of an arbitrary sample of optimized antennas are evaluated. Experimental results show that optimized antenna presents a |S<sub>11</sub>| &lt; -10 dB in 3.6-11 GHz. In addition, simulation results show that optimized antenna present a higher and more uniform fidelity factor in E-plane in comparison with similar UWB antennas reported in literature.

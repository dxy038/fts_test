Most relief resource allocation models focus on efficiency rather than equity. Equity is frequently quantified with the so-called inequality measures to be minimized. This paper presents eight common inequity measures and selects four measures appropriate for relief resource allocation model based on nine criteria. Then a general relief resource allocation model on the efficiency and equity trade-off is established by combining the inequity measure in a multi-objective model with efficiency objectives.

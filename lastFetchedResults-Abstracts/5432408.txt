In this paper we present a novel multi-criteria network selection algorithm for always best connected service provisioning. It relies on a suitably defined cost function, which at the same time takes into account metrics reflecting both objective, i.e. network related, and subjective, i.e. user preference related, conditions. Point of strength of our proposal is the implementation of the selection algorithm at a middleware layer; this hiding both network cost computation and 4G scenario complexity from user and application layers. The good performance observed is mainly due to the possibility of associating a weight to each cost parameter that is dynamically adapted to user preferences and profile not only on a per-session basis but also within the same session

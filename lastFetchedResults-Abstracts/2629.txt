The Cornell RoboCup Project was created to teach systems engineering concepts and practices to students to prepare them for designing, integrating, and maintaining highly complex systems. Another objective of the project is to explore the interplay between Al, dynamics, and control theory. This article describes the Cornell RoboCup team, which won the RoboCup-99 small-league championship in Stockholm, Sweden.

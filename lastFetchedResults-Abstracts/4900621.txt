This paper proposes a current distribution control on dual direct-driven wheel motors for electric vehicles. The objective is to maintain two driving wheels at a synchronous speed to keep the vehicle straight on, or at differential speeds when cornering, even they incur uneven load disturbance or parameter changes. The proposed control scheme employs load disturbance observer, model following controller and velocity command compensator to determine proper amount of current input to each driving wheel. The vehicle dynamics and control strategy are modeled and the control performance is simulated numerically. Experiments are performed with a dedicated wheel motor on a dynamometer and a virtual one on a field programmable gate array chip where the current distribution control is also implemented. The resulting control performance verifies the stability and robustness of the system in terms of its insensitivity of parameter variations and rejection of external disturbances

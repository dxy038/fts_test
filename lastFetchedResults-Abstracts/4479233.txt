Data replication is an important technique to reduce access latency and bandwidth consumption in Grid environment. As one of the major functions of data replication, replica selection determines the best replica according to some specific criteria in Data Grid environment, where the data resources are limited and Grid users compete for these resources. In this paper, we focus mainly on a novel QoS preference-aware replica selection strategy which will meet individual QoS sensitivity (IQS) constraints for different users/applications. We first present a framework that characterize QoS properties of replica services and establish its mathematical model by introducing quantification methods. In order to deal with the IQS constraints and to perceive Grid usersÂ´ QoS preferences accurately, we propose a QoS preference acquisition algorithm based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). We then design and implement a novel effective and efficient parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) based on Map Reduce paradigm for optimizing the objective function which corresponds to the optimal replica. Simulation results show that our strategy has a better performance in validity as well as scalability, and the optimal replica can always be obtained for Grid users with different IQS constraints under Data Grid environments that vary in system loads, scheduling strategies and user types.

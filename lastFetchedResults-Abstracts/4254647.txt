One of the main issues in project management is the compression of its duration. Project crashing is a method for shortening the project duration by accelerating some of its activities at an additional expense. The objective of crashing is to reduce project duration while minimizing the cost of crashing. However, the unknown or vagueness about the time duration for activities has led to the development of fuzzy crashing problem. In this paper, we introduce a fuzzy crashing problem based on statistical confidence-interval estimates for solving the unknown problem. The primary result obtained from this study is a Theorem based on statistical confidence-interval estimates through which the fuzzy crashing problem on project management can be solved efficiently.

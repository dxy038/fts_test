This paper presents a method for the squirrel cage asynchronous motors parameters determination, which is the object of a invention proposal. The method involves monitoring a direct-on-line starting and processing, by minimizing an objective function, the data recorded during starting. There are also presented the experimental results obtained, with accent on the synchronization device, which is the object of an invention demand, too.

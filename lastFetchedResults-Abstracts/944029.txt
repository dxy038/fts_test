The objective of this study was to determine the nutritive value of grape pomace and pomegranate seed pulpusing, in situ and in vitro(gas production) techniques. For this purpose two ruminalfistuled sheep were used. Nylon bags methods 5g of samples were incubated in duplicate in the rumen of fistulated sheep for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h. The gas production was recorded after 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 h of incubation. The data at the different times was analyzed using completely randomized design. Dry matter disappearance of grape pomace (45.75%) at 48h was higher than pomegranate seed pulp (36.23%). At 48 h of incubation CP disappearance of grape pomace was 43.36% that was significantly higherthan pomegranate seed pulp (40.04%) (P < 0.05). The gas production volume at 48h for grape pomace andpomegranate seed pulp were 220.46 and 167.69 mL/gDM, respectively.Contents of metabolisable energy (ME) and organic matter digestibility (OMD) for grape pomace and pomegranate seed pulp were 8.02 MJ/kgDM, 52/72% and 6.84MJ/kgDM, 44/79% respectively. It was concluded that grape pomace and pomegranate seed pulp as cheap feedstuff sources can be replaced with part of feed stuffanimalâ€™s diet.

During path planning, it is necessary to satisfy the requirements of multiple objectives. Multi-objective synthesis is based on the need of flight mission and subjectivity inclination of decision-maker. The decision-maker, however, has illegibility for understanding the requirements of multiple objectives and the subjectivity inclination. It is important to develop a reasonable cost performance index for describing the illegibility of the decision-maker in multi-objective path planning. Based on Voronoi diagram method for the path planning, this paper studies the synthesis method of the multi-objective cost performance index. According to the application of the cost performance index to the path planning based on Voronoi diagram method, this paper analyzes the cost performance index which has been referred to at present. The analysis shows the insufficiency of the cost performance index at present, i.e., it is difficult to synthesize sub-objective functions because of the great disparity of the sub-objective functions. Thus, a new approach is developed to optimize the cost performance index with the multi-objective fuzzy optimization strategy, and an improved performance index is established, which could coordinate the weight conflict of the sub-objective functions. Finally, the experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Treatments that obturate dentin tubules have been used for reducing dentin hypersensitivity. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of multiple treatments with a mildly supersaturated calcium phosphate solution on the hydraulic conductance (Lp) of partially occluded dentin discs in vitro. The treatment solution contained 6.5 mmol l−1 each of calcium and phosphate, 0.25 mmol l−1 fluoride, 30 mmol l−1 KCl, and 50 mmol l−1 HEPES buffer (pH adjusted to 7.0). The mean baseline Lp (in μl cm−2 min−1 H2O cm−1) was 0.108±0.041 (mean ± S.D.; n=9, μl cm−2 min−1 H2O cm−1 = 10.20 μl cm−2 min−1 KPa−1) and after five consecutive treatments, the mean relative Lp, presented as percentage of baseline, were 71±11, 58±10, 46±18, 40±14, and 25±10, respectively. The Lp values of the baseline and treatment groups were significantly (P&lt;0.05) different. Consecutive treatments appeared effective in further reducing Lp of dentin discs.

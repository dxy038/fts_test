The interactive exploration of complex simulation data have spurred a renewed interest in visualization techniques, because of their ability to give an intuitively clue for the interpretation of electromagnetic phenomena. This paper presents a methodology for a bidirectional coupling of VTK-based visualization systems to interactive and immersive visualization systems which are specially adopted for the handing and processing of large and transient simulation data. In this work, the coupling is demonstrated by the flexible virtual reality (VR) software framework ViSTA which is used by many national and international research groups.

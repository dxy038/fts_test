Adaptive antenna arrays have been proposed as a technique to suppress interference and increase system capacity. In specialized literature is found extensive studies for the cases of arrays with isotropic elements in adaptive antenna systems. In this paper, we apply dipoles as sensor elements and linear, circular and planar configurations in adaptive antenna arrays of DS-CDMA systems at the base station in the reverse link of cellular communication systems. Computational numerical simulations for the suppression capacity of the considered schemes, used the adaptive algorithm supervised recursive least squares to adjust the weight coefficients of the array are considered. This real scheme of dipole antennas when compared with ideal scheme of isotropic antennas it presented sufficiently reasonable approaches being therefore recommended for applications in real system cellular mobile communications. The comparisons of different geometric adaptive antenna arrays used dipoles as sensor elements are discussed and analyzed. The objective of this study is to present a general analysis of the performance of dipoles (not-isotropic antennas) in adaptive antenna arrays considered linear, circular and planar configurations of sensor elements.

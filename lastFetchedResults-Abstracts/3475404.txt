Standardization of the design has been a prime objective for the five SNUPPS PWR nuclear units. Described is the approach taken to achieve this objective in the electrical auxiliary system even considering unique site characteristics for each unit. Also identified are portions of the system which could not be standardized. The result is a successful single design for the nuclear power plant electrical auxiliary system.

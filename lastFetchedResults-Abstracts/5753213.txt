This paper presents an approach for transfer of speaker intent in speech-to-speech machine translation (S2SMT). Specifically, we describe techniques to retain the prominence patterns of the source language utterance through the translation pipeline and impose this information during speech synthesis in the target language. We first present an analysis of word focus across languages to motivate the problem of transfer. We then propose an approach for training an appropriate transfer function for intonation on a parallel speech corpus in the two languages within which the translation is carried out. We present our analysis and experiments on English&#8596;Portuguese and English&#8596;German language pairs and evaluate the proposed transformation techniques through objective measures.

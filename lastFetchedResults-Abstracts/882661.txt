Avicenna, in his ontological theories, frequently refers to the two terms necessity and contingency proposed by Ai-Farabi. These two terms, which can hardly be seen in philosophical works before Avicenna and Al-Farabi have only traces in ancient Greek philosophy. These trances are more evident in Aristotleâ€™s works in which they are treated more logically than philosophically in the sense that they have ben used in relation to propositions and not in relation to objective things and existents. With the Farabian and Avicennian initiative and their use of the theory of philosophical necessity and contingency, and their classification of existents into necessary and contingent the peripatetic ontology found a new distinct from by which the issues of the
existence of God, the world and the creation which had not been previously treated are explained more clearly.

This work is the result of an analytical investigation of both the steady-state and the small-signal behavior of a bidirectional boost converter with output filters controlled by PWM (pulse width modulation). Due to the bidirectional current capability of the switch, the discontinuous conduction mode does not occur, leading to a simple analytic description of the switching converter. The small-signal model is derived in the form of both control-to-output and input-to-output transfer functions using the state-space averaging method. As a result, fourth-order and nonminimum-phase characteristics are obtained

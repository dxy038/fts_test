Simulation is a popular approach to obtain objective performance indicators on platforms that are not at oneÂ´s disposal. It may help the dimensioning of compute clusters in large computing centers. In a previous work, we proposed a framework for the off-line simulation of MPI applications. Its main originality with regard to the literature is to rely on time-independent execution traces. This allows us to completely decouple the acquisition process from the actual replay of the traces in a simulation context. Then we are able to acquire traces for large application instances without being limited to an execution on a single compute cluster. Finally our framework is built on top of a scalable, fast, and validated simulation kernel. In this paper, we detail the performance issues that we encountered with the first implementation of our trace replay framework. We propose several modifications to address these issues and analyze their impact. Results show a clear improvement on the accuracy and efficiency with regard to the initial implementation.

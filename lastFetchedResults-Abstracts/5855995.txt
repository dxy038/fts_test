To facilitate the introduction of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) technology and associated dynamic spectrum management (DSM) procedures in military tactical radio communication, a roadmap was presented to NATO CaP3 military session in Oct 2012. The main objective of the roadmap was to create a dedicated band for cognitive radio, in the hope that this would take away uncertainties about spectrum regulations and be a sufficient incentive for military communication industry to start investing and developing products. This paper describes the proposed roadmap and formulates the critics of the NATO spectrum managers (CaP3) on this proposition. Taking into account the remarks of CaP3, a possible way ahead is described. The most promising idea is to create a Military dual-priority band that would take into account the existing saturation of the VHF/UHF band, and meanwhile create a clear spectrum access model for future DSA systems.

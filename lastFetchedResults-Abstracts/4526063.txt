In order to use the theory of space-time adaptive processing (STAP) in Sonar, an improved STAP for sonar was proposed. Firstly, the principle of STAP was analyzed according to the echo model of radar. Secondly, comparing the echo model of sonar with radar, the improved STAP was presented and the space-time coupling steering vector was used in space time processing. Finally, the improved STAP was applied in space time processing and objective detection. Simulation results illustrate that the improved STAP is beneficial to underwater objective detection, and applying Space-time coupling steering vector can improve the accuracy of the direction estimation of target.

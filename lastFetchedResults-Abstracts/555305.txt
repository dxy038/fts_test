Background: Management and rehabilitation of disabilities relevant to fine finger dexterities in spastic cerebral palsied patients is often complex and challenging, therefore exploiting an easy and effective method similar to music therapy for completing the rehabilitation process can be most essential.
Objective: The Aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Rhythmic-melodic stimulants on fine finger dexterities of spastic cerebral palsied children.
Materials and Methods: twenty patients (9 girls and 11 boys) suffering from spastic cerebral palsy with ranging in age from 7-12 years participated in this semi-experimental study. Ten of them randomly
assigned to experimental group and followed to control group. Musical
intervention was performed for experimental group. Level in fine finger dexterity of two groups assessed before and after intervention via the Purdue pegboard Test. Data was analyzed by U Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test.
Results: The results indicate that Patients in the experimental group demonstrated a significant increase from pretests to posttests in third, fourth and fifth stages of Purdue Pegboard test (P<0/05). However, there was no significantly difference between pretest and posttest of first and second stage (P>0/05)
Conclusion: it seems as thought musical activities in this study only can affect and improves bilateral fine finger dexterities. However, there was no any effect in unilateral dexterities.

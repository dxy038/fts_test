Background Intravenous amiodarone is effective for the acute suppression of recurrent hemodynamically destabilizing ventricular arrhythmias. There are no follow-up data on patients undergoing long-term therapy with intravenous amiodarone. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate long-term outcome.

Methods and Results We reviewed the clinical courses of 245 patients given intravenous amiodarone for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Of the 107 survivors (84% men; mean age 64 years) released from the hospital taking oral amiodarone, 41 were discharged with an empiric prescription for oral amiodarone. For 64 patients a decision regarding further therapy was based on results of an electrophysiologic study. Two patients were treated empirically with oral amiodarone and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Clinical variables and survival curves were the same for the empirically treated group and the group whose treatment was based on electrophysiologic findings (P = .89). Survival at 6, 12, and 18 months was 88%, 81% and 71%, respectively, for empirically treated patients, and 83%, 80% and 73%, respectively, for patients whose therapy was directed with an electrophysiologic study. Of the 64 patients who underwent electrophysiologic studies, 33 received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for patients with and patients without an implantable cardioverter defibrillator were similar (P = .46).

Conclusions Patients for whom recurrent ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation are suppressed with intravenous amiodarone and who are discharged receiving oral amiodarone have an 80% 1-year survival rate. Although not randomized, our data suggested that among such patients, electrophysiologic testing, implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, or both may not be necessary. Ascertaining the best management strategy for these patients will require a prospective randomized trial.

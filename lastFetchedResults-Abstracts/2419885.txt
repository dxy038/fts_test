A new design of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based decentralized controllers for load–frequency control of interconnected power systems with Governor Dead Band and Generation Rate Constraint nonlinearities, AC–DC parallel tie-lines and Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) units, is proposed in this paper. The HVDC link is used as system interconnection in parallel with AC tie-line to effectively damp the frequency oscillations of AC system while the SMES unit provides bulk energy storage and release, thereby achieving combined benefits. The proposed controller satisfies two main objectives, namely, minimum Integral Squared Error of the system output and maximum closed-loop stability of the system. Simulation studies are conducted on a two area interconnected power system with nonlinearities, AC–DC tie-lines and SMES units. Results indicate that the proposed controller improves the transient responses and guarantees the closed-loop stability of the overall system even in the presence of system nonlinearities and with parameter changes.

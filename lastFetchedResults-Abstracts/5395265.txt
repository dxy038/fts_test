The use of power electronic converters is strongly increased these last years, which increases the electromagnetic interference (EMI). In this work we propose to compute the electromagnetic field distribution for characterizing the electromagnetic perturbations emitted by the power converters circuits. For this objective we use two different modeling; the first is based on the resolution of Maxwell equations by FDTD and the second by using the Hertzian dipole concept and the modified images theory. These two approaches are compared in term of the precision, implementation and computation time consuming. Also, we propose a comparison with FEKO software which is based on the antenna theory. The obtained results show that the dipole method which is simpler to implement give satisfactory results.

Space syntax is a set of techniques for describing and analyzing spatial configurations of all kinds. It is equipped with clear property and design guidance that gives decision-makers a greater confidence in decision making in any related perspective. This work is focused on design and development of a road network analysis prototype in the form of a graphical simulation environment that supports multi-objective road and traffic network design. The simulation environment acts as a computer aided design tool that would evaluate the level of accessibility of a global traffic network, and its implication on distribution of traffic across different parts of the network.

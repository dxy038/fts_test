The objective of the study was to determine monthly variations in serum glucose, cholesterol, total protein (TP), urea, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine kinase (CK), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium, phosphorus and magnesium in Nguni, Bonsmara and Angus beef steers raised on sweetveld. Twenty-five Nguni, 15 Aberdeen Angus and 15 Bonsmara 8-month old steers were studied from June 2006 until March 2007. Across the 9 months, Nguni had higher concentrations of glucose (P = 0.019) and cholesterol (P = 0.001) than the other two breeds. The overall glucose and cholesterol concentrations in the Nguni were 4 and 2.86 mmol/L, respectively. There was a breed Ã— month interaction on glucose, cholesterol, creatinine, calcium, albumin and phosphorus concentrations. Breed had no effect on TP, urea, globulin and AST concentrations. Breed and month differences obtained could be attributed to changes in environment temperature and nutrient content of the forage.

Abstract
Background: Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis miller) is an evergreen perennial plant widely used in modern herbal practice and is often available in proprietary herbal preparations.
Objective: This study was designed to investigate the semen picture and spermatozoa morphology of West African Dwarf (WAD) bucks treated with Aloe vera extract.
Materials and Methods: Twelve sexually matured WAD bucks, weighing between 11 and 15 kg, were used for the study. The bucks were first used as control (pre-treatment) and later as two groups of six animals each. The first six bucks received 10 mls of the 3% extract while the other six received 10 mls of the 4% of the extract for a 7 day period. Semen was collected from both the 3 and 4% extract treated bucks for the control (pre-treatment), on days eight (first week post-treatment) and fifteen (second week post-treatment) in each case using the electroejaculation method. The spermiogram of the bucks were investigated using standard procedures. Data obtained were analyzed using two way ANOVA and significance reported at p < 0.05.
Results: The continuous administration of Aloe vera extract significantly (p < 0.05) reduced sperm concentration, motility and percentage livability and resulted in increased sperm abnormalities in the WAD buck.
Conclusion: Aloe vera adversely affected the spermiogram of bucks. The plant can reduce fertility in male animals and is therefore not recommended for medicinal purpose in male animals especially those used for breeding.

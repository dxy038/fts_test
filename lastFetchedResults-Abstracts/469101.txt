Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of a 3-dimensional virtual organ computer-aided analysis imaging system for the monitoring of the quantification of changes of uterine neovascularization before and after successful treatment with uterine artery embolization in cesarean scar pregnancy.
Study design
A case of cesarean scar pregnancy that was associated with extensive uterine neovascularization was diagnosed at 8 weeks of gestation with the 3-dimensional virtual organ computer-aided analysis imaging system. After appropriate counseling, a bilateral uterine arteries embolization procedure was performed with nonresorbable microspheres by interventional radiologists.
Results
The gestational cystic mass at the site of previous cesarean scar completely disappeared at the follow-up examination 3 months later.
Conclusion
A 3-dimensional virtual organ computer-aided analysis imaging system can be used for the monitoring of the quantification of changes of uterine neovascularization before and after successful treatment with uterine artery embolization in cesarean scar pregnancy.

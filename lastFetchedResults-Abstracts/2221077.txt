In the present study, depriving chickens of foraging material was shown to induce stress. The impact of this type of stress on the immune response was compared with feeding of corticosterone (1.5 mg per bird per day), a hormone known to be immunosuppressive and to be the major stress hormone of chickens. Corticosterone feeding induced stress as revealed by higher heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratios, longer tonic immobility (TI) reaction, reduced body weight gain and reduced egg production. Blood corticosterone levels were increased. Corticosterone feeding decreased the antibody response to tetanus toxoid and SRBC, DTH to PPD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the inflammatory response to PHA. Housing chickens on slats also induced chronic stress, as evidenced by increased H/L ratios, prolonged TI duration and decreased egg production. Corticosterone levels were slightly but not significantly enhanced. This novel form of chronic stress strongly suppressed humoral and cellular immune responses as evidenced by lower antibody titers to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and tetanus toxoid (TT) decreased DTH reaction to PPD and inflammatory reaction to PHA in the skin. In contrast, the antibody response to human serum albumin (HSA) was neither influenced by corticosterone feeding nor by keeping the birds on slats. Even the combination of corticosterone feeding and housing the birds on slats did not significantly impair antibody responses to HSA. In conclusion, the present study showed that chronic stress induced by depriving the birds of foraging material led to a similar impairment of humoral and cell-mediated immunity as did feeding with corticosterone. More importantly, it showed for the first time that depending on the antigen tested, there are stress-resistant and stress-susceptible antigen responses.

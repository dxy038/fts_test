Workflow can be understood as the automation of a business process in the total or partial meaning, when documents or activities are passed from one participant to another. The goal is that actions start according to a set of rules and behaviors. The objective of the article is to introduce the workflow technology and to present a new technique to model workflow systems. This technique is defined as an improvement of the Triggers Model (P. Barthelmess and J. Warner, 1995), validated by Stef Joosten. It is formed by a method for specifying activities and by a set of graphic elements inherent to the main concepts of workflow. As validation, this technique is used to model the Case Study to Approve Research Projects at the University at Santa Cruz do Sull. This modeling applies to the implementation of a prototype on Lotus Notes 4.6. The purpose of the improvement is to introduce aspects of the specification of the project that were not contemplated, through a sequence of stages aimed at the creation of a more efficient model, improving the implementation of a workflow system regardless of the development tool used, and making it easier

Liver performs several numbers of metabolic functions that are essential to human life. These functions make the liver one of the most important organs in the human body. There are diseases that occur in the liver in short time (acute) and long time (chronic). These diseases could occur because of medications, alcohol, viruses, or excessive fat accumulation or deposit in the liver. Some of these diseases are the inflammation of the liver, insufficient liver performance, Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and liver cirrhosis. If the liver malfunctions in anyway, people know that they are putting their life at risk. For this reason, diagnosing any disease in the liver is important and sometimes difficult. It is also important to notice the diagnosis of the patient at an early stage as the symptoms arise so that the patient might be able to carry on a normal life. The objective of this article is to diagnose the liver disease using an application of the CMAC (Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller) neural network so that it can shorten the medical diagnostic process and help the physician in the complex cases which are otherwise difficult to perceive.

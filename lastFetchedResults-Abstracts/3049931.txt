This work describes how a bidirectional WDM transmission technique on a single fiber gives a new opportunity to improve reconfigurability of WDM add-drop networks with a help of simple edge filters. These filters also make power penalty due to Rayleigh backscattering small enough for optically amplified WDM transmission over multiple spans. The paper emphasizes our design concept and preliminary numerical results rather than strict analytical processes and experimental results.

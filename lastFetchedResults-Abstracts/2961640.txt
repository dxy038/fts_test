In this paper, an object-oriented model description language OPDL, which is based on OPNs (Objective Petri Nets) is introduced. Then a basic algorithm of simulation based on OPDL models is presented. Finally, the implementation of a distributed simulator is proposed. The simulator can distribute the model objects on a Sun workstation network according to the distribution table defined by the user and coordinates the simulation of all objects

This paper deals with the energy recovery in the dairy industry. Thermodynamic, economic and environmental optimization of three water-to-water heat pumps has been studied in order to replace totally or partially a fuel boiler used to produce heat at different temperature levels in a cheese factory. These heat pumps have their evaporators connected to one effluents source and two of them are equipped by storage tanks at the condenser side. Multi-objective optimization permits optimal repartition of mass flow rates of effluents and optimal choice of electrical power of the compressors and volumes of storage tanks. The thermodynamic objective is based on the exergy destruction in the whole system. The economic objective is based on the investment cost and the operating cost obtained with the heat pump system. The environmental impact objective has been defined and expressed in cost terms by considering a CO2 taxation (carbon tax) on the GHG emissions. This objective has been integrated with the economic objective. Multi-objective genetic algorithms are used for Pareto approach optimization.

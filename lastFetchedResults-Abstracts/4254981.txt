A specific and high-sensitive immunosensor for detecting pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) markers in human serum is presented by miniaturizing array of microelectrodes via micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) for multi-channel electrochemical measurement. The immunosensor is consisted of six Au disk working electrodes, one Au counter electrode and one Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Semi-insulating poly(o-phenylenediamine)(PoPD) film was utilized to co-polymerize and immobilize antigen at the arrayed Au electrodes. The selective recognition of antibody to the corresponding antigen is quantitatively detected by the peak current in the presence of the redox probe, FcCH<sub>2</sub>OH(FcM). Samples with antibody positive and antibody negative can be distinguished.

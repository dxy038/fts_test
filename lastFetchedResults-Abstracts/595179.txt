Objective; To compare the induction characteristics of two different concentrations of propofol (i.e. 1% and 2%) in children undergoing eye surgeries.Material and Methods: This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted at LV Prasad Eye Institute Hyderabad India. Hundred consecutive patients of American society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) status I and II coming for elective eye surgeries were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into two groups of 50 each. Group A were given propofol 1% while patients in Group B were given propofol 2% for induction of anaesthesia and were maintained with 1% isoflurane and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Induction characteristics were assessed and compared in two groups. Student's t test and chi- square test were applied.Results: Loss of consciousness was more rapid with propofol 2% compared with propofol 1% (40s Vs 48s; P = 0.02). Pain on injection occurred in 5 patients (10%) and 10 patients (20%), P - 0.09 after propofol 1% and 2% respectively Spontaneous movements during induction occurred in 8 patients (16%) and 12 patients (24%, P=0.18). Satisfactory intubation was done in 40 patients (80%) and 45 patients (90%, P=0.I9), while spasm just after intubation was noticed in I patient (2%) and 3 patients (6%) receiving propofol 1% and 2% respectively. Haemodynamic changes were not different in the two groups.Conclusion: Propofol 1% and propofol 2% are equally effective and safe for induction of anaesthesia in children undergoing eye surgeries.

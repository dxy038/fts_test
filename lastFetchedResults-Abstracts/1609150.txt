The objective of this study was to assess the quantity and quality of biogas produced by co-digesting flushed dairy manure (FDM) and turkey processing wastewater (TPW). An attached growth digester with working volume of 15 L and a 3 L head space was operated at a 5 d hydraulic retention time using five feed mixes containing 100, 67, 50, 33, and 0% FDM by volume. The biogas yield ranged from 0.072 to 0.8 m3 [g VSâˆ’1] and the methane content (quality) of the gas ranging from 56% to 70%. Both the quantity and quality of the biogas increased as the proportion of TPW in the feed increased. An energy balance for the digester based on a dairy farm with 150 animals, showed that augmenting FDM with TPW at 1:1 and 1:2 ratios, feeds C and D, respectively, produced biogas with net positive energy to all year round. The gas produced was enough to run a 50 kW generator to produce electricity for about 5.5 and 9 h for the 1:1 and 1:2 feed mixes. However, the economics were not favorable if the benefits of the digester are based only on the value electricity to be produced. Either, other possible revenues such as carbon credit, renewable energy credits, green tags for electricity, putting a value to the environmental benefits of AD should be considered or subsidies from grants or other incentives programs to make the system economically viable.

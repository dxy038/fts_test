The increasing demand for real-time application in wireless sensor network (WSN) has made the Quality of Service (QoS) based communication protocols a hot research topic. Most routing protocols consider energy saving as the main objective and assume data traffic with unconstrained delivery requirements to be a given. However, with the arrival of wireless multimedia sensor networks, the transmission of imaging and video information requires both energy efficiency and QoS assurance (e.g. bandwidth, packet loss and delay constraints). Swarm intelligence algorithms are the relatively effective strategy for distributed optimization and show the desirable properties of being adaptive, scalable, and robust in particular of routing in WSN. In this paper, In order to achieve the balancing of energy-efficiency with QoS improvements for applications specific, a multiple QoS metrics hierarchical routing protocol based on swarm intelligence optimization (combination of improving ACO and AFSO) for WSN is proposed, namely 2ASenNet. The 2ASenNet protocol built a hierarchical structure on the network before choosing suitable paths to meet various QoS requirements. Then, the 2ASenNet protocol adopted hybrid ant behavior to produce diverse original paths, adding AFSO to ACOÂ´s per iterative process, and the optimization path was explored according to multiple QoS constrained. Simulation results have shown the efficiency of this novel approach, while simultaneously reducing the consumption of constrained resources as much as possible.

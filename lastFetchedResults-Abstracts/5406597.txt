The objective of this work is to allow users of mobile devices to visualize Web sites without mattering if Web sites were designed or not specifically for these types of devices; in that way, it is necessary to adapt Web contents to the limitations of each mobile device. In this paper, Web content transcoding mechanism "on-the-flight" is presented. This mechanism works by means of a simple inclusion of a HTTP header named X-Transform, which describes a transcoding format command. This header is generated by a client-side proxy named GAP, which runs on mobile devices with Windows CE operating system (Pocket PC, Smartphone, among others). The transcoding header is interpreted by a server-side proxy named GAT MT, that converts Web documents to WML, XHTML-MP, PDF, plain text, PostScript, XML and HTML adapted for mobile devices, making use of XSL technologies (XSLT and XSL-FO)

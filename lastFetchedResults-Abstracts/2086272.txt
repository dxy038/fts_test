Cancellation of Hadd (prescribed punishment) is prohibited in some Islamic narrations. These narrations have often been interpreted and construed as referring to Hodoud as opposed to Tazira’t and their inflexible implementation. According to such an inflexible reading of the texts, Hodoud would not be flexible enough to cover all the necessary expediencies, and would not be compatible with the requirements of different circumstances and conditions.
By critically analyzing the content of these narrations, this article comes to the conclusion that they are not specifically related to Hodoud. Rather, they are talking about punishment, in general, and that any unjustified ignorance and abolitionist approach to the punishment is not acceptable: be the punishment Had or Ta’zir. So the main objective of these narrations is not to emphasize rigidity, inflexibility, and  unreasonable seriousness in Hodoud in their idiomatic sense; rather they are emphasizing the certainty of punishments in general. Also the article criticizes some rules inferred from the narrations.

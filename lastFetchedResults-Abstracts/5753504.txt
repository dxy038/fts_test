In this paper, we present a modified version of HTS, called performative HTS or pHTS. The objective of pHTS is to enhance the control ability and reactivity of HTS. pHTS reduces the phonetic context used for training the models and generates the speech parameters within a 2-label window. Speech waveforms are generated on-the-fly and the models can be re-actively modified, impacting the synthesized speech with a delay of only one phoneme. It is shown that HTS and pHTS have comparable output quality. We use this new system to achieve reactive model interpolation and conduct a new test where articulation degree is modified within the sentence.

The patient complained of mild nasal obstruction and intermittent  epistaxis, but the significant symptom was  bulging  in medial canthus from 20 days before. Clinical and endoscopic examinations of the left nasal cavity revealed a vascular mass in the axillary of the middle turbinate and anterior ethmoidal sinuses extending to the left orbital cavity .

An indirect adaptive control scheme for linear time-varying plants is presented which guarantees the closed-loop stability and exact tracking of a class of reference input signals. By incorporating any a priori available knowledge of the structure of the plant parameter variations in the estimator, the scheme can meet the control objective for plants whose parameters can be rapidly varying functions of time

The paper presents the modelling, analysis and design of a pulse width modulation voltage source inverter (PWM-VSI) to be connected between a DC source, which is supplied from a photovoltaic (PV) array and the AC grid. The control algorithm of the PWM-VSI applies the concepts of the instantaneous p-q (real-imaginary) power theory. The objective is to show that, with adequate control, the power converter can transfer the DC energy from a PV array and improve the power factor (and the power quality) of the electrical system. Some design considerations are also discussed. A digital simulation and measurements on a small prototype model verified the feasibility of the proposed control method

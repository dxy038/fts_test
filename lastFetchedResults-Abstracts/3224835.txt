In this paper we propose a scheme tailored for WDM-PONs, which employs dozing mode in transceivers not only at the user side but also at the central office. The objective is to reduce the energy consumption while minimizing the impact on the total packet delay. The proposed scheme is able to take into account the diverse delay requirement of multiple traffic classes by adapting the wakeup time of the transmitter. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the power efficiency in WDM-PONs while maintaining the maximum packet delay at an acceptable level, in particular in cases where multiple traffic classes are considered.

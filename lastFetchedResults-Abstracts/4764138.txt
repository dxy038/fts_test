Applications like weather forecasting and prediction, health-care monitoring, habitat monitoring, tsunami- warning systems, demand integration of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with grids. The issues that need to be addressed are, providing suitable programming platform, seamless networking, data management, service/resource discovery etc. Objective of this work is to provide a programming model for this integrated network. We propose a programming model built using e-Petri Net, an extension to the classical Petri net. We define the meta-model for the e- Petri Net using Generic Modeling Environment (GME) tool. This meta-model gives the flexibility in understanding and analysing the application before hand.

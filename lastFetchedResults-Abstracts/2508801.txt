Background: High-energy linear accelerator (linac) is a valuable tool and the most
commonly used device for external beam radiation treatments in cancer patients. In
the linac head, high-energy photons with energies above the threshold of (?,n) interaction produce photoneutrons. These photoneutrons deliver the extra dose to the patients
undergoing radiation treatment and increase the risk of secondary cancer.
Objective: In this study, a simplifed model of the linac head was simulated and
photoneutron dose equivalent was calculated at the isocenter and maze in the sphere
detector. In addition, the absorbed and equivalent dose of photoneutron were estimated
in the some organs of the phantom.
Methods: The simulations were made using the Monte Carlo code. The ICRP reference adult male voxel phantom was used as the human body model for dosimetry
calculations.
Results: The results of dose calculations at the isocenter and maze showed that
photoneutron dose decreases as the function of distance from the isocenter and increases with increasing the distance from the entrance maze.
Conclusion: It is concluded that the simplifed model of linac head is a useful and
reliable method in dosimetry calculations. Calculations illustrated that the photoneutron dose is not negligible and duo to its harmful biological effects on body, it should
be considered in the treatment plans.

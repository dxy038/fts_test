A straightforward approach to the utilization of digital computers in design is described. The choice of a performance index is discussed as well as the search procedure to be used in seeking the component values which minimize this index. A realistic example of a pressure transducer is presented. The computer is used to choose compensating capacitors for the associated bridge circuitry with the objective of obtaining a linear (voltage versus pressure), temperature-independent response. The results are excellent both in terms of good design and reduction of design effort.

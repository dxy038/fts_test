Objective
m of this study is to assess the measures of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with panic disorder in comparison with the healthy subjects.
s
 three patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and twenty three controls were recruited for the study. Plasma samples of all subjects were analyzed for TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12 concentrations and NK-cell activity is measured in the peripheral blood samples of the subjects.
s
nd significant differences on the mean values of IL-12 (p = 0.01) and IFN-γ (p = 0.02) between the panic disorder and control groups. In a logistic regression analysis, IFN-γ values were significant statistical predictors of the presence of panic disorder (B = − 0.07, SE = 0.03, p = 0.04).
sion
st important implication of our results is to suggest a relation between panic disorder and low levels of IFN-γ, compatible with the results of the animal studies showing that IFN-γ plays a role by acting to regulate the development of anxiety-like behaviors.

Objective
To evaluate the auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) in patients with asymmetric hearing loss (ASHL).
Methods
Data on 245 patients (men = 106; women = 139) with ASHL were gathered, retrospectively. Effects of sex, age, stimulation side, and hearing level on ipsilateral ABRs were carried out by multivariate linear regression.
Results
Waves III and V latencies were only significantly affected by sex and hearing level but not by age and stimulation side, in patients with ASHL. In addition, wave V latencies were positively correlated with age in men, but not in women; IIIâ€“V intervals were significantly affected only by sex and age but not by stimulation side or hearing level.
Conclusion
Effects of clinical factors on ABR were different between patients with ASHL and normal-hearing subjects.

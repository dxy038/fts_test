Objective: Symptoms are important for appropriate triage and beginning of rapid treatment. Classification of patients referred to the emergency departments into high, low or moderate risk group involves accurate recognition of risk factors and symptom predictors.
Method and Material: This survey is a descriptive analytic study to determine symptom predictors and ACS risk factors in patients hospitalized in eight selected hospitals in coronary care units (Tehran). 446 patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction were randomly selected. Exclusion criteria were CVA history, joint degenerative disease, trauma, asthma, pulmonary infection and renal failure.
Data collecting instruments were a questionnaire consisting of demographic variables, risk factors, baseline variables, electrocardiography changes, cardiac enzymes and also ACS symptoms checklist.
Results: Results showed that menopause and diabetes are the only
effective variables on report of typical symptoms. The mostly reported
symptom among diabetic patients was diaphoresis and chest symptom was
dominant in non-diabetic patients. Chest symptom was also most common in
the menopause. Results showed that there was no significant difference
between typical symptoms of ACS with sex (p=0.98). Further more, chest
symptoms (sub sternum pain, left chest pain with pressure, heaviness,
tightness/squeezing sense) were the most common complaints. Typical

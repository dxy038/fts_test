The main objective of this paper is to examine the deterioration effects of the Doppler frequency-shift phenomena on the performance of direct-sequence (DS)/spread-spectrum (SS) communications systems caused by the wind turbinesÂ´ rotating blades. By performing Monte Carlo simulations through the entire rotation period of the blades and employing numerical integration over the entire length of the blades, the variation of the bit/symbol error rates of DS/SS systems employing different modulation signals are investigated. In order to provide many useful insights on the assessment of the performance degradation caused by the Doppler phenomena, this paper exposes miscellaneous numerical results related to different operating configurations and settlings.

Finding the most superior composite services belongs to the multi-objective and combination optimization category, this paper proposed a new solution to this problem which uses Pseudo-parallel genetic algorithm based on the up-triangular relationship matrix coding mode of chromosomes, and applies it in an example of itinerary scheme. Experiment results show the algorithm has a better performance.

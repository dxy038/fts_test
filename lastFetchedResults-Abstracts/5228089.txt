The objective of this paper is to develop methods for enhanced clutter/interference suppression by redesigning the transmit pattern in the spatio-temporal domain to emphasize the target response and de-emphasize the clutter response. In this context, traditional adaptive transmitter weight design in the spatial domain to generate multiple spatial nulls is extended to both the spatio-temporal domains to suppress certain Doppler frequencies as well. Analysis of this approach and preliminary simulation results are included in this paper.

Background: Atherosclerosis incidence is affected by various factors of which the most important is the high cholesterol plasma concentration producing fatty streaks as the first stage of athersclorosis.
Objective: To assess leptin effects on the cholesterol plasma level and hypercholesterolemia - induced fatty streaks in Rabbits.
Methods: Using 36 male white rabbits in this experimented study, they were divided into 6 groups. The case groups received normal or high cholesterol diet and different doses of 0.1,land 10 /i g / kg leptin everyday. The blood samples were tested and the cholestrol
plasma was measured .Also abdominal aorta was sampled to survey pathologic changes. Statistical Duncan test was used for inter and intra comparison of the groups respectively. Findings: The cholesterol plasma level in all high cholesterol diet (HCD) groups showed a significant increasing, but there were no significant differences between the groups. Fatty streaks in all HCD groups were equal.
Conclusion: Inspite of leptin effect on fat metabolism , regarding the fact that it has no effect on decreasing the cholesterol plasma level and there is not any difference between the case groups in producing fatty streaks ; leptin has no effect on athersclorosis.

Sequential composition is an effective supervisory control approach for addressing challenging control problems on complex dynamical systems. It constructs a back-chaining sequence of controllers to achieve the control objective using simple local controllers. Although sequential composition works properly for a single system, it is not designed for cooperative systems. This paper extends the standard sequential composition by introducing a novel approach to compose multiple sequential composition controllers towards cooperative control. Given two or more systems, cooperation is achieved by composing each of the systemsÂ´ supervisory finite-state machines, together with the estimation of the domains of attraction of the composed controllers. We present the simulation and experimental results of an inverted pendulum system collaborating with a second-order DC motor for cooperative swing-up maneuvers.

This paper formulates a simple two-sensor track association and fusion problem and derives a solution, using the finite point process formalism, expressed by prior and posterior Janossy measure density functions. The main objective of this paper is to show how the track association and fusion solution can be derived exclusively through manipulations of prior and posterior Janossy measure density functions. By doing so, we show the potential usefulness of the Janossy measure concept for developing new multiple target tracking algorithms. The secondary objective of this paper is to show how the possible presence of false tracks may affect the track association metrics, under the i.i.d.-non-Poisson and i.i.d.-Poisson assumptions.

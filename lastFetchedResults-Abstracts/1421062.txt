The main objective of this study is to provide the deformation characteristics in detail in ring compression, especially at the tool/workpiece interface. The surface flow patterns at the contact boundary are analyzed in terms of surface expansion, surface expansion velocity, pressure distributions exerted on the die surface, relative sliding velocity between die and workpiece, and the sliding distance along the die surface. Movement of neutral positions and folding phenomenon is also been investigated to see its effect on the flow pattern, that is geometrical change, which is important to measure the frictional condition at the interface using calibration curves.

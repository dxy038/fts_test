In classification of objects substantial work has gone into improving the low level representation of an image by considering various aspects such as different features, a number of feature pooling and coding techniques and considering different kernels. Unlike these works, in this paper, we propose to enhance the semantic representation of an image. We aim to learn the most important visual components of an image and how they interact in order to classify the objects correctly. To achieve our objective, we propose a new latent SVM model for category level object classification. Starting from image-level annotations, we jointly learn the object class and its context in terms of spatial location (where) and appearance (what). Furthermore, to regularize the complexity of the model we learn the spatial and co-occurrence relations between adjacent regions, such that unlikely configurations are penalized. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently enhance results on the challenging Pascal VOC dataset in terms of classification and weakly supervised detection. We also show how semantic representation can be exploited for finding similar content.

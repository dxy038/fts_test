Harnessing renewable energy and distributed generation (DG) are considered to be partial solutions to global energy concerns. This paper presents a model for a Green Energy (GE) system that facilitates integration of multiple renewable energy sources and an electric vehicle (EV). The proposed GE system is suitable for both stand-alone and grid-connected operation. It allows the integration of a wind turbine, a solar (PV) system, an EV with a wireless power interface and an energy storage to the grid through a bidirectional power converter, and is controlled by an energy management system. Each sub-system of the GE system is individually modelled using Simulink&#8482;, and then combined together through the energy management system. The proposed model accurately predicts the behaviour of the GE system under various operating conditions, and simulation results indicate that proper coordination between sub-systems is paramount in practice for efficient integration of multiple renewable sources both in grid-connected and stand-alone operations.

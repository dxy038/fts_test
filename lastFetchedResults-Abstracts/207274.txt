Stabilization ponds have become popular means of wastewater treatment for small communities and certain industries such as slaughterhouses, dairies and meat processing plants. The main objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of stabilization ponds for treating slaughterhouse wastewater.The efficiency of the slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plant of Bisotoon, Kermanshah was studied over a period of six months from September 2000 to March 2001. The general conditions and operation of the plant were studied and some of the wastewater treatment indices such as pH,TSS, BODS ,COD,coliform and fecal coliform bacteria in both the inflowing and outflowing sewers were determined.The average levels of TSS, BOD5, COD, total coliform and fecal coliform bacteria in the effluent were 280.67 mg/I, 353.17 mg/1, 580.5 mg/I, 1.51x10^7 MPN/100ml and 2.10x105 MPN/100ml respectively. The results were significantly different from the standard limits recommended by the Iranian Environmental Protection Agency.The results showed that the effluent could not be used for irrigation or discharged to surface water according to the recommendations by the Iranian environmental protection agency. Also, comparison of the average number of fecal coliform bacteria in the effluent with the standard levels in the microbiological quality guideline of World Health Organization (WHO) showed that the effluent was not acceptable for use in irrigation.

Serum vitamin D (VitD) status is associated with active
                            tuberculosis (TB) and TB infection conversion (TBIC). The objective of
                            the present study was to quantify the risks of TB (latent, conversion,
                            disease) in accordance with VitD status and other variables among the
                            contacts of pulmonary TB patients. From 2009 to 2012, a cohort of the
                            contacts of pulmonary TB patients was studied to rule out and prevent TB
                            in Castellon (Spain). The exams performed included a tuberculin skin
                            test (TST), a QuantiFERON Gold in-tube test® (QFTGIT), blood and
                            radiographic tests, and an initial measurement of serum VitD status.
                            Contacts who were initially without active TB were followed up through
                            2015. Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) analyses were carried out.
                            From a total of 572 contacts of pulmonary TB patients with VitD status
                            measurement, 523 completed the follow-up (participation rate 91.4%).
                            Among them, five groups could be established: 3 new cases of pulmonary
                            TB (0.6%), 27 cases of TBIC (5.2%), 116 cases of latent TB infection
                            (LTBI) (22.2%), 125 uninfected TB contacts with only one TST or QFTGIT
                            measurement (23.9%), and 252 uninfected TB contacts with two TST or
                            QFTGIT measurements (48.2%). The comparison of these five groups
                            revealed several significant differences, including age, whether they
                            were foreign-born, place of residence, social class, high exposure to an
                            index case with sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and VitD status. The MLR
                            analysis for all groups, with the group of uninfected TB contacts with
                            two TST or QFTGIT measurements as a reference, estimated that only two
                            of these factors were significantly associated with TB in three or more
                            groups; these factors were VitD status and high exposure and a sputum
                            AFB-positive index case. VitD status was a protector against pulmonary
                            TB with a relative risk (RR) of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74
                            - 0.99) and against TBIC (R = 0.95; 95% CI 0.91 - 0.99), while it was
                            not associated with LTBI (RR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.97-1.01). Only 34.0% of
                            the contacts had sufficient VitD levels (≥ 30 ng/mL). Our results
                            suggest that a sufficient VitD level could be a protective factor
                            against TBIC and active TB.

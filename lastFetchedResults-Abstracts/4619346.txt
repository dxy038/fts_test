Multidimensional scaling is a technique for exploratory analysis of multidimensional data, whose essential part is optimization of a function possessing many adverse properties including multi objectivities, multimodality, and non differentiability etc., In this paper, global optimization algorithms for multi Objective problems are chosen for different kind of problems especially in the IT Industry and power Industry. In this Paper it have been given the detail analysis of new algorithm with comparison of other algorithms. This new algorithm is tested and it is applied to an induction motor drive to eliminate selective harmonics for an voltage source inverter. The results have been compared with other algorithms and improvement in the performance has been observed.

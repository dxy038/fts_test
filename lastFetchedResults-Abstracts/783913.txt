Background Heterogeneous groups of patients with a
spectrum of service needs are commonplace in mental
health settings. Although comprehensive assessments are
available to measure variations in service needs, numerous
challenges still exist when confronting this heterogeneity
and many assessments used in clinic settings are lengthy
and have not been demonstrated to be consistent over time.
Objective The purpose of this study was to identify
subgroups of persons with bipolar spectrum disorders, who
have similar disability profiles, and to the extent to which
the subgrouping is stable over time.
Methods Participants were recruited from the Continuous
Improvement for Veterans in Careâ€“Mood Disorders. Eligible
patients (N = 435) were those who received inpatient
or outpatient treatment for bipolar disorder at a large urban
VA mental health facility in Western Pennsylvania from
July 2004 through July 2006. This was a naturalistic cohort
study of patients with bipolar spectrum disorders. Baseline
and 1-year follow-up data were collected using face-to-face
interviews and recorded abstraction. The World Health
Organization Disability Assessment Scale was the primary
measure used to identify subgroups within this sample.
Results Using a classification strategy called latent profile
analysis, this study identified three unique subgroups that
showed significant differences in various clinical measures
at baseline and follow-up. The largest and most consistent
subgroup differences were observed in the current bipolar
symptomatology.
Conclusion The classification of functional status in the
present study can aid clinicians in the identification of
bipolar patients, with specific impairment profiles, who
may need additional intervention. Future research is needed
to understand whether specific interventions targeted at
these subgroups can improve the quality of care for this
high-need and at-risk population

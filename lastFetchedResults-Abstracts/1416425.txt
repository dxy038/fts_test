In order to compare PCR technique with smear method to find out Theileria annulata in the cows carrier,cattle over one year was referred to the slaughter, samples were taken randomly since February 88 till May 89. We took blood from ear vein, then fixed with methanol & colored with gimsa at least we sarched for parasits under objective lenses (100x). Also for PCR,we took 9ml blood from jagular vein of each cows & added 1ml citrate buffer 3.2%, then sensed to biochemistry laboratory of Shahrekord University.From 140 samples by PCR technique:56 samples) 40%) were positive & 84 samples(60%) were negative. From 140 samples by smear method 12 samples (8.75%) were positive & 128 samples (91.43%) were negative. Comparison between PCR and detection of Asmer prepration method to detection of Theileria carrier cow, showed significant differences between two methods (P < 0.005). According to the results obtained in this study, we understand that the sensitivity of PCR technique to diagnosis Theileria annulata carrier svery high compared to smears.Itis suggested that the epidemiological studies,  and control measure  be used.

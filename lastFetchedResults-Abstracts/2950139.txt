A rate-based congestion control algorithm regulates cell emission rate of source end systems based on feedback information from the network. It was standardized by the ATM Forum for application to an ABR (available bit rate) service class. In the standard, two types of congestion notification methods of the switch are specified: EFCI marking and explicit-rate marking. In this paper, we focus on the explicit-rate marking switch. We propose our enhancements on a recently proposed switch algorithm known as the max-min scheme. The main objective of our enhancements is to control the queue length of the switch for preventing cell loss and achieving full link-utilization. We show the effectiveness of our switch algorithm by simulation experiments

The algorithm for objective function contour lines determination in case of three-dimensional problem is proposed. Procedures are based on Newton iterative method and principle of linearization of the contours in narrow intervals. Practical example is presented for use the algorithm to determine contour lines of the function that was obtained as a result of Q-band cavity measurements.

Objective:
In this study, we tried to make the staging of surgical approach of inverted papilloma (IP) and investigated the recurrence rate of IP.
Patients and methods:
Operating staging was as follows: When the IP was limited to the middle meatus, anterior and posterior ethmoid, or sphenoethmoid recess, standard endoscopic sinus surgery (SESS) was performed. When the lesion extended from the middle meatus into the maxillary sinus or originated from the medial wall of the maxillary sinus, radical endoscopic sinus surgery (RESS) was performed. And, when the IP originated from or involved the posterolateral, anterior, inferior wall of the maxillary sinus, intraorbital involvement, extensive growth of the lesion into the frontal or sphenoid sinus, or intradural invasion, external approach with endoscope assistance (Ex + E) was performed.
Results:
14 (36%) patients underwent SESS, 9 (23%) patients underwent RESS, and 16 (41%) patients underwent Ex + E. Malignancy occurred in no patient, and recurrences developed in four patients (10%). One of these recurrences happened after SESS, one after RESS and two after Ex + E.
Conclusion:
In this study, there was no significance of recurrence rate in each group. Better visualization can be obtained by combining the endonasal operation with an external procedure.

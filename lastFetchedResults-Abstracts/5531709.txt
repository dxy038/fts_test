A high-performance parallel, multivalued VLSI processor using the radix-2 signed-digit number system is proposed. Multivalued bidirectional current-mode technology is used not only in the high-speed small-sized arithmetic circuits, but also in reducing the number of connections. Compactness and high-speed operation enhance the performance of the processor chip under the chip size limitation. The processor has been developed for real-time digital control, where the performance is evaluated by delay time. A performance estimation using SPICE simulators shows that the delay time of the processor for operations such as matrix multiplication is greatly reduced in comparison to a conventional binary processor

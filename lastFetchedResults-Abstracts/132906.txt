Objective(s): To assess one-month drug compliance and some of the factors that influences it in a sample of diabetic patients.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out from April to September 2004. In this study, 256 diabetic patients in Shariati and Imam Khomeini hospitals were assessed in terms of one-month drug compliance and their knowledge about diabetes, their attitude regarding drug usage, family support, drug accessibility and other factors that probably influence compliance.
Results: 221 patients (86.3%) had drug compliance levels of ?90% during the month preceding the study. The associations between drug compliance and age, knowledge, patients' attitude about controlling of diabetes and drug effectiveness were significant (P <0.001, P=0.017, P-0.04 and P =0.009 respectively). However, there was no significant association between drug compliance and drug accessibility, family support, education, and co morbidity and disease duration.
Conclusion: Higher compliance in those aged above 45 years is probably due to greater risk perception. Age, knowledge and attitude influence drug compliance and therefore patients under 45 years of age, should be regarded as target group for interventions to increase drug compliance.

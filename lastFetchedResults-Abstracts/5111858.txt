An accurate near-field diffraction synthesis method for 2-D shaped reflectors in the E-polarized wave is presented. The implemented method is based on a singular integral equation (SIE), which is descretized with the method of discrete singularities (MDS). The gradient of the objective function is derived with the aid of a certain SIE whose right-hand part is computed from the electric field SIE for the surface current. Such a semi-analytical gradient method is favorably timesaving and has controlled accuracy of computations

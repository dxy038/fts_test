The LHC is designed to provide proton beams of 7 TeV and nominal luminosity of 1034 cm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. This objective is achieved at an affordable cost by pushing all major collider components to the limits of technology, by upgrading the existing CERN accelerators and infrastructure, and by involving the technical expertise, resources and dedication of accelerator laboratories world-wide. Following a decade of intensive R&amp;D and technical validation of major collider systems, the LHC construction is now fully underway. Major industrial contracts have been awarded and are in execution for the procurement of the magnet, cryogenics and other systems. In this report, the status of the design and construction of the major LHC systems is presented

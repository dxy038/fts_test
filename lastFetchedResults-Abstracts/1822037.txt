Objective
al was to evaluate the expression patterns for voltage gated sodium channels in odontoblasts of developing and mature rat teeth.

lysed immunoreactivity (IR) of the alpha subunit for all nine voltage gated sodium channels (Nav1.1–1.9) in teeth of immature (4 weeks), young adult (7 weeks), fully mature adult (3 months), and old rats (6–12 months). We were interested in developmental changes, crown/root differences, tetrodotoxin sensitivity or resistance, co-localization with nerve regions, occurrence in periodontium, and coincidence with other expression patterns by odontoblasts such as for transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1).
s
nd that Nav1.1–1.9-IR each had unique odontoblast patterns in mature molars that all differed from developmental stages and from incisors. Nav1.4- and Nav1.7-IR were intense in immature odontoblasts, becoming limited to specific zones in adults. Crown odontoblasts lost Nav1.7-IR and gained Nav1.8-IR where dentine became innervated. Odontoblast staining for Nav1.1- and Nav1.5-IR increased in crown with age but decreased in roots. Nav1.9-IR was especially intense in regularly scattered odontoblasts. Two tetrodotoxin-resistant isoforms (Nav1.5, Nav1.8) had strong expression in odontoblasts near dentinal innervation zones. Nav1.6-IR was concentrated at intercusp and cervical odontoblasts in adults as was TRPA1-IR. Nav1.3-IR gradually became intense in all odontoblasts during development except where dentinal innervation was dense.
sions
ne voltage-gated sodium channels could be expressed by odontoblasts, depending on intradental location and tooth maturity. Our data reveal much greater complexity and niche-specific specialization for odontoblasts than previously demonstrated, with implications for tooth sensitivity.

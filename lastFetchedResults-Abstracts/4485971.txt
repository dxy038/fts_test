Research in wireless sensor networks is ongoing at a large scale for applications deployable world-wide like forest monitoring etc. To design, deploy and evaluate novel wireless systems, large and critical application requires a substantial effort. One of the major applications of wireless sensor networks is in event detection. The main objective of this paper is to monitor the forest tree theft and alert using wireless sensor networks. In forest monitoring application, event occurrence is rare, so the communication node is kept in at sleep mode. Whenever an event occurrence has been detected by sensor, it triggers the communication node. Subsequently, the event is reported to the sink node as quickly as possible and an alert is generated. In addition to this, the second objective of this work is power harvesting and power managing that has been achieved using event detection technique.

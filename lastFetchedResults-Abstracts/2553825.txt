Objective:The main purpose of this research was to study the relationship between different types of second presentation with student independent learning. Method: A descriptive correlation research method was used. The statistical population included 3676 (1657 girls &amp;2019 boys) students of second grade of junior high school in Hamadan city at (9394)school year. Using clustering sampling method and based on Kerjcie and Morgan table about 246 (111 girls and 135 boys) were selected as study sample. The data gathering instruments were independent learning questionnaire based on Agency for independent &amp;Lifelong Learning and researcher made instrument second presentation type. The content validity of researcher made instrument was reported as acceptable by the experts and the reliability index of the instrument was stimated to be 0/851 for independent learning questionnaire and 0/878 for second presentation instrument using cronbachs alpha.The gathered data were analyzed using descriptive statistic indices such as frequency, percentage, table, mean, standard deviation and inferential statistical procedures like Pearson correlation coefficient, independent Ttest and multiple regression. Results:The Research findings showed that except feedback there was positive and significant relationship between contextual, prerequisite, memorials, supportive and presentation types with independent learning. Also finding showed that the independent learning could be predicted through contextual, prerequisite and presentation types. Conclusion:Through different types of second presentation we can increase the student self initiation, responsibility and autonomy in the process of learning.

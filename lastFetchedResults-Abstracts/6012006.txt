Large-scale Electric Vehicles(EVs) on Distribution System, result in electrical load of city grows rapidly and erratically, the reliability of Distribution System will be terrible if not regulate appropriately. As far as the Distribution System is concerned, EVs mass access is austere challenge and also a great opportunity, it can enable the power system to clean, efficient and intelligent direction. From the point of view of Distribution System planning, this paper based on the charging pattern of EVs, classified the EV load into three kinds: base-load-controllable load-bi-directional power. According to the different proportion of three kinds of load combination to simulate the EV load, the objective function is to reduce the grid peak-valley difference, combined with the city load forecasting, meet the energy need of user of EVs, the optimization strategy model for EV charging and discharging is built.

This research activity is being carried out between the Canadian Space Agency and the Royal Military College of Canada. The objective is to develop a Robotic Mimicking Control System (RMCS) to provide a more user friendly and efficient robotic controller. A video camera is used to acquire a still photograph of a model joint. The selected image is processed and a closed-form algorithm for photogrammetry is employed to determine the orientation of the model joint objects. This orientation information is passed on to the physical robotic arm. The commands are executed by the robotic arm, which enables it to imitate the orientation of the model joint

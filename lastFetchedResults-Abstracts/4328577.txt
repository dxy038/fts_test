This work presents the development of a novel bidirectional Solid State Disconnect (SSD) module based on Silicon Carbide (SiC) Junction Field Effect Transistors (JFET) capable of a fast disconnect action upon reaching a preset value of the current through the SSD. Due to the superior properties of SiC material and the low on-resistance of the normally-on SiC JFET, a very low insertion loss can be realized for high power applications. For application in 10kW power systems an insertion loss of less than 0.7% was achieved with a current fall time of 0.26&#956;s for trip currents of about 70A. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other solid-state disconnects available of comparable parameters.

Objective
rpose of this study was to determine the presence and relative composition of neutral lipids in human saliva.

unstimulated saliva was collected from 12 subjects ranging from 21 to 29 years old. Samples were lyophilized, and lipids were extracted using chloroform–methanol. Lipids were analysed by thin-layer chromatography.
s
saliva contains cholesterol, fatty acids, triglycerides, wax esters, cholesterol esters and squalene. The mean total neutral lipid content was 12.1 ± 6.3 μg/ml.
sions
lipids in human saliva closely resemble the lipids found on the skin surface. These salivary lipids are most likely produced by the sebaceous follicles in the oral mucosa and sebaceous glands associated with major salivary glands.

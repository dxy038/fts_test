Goat loins (n = 22) were evaluated to test effects of 0, 15, and 30% dietary pine bark (PB) and salt, water, and phosphate enhancement on shelf-life, shear force (WBSF) and consumer acceptability. No interactions existed between PB and enhancement. Dietary PB did not affect objective color, but enhancement increased a* and b* values (P &lt; 0.05). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) increased from d 1 to d 5 of storage (P &lt; 0.0001), but were not affected by PB or enhancement. The WBSF for 30% PB was less than that of 0% PB (P = 0.0199), and enhancement decreased WBSF (P = 0.0010). Texture, flavor, and overall acceptability were greater (P &lt; 0.05) for 15 and 30% PB compared to 0% PB. Enhanced loin samples had greater appearance, aroma, texture, flavor, and overall acceptability scores (P &lt; 0.05). Results indicated that enhancement improved tenderness and consumer acceptability of goat loin, and PB had minimal impact on goat loin quality.

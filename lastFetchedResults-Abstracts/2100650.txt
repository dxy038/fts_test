For investigating the feasibility of using disperse dyes as an immunoassay chromogenic marker, a disperse dye, DADISPERSE NAVY BLUE SP, was selected in analyzing antibody against infectious bursal disease virus (anti-IBDV). With the color intensity revealed in the disperse dye immunochromatographic test (DICT) strip as the objective function, the optimal dyeing conditions were found as follows: dye concentration absorbance (at λmax = 587 nm) = 3, pH 7, 50 °C, for 10 min. Under these conditions, the resultant dyed-antibody (rabbit anti-chicken) can produce an optimal color intensity reading of 55,054 on the strip. For performing qualitative immunoassay, chicken sera samples taken from different farms were used for the anti-IBDV titre assessment. The results of DICT strips showed very high sensitivity and specificity as compared to that analyzed by FlockChek enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (F-ELISA) kits. For quantitative immunoassay, it was found that the color intensity measured with DICT was linearly correlated to that of F-ELISA titre (r2 = 0.9687). Therefore, DICT was further applied to the detection of chicken anti-IBDV sera under vaccination in the farms. The average titres of the sampling groups exhibited a strong agreement to that of F-ELISA. Accordingly, the DICT method developed in this study, shown to be reliable, cheap and simple in both qualitative and quantitative immunoassays, is particularly suitable for point-of-need testing (PONT) in agricultural applications.

According to the connotation of Scientific Outlook on Development, this paper constructs a combination evaluation model based on G1-TOPSIS and then evaluates the scientific development performance of ten equipment manufacturing corporations in China. The innovation points and contributions are in three aspects. First, by evaluating performance from the manpower criterion, the basic idea of Scientific Outlook on Development of people-oriented is reflected. Second, by determining the combination weight through the multiplicative synthesis method based on G1 and TOPSIS, it fully utilizes expertsÂ´ subjective experiences and objective data, and organically combines subjective and objective information. Third, the research results indicate that the overall scientific development of these ten equipment manufacturing corporations is significant and sustainable, but not coordinate. Some corporations developed fast, some were far less developed.

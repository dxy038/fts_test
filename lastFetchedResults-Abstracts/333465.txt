Enlarged intramammary lymph node (LN) may be caused by inflammation [Arch. Surg. 109 (1974) 759.], reaction to dermatitis [Radiology 137 (1980) 15.], tuberculosis [Histopathology 17 (1990) 91.], foreign body such as gold [Hum. Pathol. 19 (1988) 992.], neoplasm including metastasis [Arch. Surg. 109 (1974) 759; AJR, Am J Roentgenol 146 (1986) 133.], and malignant lymphoma [AJR, Am J Roentgenol 161 (1993) 779.]. It is difficult to distinguish benign enlarged LNs from malignant lesion clinically, mammographically, and sonographically. There have been a few reports on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of enlarged intramammary LNs in the English literature. In this article, we present a case in which dynamic MRI indicated inflammatory LNs as highly suspicious of malignancy.

Objective: A pilot study was undertaken to investigate the utility of the vulvar algesiometer in correlating symptom improvement with treatment response. Study Design: Women with a diagnosis of vulvar vestibulitis syndrome attending a specialist vulvar clinic were assessed with the vulvar algesiometer before and after treatment. Results: The conditions of 25 patients had improved to the point of discharge, and readings from before and after treatment were compared. There was a statistically significant difference in the vulvar algesiometer readings before and after treatment and this improvement was reflected in patient response. Nine patients had no response to treatment and also no significant improvement in vulvar algesiometer score. Conclusion: The vulvar algesiometer provides an easy noninvasive means of assessing vestibular tenderness in vulvar vestibulitis syndrome that is well tolerated by the patients and provides a degree of biofeedback for them.

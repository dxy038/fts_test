The Technology System of Systems (TSoS) studies the connections between technologies which support Weapon System of Systems (WSoS) to fulfill certain functions and accomplish certain tasks. Current TSoS related methodologies and approaches are mostly objective or protected due to confidential causes. This study proposed two modeling methods to meet these challenges: the multi-view modeling method is used to provide the decision makers with a comprehensive understanding of the TSoS; the network modeling method is used to unveil the hidden links within the TSoS. A TSoS network model comprised of 112 technologies is constructed and its degree distribution is calculated to fit the power-law distribution, which validates the efficiency of the proposed TSoS network model.

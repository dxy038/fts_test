In this paper, we describe an optical configuration with a holographic optical element (HOE) for the small-form-factor (SFF) pickup head. This system adopts a finite-conjugate objective lens for both red and blue wavelength. A holographic optical element is used for simplifying the optical configuration which provides a better approach for alignment. In addition to demonstrating this OPH by using existing discrete components, flip chip bonder with high accuracy alignment was to integrate it. Fabrication process of the micro holographic optical pickup has been successfully verified. The experimental results verify the optical performance and the system have been demonstrated.

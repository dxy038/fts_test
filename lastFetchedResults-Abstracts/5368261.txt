This paper describes the procedures used during the planning of a material delivery system for the manufacturing lines of an electronic company. The paper describes the simulation experiments of a material delivery system for the manufacturing lines, using a logistic train. The main objective of this study is to make simulation experiments, regarding different amounts of equipment and logistic train programming methods, in order to identify and to propose changes that may lead to greater efficiency and precision of the logistic train functioning. The developed models were implemented with Arena simulation software. Experimental results are presented. Conclusions are discussed.

A controller able to support bidirectional power flow in a full-bridge rectifier with boost-like topology is obtained. The controller is computed using port Hamiltonian passivity techniques for a suitable generalized state space averaging truncation of the system, which transforms the control objectives, namely constant output voltage dc-bus and unity input power factor, into a regulation problem. Simulation results for the full system show the correctness of the simplifi-cations introduced to obtain the controller.

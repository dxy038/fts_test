Objective: To evaluate image guided cutting needle biopsy of mediastinal masses for diagnostic yield and complications. Material and methods: This was a descriptive study. Computed Tomography (CT) and ultrasound guided biopsies of mediastinal masses were performed in 30 patients. Tissue core obtained, were preserved in formalin and sent for histological examination. X-ray chest taken for evidence of pneumothorax and mediastinal widening. Hemoptysis, pneumothorax other complication were recorded. Result: Definite histological diagnosis was obtained in all 30 patients. 70% (n=21) were malignant disease and 30% (n=9) were benign pathologies. Sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 100%. Pneumothorax occurred in 7%> (n=2) cases. Hemoptysis occurred in 10% (n=3) cases. Chest intubation was not required in cases of pneumothorax. No hemodynamic instability occurred. There was no major complication. Conclusion: Image guided percutaneous transthoracic cutting needle biopsy in mediastinal masses is an accurate procedure for specific histological diagnosis and has a low complication rate

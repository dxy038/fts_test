NS(Simulator Network) is an object-oriented visual simulator based on large-scale discrete event. It simulates not only the transmission of network data and topology architecture, but also all kinds of IP network circumstance. This paper describes the architecture and characteristics of NS, and also gives the technique and the general process based on NS. The instance of a streaming media applications-based adaptive congestion control algorithm is implemented and simulation results are analyzed. The experimental result shows that when the network is congested, the delay, delay jitter and throughput will be corresponding changes in objective phenomenon.

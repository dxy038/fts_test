Objective: In some areas of Iran self –immolation is one of the most common ways for committing suicide and it is very disturbing and painful for those who witness it. Due to the presence of the families/relatives of the self-immolation victims in the psychiatric clinics seeking for the treatment of PTSD sings, we decided to carry out a research in this respect. Method: This descriptive cross–sectional study has evaluated 100 witnesses ( 70 % females , 30% males ) who referred to Kermanshah psychiatric clinic during a four year period ( 2004-2007) . The subjects were assessed by 2 demographical questionnaires and PTSD criteria on the basis of DSM-IV-TR using clinical interview. The obtained data were analyzed using SPSS statistical indexes. Results: Among the subjects, 52% were between 25-35 years of age, 87% were illiterate, 29% had a previous history of self–burning in their family, 33% had a previous history of mental disorder, 84% were villagers and 75% were married. The results have also shown that 78% of the studied subjects had diagnostic symptoms for PTSD and 22% had major depressive disorder according to DSM–IV-TR Conclusion: This study suggests that psychiatric evaluation of people who directly witness self –immolation in family members or neighbors may be useful in early detection and prevention of PTSD. However, further studies are warranted.

XLIM (French research institute based at the University of Limoges) has just launched a new project which is called Michelson project and whose the concept has been patented. The objective is to measure an electromagnetic field in a selected location. This system is composed of a target, a receiving antenna, and a system of acquisition. The target is illuminated by the incident field which must be measured. This field is diffracted by this target in different directions and according to different polarizations. A receiving antenna is placed at a given place and recovers the diffracted field at this location. The purpose is to come back to the incident field which lights up the target from the voltage measured on the receiving antenna output. To obtain the incident field, a global transfer function of this system must be calculated before. One of many possible applications of this system is the measurement of high power which could be destructive for traditional receiving systems. Moreover this system doesnÂ´t disturb much the field in the zone of the measurement The first tests validating this concept have been realized with transient pulse signals in ultra wide band condition

The objective of this paper is to investigate some qualitative behavior of the solutions of an economic model. This is accomplished by studying a higher order difference equation where we establish some results about the boundedness, the periodicity, and the global attractivity of the solutions of this higher order difference equation and then apply the obtained results to give a complete description of global stability and the periodic character of the solutions of the model.

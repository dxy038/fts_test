The ARTEMIS BRITE-EURAM program has been presented in this paper. Its main objective is to develop a diagnostic methodology to assess i) the susceptibility of polymeric cable insulation to electrical ageing; and ii) the state of the insulation at any chosen time in order to evaluate the remaining life-time of operating power cables. The ARTEMIS partners include cable manufacturers, material suppliers, electricity distributors and a number of universities throughout Europe.

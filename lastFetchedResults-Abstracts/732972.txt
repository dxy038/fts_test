Background. To ensure successful implementations of genetic screening in the future, the attitudes of the public are an important factor to consider. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the intention to take a genetic test for an unidentified hereditary disease. A further objective is to assess the predictive values of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived personal control on the intention to take a genetic test. These aims are investigated in two groups differing in their experience and knowledge of genetic testing.

Method. A questionnaire was developed according to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and mailed to a random sample of 1000 persons from the general public and to 330 persons in FAP families. The response rate was 60% and 74%, respectively.

Results. The probability of taking a genetic test was high in both groups but significantly higher in the FAP group. The attitudes of the FAP group were significantly more positive when compared to the attitudes of the general public. For the persons in the FAP group, the most significant others in the decision to take a genetic test were their children, whereas spouses proved to be the most important significant others in the general public. The most important predictor of the intention to take a test in both groups was attitude, accounting for 64% of the variance.

Conclusions. The study indicated that most of the individuals in the FAP group and many in the general public intended to take a genetic test. Our findings suggest that living in an affected group and having some kind of experience of a hereditary disease may lead to an even more positive attitude to genetic testing. Using the TPB, attitudes were found to be the strongest predictor of intention to take a genetic test in both groups.

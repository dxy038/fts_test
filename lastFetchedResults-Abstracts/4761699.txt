A new variational assimilation method - named dynamic boundary variational assimilation project (the outer boundary value of grid zone selected chooses real observation instead of simulation value from the model), this method is based on the transformation of objective function is presented in this article, and taking this project into the shallow water equations for a simulation experiment with adjoint code, which developed a new way for forecasting primitive field. The feasibility of this method was proved true from the angle of theory and numeric study. The experimental result showed that the result of this variational assimilation on the basis of the method is explicitly improved for the primitive field

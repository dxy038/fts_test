A rotary platform is studied in this paper. The control method of its electromechanical transmission system is studied by using virtual prototype technology and control technology. Virtual prototype model of rotary platform is established in the Gear subsystem of RecurDyn, Based on the Hertz elastic contact theory. A feed-forward link and three-ring control system which are position, speed and current control link are designed in Colink. And then, the mechanical and control simulation model is set up. The response of the typical position command signal is analyzed. The simulation results show that the control method has effective engineering application, and the method can satisfy the objective of engineering control, providing a reference for the design and analysis of other electromechanical transmission control system.

Objective: We sought to investigate the amniotic fluid index for individual gestational sacs of twin pregnancies. Study Design: Four hundred eighty-eight patients with normal diamniotic twins were examined between 14 and 40 weeks’ gestation. The dividing membrane between twin fetuses was identified. An amniotic fluid index was then obtained for each gestational sac. Results: The median amniotic fluid index in individual twin gestational sacs rises slowly from 14 to 16 weeks’ gestation to 23 to 28 weeks’ gestation and then gradually declines. The median amniotic fluid index values by gestational age for twin A and twin B are not statistically different. Although twin pregnancies have a slightly lower median amniotic fluid index value than singleton pregnancies, the difference is also not statistically significant. Conclusion: Individual amniotic fluid indices can be obtained in twin pregnancies, and the values are comparable with those of singleton gestations. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:950-4.)

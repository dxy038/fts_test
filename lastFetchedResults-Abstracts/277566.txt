Energy storage and return (ESAR) foot-ankle prostheses have been developed in an effort to improve gait performance in lower-limb amputees. However, little is known about their effectiveness in providing the body segment mechanical energetics normally provided by the ankle muscles. The objective of this theoretical study was to use muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulations of unilateral transtibial amputee and non-amputee walking to identify the contributions of ESAR prostheses to trunk support, forward propulsion and leg swing initiation and how individual muscles must compensate in order to produce a normal, symmetric gait pattern. The simulation analysis revealed the ESAR prosthesis provided the necessary trunk support, but it could not provide the net trunk forward propulsion normally provided by the plantar flexors and leg swing initiation normally provided by the biarticular gastrocnemius. To compensate, the residual leg gluteus maximus and rectus femoris delivered increased energy to the trunk for forward propulsion in early stance and late stance into pre-swing, respectively, while the residual iliopsoas delivered increased energy to the leg in pre- and early swing to help initiate swing. In the intact leg, the soleus, gluteus maximus and rectus femoris delivered increased energy to the trunk for forward propulsion in the first half of stance, while the iliopsoas increased the leg energy it delivered in pre- and early swing. Thus, the energy stored and released by the ESAR prosthesis combined with these muscle compensations was able to produce a normal, symmetric gait pattern, although various neuromuscular and musculoskeletal constraints may make such a pattern non-optimal.

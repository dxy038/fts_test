Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of stem canker and
black scurf on potato, survives as sclerotia on tubers,
in soil and in plant residues. The objective of the present
study was to evaluate the importance of inoculum
source on disease development. Disease-free minitubers
and seed tubers contaminated with low levels of
R. solani were planted in fumigated or artificially
inoculated growth mixture in greenhouse experiments.
Black scurf incidence and severity were significantly
higher when the inoculum was present in both seed
tubers and soil, compared with either of them separately.
The severity of disease symptoms on the subterranean
parts of the plant also were significantly higher
in plots where both seed tubers and soil were contaminated,
compared with plots where the inoculum
source was either the seed tubers or the soil. Thus,
both major sources of inoculum, seed tubers and soil,
are important in disease development. However, when
both sources are present, black scurf incidence and
severity are increased, leading to economical damage
to tuber yield and quality. Additional results from field
trials support these findings. Disease incidence and
severity on daughter tubers were correlated with levels
of contamination in seed tubers and soil. When seed
tubers and soil were heavily infested, the levels of
black scurf incidence and severity on daughter tubers
were very high; when seed tuber and soil infestation
were very low, black scurf incidence and severity on
progeny were also lower. Disease levels were reduced
by in-furrow fungicide treatment, but were less effective
when the initial levels of the fungus on the seed
tubers and in the soil were high

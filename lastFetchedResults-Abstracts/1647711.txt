Ventilation testing on the model of the Sv. Rok tunnel is presented. The aim of the testing was to obtain the data necessary for the tunnel ventilation designing. These data are particularly important because longitudinal ventilation is planned, which is not often the case in such long tunnels with bidirectional traffic that will be in this tunnel until the completion of the second tunnel tube. The testing procedure is described, and the obtained experimental results and the ventilation system efficiency in normal traffic conditions are presented.

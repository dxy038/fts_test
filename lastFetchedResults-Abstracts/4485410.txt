The optimization and scheduling of production operations is one of the key issues in automated manufacturing systems. In the past 30 years, single-objective scheduling problem in the automated manufacturing systems has attracted the attention of many scholars, but the research results had certain limitations in the application because it was only a simplified case of the actual production. It is more in line with the needs of actual production that to study the automated manufacturing systems scheduling under the conditions of multi-objective. In this paper, the mathematical model of the multi-objective optimization and scheduling in the automated manufacturing systems was established, and applied the non-cooperative game theory to propose the scheduling algorithm.

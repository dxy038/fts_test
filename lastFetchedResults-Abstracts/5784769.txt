A new design of broad-band suspended Microstrip Patch Antenna with shaped ground plane is presented. The fundamental parameters of the antenna such as return loss, gain, radiation pattern and polarizations are measured and these parameters meets the acceptable antenna standards. The radiation patterns are bidirectional in the E-plane and H-plane. The analysis is performed numerically using method of moments simulation software (Zeland- IE3D version 12.0) and the experimental results are presented. This antenna can be part of various wireless communication systems.

Modeling and simulation provide objective analysis tools for many fields including manufacturing. This paper presents the requirements and describes the usefulness of a Web-based interface to discrete-event simulation. A description of related efforts is first presented and an approach is then described. The approach develops a Web-based interface to use commercial discrete-event commercial tools

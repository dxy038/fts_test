We present the computer implementation of different standards for the evaluation of human exposure to whole-body vibration. The resulting computer tool enables assessment and quantitative analysis of vibration records in accordance with current standards ISO 2631-1:1997, VDI 2057 Part 1 2002, and BS 6841:1987. The objective is to provide a user-friendly computer system, as a complement to a basic vibrometer, which provides a quick and effective quantification of vibration effects using appropriate descriptors. The numerical implementation of a Matlab code is described, including the conversion of analog filters to digital in the time domain. The development of the computer tool presented here was motivated by the lack of flexibility found in commercial equipment; although commercial vibrometers satisfy basic requirements, they are limited to specific processing and restrict the possibility of a thorough study or research. The performance and potentiality of the computer tool, which has been conveniently validated, are illustrated through examples of practical interest.

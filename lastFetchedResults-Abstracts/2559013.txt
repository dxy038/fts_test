Abstract

Objective

Anticonvulsant drugs can cause various forms of skin drug reactions, ranging from exanthema to severe blistering reactions. An association between HLA-B*1502 allele and severe skin reactions have been reported.

Materials & Methods

Fifteen patients with severe skin reactions following treatment with anticonvulsant drugs (Carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, primidone) and 15 controls (age-matched epileptic patients taking similar anticonvulsants without drug eruption) were included. They were referred to Mofid Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Tehran, Iran, between Jan 2012 to Jan 2014. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of all patients and HLA- B*1502 genotype was detected by real-time PCR.

Results

None of the patients was positive for HLA- B*1502, but two patients in control group had positive HLA- B*1502.

Conclusion

The HLA- B*1502 is not correlated with severe anticonvulsant drugs -induced skin reactions in Iranian children.

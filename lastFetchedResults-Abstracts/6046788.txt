The objective of this paper is to discuss the accuracy and uncertainty of the standard WAsP model in determining the wind speed on a Croatian bora dominated site by using multiple wind measurements. The results show that on Croatian locations, however simple they might seem, it is essential to establish multiple wind measurements. Even with high quality measurements set at hub-heights and at a reasonable distance from a prospective wind turbine on a location of simple configuration, it is possible to expect significant errors in wind speed assessment.

Watermarking with oblivious detection and high robustness capabilities together is still a challenging problem. In addition, the number of secret keys which is required in the detection process should be kept as minimal as possible. Usually, a human visual model-based watermarking method requires recording the hiding places where watermarks are concealed. However, this kind of embedding strategy will cause an extra burden during watermark detection. The objective of this paper is to propose a more general watermarking framework which can satisfy the requirements of robustness and oblivious detection while only requiring one secret key in both the embedding and the detection processes. The paper proposes to employ the side information concept which is commonly used in communication together with a mean filtering process to design a new watermarking technology. Experiments show that the method is robust against common attacks

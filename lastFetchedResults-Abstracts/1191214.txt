The cure kinetics of a cycloaliphatic epoxy resin with and without additives and cured with an anhydride hardener was investigated by isothermal and nonisothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

Dynamic measurements were used to predict the total heat of reaction of the epoxy resin as well as its activation energy based on the methods of Kissinger and Ozawa. With these methods the inhibition and acceleration effects of additives and fillers on the kinetics have been demonstrated. Additives for advanced processing and property upgrade were added in less than 2 wt.%, whereas fillers on base of SiO2 were incorporated in more than 50 wt.%. The effect of SiO2 surface treatment was also objective of this study.

To describe the dependence of the conversion on time and temperature, isothermal DSC data were fitted to an autocatalytic model developed by Kamal and extended with a diffusion factor. The results show a very good agreement within the whole conversion range. Also the highly-filled system could be described very well by the phenomenological Kamal model.

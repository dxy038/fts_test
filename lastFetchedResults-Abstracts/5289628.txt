Ontology provides shareable and reusable knowledge about a specific domain. Domain specific relational databases are being used for constructing ontologies due to huge amounts of data on the Web. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview along with the pros and cons of ontology construction techniques. The objective of our research is to overcome the shortcomings of existing techniques in our future work. We have done in depth analysis of various techniques for ontology construction from relational database (RDB) based on database schema analysis (meta-data, cardinality restrictions and data type information), stored data (through data mining) and also performed a comparative analysis of these techniques.

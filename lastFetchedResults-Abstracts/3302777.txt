This paper presents a bio-inspired search behavior model for navigating using geomagnetic information in unknown environments. A multi-objective search navigation framework combining random walk movement model and stress evolution algorithm is applied to the navigation. Firstly, motivated by animal geomagnetic navigation behavior, we generalize the bio-inspired navigation process as the convergence of geomagnetic multi-parameter from the present point values to object point values. Then, we adopt a random walk movement model to represent the moving behavior of vehicle. In addition, stress evolution algorithm is used to obtain the appropriate direction, which realizes the convergence of multi-objective function as well as the bio-inspired navigation of vehicle. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only allows the vehicle to navigate efficiently using geomagnetic information without prior map, but also significantly improves the robustness of the navigation performance which could cross abnormal environment. The proposed algorithm offers insights into the research and application of the biologically inspired geomagnetic navigation.

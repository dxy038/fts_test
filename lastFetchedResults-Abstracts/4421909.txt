The high cost of fossil fuels and the fact that the world has arguably reached peak oil, has driven the need to seek alternative fuel sources. The main objective of the current study is to determine the performance of a laboratory-mounted diesel engine when fuelled with varying laboratory prepared bio-fuel blends and whether the advancement of the injection timing parameters will improve the engine power out and improve the smoke effect on these different fuel blends, ranging from 100% bio-fuel (BF100) to 50%, 30% and 10% bio-diesel blends (BF50, BF30 and BF10, respectively). It should be noted that these blends are not commercially available, since they were blended in the laboratory specifically for these tests. The overall results of the study show that there is a distinct opportunity for using certain bio-fuel blends in specific applications as the power outputs are no more than one quarter less than that of base diesel. Concomitantly, the smoke opacity in all of the blends is lower than that of base diesel, which is a significant benefit in terms of their overall air emissions.

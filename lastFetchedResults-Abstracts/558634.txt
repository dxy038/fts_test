Lipase is the extensively used key enzyme for various biotechnological applications in wide spectrum of industries. The process oriented feeding strategies for higher production of lipase was objective of the study. Range of carbon sources were used for the higher production of lipase, among them germinated maize oil was chosen as the best one. Feeding strategies like quasi steady state, pH stat and DO stat were employed. Eventually it was established that the DO stat based fed batch fermentation gave maximum in terms of both enzymatic units and productivity. The yield in DO stat fed batch fermentation was seven fold increase when compared to batch fermentation. The reasons for the higher production of lipase was documented and the commercialization of the product also discussed

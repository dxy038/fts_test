A neural network model and its application to image recognition are proposed in this paper. This model consists of a mapping network (MN) and liked bidirectional associative memory (LBAM). Invariant mapping is used in MN in order to decrease the number of dimensions of image samples and not to change the distance between them. LBAMÂ´s structure is simple and its convergence speed is fast.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

A prime objective of modeling gene regulatory networks is the identification of potential targets for therapeutic intervention. To this end, it is crucial to understand the structure-dynamics relationships in biological networks. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the structure of gene regulatory networks modeled as Boolean networks and the benefit-to-intervention-rate ratio of optimal intervention strategies derived for them.

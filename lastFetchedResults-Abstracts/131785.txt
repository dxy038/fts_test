Introduction & Objective: Accurate treatment of T.B is the only way for prevention of the disease. Incomplete therapy results in disease recurrence and development of drug resistance. The most important problem in the control of T.B is lack of compliance to therapy one reason of which is side effects of drugs. This study aims at studying the prevalence of the adverse effects of anti-TB drugs in tubercular patients in Shiraz, 2001-2002.
Materials & Methods: In this descriptive study, from April 2001 to April 2002, all new T.B patient records registered in our public T.B center(325 cases) were studied. All the patients were trained for the symptoms of drugs side effects. LFT test was done for those who developed drugs adverse effects. Pertinent demographic and lab data were gathered and analyzed.
Results: 325 new patients (182 male, 56%, 143 female, 44%) were registered. Among these 113 patients (52 male, 44%, 61 female, 56%) developed drugs side effects. 107 (29.5%) had minor and 16 (5.2%) had major side effects. The incidence of all major adverse effects was 0.4 person-day during this study. There was significant statistical difference between female sex and drugs adverse effect
(P<0.05), but no significant difference was found between nation, age and weight of the patients and the adverse effects of drugs. Conclusion: Of 113 patients experiencing side effects, 109 (96.5%) received complete treatment (3 died & ldiscontiued). Anti-TB drugs adverse effect isn't a major reason for discontinuation of therapy. Appropriate treatment of side effects leads to cure of illness.

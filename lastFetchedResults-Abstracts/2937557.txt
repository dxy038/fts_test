A new radiative transfer model based on Monte Carlo ray tracing techniques of leaf optical properties has been developed, where the internal three-dimensional cellular structure is explicitly described to represent morphological properties of a typical dicotyledon leaf. The main objective of this work is to perform sensitivity analyses at different wavelengths to test the influence of the leaf internal structure as well as that of pigment and water concentrations on the light attenuation profile and the bidirectional scattering shape

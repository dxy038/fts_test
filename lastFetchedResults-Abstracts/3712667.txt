In this paper, we compare simulated forces and accelerations for a moored floating buoy with full-scale experimental results in real ocean waves. The buoy is moored with a wire connected by springs to a concrete foundation situated at the seafloor. This study aims to develop a computer model using potential theory with a linearized free-surface boundary condition to describe the motion of such a system. The intention is to use the model for future study of wave-energy absorption and design of converters. Another objective is to see how complex a model is required to get accurate results. The method used is computationally fast and makes it possible to couple linear buoy wave interaction with nonlinear generator models, so that different loads and latching can be studied. A computationally fast method is required to model farms of wave-energy converters

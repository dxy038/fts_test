Background
Hypertriglyceridemia is often associated with elevated remnants, small dense LDL and decreased HDL-cholesterol (C). The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of bezafibrate on lipoprotein subfractions profile and inflammation markers in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.
Methods

Twenty-four hypertriglyceridemic subjects took bezafibrate, 400 mg daily, for 4 weeks. Lipoprotein subclasses were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Inflammation markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were also determined.
Results

Bezafibrate lowered triglyceride (TG) by 59% and increased HDL-C by 20%. NMR analysis revealed that bezafibrate lowered large TG-rich lipoproteins and IDL by 81% and 46%, respectively. Small LDL was selectively decreased by 53% with increase in large to intermediate LDL, thus altering the LDL distribution towards the larger particles (mean diameter 19.9 to 20.7 nm, p=0.0001). Small (HDL1) and intermediate (HDL3) HDL significantly increased by 168% and 70%, whereby resulting in a significant reduction of the mean HDL particle size from 9.0 to 8.7 nm (p=0.026). None of inflammation makers showed significant change by bezafibrate.
Conclusions

Bezafibrate effectively ameliorates atherogenic dyslipidemia by reducing remnants and small LDL as well as by increasing HDL particles in hypertriglyceridemic subjects.

Objective: In an attempt to decrease hospital stay we performed a prospective trial of aggressive bowel stimulation and early postoperative feeding after radical hysterectomy. Study Design: In a prospective trial of 20 consecutive patients undergoing class 3 radical hysterectomy, feeding of a clear liquid diet and bowel stimulation with oral 66% sodium phosphate solution (Fleet Phospho-Soda) were instituted on postoperative day 1. Patients were discharged after passage of flatus or stool. Results: Median time to discharge was 3.5 days. No patient had emesis, ileus, or bowel obstruction. The decrease in hospital stay with respect to those in our previous trial with traditional postoperative feeding and our original study on postoperative bowel stimulation was statistically significant. Conclusion: Aggressive bowel stimulation with Fleet Phospho-Soda and early feeding after radical hysterectomy resulted in early return of bowel function and early discharge without significant intestinal complication.

Daily variation in the udder surface temperature of dairy cows measured by infrared thermography: Potential for mastitis detection. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 83: 687-693. The daily and within-day variation in udder temperature was monitored in dairy cows (n = 10) using infrared thermography (IRT). The initial assessment and prediction of udder surface temperature variation would hopefully form the basis for future development of an early detection method for mastitis. Our initial objective was to determine the magnitude and pattern of udder temperature variation. To accomplish this, we measured daily fluctuations in udder temperature and the influence of environmental factors upon these values in non-mastitic cows. Udder temperature rose significantly after an exercise period (P < 0.05). Withinday monitoring of udder temperature demonstrated there was a distinct circadian rhythm. Lag regression analysis showed that previous daily udder temperatures together with environmental temperature parameters could successfully predict current udder temperature with a high degree of accuracy. The variation between predicted and actual udder temperature was within the

Objective. The effects of spinal cord injury level on shoulder kinetics during manual wheelchair propulsion were studied.

Design. Single session data collection in a laboratory environment.

Methods. Male subjects were divided into four groups: low level paraplegia (n=17), high level paraplegia (n=19), C7 tetraplegia (C7, n=16) and C6 tetraplegia (C6, n=17). Measurements were recorded using a six-camera VICON motion analysis system, a strain gauge instrumented wheel, and wheelchair ergometer. Shoulder joint forces and moments were calculated using the inverse dynamics approach.

Results. Mean self-selected propulsion velocity was higher in the paraplegic (low PARAPLEGIA=90.7 m/min; high PARAPLEGIA=83.4 m/min) than tetraplegic (C7=66.5 m/min; C6=47.0 m/min) groups. After covarying for velocity, no significant differences in shoulder joint moments were identified. However, superior push force in subjects with tetraplegia (C7=21.4 N; C6=9.3 N) was significantly higher than in those with high paraplegia (7.3 N), after covarying velocity.

Conclusions. The superior push force in the tetraplegic groups coupled with weakness of thoraco-humeral depressors increases susceptibility of the subacromial structures to compression.

This invited plenary session paper highlights research activities at the authorÂ´s laboratory at UCLA in the area of electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structures. Specifically, an overview of a powerful computational engine utilizing finite difference time domain (FDTD) technique integrated with novel extrapolating algorithms is presented to extract and highlight the marvels of EBG structures. The objective is to provide an in-depth understanding of the EBG phenomena and present representative applications. Among the structures addressed in this presentation are: (a) frequency selective surface (FSS) structures, (b) PBG crystals, (c) smart surfaces for communication antenna applications, (d) surfaces with perfectly magnetic conducting properties (PMC), (e) creation of materials with negative permittivity and negative permeability, (f) surfaces with reduced edge diffraction effects and (g) reduction of mutual coupling among array antenna elements.

Sensor Information Systems are widely used in data centers for a variety of reasons. There is, however, limited literature on the role of Sensor Information Systems to support the management practice of organizations. The main objective of this paper is to provide insights into the role of sensor technology in general, as well as into the Sensor Information Systems in particular, within the context of the data centers risk management practice. The paper explores the current practices of sensor applications and Sensor Information Systems in the context of data centers and identifies the gaps between the ideal and optimal utilization of sensors for managing the risk within the data centre environment. This leads to the introduction of the Data Center Sensor Information Systems (DCSIS). Using content analysis of data gathered from five case studies, the study evaluates the practical role of DCSIS in data centers risk management practice. The paper concludes by showing how DCSIS can enhance the processes of risk assessment including Risk Identification, Risk Analysis, Risk Evaluation, Risk Treatment, Monitoring and Review and Communication and consultation.

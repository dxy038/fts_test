Three-dimensional (3D) quantitative analysis is indispensable for the unambiguous characterization and objective classification of complex microstructures. Focused ion beam (FIB) nanotomography provides complete information of the spatial arrangement, chemistry and orientation of different phases of real microstructures on scales especially important in materials science (10 nm–100 μm). Complex graphite particles were analyzed in three-dimensions. Whereas nodular, vermicular and temper graphite particles can be characterized individually, the whole network of flake graphite has to be considered due to the high spatial interconnection of particles. The characterization method was verified in comparison to established two-dimensional stereological methods. The influence of anisotropy and image resolution was discussed. Basic stereological characteristics (volume, surface area, integrals of mean and total curvature) as well as 3D connectivity (Euler number) and shape parameters objectively differentiate these graphite morphologies and contribute to the understanding of their growth mechanisms and the properties of the cast iron.

A medium access control (MAC) protocol to serve different kinds of traffic, namely voice, data, and, real time variable bit rate (rt-VBR) video is proposed. The transmission time scale is divided into frames. Each frame is subdivided into N time slots. A fixed number of slots M out of 150 time slots are reserved at the beginning of every frame to transmit some of the video packets arriving during the frame interval. The rest of the video packets contend with the voice and data packets for the remaining time slots of this frame as in normal packet reservation multiple access (PRMA). One objective of this paper is to find the optimum value of M allowing the maximum number of voice and data users to share the RF channel with one video user. Another objective is to find the optimum permission probabilities of sending contending voice, data, and video packets allowing the maximum number of users sharing the RF channel. The 0.00001 dropping probability requirement for video is examined

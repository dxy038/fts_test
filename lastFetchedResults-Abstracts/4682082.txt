This is the companion paper to &#8220;Part I: theoretical aspects&#8221;. Part I reviews and critically analyses some of the most significant single-objective optimization methodologies proposed for the optimal operation of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) operating in Smart Grids. This Part II applies the models presented in Part I to a low voltage test Smart Grid. Analysis of the results highlights the behavior of the considered control strategies in terms of their compliance with both the objective functions and constraints. In the final part of this paper the results are summarized and compared in order to give an useful tool for understanding the more appropriate objectives and constraints to be taken into account for an optimal control of the Smart Grids.

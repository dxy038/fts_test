During an in-field campaign conducted in February-March 1993, the authors have characterized the reflectance properties of 4 Saharan desert sites in Algeria, identified from satellite imagery to be suitable for calibration purposes. Bidirectional measurements of the surfaces in reflectance were collected in different planes of each site in the visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared. The goal of the measurements is to prepare metrological standards for the calibration of present (AVHRR, Meteosat, SPOT, Landsat, etc.) and future (POLDER, Vegetation, MERIS, MODIS, etc.) satellite sensors

We describe a possible structure for a localization system providing 2-D position. The system uses global positioning system (GPS) sensor measures as well as odometric data and a digital road map to maintain a correct estimate of the location of a vehicle. The measurement results from these differences sensors are fused by using the evidence theory. The objective is to reduce the position error. Experimental results show the potential of the utilization of evidence theory to the localization problem.

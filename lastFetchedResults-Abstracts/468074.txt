Objective: This study aimed to compare neonatal outcomes in a cohort of triplet gestations undergoing a trial of labor with those of a similar cohort delivered by elective cesarean delivery. Study Design: Thirty-three women with triplet gestations who underwent a trial of labor were compared with a matched cohort of 33 women with triplet gestations who were delivered of their infants by elective cesarean delivery. Neonatal outcomes assessed included respiratory distress syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, Apgar scores, and birth trauma. Results: Twenty-nine of 33 women (87.9%) who underwent a trial of labor had a successful vaginal delivery of all 3 neonates. One patient was delivered of her first triplet vaginally but then required a cesarean delivery for abruptio placentae; 3 other patients were delivered of their infants by cesarean section for active-phase arrest of labor. There were no differences in neonatal outcomes between the 2 groups, although triplet neonates delivered by elective cesarean section demonstrated a trend toward a greater incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (P = .09). Conclusion: Our experience suggests that offering vaginal delivery is an acceptable management plan for triplet gestations. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:942-5.)

Efficient shortest path algorithm in road networks plays an important role in car navigation system. This paper brings forward the bidirectional A* algorithm based on the hierarchical thinking. Simultaneously, improved the data structure of A* algorithm and the expanded mode of nodes, greatly reduced the running time and scale of algorithm search, enhanced the speed and accuracy of path planning.

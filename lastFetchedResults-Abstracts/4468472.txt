A new three-phase power converter topology, applied for an AC drive, which consists of a matrix converter integrated with a boost-buck chopper, is presented. Although the configuration comprises 12 bidirectional switches (24 IGBTs), it may be useful because: the currents injected into the stator have an insignificant harmonic content, eliminating torque ripple and generating smooth rotor rotation even at low stator frequencies; the stator voltage can be boosted to a multiple of the input nominal voltage; and it allows high performance induction motor control to be implemented by sensing stator currents only (without shaft speed/position sensor and stator voltage measurement)

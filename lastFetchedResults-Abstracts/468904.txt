Objective
Reduction in the collagen content of the pelvic floor tissue of the patients with pelvic organ prolapse and/or stress urinary incontinence has been documented previously. However, this is less clear for nonsupport tissue. We aimed to compare the collagen content of the uterine cervix, a nonsupport tissue, of women who had pelvic organ prolapse with and without stress urinary incontinence against those without these problems.
Study design
Cervical collagen content was compared between 14 women who had pelvic organ prolapse with and without stress urinary incontinence and 17 controls without these conditions. Specimens were obtained after surgery for benign gynecologic conditions.
Results
Groups were similar with respect to age, parity, body mass index, and tobacco use. Women who had pelvic organ prolapse with and without stress urinary incontinence possessed significantly less collagen compared with the controls (8.10%±3.43% vs 12.35%±4.72%, P = .0104). Furthermore age, parity, body mass index, or tobacco use had no significant relationship to collagen content.
Conclusion
Cervical collagen content is significantly decreased in women who have pelvic organ prolapse with and without stress urinary incontinence regardless of age, parity, body mass index, or tobacco use.

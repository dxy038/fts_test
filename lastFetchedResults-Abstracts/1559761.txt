In the present paper, power transmission interaction of multilayered sound isolation panels consists of porous, solid materials and air gaps using Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) has been considered. Considering the theories related to acoustical behavior of multilayered panel lined with poroelastic materials, detail explanation of Transmission Loss (TL) of a panel via TMM has been presented. Calculation of TL for a specified panel via TMM has been compared to existed experimental data in the literature and excellent agreement is observed. Next, based on this verified model, a multi-objective optimization of multilayered panel has been conducted using NSGA-II to maximize TL of panel while the panel weight is kept to a minimum. Results of two-objective optimization reveals, if the designer target is to achieve a specific average TL in the frequency band of 10 to 500 Hz, for a panel with constant width, selecting a panel with lower layers (three layers) can bring lower weight. But, if a higher average TL in the same frequency band is desired, a panel with more layers (six layers) has much better conditions in terms of weight.

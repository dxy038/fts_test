Although more and more customers are buying products on online stores, they have a difficulty in selecting a both trustworthy and suitable seller who sells a product they want to buy since there is a plenty number of sellers who sell the same product with different options. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose a personalized trustworthy seller recommendation system for the customers of an open market in Korea. To that end, we first developed a module which classifies sellers into trustworthy one or not using a classification technique such as decision tree, and then developed another module which makes use of the content-based filtering method to find best-matching top k sellers among the selected trustworthy sellers. Experimental results show that our approach is worthwhile to take. This study makes a contribution at least in that to our knowledge it is the first attempt to recommend sellers, not products as done in most other studies, to customers.

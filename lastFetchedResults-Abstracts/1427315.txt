Objective
is a ‘risk factor’ for cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's dementia, and Late Onset Depression (LOD) is a forerunner of dementia. There is thus a need to study the association between ApoE4 allele and LOD.

udy assessed the frequency of ApoE4 allele in 31 cases of LOD above the age of 50 years and 31 matched controls. The subjects were assessed on various clinical parameters towards diagnosis.
s
was a significant association between the ApoE4 allele and LOD in comparison to controls (Odd's ratio = 4.7, Confidence Interval = 1.12 to 19.79, P = 0.035). ApoE4 allele had no association with the age of onset of depression, cognitive functions and severity of LOD.
sion
duals with LOD have a significantly higher frequency of the ApoE4 allele. In other words, elderly in India with an ApoE4 allele have 4.7 times more risk of developing depression in old age. Within LOD group there is no difference between those with and without ApoE4 accordingly in age of onset of depression, cognitive functions and severity of LOD.

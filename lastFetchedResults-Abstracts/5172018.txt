This paper researches the scheduling of the multi-objective elevator from a new perspective, building a new model after modifying tsp model. Tsp is transformed into the problem of the multi-objective elevator control. The paper analyses waiting time and elevator energy consumption, solving the control of the multi-objective elevator successfully. Taking Ant colony algorithms as example, scheduling scheme of the multi-objective elevator is completed through the resolution of tsp.

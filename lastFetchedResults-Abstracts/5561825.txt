Data from 53 current meters deployed between March 1983 and December 1985 in the vicinity of ten exploratory wellsites located near Sable Island were compiled and summarized. The objective was to present speed and direction information in a format that would assist offshore drilling operations and planning personnel in assessing the current regime north and south of Sable Island. Monthly mean and extreme current speeds together with prevailing direction of flow were determined for measured and residual currents. Individual current meter records were considered to be representative of near surface, mid-depth or near bottom conditions. Current speed exceedance values were also calculated. The predominant direction of current flow north of Sable Island was oriented towards the east. Consistent westerly flow was observed along the southern margins of Sable Island Bank, suggesting a year-round clockwise circulation around Sable Island. Average monthly current speeds south of Sable Island were higher than values measured to the north. Peak current speed exceedance values along the southern margin of the Bank were considerably higher than values calculated north of Sable island.

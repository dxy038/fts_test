In rail freight transportation, general merchandise freight cars may pass through many classification stations
on their route from origin to destination. The Railroad Blocking Problem (RBP) is to reclassify
inbound traffic from various origins in the classification stations and put them on outbound trains with
the same or close destinations, the objective of the RBP is to minimize the total operating costs of delivering
all traffic on the railway network while satisfying the resource and capacity constraints at the stations
and the priority constraints for shipments. In this paper, we introduce a new mathematic model
which can comprehensively describe the blocking strategy and various combinations of multi-route
Oâ€“D pairs in large scale railway network. Furthermore, we propose an improved Ant Colony (AC) algorithm
for RPB, and a computational experiment derived from the real life instances of coal heavy haul rail
network in north China is given. Experimental results verified the validation of the model and effectiveness
of the algorithm.

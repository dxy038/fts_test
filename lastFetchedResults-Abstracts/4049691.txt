In this letter, we consider the problem of designing asymmetric bidirectional associative memories (ABAM). Based on a newly derived theorem for the ABAM model, we propose an optimization-based design procedure for obtaining an ABAM that can store given bipolar vector pairs with certain error correction properties. Our design procedure consists of generalized eigenvalue problems, which can be efficiently solved by recently developed interior point methods. The validity of the proposed method is illustrated by a design example

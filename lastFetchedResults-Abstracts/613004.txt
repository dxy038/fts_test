This paper aims to probe the need and impact of teaching personality development, social and 
communication skills as part of Library & Information Science (LIS) education. The Master 
programme at the Department of Library & Information Science at University of the Punjab, Lahore 
was taken as a case to study in this regard as the Department started a full 3 credit hour course on 
‘Personality Development & Communication Skills’ in 2007.  To meet the objective of the study, a 
web-based survey was used for data collection. Those 4 sessions’ students who studied in this course 
were asked to respond to the survey.  The findings revealed that overall the course had a meaningful 
influence on students’ personality growth, behaviour modification and social skills. However, written 
communication skills were not much improved. The majority of respondents acknowledged the need 
for extensive learning of social and communication  skills for LIS professionals as part of LIS 
education. It is assumed that this study will raise awareness in this regard among other schools in 
the country and in the sister countries with comparable conditions.

The basic objective of this research was to investigate the incidence and occurrence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk and dairy products produced in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. Milk samples (107) and dairy products including yogurt (96), white cheese (119), cheese cream (150) and butter (74) samples were analyzed using High performance liquid chromatography equipped with fluorescence detector. The results have shown that AFM1 was detected in 71% of milk samples with 58% samples were found above the permissible limit of European Union (EU). AFM1 was detected in 61% of yogurt, 78% white cheese, 59% cheese cream and 45% butter samples with 47, 15, 11 and 52% samples of yogurt, white cheese, cheese cream and butter, respectively were found above the recommended limit of EU. The data of the present study will be helpful for the implementation of regulatory limit for AFB1 in order to minimize or avoid AFM1 in milk and milk products from Pakistan and also gives insights that whether the occurrence of AFM1 in dairy products was considered as a possible risk for consumers health.

Enterprise Architecture (EA) is the most suitable approaches intended to assist companies in achieving their long-term objective. Meanwhile, establishing EA in an organization is a costly and time-consuming task. We can analyze the EA scenarios using famous IT governance frameworks to achieve IT and business alignment. In this paper, we propose a new analytical approach for selecting and ranking EA scenarios according to the criteria of a well-established IT governance framework, namely COBIT. We propose a new group-based analytical approach based on a novel DEA model combined with p-robust technique.

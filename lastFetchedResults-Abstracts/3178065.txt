The application of two techniques for the reconstruction of shape reconstruction of the perfectly conducting cylinder from scattered field measurements is studied in the present paper. These approaches are applied to two-dimensional configurations. After an integral formulation, a discretization using the method of moment (MoM) is applied. The inverse scattering problems are transformed into optimization problems. Considering that the microwave imaging is recast as a nonlinear optimization problem, an objective function is defined by the norm of a difference between the measured scattered electric field and that calculated for an estimated the shape of the perfectly conducting cylinder. Thus, the shape of metallic cylinder can be obtained by minimizing the objective function. In order to solve this inverse scattering problem, two techniques are employed. The first is based on a dynamic differential evolution (DDE). The second is a new version of the DDE algorithm with self-adaptive control parameters (SADDE). Numerical results indicate that the self-adaptive dynamic differential evolution algorithm (SADDE) outperforms the DDE in terms of reconstruction accuracy.

In the past few years, the development of complex surveillance systems has captured the interest of both the research and industrial worlds. Strong and challenging requirements of modern society are involved in this problem, which aims to increase safety and security in several application domains such as transport, tourism, home and bank security, military applications, etc. At the same time, fast improvements in microelectronics, telecommunications, and computer science make it necessary to consider new perspectives in this field. The main objective of this paper is to investigate, discuss, and evaluate the impact of distributed processing and new communication techniques on multimedia surveillance systems, which represent the so-called third-generation surveillance systems (3 GSSs). In particular, aspects related to the distribution of intelligence among multiple-processing and wide-bandwidth resources are discussed in detail. It is shown how distribution of intelligence can be obtained by a hierarchical architecture that partitions, in a dynamic way, the main logical processing tasks (i.e., representation, recognition, and communication) performed in a 3 GSS physical architecture made up of intelligent cameras, hubs, and central control rooms. The advantages of this solution are pointed out in terms of 1) increased flexibility and reconfigurability and 2) optimal allocation of available processing and bandwidth resources. Finally, a case study is analyzed that allows one to gain a deeper insight into a distributed surveillance system

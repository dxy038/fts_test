In a recent paper by the current authors a new methodology called the Extended-Domain-Eigenfunction-Method (EDEM) was proposed for solving elliptic boundary value problems on annular-like domains. In this paper we present and investigate one possible numerical algorithm to implement the EDEM. This algorithm is used to solve modified Helmholtz BVPs on annular-like domains. Two examples of annular-like domains are studied. The results and performance are compared with those of the well-known boundary element method (BEM). The high accuracy of the EDEM solutions and the superior efficiency of the EDEM over the BEM, make EDEM an excellent alternate candidate to use in the animation industry, where speed is a predominant requirement, and by the scientific community where accuracy is the paramount objective.

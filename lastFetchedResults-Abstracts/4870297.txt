The network reconfiguration optimal control in distribution networks is modeled as a multi-objective combinational optimization. Multiple objectives are considered for load balancing among the feeders, minimum deviation of the nodes voltage, minimize the power loss and branch current constraint violation. Based on the objectives evaluated by membership functions respectively. These objectives are modeled with fuzzy sets to evaluate their imprecise nature and one can provide the anticipated value of each objective. We propose a new Fuzzy Preferences Multi-Objective Approach to solve it. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective in improving performance.

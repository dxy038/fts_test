The infection control staff worked on their first project that used the methods of continuous quality improvement from January through July 1993. The purpose of this initial project was to achieve proper isolation of patients with suspected tuberculosis. Flowcharting revealed that appropriate clinical performance by the charge nurses was crucial, and cause and effect diagraming demonstrated the importance of good policies and procedures. The team hypothesized that the charge nurses' current knowledge of tuberculosis and isolation procedures was low and that fewer exposures would occur if a concerted effort were made to educate this particular group. A self-administered examination to test their knowledge base was completed by 87% of approximately 75 charge nurses. The average score was 48 of a possible score of 100. Eight education programs were given to the charge nurses; these included information about tuberculosis and revised policies and procedures. After the intervention, the test was readministered to a group of 20 charge nurses. Scores of this group improved by 49%. Mistakes were made and lessons were learned in this first continuous quality improvement endeavor. Despite the flaws in this project, its ultimate goal of reducing exposures to tuberculosis was achieved.

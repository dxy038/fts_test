The application of particle swarm optimization (PSO) in parameters design of a split-phase single-phase induction
motor is proposed in this paper. The PSO considers the motor efficiency as objective function and five performance
related items as constraints. The main advantages of the proposed technique are; its simple structure and its
straightforward verification of maximum efficiency of induction motor for a given output power. The PSO algorithm
was implemented on a test motor and therefore, a code has been provided under MATLAB software. The results show
that the PSO method gives more suitable design optimization against conventional methods.

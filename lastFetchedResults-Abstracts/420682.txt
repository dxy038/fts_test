OBJECTIVE

To compare the prognostic significance of reperfusion assessment by Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade in the infarct related artery and ST-segment resolution analysis, by correlating with clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

BACKGROUND

Angiographic assessment, based on epicardial coronary anatomy, has been considered the “gold standard” for reperfusion. The electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring provides a noninvasive, real-time physiologic marker of cellular reperfusion and may better predict clinical outcomes.

METHODS

Two hundred fifty-eight AMI patients from the Thrombolytics and Myocardia Infarction phase 7 and Global Utilization of Streptokinase tPA for Occluded coronary arteries phase 1 trials were stratified based on blinded, simultaneous reperfusion assessment on the acute angiogram (divided into TIMI grades 0 & 1, TIMI grade 2 and TIMI grade 3) and ST-segment resolution analysis (divided into: <50% ST-segment elevation resolution or reelevation and ≥50% ST-segment elevation resolution). In-hospital mortality, congestive heart failure (CHF) and combined mortality or CHF were compared to determine the prognostic significance of reperfusion assessment by each modality using chi-square and Fisher’s Exact tests for univariable correlation and logistic regression analysis for univariable and multivariable prediction models.

RESULTS

By logistic regression analysis, ST-segment resolution patterns were an independent predictor of the combined outcome of mortality or CHF (p = 0.024), whereas TIMI flow grade was not (p = 0.693). Among the patients determined to have failed reperfusion by TIMI flow grade assessment (TIMI flow grade 0 & 1), the ST-segment resolution of ≥50% identified a subgroup with relatively benign outcomes with the incidence of the combined end point of mortality or CHF 17.2% versus 37.2% in those without ST-segment resolution (p = 0.06).

CONCLUSION

Continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring can be an inexpensive and reliable modality for monitoring nutritive reperfusion status and to obtain prognostic information in patients with AMI.

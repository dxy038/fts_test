To remain competitive many organizations are seeking to implement quality improvement systems. But measuring service quality is an elusive task. To facilitate this task, we are developing an expert support system to assist managers in determining what problems to address and what data to collect in order to improve service quality. The development environment consists of two banks committed to quality improvement, a semi-structured task, a high-level development tool, and multiple users. A four-stage development methodology is used, comprising requirements analysis, knowledge acquisition, system development and system assessment. The field prototype, developed in LEVEL5 OBJECT, uses procedural cuing to guide decision makers through a series of decision-making subtasks toward an overall objective. The function of the proposed system is to provide decision support, interactive training, and expert advice. Future research will expand the system, adding more functions and expertise.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

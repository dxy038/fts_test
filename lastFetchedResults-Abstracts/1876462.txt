Objective
m of this study was to describe Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) nurses’ coping behaviors while caring for a patient whose medical treatment transitioned from cure- to comfort-oriented care.
s
e of a descriptive qualitative research design with brief selective participant observation and focus group interviews was used to explore the coping experiences of MICU nurses. The study took place in an 18-bed MICU that was part of a 719-bed acute care hospital located in the northeastern United States. Nineteen female and 5 male nurses participated in the study.
s
urses used a variety of coping strategies including cognitive, affective, and behavioral techniques to cope with end-of-life care transitions. Being a MICU nurse in and of itself provided a sense of pride for staff. Most believed that their clinical opinions were valued and that they were respected as professionals. Providing futile care, the perception of “torturing the patient,” and conflict with families caused the greatest distress to staff.
sions
urses are dynamic and resourceful when responding to challenging end-of-life patient care situations.

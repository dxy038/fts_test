The objective of this work is to study flexible Printed Circuits Boards (fPCBs) using a ThermoMoire&#194;&#191; chamber for measuring fPCBs surface warpage as a function of temperature in orders to evaluate its displacements. A 3-D computational modelling in a multilayer configuration will be used to compare with a typical FEM simulation. Additionally, it will be demonstrated a defect inspection using an Acoustic Scanning Microscope (SAM) to find delamination failure after a Thermal Shock Test (TST).

This paper discusses the control of an industrial gas-phase polyethylene reactor to produce a desired molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the polymer. The controller objective is to regulate online the entire molecular weight distribution by either manipulating the hydrogen content inside the reactor or coordinating the feed rates of two different types of catalysts. In this work, the molecular weight distribution is modeled as a function of the reaction kinetics and hydrogen to monomer ratio. Nonlinear model predictive controller (NLMPC) algorithm is used to maintain the desired molecular weight distribution online. The closed-loop simulations indicated the effectiveness of NLMPC to achieve its goal even in the presence of modeling errors. Moreover, the results showed that, altering the hydrogen concentration solely can produce the required polymer quality provided that an efficient mechanism is available to readily alter the hydrogen composition. Alternatively, the desired MWD can also be guaranteed with proper manipulation of the catalyst feed rates while the other process inputs are kept constant.

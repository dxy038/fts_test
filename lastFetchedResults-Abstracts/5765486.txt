Cloud services decouple cloud applications from IT infrastructure in cloud environment. On demand resources provisioning pattern makes high efficient resource utility and application dynamic scaling possible. Hence Cloud data center could provide infrastructure capabilities in a more energy efficient way. However, there exists a tradeoff between energy efficiency and application service level objectives. It is challenging to realize effective energy consumption and energy efficiency aware autonomic cloud application service level agreement assurance mechanism. In this paper, we propose energy aware cloud application management architecture for private cloud data center. Furthermore we present a cloud application and power management model. In order to metering server energy utility efficiency and cloud applications´ total energy consumption of running on a specific group of servers, we define related measurement metrics. The objective of our approach is to reduce data center´s total energy efficiency by controlling cloud applications´ overall energy consumption while ensuring cloud applications´ service level agreement. The experiment results show that the cloud application energy consumption and energy efficiency is being improved effectively.

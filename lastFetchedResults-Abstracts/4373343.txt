A 32-bit constant coefficient multiplier using a KCM algorithm in Wallace tree format is presented. The proposed design is compared with other constant coefficient multipliers and different general-purpose multipliers. For quantitative analysis, the multipliers are synthesized in FPGA using Xilinx 4052xl-1 FPGA technology. The analysis presents a guideline to the ASIC designers for selection of an appropriate multiplier when delay, area, power or any combination of them is the primary objective

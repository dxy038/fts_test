The experience of the Army Metrics Training Program has been that most software development managers do not recognize or use the software metrics which are already available in their programs. The content of the Army Metrics course focuses on use of the &#8220;standard&#8221; Army set of metrics. However, the course material is presented in a workshop format, in which the student group discusses the standard metric definition in terms of their program applications. The objective is to teach the tailoring process to define software metrics in terms of each studentÂ´s management objectives and the structure of their program. The metrics tailoring process is structured by allowing by the students to define their own software measurement issues, including: how will measurement information be useful to my program in our existing management structure? How do I implement a measurement program without additional resources? What existing information and management systems can provide software measurement data?

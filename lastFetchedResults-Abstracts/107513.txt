The objective of this paper presents the results of subtask dealing with the bond behaviour study of the reinforcement systems under monotonic loading pull-out tests. This numerical method is based on the slip and the bond stress distributions through the anchored length of the bar in the concrete block. The work refers, especially to the implementation of reinforcing bars and bond-slip models between steel and concrete in the developed finite element program. For the application of the proposed method, three analytical expressions of bond-slip relationship are selected. The obtained results are presented and commented with the fundamental characteristics of plain concrete and reinforced concrete members. The bond models in contribution with concrete and reinforcing steel provide a relativity good representation of bond-zone system responses.

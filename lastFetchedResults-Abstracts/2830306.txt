This paper investigates a new approach for the design of robust output feedback controllers with respect to minimizing the condition number of the closed-loop eigenvector matrix. Relying on a recently proposed procedure for parametric eigenstructure assignment, we exploit the degrees of freedom in the design to achieve our result. Computing analytical gradient expressions of our objective function allows to minimize the condition number of the closed-loop eigenvector matrix using gradient-based optimization. Additionally, we will also discuss how further design goals can be easily included into the design which is exemplified by the notion of output coupling.

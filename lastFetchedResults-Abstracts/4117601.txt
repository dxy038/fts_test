PROMOTION of the use of electric energy requires that the voltage supplied to the user be of a level and a character that will not have objectionable effects upon the utilization equipment. The level supplied must be neither too high nor too low, and the variation must not be noticeable. On the other hand, it is not economically sound to furnish a voltage that is better than necessary to meet these requirements. The over-all objective, then, is to supply enough capacity for adequate voltage control at a minimum over-all cost.

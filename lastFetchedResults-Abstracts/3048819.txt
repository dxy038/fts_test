This work deals with the stochastic large-scale time-delay systems for certain performances. Delay-independent decentralized controller via linear memoryless state feedback is developed. The design objective consists of H<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm constraint and individual variance constrain. Sufficient conditions, based on a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The effectiveness of the proposed results are illustrated by numerical examples.

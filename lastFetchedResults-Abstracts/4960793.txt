The principle of material damage and the Cockroft-Latham damage model were demonstrated. The finite element simulation combined with fracture criterion has been performed in order to predict fracture. An optimisation method for the helical gears precision forging was proposed based on the finite element method(FEM) and Taguchi method with damage minimization. The maximum damage value of all element in helical gear precision forging was considered as the optimal objective. The optimal parameters combination is obtained through S/N analysis and the analysis of variance (ANOVA). It is shown that, for helical gears precision forging, the most significant parameters affecting the maximum damage value are punch velocity, friction coefficient, interaction between deformation temperature and punch velocity, deformation temperature in turn.

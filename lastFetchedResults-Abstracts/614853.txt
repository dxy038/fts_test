Background & Objective: Fire brick workers expose to dust that may affect their respiratory system. This study conducted to evaluate respiratory complaints and Spirometric parameters in a number of Fire Brick workers.
Methods: This case-control study was conducted on 51 fire brick workers as a case group and 56 workers of food industries as a control group. Respiratory Symptoms Questionnaire and spirometry, as a standard method, were applied to evaluate respiratory problems and lung functions, respectively.
Results: Respiratory complaints in case group were significantly higher than the controls. All the spirometric parameters, except FEV1/FVC, in cases were also significantly lower than that of control group (p  < 0.05).
Conclusion: This study shows that exposure to dust may lead to increased respiratory symptoms and spirometry abnormalities in fire brick workers.

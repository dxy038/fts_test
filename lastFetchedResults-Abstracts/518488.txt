Background and objective: Trichinellosis is a cosmopolitan parasitic infection in carnivorous animals which can also infects humans. Apart from one documented case of human trichinellosis by serology in Iran, there has not been any other report on human trichinellosis in the country. Hereby, an outbreak of human trichinellosis in a group consumed wild boar (Sus scrofa) is reported.

Material & methods: In May 2007, in 7 members of a household in Tehran, following consumption of boar meat, hunted and sent from Javaher-Dasht forest, Siahkal, Gilan Province, trichinellosis characteristic symptoms were appeared, simultaneously. After referring of these people to the School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and following blood tests, trichinellosis serology was performed by ELISA, and the meat of relevant boar was examined for Trichinella larvae.

Results: According to the history of the disease, symptoms and clinical findings and also presence of the Trichinella sp. larvae in the hunted meat, the infectivity of these people with trichinellosis was confirmed and they were treated by Albendazole. The serology by ELISA (IBL- Germany) showed the presence of anti Trichinella IgG.

Conclusion: Considering the presence of infection in wild animals in different parts of the country, there is the risk of occasional outbreaks of trichinellosis in people who practice consuming such meats. Therefore, the especial attention of the health and medical authorities of the country to this zoonotic disease is necessary.

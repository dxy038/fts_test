Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether hysteroscopy improves the detection and extraction of endometrial polyps in postmenopausal women. This method was compared with curettage complemented by Randall polyp forceps. Study Design: In a prospective study hysteroscopy was performed before and after curettage in postmenopausal women. In addition to curettage, the Randall polyp forceps was used to extract endometrial polyps. Curettage and polyp extraction by Randall forceps were performed by a second surgical team that did not know the results of hysteroscopy. Results: A total of 83 patients were included in the study because of either postmenopausal bleeding (n = 40) or ultrasonographic abnormal endometrium (n = 37), or both (n = 6). Thirty-two patients received either hormone replacement therapy or tamoxifen. Hysteroscopy revealed endometrial polyps in 51 patients. Polyps were diagnosed by curettage alone in 22 (43%) cases. In 18 of these 22 cases remnants of polyps were extracted by Randall forceps, and in another 23 cases polyps were only found by use of the Randall forceps. Thus in 45 (88%) of 51 patients the detection of endometrial polyps by curettage and Randall forceps was possible. A second hysteroscopy procedure revealed remnants of polyps or polyps in 31 cases. These patients with incomplete curettage predominantly had a preoperative endometrial thickness of â‰¥10mm. Conclusions: Curettage alone in postmenopausal patients is not sufficient for detection and extraction of endometrial polyps. Additional use of Randall forceps improves detection of polyps considerably. However, with both procedures complete extraction of polyps was not achieved in a considerable number of patients. Hysteroscopy-controlled extraction was superior, especially in those patients with an endometrial thickness of >10 mm. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:59-63.)

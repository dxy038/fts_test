Objective: In this investigation Murine Embryonic Stem (ES) cells were  differentiated
into  endothelial cells.
Materials
and Methods:
Murine ES cells (CCE cell line) exposed to AlphaMEM
medium containing 10% FBS for 4 days. Then
obtained Flk-1 (Flk-1: Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2) Positive cells were cultuted in 

Endothelial
Growth Medium-2 (EGM-2) until the last day of experiment. Differentiated


cells
were evaluated by immunocytochemistry,
RT-PCR
and Tube
Formation Assays.
Results:
When the ES cells cultured in collagen coated dishes containing 

Alpha-MEM
& FBS, Flk-1 positive cells were obtained. After
transfering Flk-1 

positive
cells into fibronectin coated dishes containing EGM2, the cells were 

assumed
a  relatively uniform endothelial cell morphology and could be propagated and
 expanded. Immunocytochemical and RT-PCR
analysis of differentiated

cells
showed that they take up acetylated low-density lipoprotein (LDL), express Flk-1,
CD31 and bind the BS-l lectin. When placed in Matrigel, these Murine 

ES
cell–derived endothelial cells formed capillary-like structures characteristic 

of
endothelial cells
Conclusion:
ES cell–derived endothelial cells provide a novel means to examine the
mechanisms of endothelial cell development, and may open up new therapeutic strategies.

Objective
To evaluate the feasibility of mitral valve (MV) reconstruction protocol by real-time 3D echocardiography (RT3DE) in the assessment mitral regurgitant (MR) lesions, and to determine the accuracy of RT3DE compared with transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal (TEE) echocardiographies using surgical findings as gold standard.
Patients and methods

Sixty-three consecutive patients (mean age 61.7 ± 12.5 years, 35 men and 28 women) with severe organic MR were enrolled. Data were acquired in zoom and in full-volume modes from apical and/or parasternal windows. A volume rendered en-face view of MV and five serial longitudinal cut planes were reconstructed to visualize all segments of both leaflets.
Results

The feasibility of RT3D reconstruction was 94%. Compared with surgical diagnosis, the accuracy of RT3D was 91% for aetiology, 92% for mechanisms, 94% for prolapse, 88% for flail and 94% for defect location. Diagnostic accuracy was significant higher for RT3D than TTE for all end points except for flail lesion and similar to TEE but inferior to this for flail lesion. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were higher in patients with good–excellent than those with poor image quality regarding aetiology, mechanisms and defect location (all p = 0.0001).
Conclusions

RT3D imaging of MV is feasible and accurate in defining aetiology, mechanism and defect location in patients with MR and has incremental diagnostic value if TTE is inconclusive and similar diagnostic value of TEE except for flail lesion. RT3D, at least in patients with good acoustic window, may obviate the need for subsequent TEE and/or can be considered a complementary technique to study MV in patients with MR.

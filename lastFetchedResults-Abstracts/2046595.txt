
Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of expressive arts
therapy on decreasing anxiety of orphaned girls living in family-like centers of Mashhad , Iran. Method: One week prior to final examinations, participants were randomly assigned to either
an expressive art-making group or a control group. The State-trait anxiety inventory was
administered before and after participation. Expressive art making activities included painting
or coloring predesigned Mandalas, free-form painting, collage making, still life drawing, and
modeling with clay. Results: The mean state anxiety score between pre-activity and post-activity decreased
significantly in the expressive art-making group, whereas no difference was found in the
control group. Similarly, the mean trait anxiety score between pre- and post-activity in the artmaking
group was significantly lower, and no difference was observed in the controls. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a brief period of expressive art making can
significantly reduce a person’s state of anxiety, which may have implications for art and art
therapy programs that offer methods for helping orphaned children coping with stress.

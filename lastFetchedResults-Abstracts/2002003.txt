Development of biomaterials to control the fate of stem cells is important for stem cell based regeneration of bone tissue. The objective of this study is to develop functionalized electrospun fibers using a mussel-inspired surface coating to regulate adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We prepared poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) fibers coated with polydopamine (PD-PLLA). The morphology, chemical composition, and surface properties of fiber were characterized by SEM, AFM, XPS, Raman spectra and water contact angle measurements. Incubation of fibers in dopamine solution for 1 h resulted in formation of polydopamine with only negligible effects on the roughness and hydrophobicity of the fibers. However, PD-PLLA fibers modulated hMSC responses in several aspects. Firstly, adhesion and proliferation of hMSCs cultured on PD-PLLA were significantly enhanced relative to those on PLLA. In addition, the ALP activity of hMSCs cultured on PD-PLLA (1.74 ± 0.14 nmole/DNA/30 min) was significantly higher than on PLLA (0.97 ± 0.07 nmole/DNA/30 min). hMSCs cultured on PD-PLLA showed up-regulation of genes associated with osteogenic differentiation as well as angiogenesis. Furthermore, the calcium deposition from hMSCs cultured on PD-PLLA (41.60 ± 1.74 μg) was significantly greater than that on PLLA (30.15 ± 1.21 μg), which was double-confirmed by alizarin red S staining. Our results suggest that the bio-inspired coating synthetic degradable polymer can be used as a simple technique to render the surface of synthetic biodegradable fibers to be active for directing the specific responses of hMSCs.

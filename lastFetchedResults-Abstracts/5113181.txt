Case feature weights are the keys to affecting the retrieving in case-base reasoning. To solve the problems of the existing algorithms such as poor objectivity and high complexity, a method based on coverage for determining the case feature weights is proposed, which calculates the case feature weights by the affecting of each attribute to the case average coverage. This algorithm has been applied to the CBR system for optimization of blending process in production of alumina. The experimental result shows that it is effective, objective and easy to do. In addition, the proposed algorithm can be used to guide the establishment and maintenance of the case base, and extended in other CBR systems.

An adaptive feedback control method is presented for the speed control problem of internal combustion engines. It is shown that for the mean-value engine model with the intake-to-power delay, the proposed feedback speed controller satisfies the design objective, and a simplified extension for the control design with adaptive control action is shown to be effective in accounting for uncertain system parameters. The stability of the control system is proved via Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional stability theorem. Experimental results are shown to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control system.

This paper presents the results of an experimental program for evaluating sensors and sensing technologies in an underground mining applications. The objective of the experiments is to infer what combinations of sensors will provide reliable navigation systems for autonomous vehicles operating in a harsh underground environment. Results from a wide range of sensors are presented and analysed. A conclusion as to the best combination of sensors is drawn

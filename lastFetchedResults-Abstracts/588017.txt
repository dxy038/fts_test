In this paper, we propose an iterated greedy algorithm for solving the blocking flow shop scheduling problem with total flow time minimization objective. The steps of this algorithm are designed very efficient. For generating an initial solution, we develop an efficient constructive heuristic by modifying the best known NEH algorithm. Effectiveness of the proposed iterated greedy algorithm is tested on the Taillard's instances. Computational results show the high efficiency of this algorithm with comparison state-of-the-art algorithms. We report new best solutions for 88 instances of 120 Taillard's instances

Nowadays wireless sensor network have been used in many area for automatic localization and target tracking. However, the large resource demands of sensors for simultaneous running might not be feasible and will lead to loss of functions. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamical sensor selection based on user-defined objectives, such as maximizing k-coverage and detection probability. We model the problem as a POMDP, which selects k sensors in each time frame to maintain the area coverage quality. In order to fulfill the users chosen objective, we change the system behavior by changing the reward function of POMDP and the parameter of coverage model. The performance of our scheme is compared to three different schemes: RandomSelection, ShortestDistance and POMDP with Boolean model. The POMDP scheme with probability coverage model shows the best performance in terms of coverage and detection probability.

Recently, inquiry-based learning has been used to enable students to ask scientific questions and come to objective conclusions based on observation and experimentation. Within this context, we have been exploring the impact of mobile devices upon different modes of learning including inquiry-based instruction. While much attention has been on the acquisition of mobile devices for the classroom, mobile learning has the ability to facilitate education beyond the confines of the brick and mortar to improve information retention and student engagement. This paper describes research being performed at Miami University which explores best practices in engaging students in inquiry-based learning experiences using a suite of technological tools (including a mobile app) being developed to support citizen science and research data collection.

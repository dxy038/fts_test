The Muskingum model is a hydrologic flood routing method in which the accuracy of its parameter estimation affects the routed hydrograph, especially in the value of the peak flow flood. Meta-heuristic algorithms are good candidates to determine optimal/near-optimal parameters in the Muskingum model. In this paper, shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) was applied and compared in two benchmark and real case studies.The sum of the squared deviation (SSQ) between observed and routed outflows and the sum of the absolute value of deviation (SAD) between observed and routed outflow as the objective functions (DPO) as an important parameter on the routed flood hydrograph. Results show were considered that the SFLA improves (decreases) the SSQ and SAD by 0.03 and 0.40 percent in the benchmark problem, and by 0.27 and 3.67 percent in the real case study, respectively, compared to reported results using various optimization algorithms. In addition, the SFLA improves (decreases) the DPO of the routed hydrograph in the benchmark and real problem by 17.65 and 3.67 percent compared to the best (minimum) reported result.

Introduction: Environment and perceptions about it play an important role in educational performance and its associated processes. Study of these relationships is valuable in educational process improvement. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between perceived classroom assessment and achievement objectives with nursing students' academic achievement.
Methods: This descriptive correlative study included undergraduate B.A students of nursing and midwifery school in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences who were enrolled within 2011- 2012. A sample (n-220) was selected through stratified random sampling based on gender. Participants completed perceived classroom assessment, and Midgly et alâ€™s goal orientation questionnaire. Also, students' grand point averages were used to measure academic achievement. Data was analyzed using LISREL software using appropriate statistical tests according to variable types such as Pearson correlation coefficients and path analysis.
Results: There was a significant negative relationship between perceived mastery classroom assessment and academic achievement (r= -0.20, p < 0.01). On the other hand, a relationship was observable between approach goals and academic achievement (r= 0.24, p < 0.01). Also there was a significant positive relationship between mastery goals and perceived learning-oriented classroom assessment (r= 0.21, p < 0.01). The causal model about relationship between mastery based class assessment and academic achievement mediated by achievement goals orientation was confirmed. 
Conclusion: Structures of classroom assessment can affect objective-based achievement procedures and academic performance. Therefore the type of evaluation and its consequents should be considered in developing educational methods.

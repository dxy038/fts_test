The objective of software radio is reconfigurability - the ability to dynamically configure software and hardware functionalities of mobile terminals. To achieve this, the concept of software download is emerging. With software download, a mobile terminal can be reconfigured using downloadable modules instead of saving all the software in its non-volatile memory. This paper presents the design of a configurable Java architecture. With this architecture, we may dynamically build secure and flexible execution environments for different software requirements. The implementation of the configurable Java virtual architecture is based on K virtual machine (KVM) and the constructed execution environment supports user application, man-machine interface (MMI), and protocol stack reconfigurability.

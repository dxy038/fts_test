This paper presents a robust H<inf>&#194;&#191;</inf> full-state feedback control synthesis method for uncertain systems with D<inf>11</inf> &#194;&#191; 0. The method is applied to the robust stabilization problem of the Space Station in the face of inertia matrix uncertainty. The control design objective is to find a robust controller that yields the largest stable hypercube in uncertain parameter space, while satisfying the nominal performance requirements. The significance of employing an uncertain plant model with D<inf>11</inf> &#194;&#191; 0 is demonstrated.

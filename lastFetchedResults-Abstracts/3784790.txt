The determination of when a process control computer system is obsolete and requires replacement is a problem that must be approached in a logical and objective manner. An approach has been developed which uses specific trigger points to determine when a detailed investigation of obsolescence is needed and which defines specific criteria against which the performance and continued suitability of the system can be judged. The methodology described can be applied to any type of process control computer system to give a systematic approach to determining and justifying the need to replace an existing system.

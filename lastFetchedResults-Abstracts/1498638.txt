The need to increase energy security and promote development, especially in rural areas has forced many developing countries in southern Africa, like Mozambique to take several actions toward development of several infrastructures and legislations for production and use of liquid biofuels. The main objective of this study is to present the energy situation in Mozambique and assess the potential for energy generation from widely available renewable sources including residues from agricultural crops and forest industry. The country is endowed with great potential for biofuels, solar, hydro and wind energy production. The energy production today is, however, far from fulfilling energy needs of the country, and the majority of people are still not benefiting from these resources. The potential of total residues from agricultural sector and forest industry is estimated to be around 128 PJ. This amount of energy covers almost half of the combined production of charcoal and firewood which amounted to approximately 298 PJ in 2006. However, such amount of energy resources is wasted and is not visible on national energy statistics.

Our main objective is to compare distance measurement for the motion verbs from the cognitive point of view and that of computable point of view. We use motion verbs to represent moving of objects as high-level features from the cognitive point of view. In the previous works, Specially, we focus on antonym relation and not just limit research only on the basic relations (IS_A, PART_OF) in hierarchical model and get suitable weight value (0.7) using correlation coefficient. In this paper, we propose trajectory retrieval using similarity measure according to link type between motion verbs

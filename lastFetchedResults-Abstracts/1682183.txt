Recent advances in hydrogen technologies allow the conversion between electric energy and hydrogen, increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Electric systems based on Hydrogen technology can be used to replace large battery banks in distribution systems, especially in green applications or where there is a big concern for environmental safety. A hydrogen based energy system with storage at high pressure allows smoothing the power variations which appear in electrical systems with a considerable proportion of wind and/or solar generation. A bidirectional Multilevel Current Source Inverter is used to interconnect an electrolyzer and a fuel cell within a low voltage distribution system with high efficiency and reliability. The proposed structure is simulated thoroughly with Matlab/Simulink, showing a proper behavior for the applications of interest.

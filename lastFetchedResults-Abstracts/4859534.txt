The paper analyzed the present energy sources situation in China, and put forward an Inexact Linear Multi-Objective-Program (ILMOP) approach for eco-campus energy sources system based on the characters analysis of eco-campus system. The ILMOP model objective in the least of economic cost and maximum of eco-environmental efficiency, while limited of capital available and every kinds of energy supply capacity. Then a corresponding information management system was set up to give support to information dating, model solving, designs forming and evaluating, and the optimal mode selected. Finally, the approach was used in Tianjin Polytechnic university energy system plan. The plan ranged from 2008 to 2016 and was separated into three phases. Through the scenarios analysis based on ILMOP solutions, three phasepsilas different energy rate was decided respectively, while the investment design was obtained. The case showed the method is a feasible support to campus sustainable development for setting a good example to the whole society.

This paper compares two different optimal power flow (OPF) formulations that consider voltage security in power systems. The techniques are both based on multi-objective optimization methodologies, so that operating costs and losses can be minimized while maximizing the "distance" to voltage collapse. The techniques are described in detail and compared to study their similarities, as well as advantages and disadvantages. The comparisons are based on the results obtained by applying these two methods to a modified version of the 118-bus IEEE test system.

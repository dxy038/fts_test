To meet the growing service scale, distributed streaming media system has been widely used for streaming media applications. The schedule algorithm of distributed streaming media system on how to reduce the network bandwidth consumption and balance the load among service nodes has become a challenging problem. We develop the period patching algorithm with unfixed period to achieve the best efficiency on reducing bandwidth consumption. Furthermore, the minimum bandwidth schedule algorithm is proposed. Its major objective is reducing network bandwidth consumption and at the same time balancing the load balancing between nodes. The experiment results show that this proposed algorithm outperforms the classical scheduling algorithms both in reducing total bandwidth consumption and service response time, which is used to reflect the quality of service and load balance effect.

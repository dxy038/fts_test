Background and Aim: The auditory steady state response is a modern test for estimating hearing thresholds, especially in difficult to test individuals. However, there are few bone conduction auditory steady state response data, particularly for individuals with hearing loss. The objective of this study was to investigate bone conduction auditory steady state response thresholds in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss and normal hearing.
Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 10 individuals with normal hearing and 10 with sensorineural hearing loss at the age of 15-30 years were selected by non-probability sampling. Auditory steady state response and pure tone audiometry to bone conduction stimuli in 500 and 2000 Hz were recorded in two groups. Paired and independent t-test were used to compare data between the groups.
Results: There was low correlation between bone conduction auditory steady state response and pure tone audiometry in both groups (p > 0.05 for both). The difference of behavioral thresholds and auditory steady state response in 500 Hz was higher than 2000 Hz in both groups (p=0.033 for normal hearing and p=0.017 for sensorineural hearing loss groups). Comparison of these results showed significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: In both groups, there was low correlation between bone conduction auditory steady state response and pure tone audiometry thresholds. In individuals with sensorineural hearing loss and in higher frequencies, bone conduction auditory steady state response thresholds was closer to pure tone audiometery thresholds.

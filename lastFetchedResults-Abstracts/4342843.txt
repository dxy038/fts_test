For the optimal size and placement of the dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) in a distribution network, in this paper the Simulated Annealing (SA) method is proposed. The multi-objective problem is converted to a single function using the goal attainment method. The obtained results show the voltage sag improvement on sensitive load nodes and other nodes in distribution system with minimum cost.

This study proposes a security-oriented cooperation (SOC) scheme, which first determines one of the three possible cooperation scenarios, namely the jammer only, relay only and the relay-jammer pair, according to the security requirement and networkÂ´s operational conditions. After determining a cooperation scenario, then, the selection of a relay or/and a jammer as well as their transmit power are jointly optimised with the objective to attain a good trade-off between security performance and energy consumption. The performance of the networks employing the proposed SOC is investigated here over finite-state Markov channels. The studies and results explain that the proposed SOC scheme constitutes one of the promising SOC schemes. It belongs to a generalised cooperative security scheme, which adapts according to the specific security requirement and communication environments.

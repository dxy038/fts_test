After the demise of the method, the dominant and agreed-upon teacher education model and framework has been reflective teaching. Therefore, in this era of post-method, one targeted objective of English Language Teaching practitioners and ELT theoreticians has been training reflective teachers. On the other hand textbooks and materials have always been one inseparable components of the classroom. The purpose of this study was to uncover the perceptions and perspectives of two groups of teachers regarding the characteristics of good ELT materials. The teachers were divided into two groups of high reflective teachers and low reflective teachers after administering Akbari, Behzadpoor, and Dadvand’s (2010) Reflective Teacher Instrument. After identifying high reflective and low reflective teachers, the teachers’ perceptions were elicited through an open-ended questionnaire survey. The sample for the survey consisted of 53 EFL teachers in Iran. The qualitative data of the open-ended questions were analyzed via content analysis to uncover the similarities and differences between two groups of teachers as far as characteristics of good ELT materials are concerned. Results indicated that there were significant differences in perceptions of low reflective teachers with those of high reflective teachers; especially the ideas and views of those teachers whose scores were very high on the Reflective Teacher Instrument were drastically different from the others. The content analysis results of the responses given by high reflective teachers were to the high extent compatible with the components of reflection as mentioned in the literature.

This paper is a contribution to the debate on how to make health-care services
in the United Kingdom more responsive to the needs of older people who are
members of recent immigrant groups. The focus is on the Chinese-origin elders,
and the objective is to demonstrate their diverse migrant histories, cultural backgrounds
and attitudes to both ‘ traditional ’ and Western health-care practices.
The underlying argument is that if National Health Service staff had a better
understanding of the diversity of Chinese older people, this would make an important
contribution to making the service more sensitive to their needs. To
develop this argument, this paper carries out three main analytical tasks. The first
is to discuss the range of strategies adopted by Chinese people in general and
Chinese older people in particular to improve their health. The second is to study
Chinese people’s heritage of exploring different methods to organise health in
response to foreign culture. The third considers the ways in which the sensitivity
of British health-care services to the needs of ethnic-minority groups can be improved,
with a focus on the culturagram instrument and procedure. Three contrasting
examples are presented.

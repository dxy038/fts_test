The application of multivariable adaptive control techniques to flight control reconfiguration is considered. The paper first discusses three adaptation mechanisms for model reference control. It is shown that simple algorithms can be obtained if full state feedback is assumed. The respective advantages and disadvantages of the three algorithms are discussed in general terms, considering their complexity and the assumptions that they require. Next, the application of the adaptive algorithms to reconfigurable flight control is investigated. The objective is to design automatically a flight control law in the presence of actuator failures or surface damage. Design considerations for the adaptive algorithms are discussed in this context. Simulations obtained using a full nonlinear simulation of a twin-engine jet aircraft are included to illustrate the results

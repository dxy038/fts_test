The Frequency Assignment Problem is
assignment of frequencies or channels to establish link
between base station and mobile transmitter in cellular
system. To avoid interference, minimum separation between
assigned frequencies is required. This problem is NP-hard.
Due to limited availability of spectrum and reuse of same
frequencies at different geographical locations, an excellent
assignment is to be done, which must satisfy electromagnetic
constraints with respect to demand in each cell. This paper
presents new strategies for frequency assignment in cellular
radio networks. The objective is to assign the frequency
satisfying electromagnetic constraints for given demand with
minimum use of frequency bandwidth. The proposed
strategies are implemented on benchmark test problems. In
frequency assignment, call ordering is done with help of
computational intelligent techniques and assignment part is
done with FEA strategy. To speed up the assignment process
to find good assignments, we proposed modified strategies.
The performance of the proposed strategies compared with
Frequency Exhaustive Assignment (FEA). The results
obtained are very optimistic and encouraging

The major objective of this study was to investigate
heavy metal content of black pomfret (Parastromateus
niger). The concentrations of Zn, Cu, As and
Cd were determined in external (gill and shell) and
internal organs (muscle and liver) of black pomfret
in northwest of Persian Gulf in summer 2013.
A total of 60 specimens were collected from fishing
bottom trawlers. Concentrations of these heavy
metals were measured by using atomic absorption
spectrometer. Results showed that heavy metals
concentrations varied significantly, depending on
the types of the tissue in fish. Bioaccumulation of
heavy metals Zn and Cu were in the sequence liver > 
shell >  gill >  muscle but for Cd and As were in
the sequence of gill >  shell >  liver >  muscle. In total
organs and among heavy metals the accumulation
of Zn and As were the highest and the lowest (P < 
0.05). The results indicated that the gill of fishes
were highly contaminated by heavy metals and exceeded
of WHO and NHMRC guidelines for As and
Cd, respectively.

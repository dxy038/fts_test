BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Due to a very specific and unique characteristics of beeswax, it is important and suitable to use in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries as a coating and slower agent in dissolution of pharmaceutical compounds. Regarding to the important role of beeswax, it has been decided to evaluate the preparation of the pharmaceutical beeswax in laboratory.
METHODS: The raw beeswax was provided from the waxes prepared by Appis Mellifera in two different seasons (fall and spring). Wax was melted by several methods using hot water, ether and ethanol 90%, in a controlled temperature. The same procedure was performed to prepare the white wax in presence of a bleaching agent. The wax sheets were analyzed and standardized under British pharmacoepoiea (BP) protocols.
FINDINGS: Beeswax extraction with different solvents showed that using ether for preparing spring and fall yellow wax, some indices were out of standard limits but regarding to white wax that was prepared by hot water we could get a significant difference. Using ethanol as a solvent for extraction is not suitable and decreases the indices significantly.
CONCLUSION: The spring white and yellow wax which were prepared by hot water method in a temperature lower than 85Â° C is recommended as a suitable and economical method with the same results comparing with BP standard beeswax.

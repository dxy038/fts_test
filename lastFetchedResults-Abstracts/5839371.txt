In this paper we proposed a multi-objective optimization model for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed model optimized several objectives, simultaneously. Indeed, by starting from a generic configuration we found new location for sensors, that the network have appropriate performance in terms of energy consumption and travelled distance. For the monotony of energy consumption and life time of sensors, the rate of energy consumption in each stage have been associated the previous stage. Through a series of calculations the behavior of the proposed model has been compared with other one-objective models.

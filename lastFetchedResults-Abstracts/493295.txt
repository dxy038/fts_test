Background: Some of plants have antifungal properties because of special compounds in their contents,
Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate the antifungal activities of five plant species collected from Kermanshah including Anthemis altissima, Eucaliptus sp. Euphorbia heteradenia, Asparagus officinalis and Carthamus oxyacantha against Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum, Phytophthora drechsleri and Bipolaris sorkiniana.
Methods: The fungitoxicity of crude extracts of the different parts of Anthemis altissima, Eucaliptus sp., Euphorbia heteradenia, Asparagus officinalis and Carthamus oxyacantha on the Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum, Phytophthora dershleri and Bipolaris sorkiniana was verifed in vitro by means of paper disc method, Crude extracts were obtained using water, methanol and ethanol, Each paper disc was impregnated by 5mg of each extract. 
Results: Methanolic extracts of Carthamus oxyacantha in seeding stage and leaves of Eucaliptus sp, showed the highest inhibitory property against the mycelial growth of B, Sorkiniana, Aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Carthamus oxyacantha and aqueous extract of Anthemis altissima significantly inhibited the growth of P, dershleri, Methanolic extract of Eucalyptus sp, and Carthamus oxyacantha supperesed the mycelial growth of F, oxysporum, Ethanolic extract of Carthamus oxyacantha showed highest inhibitory activity against R, Solani.
Conclusion: Results indicated that extracts of Carthamus oxyacantha, Anthemis sp., Eucaliptus sp., Euphorbia sp. and Asparagus sp. have broad ranges of antifungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi, surprisingly; all of extracts of Carthamus oxyacantha did not show any inhibition against all tested fungi.

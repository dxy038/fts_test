This paper proposes a new static simultaneous optimization of dispatching and conflict-free routing for unidirectional Overhead Hoist Transport (OHT) systems. Our objective is to minimize the entire transportation time where the given transportation tasks are finished. A hybrid system modeling is applied for OHT system that is constituted by the OHT vehicles at the lower level and governed by the upper level scheduler. In the proposed modeling, it is clarified that the simultaneous optimization problems are recast as a binary integer linear problem by using model predictive control. This paper presents a numerical example and discusses limitation of proposed modeling.

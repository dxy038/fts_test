During decades, in semiarid rainfed Aragon, intensive soil tillage and low crop residue input have led to the loss of soil structure
and soil degradation. Conservation tillage and cropping intensification can improve soil structure in these areas. The objective of
this study was to determine the influence of three different tillage systems (traditional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage) under
two cropping systems (fallow-barley rotation and barley monoculture) on soil aggregation dynamics during a cropping season. A
decrease in tillage intensity resulted in a higher mean size of dry aggregates and a greater water aggregate stability in both cropping
systems particularly under no-tillage.

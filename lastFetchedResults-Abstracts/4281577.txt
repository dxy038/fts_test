Presents fuzzy modeling as a multi-objective decision making problem considering accuracy, interpretability and autonomy as goals. The proposed approach assumes that these goals can be handled via corresponding single-objective &#949;-constrained decision making problems whose solution is produced by a hierarchical evolutionary process. The fitting, generalization, and interpretation characteristics of the resulting fuzzy models are discussed using a classification problem

The paper proposes a symbolic framework to address the binding problem for embedded VLIW ASIPs. Alternative objective functions as well as trade-offs relevant to the binding phase of code generation for embedded processors are presented and discussed. Experimental results obtained for a number of benchmarks extracted from the literature empirically demonstrate the promise of our approach

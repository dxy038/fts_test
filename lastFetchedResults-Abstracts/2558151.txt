Background: Several instruments have so far been developed in English language to measure
the level of work-family conflict and further validation is required for non-English speakers.
Objective: To test factorial structure and construct validity of the Persian version of workfamily
conflict scale among Iranian nurse.
Methods: This study was conducted among 456 Iranian nurses working at public hospitals
in 17 provinces from March 2015 to September 2015. We used a self-administrated questionnaire
to collect information. Exploratory factor analysis was run using SPSS 21. Then, construct
validity was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), convergent validity,
and discriminant validity by AMOS 21.
Results: Exploratory factor analysis extracted four dimensions that explained 65.5% of the
variance observed. The results of confirmatory factor analysis showed that our data fitted the
hypothesized four dimensional model of work-family conflict construct. The average variance
extracted was used to establish convergent and discriminant validity.
Conclusion: The Persian version of work-family conflict questionnaire is a valid and reliableinstrument among Iranian nurses.

Objective To assess the cost-effectiveness of an occupational
therapy-led lifestyle approach to treating panic disorder
in primary care compared with routine general
practitioner’s (GP) care. The burden of mental health disorders
is considerable. Cost-effective interventions are
necessary to alleviate some of these burdens. Habitual
lifestyle behaviours influence mood, although to date
mainly single lifestyle factor trials have been conducted to
examine the effects on anxiety.
Methods An economic evaluation was conducted alongside
an unblinded pragmatic randomised controlled trial
with assessment at 5 and 10 months. Costs and consequences,
as measured by the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI)
and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), were compared
using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
Results The occupational therapy-led lifestyle intervention
was more costly than routine GP care at both 5 and
10 months. Significant outcome improvements were
evident at 5 months when using the BAI, although these
were not maintained at 10 months. Small differences in
mean QALYs were found. The estimated ICER was £36
per BAI improvement for 5 months and £39 for 10 months,
and £18,905 per QALY gained for 5 months and £8,283 for
10 months.
Conclusions If the maximum willingness to pay per
additional QALY is £30,000, then there is an 86% chance
that a lifestyle intervention may be considered to be valuefor-
money over 10 months.

In order to achieve high data rates communication system under the limitation of spectrum resources, the improvement of spectrum efficiency is needed. In recent years, for the aim to achieve such objective, many proposals are putted forward such as: MIMO (Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs), OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and high-order QAM modulation system. These systems must involve large multi-user multi-carrier signal detection problems, and for the future wireless communication systems, this is a very important issue. This paper introduces a new, OVTFDM (Overlapped Time-Frequency Division Multiplex system) system. In this new system, the elimination mechanism for inter-symbol interference is unnecessary and only need to detect the Symbol sequence code to distinguish the different original signal. Based on a Gabor transform method, a rapid detection algorithm and decoding program is presented.

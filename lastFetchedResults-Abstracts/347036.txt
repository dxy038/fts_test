Objective: It is well known that electroencephalograms (EEGs) show electrical silence in deep anesthesia as well as brain death. This is the first report on intracranial EEG changes in deep anesthesia.
Methods: We developed a new direct brain monitoring system capable of recording intracranial EEGs. This study included 13 patients with head trauma or cerebrovascular accident under deep anesthesia.
Results: The intracranial EEGs showed different patterns of wave activity in depth compared with the cortical surface. In 3 of the cases, the scalp EEG showed a flat tracing at 2.0–2.5% of isoflurane. In two of the cases, the intracranial EEGs showed electrical silence when the scalp EEG was flat. Decreasing the concentration of isoflurane to 1.5%, the intracranial EEG showed single paroxysmal appearance of ‘revival’ theta waves on the electrocorticogram (ECoG) or electroventriculogram (EVG). The intracranial ‘revival’ wave was followed by high-voltage burst-waves. In another case, at 2.0–2.5% of isoflurane, the amplitude of the waves was greatest on the EVG.
Conclusion: There is wave activity difference in the brain depth, which the scalp EEG is unable to show. Intracranial EEGs are able to show the first signs of revival after a nearly flat tracing in deep anesthesia.

Objective: The aim of our study was to examine the effect of suction drains on knee after arthro-scopic partial meniscectomy with partial fat pad removal or synovectomy. Methods: We performed arthroscopic partial meniscectomy for posterior tears of the medial meniscus and partial fat pad or synovium shaving in 72 patients. Following surgery, a suction drain was not used in 40 patients (Group A) and used in 32 (Group B). Both groups were simiÂ¬lar in terms of age, gender, and total operation time. The patients were evaluated at 1, 2, and 4 weeks postoperatively for the presence of a knee effusion. Results: No significant difference was observed in the grade of effusion and the average percent change in the effusion grade between Groups A and B at 1, 2, and 4 weeks postoperatively. Conclusion: Use of a suction drain did not influence the postoperative effusion or the clinical course of the effusion after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy with partial fat pad removal or synovectomy.

With the construction boom, the quality of construction arouses more concern from people. In this paper, we first propose that the important way to ensure and improve the quality of the project is the effective quality control and management. Then, as the basic principle of quality control, the principle of "quality first, customers first" is presented. In addition, another important principle is put forward, namely, taking people as the driving force of quality control, active control as the main part, the quality of construction is controlled comprehensively in the whole process, with the participation of all related people, taking the quality of materials into consideration. Furthermore, we propose quality control measures, in which objective management is implemented so as to perfect the quality-managing system, and human-oriented enterprises\´ quality culture is established through relying on technological progress and practicing total quality management. At the same time, we suggest that the sound and effective quality management mode is an important guarantee of quality control. And in the process of construction, quality control and management play an important role. Carrying out quality control and management can fully reflect the purpose of project quality management, which can overcome the blindness and randomness in the work of quality and avoid the passiveness, thus enhancing the a- tivity, directedness and orderliness in quality control. Quality control plays a positive role in ensuring the construction process, reducing the project costs and smoothly achieving the overall goal of project quality, which can continuously improve the project quality and further promote the overall economic benefits of enterprises.

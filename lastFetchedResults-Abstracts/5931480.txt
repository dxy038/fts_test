The objective of the present paper is to investigate the characteristics of the oscillator with the semi-spherical OR, on the plane mirror of which it is installed the four-element rectangular MSA, under each oscillating element of which the semiconductor oscillator is installed. 8-mm wave band Gunn diodes have been used as active sources.

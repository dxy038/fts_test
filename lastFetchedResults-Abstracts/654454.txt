The overall objective of this work was to measure the spatial variation of sulphur isotopic composition of lichens across the island of Newfoundland in order to assess the degree to which the atmosphere is being affected by long-range transport of anthropogenic sulphur from eastern North America, and/or local pollution sources. A contour map (based on over 80 composite samples of the lichen Alectoria sarmentosa) illustrates the spatial distribution of sulphur isotopic composition of the Newfoundland atmosphere. It shows a gradient of Î´34S of sulphur in lichen, decreasing from the coast to the interior of the island. It also shows local anomalies corresponding to the city of St. John's, the Come-By-Chance Oil Refinery, mining areas and fossil-fuel powered pulp and paper mills in central and western Newfoundland. The study strongly suggests that the isotopic composition of sulphur in the Newfoundland atmosphere is influenced more by the ocean (sea salt sulphate) and local anthropogenic activities in the province, than by long-range transport of continental North American sulphate.

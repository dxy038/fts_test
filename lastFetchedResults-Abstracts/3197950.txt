The paper presents a method and a collection of techniques for conducting virtual excavations in online social networking services. YouTube and its Data API are used as a case study of a virtual settlement. The objective is to assess not only what is retained by YouTube but also what sense can be made of a designated set of YouTube online remains. The research focuses on defining, capturing and transforming digital trace data into interactive visualizations that unlock crucial dynamics of online activity.

Introduction of E911 location technology opens a new horizon for network engineering and operation. It provides a vehicle for the engineer to reach places that could not be reached before and opens a whole suite of options for network engineering and operation optimization. The objective of this proposal is to specify an architecture and algorithm that can be used for better performance and resource management. It uses location technology to optimize cellular network operation and engineering. The virtual reality for the network can be reproduced and the associated optimized solution can be identified by engineering recorded snapshots of the network into a data warehouse. Those real life data can be used as inputs to a simulator to identify optimized engineering guidelines. Network performance can be analyzed on a per mobile, per site and per system basis. This is an intelligent and auto feedback based architecture

This paper presents a video communication system that provides real-time participating services to audiences using Internet Protocol television (IPTV) and mobile devices on cloud computing environments. High-quality video processing and bidirectional multimedia communication technologies are combined for videoconferencing and interactive user participation. The P-module has been developed to encode and decode 1080i high-definition video data on a system simultaneously. A video communication protocol is applied to exchanging information between distributed and heterogeneous devices. The developed system has been deployed in a public service center in Seoul, Korea. In the experiments, we will show the implemented system using IPTV and a mobile phone, as well as the experiment results of the measured CPU overhead and mixing time in our system.

This paper investigates the resource allocation problem in the downlink of OFDMA cooperative relaying networks with one source (base station) and multiple relay and destination nodes. Assuming that the base station knows all the instantaneous channel gains of all links, we propose a dynamic joint subchannel and power allocation (SPA) scheme whose objective is to maximize the worst userÂ´s data rate with the constraint of total transmission power. Since the optimal solution to this combinatorial problem is extremely computationally complex, we propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm that allocates subchannel and power separately. In the proposed algorithm, subchannels are firstly paired by relay nodes according to their equivalent channel gains and then assigned to a specific user. Subsequently, an optimal power distribution algorithm is designed for the proposed subchannel allocation (SA) scheme. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm approaches asymptotically to that of the optimal one, and maximal fairness is guaranteed for all users.

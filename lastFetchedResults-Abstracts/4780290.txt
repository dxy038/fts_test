The main objective of this paper is to design and compare two altitude command tracker controllers for an UAV using H&#8734; and QFT techniques. Both methods require the use of specialized software tools. The different stages of QFT methodology have been done with help of software tool QFTIT (Quantitative Feedback Theory Interactive Tool). This is a free software tool that is characterized by its easy of use and interactive nature. QFTÂ´s standing as a viable control design method that can be applied to practical problems and produce implementable results. Tests with realistically large control inputs are use to validate and compare both designs.

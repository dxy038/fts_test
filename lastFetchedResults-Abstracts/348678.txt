Objective
To investigate whether exposure to pulsed high-frequency electromagnetic field (pulsed EMF) emitted by a mobile phone has short-term effects on the visuo-motor choice reaction time (RT) and movement time (MT).
Methods
A double blind, counterbalanced crossover design was employed. In 16 normal subjects, we studied the performance of a visuo-motor precued choice reaction time task (PCRT) before and after exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone for 30 minutes or sham exposure.
Results
The RTs and MTs under different conditions of precue information were not affected by exposure to pulsed EMF emitted by a mobile phone or by sham phone use.
Conclusions
Thirty minutes of mobile phone use has no significant short-term effect on the cortical visuo-motor processing as studied by the present PCRT task.
Significance
This is the first study to investigate visuo-motor behavior in relation to mobile phone exposure. No significant effect of mobile phone use was demonstrated on the performance of the visuo-motor reaction time task.

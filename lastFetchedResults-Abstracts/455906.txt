Objective: CX3CR1 is a novel chemokine receptor located on monocytes. Recently, two polymorphisms were linked to coronary artery disease (CAD), V249I and T280M. Carriers of at least one I-allele or one M-allele were found less frequently among patients with CAD compared to controls. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of these polymorphisms on the development of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Methods: 522 human subjects with documented PAD and 522 age and sex matched controls were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction digestion. Results: Adjusted odds ratio (OR) of carriers of the I-allele for PAD was 1.34 (95% confidential interval (CI) from 0.86 to 2.09; P=0.19). The OR associated with the M-allele for PAD was 0.65 (95% CI from 0.41 to 1.04; P=0.07), when tested in the same regression analysis with the V249I genotypes. The genotypes were not linked to age at onset or severity of the disease. A subgroup of 137 CAD patients of whom 131 could be genotyped and who did not differ in baseline parameters from the remaining PAD patients, showed VV-genotype in 52.0%, VI in 42.7% and II in 5.3% CAD (OR associated with the I-allele for CAD: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.66–2.51; P=0.46). The distribution of the T280M genotypes was 67.1, 29.8, 3.1% (TT, TM, MM) also showing no association with CAD (OR=0.77; 95% CI 0.36–1.46; P=0.37). Conclusion: In this study we could not detect a difference in genotype frequencies of the V249I and T280M polymorphisms in CX3CR1 between PAD patients and controls. CAD concomitant with PAD was also not affected by the I- or the M-allele.

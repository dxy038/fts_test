In this paper focused on the design of a single phase 27-level Hybrid Multi-level inverter by using twelve switches and three separate DC sources from the solar panel. To get the maximum power from the panel Perturb and Observer algorithm can be used in the Maximum Power Point Tracking. The main objective of this paper is to increases the number of levels with a lower number of switches at the output without adding any complexity to the power circuit. The main advantages of the proposed method are to reduce the lower Total Harmonic Distortion, lower electromagnetic interference and high output voltage. To minimize the total harmonic distortion Multi-carrier pulse width modulation techniques can be proposed and it can enhance the output voltages from proposed work. Hence the single phase 27-level Hybrid Multi-level inverter having better performance compared with the conventional method. The proposed method can be simulated by using MATLAB/Simulink.

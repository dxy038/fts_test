The objective of Co-alloy perpendicular media (PM) development is to achieve thermally stable media with enhanced SNR. This in turn requires advanced microstructural features and magnetic properties, such as excellent (00.2) orientation, narrow grain size distribution and small grain size, low fcc phase content and stacking faults (SFs), good chemical segregation at grain boundaries, high anisotropy (K/sub u/), high coercivity (H/sub c/), high negative nucleation field (H/sub n/), full squareness (S=M/sub T//M/sub S/) and optimized inter-granular exchange interaction. In this paper we discuss these important issues in the development of Co-alloy perpendicular media.

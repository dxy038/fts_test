The different techniques for generation of sequences of assembly for multi robotic assembly cell problems are proposed in this research work. The objective of the research work is to develop the sequence for the robotic assembly by using Connectivity Graph and Liaison Method using LINGO. A computer-based, generic, scalable and integrated optimization method for generation of assembly sequence is developed and tested for the benefit of the professionals. Finally, the results proposed using the two methods are compared and the global optimum solution is proposed with a view to achieving concurrency for the robotic assembly activities and making the system more economical.

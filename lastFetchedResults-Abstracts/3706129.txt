Accurate time transfer method using bidirectional wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) signal transmission along a single optical fibre is proposed. The feasibility of subnanosecond time transfer is confirmed by transmitting 1.31 and 1.55 &#956;m signals along a 50 km length of 1.55 &#956;m dispersion shifted fibre

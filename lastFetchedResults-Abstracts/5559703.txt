Objective comparisons of different FM-reception systems with FM-antenna diversity systems are important for optimization and development. An advanced analyzing and evaluation system for FM-antenna diversity systems is introduced. With the possibility to record real FM-signals and the preprocessing of FM-signals, which takes into account the influence of the reception scenario and the diversity antennas, objective and reproducible comparisons of different reception systems with antenna diversity can be performed for typical reception scenarios in a reproducible way in the laboratory. A new compound method for audio-analysis allows objective comparisons of different antenna diversity systems taking into account audio processing in car radios. Thereby, we are now able to compare and test whole systems consisting of car FM-antennas, FM-diversity-systems and car radios.

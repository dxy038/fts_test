Sequential decision models are an important element of expert system optimization when the cost or time to collect inputs is significant and inputs are not known until the system operates. Many expert systems in business, engineering, and medicine have benefited from sequential decision technology. In this survey, we unify the disparate literature on sequential decision models to improve comprehensibility and accessibility. We separate formulation of sequential decision models from solution techniques. For model formulation, we classify sequential decision models by objective (cost minimization versus value maximization) knowledge source (rules, data, belief network, etc.), and optimized form (decision tree, path, input order). A wide variety of sequential decision models are discussed in this taxonomy. For solution techniques, we demonstrate how search methods and heuristics are influenced by economic objective, knowledge source, and optimized form. We discuss open research problems to stimulate additional research and development

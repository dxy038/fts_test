The main objective of this research is evaluation of quality of services in container terminal of Iran by use of SURVQUAL model and as well as prioritization of this container terminal MAPPC method according to the gap in 5 dimension of SURVQUAL model. In first stage quality of services in container terminal of Iran evaluated by use of SURVQUAL model. Obtained result from this stage revealed that there exist gaps in all dimensions in the centers meaning that they couldn’t have meet the expectations of the container terminals’ customers. In the second stage according to the container terminals’ customers’ opinions, by using AHP model the quintuple dimensions of quality of services are prioritized from the most to the least as reliability(0.260), responsiveness (0.220), physical (0.211), assurance(0.170), sympathy (0.139). Then all four container terminals prioritized according to the gap in 5 dimension of service quality by MAPPC method. Considering the final achieved results, third container terminals gained the first Rank, first container terminals the second Rank, second container terminals the third Rank and forth container terminals the fourth rank.

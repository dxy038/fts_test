Introduction: Health care unit cost is as base for budgeting of function, determining
real tariff, and privatization in health sector. Nevertheless, in our country, there is no
specific approach for it. This study usedActi vity Based Costing (ABC) to calculate unit
cost ofhealth care services delivered in pilot health care center.
Methods: The present study is a research-practical study and carried out in cross
sectional style. The data collection tool was a bound of specific designed forms and
tables. Data gathered from 2006 fiscal year and then entered to EXCEL software and
finally analyzed by ABC system in 8 steps.
Results: There are 120 unit cost quantities in 15 separated tables for any final
functional department in health care center. Results showed that lodometeric ofsalt has
the lowest unit cost (3506Rials) and treatment of Tuberculosis has highest unit cost
(1092325 Rials).
Conclusions: given to high portion of personnel costs, improvement of staff
productivity, merging same department and merging same activity in different health
care process have an important role for decreasing total expenditure .Regarding the
result of the research, Implementation of ABC system is an effective approach to
calculate unit cost in health sector. Because this system is process-oriented, result is
more precise than other costing system. Nevertheless current information system in
health care centers doesn't meet unit cost analysis, and should be restructured.

Background:
Objective: To evaluate the effects of sperm morphology on the success rate of IUI.
Methods: This was a prospective study of 200 couples who underwent IUI in order to im-prove the likelihood of conception. The patients were divided into 2 groups, one consisting of 100 patients with a normal sperm morphology of ?20%, and the other consisting of 100 patients with a normal semen morphology of  > 20%, and an otherwise normal semen analy-sis.
Results: A total of 59 clinical pregnancies were obtained for a pregnancy rate / cycle of 10.5%. No significant differences were found between the two groups examined.
Conclusion: There are no substantial differences in the success of intrauterine insemination when normal sperm morphology in semen analysis is more than 20% compared to when it is less than 20%.

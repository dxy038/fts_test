Ancillary services associated to a power system are those services that support the Transmission System Operator to ensure the requirements concerning the safe, security and reliability of the power system. Real-time behaviour of these services can be assessed using the adequacy indices of generation system. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the evolution in time of hourly values of tertiary reserve margin and hourly values of adequacy indices associated to a hybrid system that contain a conventional unit and a photovoltaic system. The hybrid system is involved in a study in order to supply differed load profiles, characterised by the same amount of demanded energy.

The 40% of wall thickness criterion which
has been used as a plugging rule is applicable only to
a single cracked steam generator tubes. In the previous
studies performed by authors, several failure predictionmodels
were introduced to estimate the plastic collapse
pressures of steam generator tubes containing two
adjacent collinear or parallel axial through-wall cracks.
The objective of this study is to examine the failure
prediction models and propose optimum ones for two
non-aligned axial through-wall cracks in steam generator
tubes. In order to determine the optimum ones, a
series of plastic collapse tests and finite element analyses
were carried out for steam generator tubes with
two machined non-aligned axial through-wall cracks.
Thereby, either the plastic zone contact model or COD
based model was selected as the optimum one according
to axial distance between two cracks. Finally, the
optimum failure prediction model was used to demonstrate
the conservatism of flaw characterization rules
for multiple cracks having equal lengths according to
ASME code.

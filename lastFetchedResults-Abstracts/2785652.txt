Systems in which resources are shared can be operated either with reservation schedulers or as queueing systems. While reservation systems are the only option to support future start-time requests, both types of systems can be used when users want resources at the earliest available opportunity. The objective of this work is to determine the conditions under which a reservation scheduler is required versus when a queueing system is sufficient. The problem was motivated by a communication network service. A new scheduled dynamic circuit service that uses a reservation scheduler is being offered. It differs from plain old telephony service (POTS), which is operated as a queueing system. Three models of reservation systems are analyzed: (i) finite-window reservation system model, (ii) infinite-window reservation system model, and (iii) synchronized-server model. Our main finding is that if the number of servers is small, a reservation scheduler is required in both blocking-mode and waiting-mode systems. In blocking-mode systems, users should specify multiple start-time options in reservation requests to lower blocking rate while simultaneously operating the system at high utilization. In waiting-mode systems with small numbers of servers, since high-utilization system operation will cause large waiting times, a reservation system is preferred as it will allow customers to carry out other activities between their times of request and allocated start times rather than wait in a queue.

This paper proposes the stochastic cost model solution technique for optimal operation of the generators in a wind-thermal scheduling considering the demand and wind power generation uncertainties. Wind-thermal scheduling problem is to determine time of instant to start up and shut down units. The main objective of this paper is to minimize the fuel cost and maximizes the profit of wind-thermal generation scheduling. The cost curve of the wind-thermal generating units is linearized in a piecewise manner, so that a mixed integer programming can be used to solve the optimization problem. In this mixed integer programming methods provides the enhanced modeling capabilities and adaptability. The mathematical modeling of this paper is to find an optimal solution which takes into account all possible realizations of the underlying uncertain wind power factor. The performance of the proposed mixed integer programming method has been tested with IEEE-36 unit thermal system in addition with one unit of 50MW wind-power system.

Using quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) flow imaging techniques for performing in vivo flow, measurement has already established its value in medical practice. Due to time limitations, however, compromises have to be made in studies of 3-dimensional pulsatile flow. Velocity distributions are usually acquired only in selected imaging planes. Although recent development of rapid MR 3D cine flow imaging techniques has greatly improved the comprehensiveness of flow data acquired, it is achieved at the cost of some reduction of signal to noise ratio and spatial resolution. The objective of this study is to use the technique of convex projections to reconstruct 3D velocity fields from incomplete or noisy data sets. The theory and numerical implementation of these projectors are presented

Cellular Manufacturing is gaining more acceptance in the industry. The performance of a cellular manufacturing system can be further improved by addressing planning issues as well. The objective of this paper is to minimize the number of tardy jobs in a multi-period environment. Different approaches are discussed and mathematical formulations are presented along with the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Later, the results of each approach are illustrated with a simple example problem. Finally, possible extensions to the models are discussed.Cellular Manufacturing is gaining more acceptance in the industry.

A T-S fuzzy iterative identification method via Objective-Satisfactory Cluster Analysis is proposed in this paper. During the iteration, an Objective-Satisfactory Cluster Analysis algorithm, which combined the Enhanced Objective Cluster Analysis algorithm and the Gustafson-Kessel method is presented. Thus the accuracy and the robustness of the premise of T-S model are guaranteed. Then the consequent parameters are quickly estimated by the Stable Kalman Filter algorithm. The effectiveness of the presented method is proved by the pH-neutralization process.

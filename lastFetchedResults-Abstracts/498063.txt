Background and objective: Survey of mutation analysis in codon 83, 87 for gyrA gene in to nalidixic acid drug resistance E.coli isolated from urine sample.

Material and methods: In this study, 79 positive samples of E.coli (sensitive or insensitive) which isolated from patients who referred to Baqiyatalah hospital were studied. During of four stages of polymerase chain reaction, survey of mutation analysis in gyrA gene specially in codon 83, 87 that cause resistance to nalidixic acid in clinical samples were carried out. For mutation detection several PCR products were sequenced.

Results: Sequencing results showed that in sensitive sample, mutation did not occurred. But in resistant samples, five mutations in codon 85, 81, 107, 97, 87 were observed. One of the mutations (87) was major mutation in resistance to Nalidixic acid.

Conclusion: Depending on results of this study, even present of one mutation in codon 87 or 83 caused resistance of E.coli to nalidixic acid.

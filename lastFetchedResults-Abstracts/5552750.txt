The principal objective of a hydrographic survey is to determine safe navigable depths. Standards for depth sounding and horizontal positioning are an essential consideration. Standards enable parties working in complementary functions-survey system planning and design, system selection and evaluation, survey planning, surveying, and cartography-to communicate effectively on matters of survey quality. Presently published standards for depth sounding and horizontal positioning are not stated in terms of statistical parameters with a consequent lack of realism and contain terminology that can easily lead to ambiguous interpretation. Improved standards which are to be incorporated into the National Ocean ServiceÂ´s Hydrographic Manual are proposed for adoption by the hydrographic community.

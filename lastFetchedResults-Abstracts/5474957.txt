In recent years, the concern with image authentication and ownership issues is growing in the remote sensing community. Watermarking techniques help to solve the problems raised by this issue. In this paper we elaborate on the proposition of an optimal placement of the watermark image in a hyperspectral image. The problem is posed as a multi-objective optimization problem. Two objective functions are formulated, one modeling the robustness of the watermark recovery and other modeling the distortion introduced in the watermarked image. The application of an evolutionary algorithm (MOGA) to the optimal watermarking hyperspectral images is presented.

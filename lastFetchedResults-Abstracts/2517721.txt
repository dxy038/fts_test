<p><strong>Background</strong>: Leishmaniasis is an important public health disease in many developing countries as well in Iran. The main objective of this study was to investigate on <em>leishmania</em> infection of wild caught sand flies in an endemic focus of disease in Esfarayen district, north east of Iran.<strong><br />Methods</strong>: Sand flies were collected by sticky papers and mounted in a drop of Puriâ€™s medium for species identification. Polymerase chain reaction techniques of kDNA, ITS1-rDNA, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism were used for identification of DNA of <em>Leishmania </em>parasites within infected sand flies.<strong><br />Results</strong>: Among the collected female sand flies, two species of <em>Phlebotomus papatasi</em> and<em> Phlebotomus salehi</em> were found naturally infected with <em>Leishmania</em><em> </em><em>major.</em> Furthermore, mixed infection of <em>Leishmania</em><em> </em><em>turanica</em> and <em>L. major</em> was observed in one specimen of <em>P. papatasi.</em> Sequence analysis revealed two parasite ITS1 haplotypes including three <em>L. major</em> with accession numbers: KJ425408, KJ425407, KM056403 and one <em>L. turanica</em>. (KJ425406). The haplotype of <em>L. major</em> was identical (100%) to several <em>L. major</em> sequences deposited in GenBank, including isolates from Iran, (Gen Bank accession nos.AY573187, KC505421, KJ194178) and Uzbekistan (Accession no.FN677357).<strong><br />Conclusion</strong>: To our knowledge, this is the first detection of <em>L. </em><em>major</em> within wild caught <em>P. salehi </em>in north- east of Iran.</p>

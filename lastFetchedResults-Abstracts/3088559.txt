The objective of this paper is to investigate contributions of SVCs and their associated voltage control loop to the phenomenon of small-signal dynamics of power system in the high frequency range (above 5 Hz). A thyristor controlled reactor model based on tensor analysis in the S-domain is used for the small-signal dynamic studies. This approach results in an analytical model that considers harmonic interaction that occurs when a nonlinear device like SVC is connected to the network. The objective of this paper is to show that a fundamental frequency based model is adequate to analyze the interactions between multiples SVCs with satisfactory precision. Some simulation results based on PSCAD/EMTDC are shown to validate the analytical model.

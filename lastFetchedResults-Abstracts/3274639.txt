The smart grid is an electric power grid-to provide "electricity with a brain" that uses information and communications technology to gather and act on information, such as information about the behaviors of suppliers and consumers, in an automated fashion to improve the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of the production and distribution of electricity. Substation, that transforming voltage levels, collecting and distributing electric energy, is an important part of smart grid. The electromagnetic environment is complex in substation. The quantum states in quantum key distribution (QKD) or quantum teleportation coupled the external environment, the quantum coherence is destroyed, that is prone to quantum de-coherence phenomena of quantum communication. And that electromagnetic interference (EMI) influenced quantum communication signal in the intelligent substation. A quantum-bit error correction coding and decoding method is presented, to solve quantum-bit error problem of the quantum teleportation for the smart grid substation. The quantum communication system, A and B two bidirectional full-duplex, is built in intelligent substation.

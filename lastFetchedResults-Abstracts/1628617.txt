Hydrocolloids are largely used in food processing because of their functional properties, but scarce information is available about the direct impact of different hydrocolloids on the starch digestibility. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of different hydrocolloids on the digestibility of corn and potato starch and to establish the possible relationship between physicochemical and in vitro hydrolysis of starch. Hydrocolloids significantly affected the in vitro hydrolysis of starch changing the pattern of the starch fractions favoring the starch hydrolysis and increasing the rapid digestible starch fraction. The effect of hydrocolloids on the starch hydrolysis was greatly dependent on the starch origin. Guar gum was the unique hydrocolloid that combined with potato starch decreases the enzymatic hydrolysis and glycemic index of this starch. Correlations were observed between hydration, pasting and starch digestibility in corn and potato starch.

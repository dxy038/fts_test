This paper presents an improved weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm for the design of quadrature mirror filters (QMFs), First, a new term is incorporated into the objective function that effectively prevents an optimization algorithm from producing suboptimal QMFs. These suboptimal QMFs exhibit a transition band anomaly; the frequency responses of the filters have large oscillatory components in the transition band. The new term can be applied to the WLS design of any FIR filter to prevent a similar transition band anomaly. Next, we present an algorithm to obtain the QMF coefficients that minimize the objective function incorporating the new term. The computational requirement of this algorithm is also briefly discussed. Last, we include a set of practical design rules for use with our algorithm. These rules simplify the design process by providing good estimation of the design parameters, such as the minimum filter length, to meet a given set of QMF specifications

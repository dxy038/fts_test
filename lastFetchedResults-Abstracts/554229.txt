In recent years, the problem of subjugation to the rules governing international system has developed into an issue which is studied by the scholars of international law. The existing theories offer different approaches in studying the reasons of obeying international rules by internal and international actors. These approaches promote a better understanding of the actors' behavioral motivation. These theories can be divided into two sets of rationalistic and normative theories. Our main objective in this study is to apply rationalistic theory to the rule abiding behavior of actors in their internal and international relations.

In seasonal breeding species, the gene encoding for the melatonin MT1 receptor (oMT1) is highly polymorphic and numerous data have reported the existence of an association between an allele of the receptor and a marked expression of the seasonality of reproduction in ewes. This allele called “m” (previously named “−” allele) carries a mutation leading to the absence of a MnlI restriction site as opposed to the “M” allele (previously named “+” allele) carrying the MnlI restriction site (previously “+” allele). This allows the determination of the three genotypes “M/M” (+/+), “M/m” (+/−) and “m/m” (−/−). This mutation is conservative and could therefore not be causal. However, it is associated with another mutation introducing the change of a valine to an isoleucine in the fifth transmembrane domain of the receptor. Homozygous “M/M” and “m/m” animals consequently express structurally different receptors respectively named oMT1 Val220 and oMT1 Ile220. The objective of this study was to test whether these polymorphic variants are functionally different. To achieve this goal, we characterized the binding properties and the transduction pathways associated with both variants of the receptors. Using a pharmacological approach, no variation in binding parameters between the two receptors when transiently expressed in COS-7. In stably transfected HEK293 cells, significant differences were detected in the inhibition of cAMP production whereas receptors internalization processes were not different. In conclusion, the possibility that subtle alterations induced by the non conservative mutation in “m/m” animals might modify the perception of the melatoninergic signal is discussed in the context of melatonin action.

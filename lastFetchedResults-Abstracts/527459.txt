By definition, asthenopia is the pain and discomfort of the eyes which can be induced by refractive error, disturbances of accommodation and muscular.... Some other causes of asthenopia are: low illumination, very close distance between the eye and the object as well as the position of the person doing near work. The objective of this study was to evaluate potential risk factors in asthenopia.In a descriptive analytic study we evaluated 361 patients with asthenopic symptoms who referred to the ophthalmologic department to be checked by an eye specialist. Then, we evaluated 14 more important risk factors for asthenopia. After completing the information, we began to analyze the data and then compared the results. The data were statistically analyzed, using statistical soft wares, SPSS and JMP. Also, some statistical tests such as X and variance analysis were used.Among 361 patients evaluated, 657. were females and another 357. were males. The prevalence of asthenopia in the age range of 10-15 was found to be higher. 44 /. of the patients had refractive errors and 40.77. had phoria. 91.1/. of the patients did not record any special history of systemic diseases. Most of the patients were students. 50.97. of the patients worked in inappropriate environmental conditions (including the light), 27.77. in relatively appropriate and 21.4 7. in appropriate conditions. 43.47 had a sitting position while working.Some parameters such as ocular pathologies, occupation, duration of near working in a day, the distance between the eye and the object as well as the position of body had statistically remarkable relationship with asthenopic symptoms, but sex and drug did not.

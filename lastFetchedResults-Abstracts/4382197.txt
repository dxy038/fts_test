In this paper, a double-input bidirectional dc/dc converter that uses a rechargeable battery and an ultracapacitor (UC) is proposed. This converter is connected to a cell-voltage equalizer between the battery and UC. The cell-voltage equalizer enables cell-voltage equalization and energy transfer between the battery and UC. This converter has six operational modes. These modes are investigated by reduced-power-scale circuit experiment. In addition, the circuit operation under the combination of the six modes is verified using a PSIM simulator in a large power scale.

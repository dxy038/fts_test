Background: Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels may represent the ovarian follicular pool and could be a useful marker of ovarian reserve. The clinical application of AMH measurement has been proposed in the prediction of quantitative and qualitative aspects in assisted reproductive technologies.
Objective: This study aimed to assess the relationship between the serum levels of AMH and results of assisted reproductive technique (ART) outcome in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients versus control group.
Materials and Methods: This cohort study was conducted on 61 (PCOS) patients and 28 patients without PCOS (controls) candidates for assisted reproductive technique. Serum levels of AMH were measured on the 3rd day of menstrual cycle and all the patients underwent controlled ovarian hyper stimulation and ART. The relationship between AMH serum level with retrieved oocytes, mature oocytes and pregnancy rate were assessed.
Results: There was significant correlation between the AMH level with number of total retrieved oocytes and mature oocytes in patients with PCOS and controls (p=0.001). In PCOS and control groups AMH level in pregnant patients was higher, but it was not statistically significant (p=0.65, p=0.46, respectively). The major outcome of the study (pregnancy) did not differ significantly between two groups.
Conclusion: This study revealed that AMH level was higher in pregnant patients undergoing ART; but AMH may not be an accurate predictor for pregnancy in PCOS patients.

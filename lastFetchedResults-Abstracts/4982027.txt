This study mainly develops a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) generation system with an adaptive step-perturbation (ASP) method and an active sun tracking scheme. The ASP method is proposed to achieve the objective of maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and the active sun tracking scheme without any light sensors is investigated to make PV plates to face the sun directly for capturing the maximum irradiation and promoting the system efficiency. Experimental results are given to verify the validity and reliability of the ASP method and the active sun tracker for a grid-connected PV generation system

Security of information systems is a current topic. In the case of cloud environment it is even a critical factor. In large environments like the cloud computing systems, it can be difficult to maintain a comprehensive view of the safety of the individual elements. For this reason, the utilization of technology that would allow central monitoring and that would help to maintain this awareness. Such technology is precisely Security Information and Event Management (SIEM). The main objective of this paper is to analyze the possibilities and approaches of SIEM in terms of technical requirements, logic and legal framework of the Czech Republic. On the analytical basis, the framework, which is bounding the utilization of SIEM in a cloud computing environment is proposed.

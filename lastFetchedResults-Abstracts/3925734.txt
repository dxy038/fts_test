Matrix converters (MCs) are considered as a step forward in ac/ac conversion, providing sine-in and sine-out voltages and currents, controlled input power factor, compact sight without the requirement of a dc bus capacitor, and bidirectional power flows. There are also drawbacks associated with this technology: More switching devices and associated gate driver circuit power supplies and protection systems are required. In this paper, a new low-cost self-powered supply for bidirectional insulated-gate bipolar transistor/MOSFET switch gate drivers is presented. The proposed circuit allows the gate driver power supply of the bidirectional switch without using a transformer or any external added dc supply. This method is characterized by a simple structure, which is cost and size effective, of the power electronics switch driver power supply with regard to those suggested in the literature. Simulation results are compared with experimental measurements for a three-phase-to-single-phase MC and validate the proposed circuit.

In this paper, secure transmission is considered in a wireless relay network in the presence of an eavesdropper. A novel hybrid relay scheme, named as relaying-and-jamming (RJ), is advocated to achieve information theoretical security. In the RJ scheme, the relay node is equipped with multiple antennas. It responses for two missions: re-transmitting the information signal from source code and broadcasting the jamming signal to degrade eavesdropper´s channel. The objective of this paper is to maximize the achievable ergodic secrecy rate. We are interested in the scenario that eavesdropper´s instant channel state information (CSI) is unknown, in which the ergodic secrecy rate expression is derived. The optimal power allocation between information signal and jamming signal at the relay node is found statistically to achieve the largest ergodic secrecy rate. Simulation is carefully designed and respective results are presented to confirm the theoretical analysis and compare with existing work.

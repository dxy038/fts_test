Introduction of Distributed Generation (DG) into our existing networks have changed the pattern of power flow from conventional vertical power flow to bidirectional and this change great implication on the networks in terms of power loss reduction and voltage stability of the entire system. In view of this development this paper proposes use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the optimal placement and sizing of DG in Shiroro complex a sub-transmission of northern part of Nigeria for the improvement of Voltage stability index and power losses reduction. Based on simulation results obtained the presence of DG in the network has greatly improved the voltage stability index of critical buses and these buses are now capable of taken more loads.

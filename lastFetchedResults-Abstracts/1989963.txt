Redevelopment of brownfields has gained significant attention in recent years due to political, social and financial reasons. A special field of such redevelopment is, when the investor aims to reutilise the property for energy generation purposes. To make such investments feasible, extensive analysis of the conditions of the brownfield and the potential of different energy sources has to be performed. Present paper introduces a multi-objective examination and evaluation method, which provides a basis for the business analysis of an energy purpose redevelopment project. A case study is also presented to illustrate the process; the site of a gas power plant is examined, and the key findings concerning the conditions and the potential utilisation of the site are listed. The authors have prepared a recommendation to the investor, detailing the advantages and disadvantages of several different power generation technologies, and also proposing ideas for converting part of the existing infrastructure to reinterpret the operation. Technologies that might draw the interest for further examination and/or are feasible enough to perform an in-detail business analysis have been selected as well. The results of the study have confirmed that the proposed multi-objective method can be applied to arbitrary brownfield sites, while a further extension of the analysis criteria is possible if environmental aspects are also necessary to be handled.

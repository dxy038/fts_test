The SVC (static VAr compensator) is commonly installed with a conventional mechanically switched existing reactor or capacitor banks for wide range voltage control. The frequencies of switching of external banks have a great impact on the quality of voltage, but are limited since the life time of the external banks depends severely on the number of switchings. So this is a multi-objective nonlinear optimization problem with conflicting objectives. This paper presents a method to determine the optimal coordination of SVC and external banks using a genetic algorithm based on the fuzzy multi-objective optimization. Optimal dead band and delay time of external banks is sought for the reliable and efficient operation of SVCs.

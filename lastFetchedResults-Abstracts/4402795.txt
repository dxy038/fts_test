The &#8220;delay scheduling&#8221; procedure is a recent concept for the design of control system. &#8220;Delay scheduling&#8221; strategy manipulates existing delays in the feedback as a control parameter which is increasing in order to recover stability. Indeed, the system should have many stable regions in the time delays domain. To do this, a recent procedure, Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots (CTCR) is deployed, allowing the exact determination of the complete picture of stable regions in time delays space. Starting from &#8220;delay scheduling&#8221; and CTCR methods, the objective of the proposed approach is to track desired trajectories even in presence of time delay and static disturbances at the output of system.

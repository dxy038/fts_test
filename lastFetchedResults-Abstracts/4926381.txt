For hydraulic press presenting the advantage of force and speed range, hydraulic press is widely used in metal forming process. However, conventional hydraulic press has inefficient energy due to the requirement of motor continuously running regardless of punch motion. To avoid the disadvantage, this paper presents a switched reluctance motor directly-driven hydraulic press. The hydraulic press is composed of bidirectional constant delivery pump, switched reluctance motor and a single-rod actuator etc. To maintain precision of punch motion, a self-tuning fuzzy control is designed. Experiments with load and without load are conducted on the directly driven hydraulic press. Experiment results show that the control system can improve the performance of the directly driven hydraulic press.

The objective of this review is to outline current major cancer targets for nanoparticle systems and give insight into the direction of the field. The major targeting strategies that have been used for the delivery of therapeutic or imaging agents to cancer have been broken into three sections. These sections are angiogenesis-associated targeting, targeting to uncontrolled cell proliferation markers, and tumor cell targeting. The targeting schemes explored for many of the reported nanoparticle systems suggest the great potential of targeted delivery to revolutionize cancer treatment.

Potassium is essential plant macronutrients. According to the conceptual
approach soil potassium (K) can be classified into four forms: soil solution K,
exchangeable K, fixed K and structural K. In this research, potassium forms were
determined in loess and loess like derived soils of Golestan Province and in the silt
and clay fractions of them. The objective of this research was to determine the
contribution of soil separates in release of potassium and to be fertilizer
management in the soils. Mean extracted potassium content in clay particles of all
soils was more than that of soil and silt fraction. The quantity of K extracted by
HNO3, NH4oAc and HF in soils varied from 632 to 1200, 103 to 476 and 12000 to
17800 mg/Kg, respectively. The mean of exchangeable, nonexchancheable and
total potassium contents were 160.6, 1155.1 and 19100 mgKg-1, respectively in
clay fraction. The quantity of non exchancheable K extracted from silt fraction was
a half of its quantity in clay fraction.

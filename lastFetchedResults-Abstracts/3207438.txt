Efficient radio resource usage and quality of service (QoS) provision are important criterions in order to choose the right QoS policy for the LTE operators. In our previous work, we have proposed to add a new database named as BSLRC (Base Station Load and Radio Conditions) to optimize the operator policy with regard to the radio efficiency. Some concrete voice capacity estimations were also proposed. In this paper, we extend our earlier work by addressing some novel concerns. As a first step, we start by calculating the signaling load due to the use of BSLRC. Then, for voice services the BSLRC method is compared with the explicit congestion notification (already proposed for LTE systems). Both BSLRC and ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) share the same objective of optimizing the choice of codec rate with regard to radio use efficiency. We also propose some capacity estimates for video services as an extension to our previously proposed voice capacity estimations over LTE systems.

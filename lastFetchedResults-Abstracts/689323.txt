Recently, Batabyal and Godfrey (J. Range-Manage. 55 (2002) 12) have used a discrete-time Markov chain model to analyse the problem of rangeland management under uncertainty. In the present note, I continue this line of inquiry. In particular, I first show how the technique of first step analysis can be used to derive a time-based objective function for a range manager. Next, I discuss aspects of the decision problem faced by a range manager who wishes to optimize the above objective function and thereby minimize the cost to society from range desertification.

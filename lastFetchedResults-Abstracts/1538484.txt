This paper proposes a feedback neural network model for solving convex nonlinear programming (CNLP) problems. Under the condition that the objective function is convex and all constraint functions are strictly convex or that the objective function is strictly convex and the constraint function is convex, the proposed neural network is proved to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov and globally convergent to an exact optimal solution of the original problem. The validity and transient behavior of the neural network are demonstrated by using some examples.

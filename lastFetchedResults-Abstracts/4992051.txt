Ice is an important factor for wind turbine system health monitoring. Ice should be predicted and removed before forming on the blades. If ice forms on the axle, it will give a friction force on the axle and damage the electrical system. The objective of this paper is to design and implement an ice detection sensor system to prevent ice forming on wind turbine. A TI series temperature sensor is chosen to measure the side parameters, input to a grey-model based prediction module to get the predicted values, and send them to LEWICE system to predict the ice shape.

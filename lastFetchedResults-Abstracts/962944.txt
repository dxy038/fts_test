
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: More than 30% of deliveries are carried out by cesarean section. Spinal anesthesia is the routine and safe method but, in some situations, general anesthesia is selected instead. One complication in general anesthesia for cesarean is intraoperative awareness which sometimes can lead to disabling psychological sequela. This study is designed to compare sodium thiopental and propofol as induction agents in depth of anesthesia and hemodynamic variations in mothers and APGAR score of neonates. 
METHODS: This double blind clinical trial was conducted on 50 full term parturients undergoing elective cesarean section. They were randomly assigned into sodium thiopental (n=25) and propofol (n=25) groups. All patients received intravenous midazolam 1.5mg and lidocaine 1mg/kg. General anesthesia was induced for the first group by sodium thiopental (5mg/kg) and the second group by propofol (2.5mg/kg) and all patients then received succinylcholine (1.5mg/kg) as muscle relaxant for facilitation of laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% O2 -50% N2O and 0.6% Isoflurane. Maternal BIS values (Bispecral Index System) and hemodynamic variables and also APGAR score of neonates were evaluated and recorded. 
FINDINGS: BIS values in different times, was similar and less than 60 (p=0.637). Maternal mean arterial pressure (p=0.630) and heart rate (p=0.623) and neonatal APGAR score in first minute (p=0.105) and fifth minute (p=0.185) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: The effect of sodium thiopental and propofol on depth of anesthesia and hemodynamic variables of mothers as well as neonatal APGAR scores was similar and propofol can be used as an appropriate alternative for sodium thiopental in induction of anesthesia for cesarean section.

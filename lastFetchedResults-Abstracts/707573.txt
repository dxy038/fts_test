Recent investigations suggest that oxidative stress markers are useful in the evaluation of some types of abdominal pathology. We hypothesized that the severity of abdominal pain is correlated with oxidative stress as quantified by total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA). The objective of this study was to determine the plasma TAC and MDA levels in patients with acute abdominal pain and to examine their relation to abdominal emergency. We recruited 128 patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the emergency department. Medical history, vital signs and laboratory data were collected on arrival. TAC and MDA levels were determined using serums obtained from the initial blood sampling. Patients with acute abdominal pain had lower levels of TAC and higher levels of MDA than normal control. When patients were grouped according to whether they were discharged early (less than 24 hours) or hospitalized longer than 24 hours, Patients with hospital stay [gt ] 24 hours had significantly elevated pulse rate, temperature, leukocyte count, and C reactive protein (CRP) and lower TAC. No significant difference was found in age, sex, temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and MDA level. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that CRP and TAC were significant indicators of quantitative variables for disposition. This study found a correlation exists between oxidative stress and disease severity in patients with abdominal pain. This suggests that TAC might be useful as a guide for patient disposition in the emergency department

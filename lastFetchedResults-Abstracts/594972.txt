Objective: To study the frequency of ABO and RhD blood groups in patients with various haematological disorders requiring repeated blood transfusion.Material and Methods: Two hundred (200) subjects requiring regular blood transfusion suffering from various haematological disorders i.e. Thalassaemia, Haemophilia, Aplastic Anaemia and patients with Chronic Renal Failure undergoing haemodialysis, were selected and analyzed to detect the ABO and RhD blood groups. The investigation included standard blood grouping tube method.Results: The commonest blood group observed was "B" (31%), the next commonest groups were "O" (27%) and "A" (27%) and "AB" (15%). The Rh-positive were 94% and Rh-negative were 6%.Conclusion: Various haematolocial disorders are quite common. Some of these are congenital e.g. Thalassaemia, Haemophilia and some of them are acquired e.g. Aplastic Anaemia, Chronic renal Failure. These disorders develop regardless of the blood groups. The frequency of ABO and RhD blood groups are related to the blood groups of the specific geographical or ethnic population.

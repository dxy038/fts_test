The principal objective of this study is to formulate a calculation process, based on the second law of exergy, for evaluating the thermoeconomic potential of a steam-turbine plant for trigeneration. The plant employs biomass, namely, waste wood as its energy source. Four different plant configurations are presented and assessed. ‘Their cost effectiveness is evaluated with varying economic and operating parameters’, because only the fuel price and electricity price are varied. In case 1, high pressure superheated steam generated is supplied to meet the demand for process heat as well as chilled water production in an absorption chiller. In cases 2 and 3, steam is extracted at appropriate stages of the turbine and supplied to meet the demand for process heat and chilled water production in an absorption chiller. Steam generated in case 2 produces sufficient power to meet internal demands while case 3 generates excess electricity for sale back to the utility. In case 4, low pressure saturated steam is generated to meet the demand for process heat and electricity is bought from the utilities, including those used to power an electric vapour-compression chiller. For all cases, it was found that exergy destruction is most extensive in the furnace, amounting to nearly 60%. Exergy destruction in the steam drum is the next most extensive ranging from 11% to 16%. It was also observed that the overall production cost decreases with steam pressure and increases with steam temperature.

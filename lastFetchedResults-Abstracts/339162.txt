Objective
The aim of this study was to reveal the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in erythropoiesis.
Methods

The effects of PPARγ ligands on cellular proliferation and differentiation were investigated in erythroid colony-forming cells (ECFCs) purified from human peripheral blood.
Results

RT-PCR analysis revealed that PPARγ mRNA is expressed in ECFCs. Synthetic PPARγ ligands, troglitazone or pioglitazone, suppressed cellular proliferation without inducing apoptosis and delayed maturation of ECFCs, as determined by flow cytometry. The delay in erythroid maturation by troglitazone was confirmed by the down-regulation of γ-globin, β-globin and GATA-1 mRNA, and the maintenance of GATA-2 mRNA.
Conclusions

Our results suggest that PPARγ modulates the differentiation process of erythroid progenitor cells, and plays a crucial role in regulating the balance of hematopoiesis.

This document describes the interpretation of in-pile oscillation experiments in the MINERVE facility at the CEA Cadarache. The objective of this study is the improvement of fission products cross sections. The experimental device and the oscillation technique are described in a first part, then the interpretation method, based on the deterministic APOLLO2.8 code, is presented in a second part. In the third part, the calculation scheme is validated by comparison to a reference Monte Carlo calculation using the TRIPOLI4.5 code. The results of the interpretation and the calculation over experiment ratios, using nuclear data from the JEFF3.1.1 library, are finally discussed.

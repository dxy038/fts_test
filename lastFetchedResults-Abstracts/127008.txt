Background : Teacher's familiarity with teaching methods along with medical revolutions is necessary to achieve the quality improvement in education. Two effective factors for success in aplication of educational content in practice domain, are knowledge and attitudes of participants in educational programs.
Objective : To detect the effectiveness of elementary teaching methodology workshops on knowledge, attitude & practice of the faculty members of Kerman university of medical sciences.
Methods : This semiexperimental study was implemented on 71 participants, selected by convenience method. The data related to the knowledge and attitudes was gathered using pre & post workshop questionnaires. A checklist was used to evaluate their practice before the workshop.
Findings: The result indicated that mean and standard deviation knowledge of pre
workshop was 6.2±3.7, attitude was 14.19±1.2 & practice 13.6±2.2 and post workshop ones were 13.4±3.9, 18.2±2.1, & 14.12±1.68, respectively. There was a significant relationship
between pre & post workshop knowledge & attitude (P <0.004 There was no such a relationship in practice domain. No significant relationship was observed between attitude, knowledge variations & practice. It cannot be judged that practice variations were affected by knowledge variation during the workshops. There was a correlation coefficient between age and post workshop knowledge (r=0.33 & P <0.03). By increase in the age, the acquired knowledge after the end of workshop was decreased.
Conclusion : It seems that the workshop can improve the participant's knowledge & attitude, but besides educational workshop some other ,factors are necessary for behavioral improvement in the practice domain.

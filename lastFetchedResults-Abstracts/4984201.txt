The objective of this paper is to compare two integrator-based controllers, the multi-resonant controller and the direct power control with space vector modulator, with a dead-beat controller for shunt power active filter applications. The three controllers have been compared, theoretically and experimentally, analyzing their robustness, their computational load and their transient and steady-state performances. The computational delay has been taken into account during the tuning processes of the controllers. Simulation and experimental results show that all proposed controllers are suitable for active filter applications. Despite that, the multi-resonant controller, due to its robustness and the good transient and steady-state performances, is the best suited for complex multi-frequency applications

This paper presents decoupling analysis and numerical performance evaluation of a microwave antenna feeding network for enhancing the isolation between coupled microwave antennas. The RF network linearly combines the input signals in order to force the antennas microwave mutual coupling between the ports become zero. The objective of this RF investigation is to develop a mathematically designed feeding network intended for a suitable use in a 2&#215;2 monopole RF antenna array. The microwave feeding network demonstrates the appropriateness in order to develop a well-established analysis model for microwave feeding networks.

This paper presents a summary of a collaborative project between the University of Bristol, UK and Monash University, Australia. The aim of the project is to investigate a new approach for on-line object identification in industrial processes. The main objective of this new sensing technique is to give a reliable identification of an object inexpensively with minimum amount of hardware.
The paper describes the cost-effective hardware architecture of the new sensing system including the signal interface device and the signal processing software. In addition, the paper includes a description of the experiments conducted to analyse the sensor's sensitivity to stimuli and the output resolution. Also, potential industrial applications of the new sensor are discussed in this paper.

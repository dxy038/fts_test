The project entitled Evaluation of RADARSAT-2 quad-pol data for functional assessment of wetlands (Id6842), developed in the framework of the CSA-ESA SOAR-EU (Science and operational applications research for Europe) by a consortium comprising I.E.T.R at the University of Rennes 1 and COSTEL-LETG at the University of Haute-Bretagne, aims to contribute to the application development in demonstrating the exploitation of fully polarimetric time-series datasets for the functional assessment of wetlands. The objective of this article is to address the issue of evaluating fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 time-series datasets to determine the water cycle dynamics, in order to delineate precisely potential, effective and efficient wetlands. To that end, the development and validation of a general PolSAR segmentation including multi-temporal analysis of wetland evolution, and the investigation of polarimetric decomposition methods for quantitative physical parameter inversion algorithms are presented.

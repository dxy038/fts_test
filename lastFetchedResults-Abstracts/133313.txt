Introduction: Transmission of malaria, different filariasis, arboviruses and biting nuisance place mosquitoes as the most important arthropods in medicine and health not only in Guilan province and Iran but also in the world. Objective: To study mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) fauna in Guilan province (Caspian sea littoral areas, North of Iran), an investigation was carried out during April to December 2000.
Materials and Methods: Mosquito larvae were collected from different larval breeding places by means of ladle or dropper. Adult mosquitoes were collected from different habitats by means of aspirator or captorator or reared from pupae.
Results: The whole set of 2478 adult spceimens from 64 habitats and 6656 larvae from 127 larval breeding places was collected. During this study, Coquillettidia (Coquillettidia) richiardii (Ficalbi, 1889) and Uranotaenia (Pseudoficalbia) unguiculata Edwards, 1913 were collected and identified.In this investigation,the second species was recorded for the first time in Guilan province(Loshan,Roodbar district) as larva,New data were provided about the distribution of Cq.richiardii in Guilan province and the second species was collected from Rezvanshahr and Lahijan districts for the first time and Some-e-Sara as female adults (in forest parts).
Conclusion: The distribution, biology and ecology of the two species need more studies in Guilan province and Iran. The possible transmission of some arboviruses by Cq.richiardii can be taken into consideration.

The primary objective of the 1994 investigation was twofold: to implement a national network, science education effort to increase the awareness and understanding of oceanography and coastal processes and to improve the teaching techniques of approximately 120 elementary and middle school teachers of predominately minority students. This proposed three-semester hour, graduate course was implemented in five regions of this country with a maximum of 20 teachers per region. Further, this study was based on the successful prototype developed and implemented during the summer of 1993. Scholarships (stipend, room, board, travel, and tuition) were provided for elementary and middle-school teachers. In service teachers were solicited and selected from the 15 chapters of the National Marine Educators Association, State Departments of Education, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Programs on the basis of their willingness to commit to: (1) enrollment for a minimum of twelve days in residence at the institution designated as the regional, host facility; (2) development and implementation of one teacher-training workshop; (3) infusion of oceanic and coastal concepts and activities within their curricula; and (4) one professional presentation (article, paper or workshop) at the state, regional, or national level. During the preparation of this course, the Project Directors compiled numerous materials as a resource book for the teacher participants. Each of these participants developed six homework assignments on the following topics: Physical Parameters, Marine and Aquatic Habitats, Marine and Aquatic Resources, Plate Tectonics, JASON Curricula, and Marine and Aquatic Pollution. The Project Directors plan to take the &#8220;best&#8221; specific concepts and activities related to oceanography and coastal processes and incorporate them into a more succinct resource book for elementary and middle school teachers. The Project Directors believe this course will instill an increased confidence in elementary and middle school teachers for teaching science, particularly oceanography and coastal processes. This study will enhance participantsÂ´ knowledge of these systems, thereby encouraging them to effectively infuse these concepts within existing curricula

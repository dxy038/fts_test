BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Raloxifen is used widely to prevent menopause complications. Hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for coronary heart disease in menopausal women. There are controversies about raloxifen effects on serum lipids, so this study was done to determine the effects of raloxifen (ralofen) on serum lipids of the menopausal women.

M ETHODS This before-after interventional study was done on 50 menopausal women that returned to menopausal clinic of Yahyanejad hospital in Babol in 2008. Inclusion criteria were 45-60 years old and past of one year of last rnenstural period. Exclusion criteria were history of cancer, abnormal uterus bleeding, clotting dysfunction, use of androgen, corticosteroid and estrogen, renal failure, chronic and acute disease of liver, history of deep vein thrombosis and cardiovascular disease. Patient received ralofen (product by Aboryhan company) 60 mg/day for three months. Serum lipid level measured in three times include: before treatment, one month and three month later. FINDINGS: The mean age (±SD) of the patients was 53.2±3.7 and the median time of last rnenstural period was 6 years. The mean level of serum triglyceride (mg/dl) of menopausal women was significant (p=0.012) before treatment (159.6±36.1 mg/dl), one month after treatment (162.9±34.8 mg/dl) and three month after treatment (170.8±41.7 mg/dl). So the mean level of serum cholesterol (mg/dl) of menopausal women was significant (p=0.000) before treatment (193.6±22.2 mg/dl), one month after treatment (198.6±24.9 mg/dl) and three month after treatment (202.1 ±26.7 mg/dl).The mean level of serum LDL (mg/dl) of menopausal women was not significant (p=0.152) before treatment (114.6±28.3 mg/dl), one month after treatment (118.8±29.6 mg/dl) and three month after treatment (113.9±26.7 mg/dl). So the mean level of serum HDL (mg/dl) of menopausal women was not significant before treatment (47.8±9.3 mg/dl), one month after treatment (46.7±8.5 mg/dl) and three months after treatment (48.2±5.8 mg/dl).

CONCLl SION: This study showed that ralofen had no significant effects on serum lipids levels and triglyceride and cholesterol increased were in normal and borderline limits that don't have clinical importance.

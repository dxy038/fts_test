Ontologies are playing an important role in semantic Web. Ontology mapping is an effective method to solve the problem of ontology heterogeneity and to realize the interoperation among semantic web applications which use different ontologies. Instances and structures are important factors to establish ontology mapping, however, existing ontology mapping methods combine the results of different strategies with weighted average and the weights are subjective. In this paper, the angle degree of approaching is proposed according to the principle of fuzzy mathematics and is applied to similarity measure. Similarity measure based-on approach degree expresses all the similarities between different factors with vectors respectively, and combines them. In the end, the experimental results show this method is more objective and can calculate the similarities more accurately than the other methods.

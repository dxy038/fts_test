Color night vision techniques play a very important role in the night vision field. How to evaluate the perceptual quality of the color night vision image is a great need to assess the performance of algorithms in this technology. Currently, people usually judge the performance of color night vision techniques using subjective evaluation measures, which is time consuming and bothersome. This paper proposes an objective evaluation metric based on affective information and harmonious feeling to assess the color appearance of the color night vision image quality. This objective index is computed based on power spectra density in a decorrelated lalphabeta color space and reflects a fluctuation of the imageÂ´s color. And this kind of fluctuation consists with the feeling of human vision. Subjective evaluation is also investigated in this paper and the experimental results confirm that the proposed objective metric correlates with the subjective evaluation well.

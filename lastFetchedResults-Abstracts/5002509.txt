Hybrid power systems combine two or more complementary power generation technologies to achieve the system performance that is not possible for those involving a single power technology. The complicated dynamic interactions of the hybrid power system elements, coupled with stringent safety, power quality and efficiency requirements, impose challenging control and dynamic optimization problems. This paper presents a novel approach that addresses the voltage regulation and power tracking problems for hybrid DC power system. A DC power network consisting of two power sources is considered. A nonlinear dynamic model is developed, and a nonlinear controller is employed to achieve: (1) DC bus voltage regulation; (2) current sensorless power tracking control. Both the dynamic model and the nonlinear controller are validated with simulation and experiment results. The results show that the nonlinear controller can effectively achieve the system performance objective.

6-Benzofuryl-, styryl, benzyl, and furfurylpurines as well as 6-[1(3H)-isobenzofuranylidenemethyl]purines have been synthesized and their activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) determined. Several compounds displayed profound antimycobacterial activity in combination with low toxicity towards mammalian cells. NMR and X-ray crystallography were employed to determine the detailed structures and the results were supported by quantum chemical calculations.

In remote sensing researches, the curse of dimensionality is one greatly difficult classification problem. Many studies have demonstrated that multiple classifier systems, such as the random subspace method (RSM), can alleviate small sample size and high dimensionality concern and obtain more outstanding and robust results than a single classifier on extensive pattern recognition issues. A dynamic subspace method (DSM) was proposed for constructing component classifiers with adaptive subspaces to adjust the shortcomings of RSM based on re substitution accuracy by applying each classifier. However, the performances of SVMs are based on choosing the proper kernel functions or proper parameters of a kernel function. The objective of this research is to develop a novel ensemble technique based on support vector machines (SVMs) via the optimal kernel method, and propose a novel subspace selection mechanism, named the kernel-based dynamic subspace method (KDSM), to improve DSM on automatically determining dimensionality and selecting component dimensions for diverse subspaces. Experimental results show a sound performance of classification on the famous hyperspectral images, Washington DC Mall.

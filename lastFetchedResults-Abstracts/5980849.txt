The primary objective of this paper is to study how the time-varying sea surface influences the electromagnetic (EM) scattering from ships. The mean and standard deviation of radar cross section (RCS) from targets on sea surface are discussed under different circumstances. The statistics of the phase gradient is also investigated using alpha-stable distribution. Simulation results show that the time-evolving sea surface affects the behavior of the EM scattering from ships both in RCS and phase gradient.

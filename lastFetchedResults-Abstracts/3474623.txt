We investigate optimum rate assignment scheme maximizing network throughput on the downlink of a multirate CDMA wireless network. Systems employing orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes as well as systems employing multiple codes have been studied. Our objective is to maximize the network throughput under constraints on total transmit power, total bandwidth and individual QoS requirements specified in terms of minimum rates. First, users are ordered based on their transmit energy per bit requirements to achieve the target received energy per bit to interference power spectral density ratio at the receivers. Based on the initial ordering, we prove that for systems employing multiple codes, greedy rate assignment yields maximum network throughput. For systems employing variable spreading codes, we show that greedy rate assignment is optimal if the minimum rate requirement of a user is larger than or equal to the minimum rate requirement of any other user with a larger transmit energy per bit requirement. Simulation results verify the superiority of the greedy algorithm under various system and channel assumptions

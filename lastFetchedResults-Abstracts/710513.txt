Study Objective: This project was initiated to better understand why some African-American adolescent females do not use emergency contraceptive pills (ECP), despite their widespread availability. Adolescents are considered likely candidates for ECP because they are more likely to inconsistently use birth control and have sporadic sexual behavior patterns. These factors increase the risk of unprotected intercourse and unplanned pregnancy
Design: A qualitative study design was employed to assess the knowledge of African-American adolescent females regarding ECP and their beliefs affecting use and nonuse of ECP.
Setting: An adolescent clinic at a large, urban, academic children's hospital.
Participants: Twenty-nine African-American adolescent (age 13–18) females.
Interventions. Semi-structured, qualitative interviews lasting 15–20 minutes.
Main Outcome Measures: Interviews yielded qualitative data that was coded and categorized into themes.
Results: Through the interviews, eight themes emerged: Taking Care of Self, Lack of Knowledge of ECP, Inaccurate Information, Sources of Information, Acceptability of Adolescent Pregnancy, Partner's Influence on Adolescent Choices, Discomfort Talking About Sex, and Concern About Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).
Conclusions: The results from this qualitative study will contribute to future quantitative research efforts by providing insight into the decision-making process regarding ECP among this population. The themes provide a foundation for clinical implications and educational interventions. Although a large proportion of the sample (24%) had used ECP, misinformation about ECP and basic reproductive health issues was prevalent. Most of the adolescents report they obtain reproductive health information from a complex network of information sharing, in which their primary sources tend to be peers.

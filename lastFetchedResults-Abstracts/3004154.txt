Membranes hold promise as a new water treatment method of the future. In this study, a device is designed to test the efficiency of membranes. The device is implemented to be controlled remotely. An Internet based remote control system is implemented on the membrane test device to make the users access to it easier. When using the system, a remote operator only needs a general purpose computer with Internet connection to conduct a test. The engineering objective is to perform robust control over the Internet connection. A control architecture that combines computer and the membrane testing hardware is built. This system has two primary parts, the server part and the client part. A server is used to provide the application to the operator to control the hardware. The client part is executed on the remote operatorÂ´s computer. The client uses a TCP/IP protocol to connect to the server through the Internet. Communication coordination between the client and the server is developed using Java and Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA).

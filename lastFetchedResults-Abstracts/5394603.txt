The objective of this article is to show how useful can be the application of ontologies for constructing 3D scenarios and describing the laws which rule an environment. It is possible to create 3D scenarios using commercial 3D tools. However, it´s important to pay attention not only to ontologies, but also to the constructing of a virtual environment. Even more in actual virtual environments, where it´s necessary to bring virtual creatures to actual conditions according to the pre-established conditions like friction, humidity, gravity, etc. In common applications these laws are given as rules in extension of the system. In this article we present an original approach to solve both problems using ontology. The main idea is to use the ontology to: describe relations between the elements of the environment to help to recreate the scenario and use the ontology to describe the laws of the environment

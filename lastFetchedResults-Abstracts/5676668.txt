Active Queue Management (AQM) can potentially reduce packet loss rate in the Internet. This is used by routers for control congestion, where packets are dropped before queues become full. In this paper, a new framework of AQM, namely NEWQUE active queue management algorithm supporting explicit congestion notification (ECN), is proposed. The objective of the new algorithm is to improve performance of congested routers by keeping link utilization high, link utilization stable, stable queue size and packet drop rate low. By examining the robustness and system response for the TCP/AQM mode, we present that the proposed scheme has good performance and robustness with respect to the uncertainties of the round-trip time (RTT) and the number of active TCP connections. The proposed NEWQUE AQM is implemented with help of ns2 simulator. The simulation shows that the proposed design outperforms the peer AQM schemes in terms of packet loss, link utilization and buffer fluctuation.

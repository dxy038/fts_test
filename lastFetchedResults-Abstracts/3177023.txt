Human identification from a skull is a critical process in legal and forensic medicine, specially when no other means are available. Traditional clay-based methods attempt to generate the human face, in order to identify the corresponding person. However, these reconstructions lack of objectivity and consistence, since they depend on the practitioner. Current computerized techniques are based on facial models, which introduce undesired facial features when the final reconstruction is built. This paper presents an objective 3D craniofacial reconstruction technique, implemented in a graphic application, without using any facial template. The only information required by the software tool is the 3D image of the target skull and three parameters: age, gender and Body Mass Index (BMI) of the individual. Complexity is minimized, since the application database only consists of the anthropological information provided by soft tissue depth values in a set of points of the skull.

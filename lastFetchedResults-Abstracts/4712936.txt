In this paper we present research works we are addressing in EU4ALL project (IST-2006-034778) to enable Higher Education (HE) institutions to support and attend the accessibility needs of their students. This approach is based on integrating learning and management of the learning in terms of workflows to support the different types of existing scenarios with a twofold objective. First, involving non-technical staff in their definition. Second, using standard-based learning management systems (LMS). A combination of design and runtime adaptations through IMS Learning Design (IMS-LD) specification is being used, following the aLFanet approach (IST-2001-33288).

In this paper we describe the design, development, formative evaluation and initial findings of one level of a serious game whose objective is to teach Information Assurance concepts to undergraduate students in introductory programming courses. The game level focuses on the concept of ´operator precedence´. The player travels through a multilevel 3- dimensional maze and at each junction in the maze he/she is required to solve a mathematical problem that involves the application of operator precedence rules. A correct answer allows the player to move closer to the maze exit, an incorrect solution moves the player farther from the end of the maze. Initial findings from a formative study with a group of 14 undergraduate students show that the game level is usable, engaging and useful for learning/reviewing the intended programming concept.

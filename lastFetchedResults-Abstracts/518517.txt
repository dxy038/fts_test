Introduction: One of the mechanisms of migraine pain is neurogenic inflammation causing by induction of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes(LTs), it seems that polyunsaturated fatty acid omega 3 have anti-inflammatory and so analgesic effect by modifying their production.

Objective: Determine the effect of omega-3 on the severity of migraine headache.

Materials and Methods: In this randomized double blind clinical trial study, 198 patients who suffered from migraine and referred to the clinic of neurology in poursina hospital in Rasht, were selected from January to September 2009 according to IHS criteria. They divided to two groups: 2 pearls of omega3 (2gr) were given to case group (97 patients) and 2 pearls of glycerol were given to control group for 3 months. Headache severity was graded according to MIDAS before and after treatment .The analysis was performed in each group by sign test. Comparing the changes of headache severity were assessed by repeated measure ANOVA variance were analyzed by SPSS 15. Results: 97 patients in case group (27 male & 70 female) with mean age of 26.51±7.01 years and 99 patients in control group (28 male & 71 female ) with mean age of 24.85±6.21 years participated in this study. This 2groups were adjusted for age (P=0.081) and sex (P =1.000). The reduction in headache severity in case group was 35.1% that was statistically significant (P=0.001) and in control group; 20.2% that wasn't statistically significant (P=0.154).The changes in headache severity had statistically significant difference in these 2 groups. (P =0.048) Conclusion: Omega 3 is effective on reduction of migraine headache severity.

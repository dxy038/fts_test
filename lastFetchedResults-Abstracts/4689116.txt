In this paper we try to discuss the past and present scenario of the quality of PhD degree awarded in engineering (or technology) by various Indian universities/institutes. This note highlights the reasons for non-uniformity in the assessment of the highest possible degree awarded by the country by various universities/institutes. In sequel, we identify the influencing parameters for assessment by analyzing the present scenario for awarding PhD, participation of the intellectual pool in the scientific and technological development and demand of these intellectuals in the job market in India &amp; abroad. Our objective is to present a suggestive decision model for quality assessment of PhD degree such that existing large gap in the quality can be narrowed down for different grades of Indian universities/institutes.

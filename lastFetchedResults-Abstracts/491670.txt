Housing conditions for horses impose various levels of confinement, which may compromise welfare. Lying behaviour and
activity can be used as welfare indicators for domestic animals and rebound behaviour suggests a build-up of motivation
resulting from deprivation. The objective of this study was to determine if activity and lying behaviour of horses are affected
by housing conditions and to investigate the occurrence of rebound behaviour after release from confinement. Eight horses
were subjected, in pairs, to each of four experimental treatments; paddock (P), fully stabled (FS), partly stabled (PS) and
yard (Y). Each horse received 6 days acclimatisation prior to the 24 h recording period. Time spent in lying and activity were
electronically recorded using a tilt switch and motion sensor connected to a data logger worn on the horseâ€™s left foreleg. Time
spent active during the first 5 min of release from stable to paddock in the PS treatment (days 1 and 5) and at the same time
of day in the P treatment was used as a measure of rebound behaviour. Effect of housing conditions on total time spent active
was highly significant (FS5123 s, PS5158 s, Y5377 s, P5779 s, P,0.001). Housing conditions did not significantly affect
total time spent lying (P50.646). Horses were significantly more active, compared with baseline paddock behaviour, on release
from stabling on both days 1 (P50.006) and 5 (P50.025) of PS treatment. These results suggest that activity patterns of
horses, but not lying behaviour, are affected by the housing conditions tested and that rebound activity occurs in horses after
a period of confinement.

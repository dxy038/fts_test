Despite advances in different techniques of suturing and their alternatives, controversies exist in their indications in laparoscopic surgeries. Due to difficulties exist with laparoscopic suturing knots the hemolock technique was introduced in this study. The objective of this study was to compare resistance among extracorporeal Meltzer and Roeder knot and hemolock in laparoscopic surgery. In this quasiexperimental study 205 intestines of sheep (20 cm length) sutured with Meltzer's (43 cases, 20%), Roeder's (44 cases, 20.5%) and hemolock (128 cases, 59.5%) methods. Resistance of these methods were evaluated with sphygmomanometer. Furthermore, side effects of sutures were evaluated. Mean pressure tolerance of Roeder's knot method (196.0±50.9 mmHg) Meltzer knot (193.8±49.22 mmHg) and hemolock clips (247.03±42.47 mmHg) were determined. Mean pressure tolerance was significantly higher in hemolock(p<0.001) compared to the other ones. Frequency of suture displacement was 52% (22 cases) in Roeder, 68% in Meltzer (23 cases), and 47% (37 cases) in hemolock. With respect to the results of this study and easy use of hemolock and due to its high pressure resistance, hemolock can be considered as a safe and good substitute for extracorporeal knots in laparoscopic surgeries.

Objective: Objective of this study was to the effect of repeated bouts of eccentric exercise on some of  Biochemical markers of Delayed onset muscle soreness.
Methodology: 30 college males with mean age of 21.2 were selected and were divided into two groups randomly. Both groups performed five sets (10 repetitions per set ) of the eccentric contractions , at 85% of one repetition maximum (1- RM), Experimental group repeated this exercise 48h later. Creatine  kinase and Total cholesterol were recorded before, after, 24, 48, 72, 96 (hr) after eccentric contractions.
Statistical Result:The repeated bout of eccentric exercise do not show any effects on cholesterol , Creatine kinase values in Experimental group (p >  0.05).
Discussion: The results of this study suggest that the repeated bout of eccentric exercise produces an adaptation such that the muscle is more resistant to damage from a subsequent bout of exercise.

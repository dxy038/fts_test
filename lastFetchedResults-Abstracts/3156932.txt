This paper is mainly a continuation of the previous study, which is based on an assessment of liver function and verifies the results. First of all, we use the grey relational grade in grey system theory and integrate the numerical results of the examiner. And then, the influence factors of liver function toward weighting value are derived by GM(0,N) weight analysis model. In addition, by using software, toolbox concept and the powerful function of software application, that is based on a relevant measuring model and weighting model to develop a toolbox and to achieve a practical setting and academic research. The paper mainly does an in-depth analysis on liver function diagnosis. In order to achieve the purpose, we first refer to the relevant regulation of Department of Health and decide the analyzed influence factors of diagnosis. In addition, we suggest five influence factors according to the past researches and the current medical analysis factors. In order to explore the nature of each factor, the expected input data is over 300 cases. Secondly, we make use of four grey relational grade in grey system theory to convert a subjective judgment into an objective way of quantitative value, and get the mean as the output of weighting analysis. Then, the influence factors of liver function toward systemÂ´s objective weighting are derived by means of GM(0, N) weighting analysis model. During the setting period, we also develop a Matlab toolbox and support with lots of calculation and complicate mathematical calculation due to the mutual influence of objects data. In addition to complete a medical assistance platform of the objective intelligent liver function evaluation, we continuously pile up the evaluation software of medical system.

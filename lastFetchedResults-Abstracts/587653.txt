Background: Galbanum is one of the endemic medicinal-industrial plants of Iran that is extincting because of irregular and unsuitable harvesting from natural habitats and its propagation problems.
Objective: In this study, in vitro germination of zygotic embryo of galbanum (originated from Esfahan) was investigated.
Methods: The effects of medium (B5 and ¼ MS), hormonal treatment (0 and 0.5 mgl-1 GA3), duration of cold treatment of cultured embryos (0 and 6 days) and light condition of cultures (for first week in darkness and then under 16-h photoperiod or only under 16-h photoperiod) factors on embryo germination and characteristics of obtained plantlets were investigated.
Results: Maximum embryo germination (100%) was obtained. GA3 caused more height of shoot and less diameter of basal ring in obtained plantlets. Production of primary leaves in plantlets was mainly observed in ¼ MS medium and the highest production of secondary roots in plantlets was obtained in the both media. Cold treatment of cultured embryos had negative effect on production of primary leaves and secondary roots in plantlets. Production of primary leaves in obtained plantlets from cold treated embryos (for 6 days) was observed in hormone-free media, that were incubated for first week in darkness and then under 16-h photoperiod, and in media containing GA3, that were incubated only under 16-h photoperiod. Also, production of secondary roots in those plantlets was observed in the media incubated only under 16-h photoperiod.
Conclusion: Embryo culture of galbanum is a useful method for overcoming seed dormancy and it also improves germination.

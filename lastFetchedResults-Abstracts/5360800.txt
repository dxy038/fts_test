PMUs can improve performances of monitored control systems in various fields of power system. Two general types of objective functions for optimal PMU placement (OPP) problems are proposed according to whether the PMU number is known or not. The first type can be solved with a standard genetic algorithm (SGA) when all the schemes are collated and coded properly. Decided by both the PMU number and the installed sites, the second type has locally optimal solutions. The stepwise mutation genetic algorithm (SMGA) is proposed to get the globally optimal solution quickly. It will adjust both the manner and the probability of mutation to avoid the possible prematurity, once the PMU numbers of individuals in the population become too close. Both the general functions and the algorithms are compared and verified in a multipurpose example of IEEE30-bus

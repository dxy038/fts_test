The rigidity of twist-drill are determined by its structure parameters. In this paper, the FEM model of the twist-drill is established by software ABAQUS. With the methods of Orthogonal test and FEM, a quantitative analysis to the torsional rigidity of twist-drill have been developed. The optimization of the twist-drill structure parameters are carried out with Genetic Algorithm based on the objective function of the torsional rigidity. The research result is helpful to the design of twist-drill

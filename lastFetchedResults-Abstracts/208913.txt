For stud ying protein elec trophoret ic pattern of Corynebacterium pse udotuberculosis , this study was co nduc ted on
16 bacteria isolat ed from ov ine caseous lymph adenitis, and they were compared wi th C. pseudo tuberculosis isolated
from cattle. All of microbi al spec imens und erwent ele ct rophoresis in SDS - PAGE method in the presence of low
molecul arl y we ight (LMWM) protein mark er on di screte sys tem ge l '%5 - 10 polyacrylarnid, To tally 17 prot ein band s
with molecul ar we ight rang ing 25- 220 KDA were obse rved in the understudied bacteria. As a result, the protein s
3 1, 53, 64, and 68 KDA were iden tified in all stra ins of nitrate posit ive and neg ative bacteria , protein s 37>38 KDA
in biotype n . nitra te posi tive (iso lated from catt le) and prot eins 25, 35, 39, 40, 48 and 120 KDA in biotype I >nitrate

The objective of this paper is to evaluate pilotsÂ´ body and physiological performance during their works using a large model sensor (tri-axial accelerometer and atmospheric pressure sensor) and a heart rate monitor toward safe harbors. The dis/embarkation experiment is carried out for the real pilotage. The results show that the largest acceleration 1.5-2.0 G appears during transfer from a pilot ladder to a pilot boat, and the sensor read their behavior at the ladder. The atmospheric pressure detected a height change. The heart rate read his mental workload for the decision-making for ship handling.

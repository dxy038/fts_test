In this paper, we propose a performance driven methodology for cancelable face templates generation. This is to address the issue of satisfying both the security and performance requirements at the same time. Essentially, the methodology consists of two transformations namely, an efficient feature extraction transformation and an error minimizing template transformation. The first transformation is achieved via a modified sparse random projection which extracts and transforms essential face features into cancelable templates. The second transformation is realized through a direct objective formulation to minimize the system's total error rate. In order to facilitate convergence of the resulted minimization search, a modified sigmoid is proposed for an error counting step function approximation. Using two publicly available face databases, we empirically show an improved verification performance in terms of the equal error rate while hiding the face identity simultaneously.

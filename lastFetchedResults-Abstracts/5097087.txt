The objective of hyperthermia cancer therapy is to elevate the tumor temperature to approximately 43degC while maintaining normal temperature in healthy tissue. This goal can be achieved through a waveform diversity method that optimizes the covariance matrix of the excitation signals applied to array elements. This paper presents the computer simulation of a cylindrical section ultrasound phased array using the waveform diversity method to heat a spherical tumor embedded in a 3D biological tissue model. With this hearing strategy, optimal excitation sequences are obtained and desirable power depositions and temperature distributions are achieved.

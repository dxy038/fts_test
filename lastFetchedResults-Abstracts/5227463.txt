The author presents a new method for solving multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems that is based on the skeleton concept of optimality. The theoretical foundations of the skeleton method are presented. The MCDM problem is formulated and the concept of optimality of the skeleton method is explained. Given upper and lower aspiration levels in the objective space, the skeleton set is determined and the best compromise solution is found as the intersection point of the skeleton and the nondominated set

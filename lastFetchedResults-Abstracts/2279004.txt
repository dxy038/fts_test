According to various loads in terms of nutrition priorities, consumers can help micro grid’s control center in optimizing the exploitation of the network and powering critical loads by offering theirremovable or interruptible load with different prices. Response to demands plays an important rule in electricity market for making balance between supply and demand. Overall consumer prices can be very useful in reducing exploiting costs especially when the market prices are high. Meanwhile, with this method consumers can avoid paying high costs for their little importance loads.In this article it is tried that the exploiting of micro grid being done with the presence of demand’s response, thus while increasing social welfare, the load’s curve be flat in an acceptable level. With this purposes the problem is a Multipurpose objective function based on non-linear programming (NLP), that for solving the problem the GAMS optimizing software and for Multipurpose optimizing, the limitation proviso ?, will be used. The suggested algorithm will be implemented on the micro grid Busbar type 17. Obtained results shows the ability of suggested algorithm in improving the micro grid’s operation.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fukushima nuclear accident has produced concerns about radioactive distribution and subsequent exposure to ionizing radiation. The aim of the present study was the comparison between local gamma rays level before and after accident in Babol in north of Iran.
METHODS: In this cross sectional study, the environmental dosimetry was performed in 182 local health centers in Babol according to International Atomic Energy Agency standard protocol and the results were compared with similar previous survey in similar areas which was done at 2010 for determining of association between local external gamma rays and frequency of cancer in Babol, Iran.  
FINDINGS: Results showed that there was no significant increase in local gamma ray level before (60.62±12.96 nSv/hr =0.53 mSv/y) and after (37.06±17.76 nSv/hr =0.33 mSv/y) accident in Babol in the areas under the study.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that Fukushima nuclear accident has not significantly changed the local gamma rays level in Babol in northern Iran.

KEY WORDS: Fukushima nuclear accident, Local gamma rays, Babol.

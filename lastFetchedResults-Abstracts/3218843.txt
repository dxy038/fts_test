Though tremendous work has been done in the field of grid computing, due to the two challenging aspects (i.e. load balancing and scheduling) it is hindered from being beneficial to large-scale distributed parallel applications. This paper provides a survey of various techniques to address the challenges in grid computing. We classify the surveyed approaches based on their objective functions into two categories: Application Centric, Resource Centric.

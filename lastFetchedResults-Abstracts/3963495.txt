The prompt exchange of information is vital to the progress of any branch of science, and especially so in rapidly changing branches such as antennas and propagation. In order to expedite the dissemination of information in these fields, the Professional Group on Antennas and Propagation is undertaking the periodic publication of groups of articles and reports of interest to the membership. In order to accomplish the objective of promptness of publication, it is planned to keep the editorial review of papers to a minimum, thus placing the responsibility for accuracy and completeness of material entirely on the author.

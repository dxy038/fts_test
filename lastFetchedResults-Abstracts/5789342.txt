Engine dynamics simulation was conducted by ADAMS, and obtained stress state of mount, calculated mount structure strength utilizing FEM. The calculation results indicate that the deformation displacements of all the mounts are in the scope limited by the allowed safe distance, the Von Mises Stress of mounts are all less than the material yield stress, so mount design meets the requirement, design methods is applicable. Therefore, this paper provide a mount design flow for vehicle engineering.

PURPOE: To report objective change in accommodation in a child with Adie yndrome.

METHOD: A child aged 2 year 10 month when initially examined wa found to have good viual acuity in both eye, a low degree of hypermetropia (iometropic), and Adie pupil preumed to be caued by chicken pox that had occurred 2 month earlier. Amblyopia developed but reponded well to treatment, which involved correction of the refractive error and occluion therapy. Objective change in the refraction of the eye were meaured on the Canon R1 autorefractor at 3.8 m and 33 cm.

REULT: The degree of accommodation in the affected eye when both eye were open wa markedly reduced.

CONCLUION: The preence of iometropic hypermetropia, which remain uncorrected when Adie yndrome i preent, can lead to the development of amblyopia in a child

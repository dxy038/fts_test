The study on body image has been grown over the recent few decades. Previous
studies have investigated body image effects on psycho-social functions.
Based on this, the objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship
among body image, adjustment and academic achievement of students.
The research sample included 400 high school male and female students who
were selected by cluster sampling. The required data was gathered using Physical
Self-Description Questionnaire and Bell Adjustment Inventory. Also, the
mean scores of students were used as an indicator of academic achievement.
The data were analysed by descriptive and inferential statistics indicators. Results
indicated that there is significant relationship between body image and
adjustment, whereas there was not any significant relationship between body
image and academic achievement. Also, the results showed that there is a significant
difference in body image of male and female students. However, there
was not any significant difference in adjustment of both male and female students.
In general, findings demonstrated that positive body image increases
adjustment and better adjustment with situation influences considerably the
adolescentsâ€™ academic achievement.

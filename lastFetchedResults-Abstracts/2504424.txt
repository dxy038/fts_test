Background: Although intrauterine insemination (IUI) is one of the most common methods which is used for male factor and unexplained infertility, the relative influence of various semen parameters on the likelihood of a successful outcome is controversial. Several semen parameters have been evaluated as predictors of a successful outcome with intrauterine insemination.
Objective: To evaluate the effects of sperm morphology on the success rate of IUI.
Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study of 200 couples who underwent IUI cycles of ovarian stimulation in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. The patients were chosen in 2 groups, group A: 100 patients with ?20% normal sperm morphology and group B: 100 patients with  > 20% normal sperm morphology (unexplained infertility). The other semen parameters were normal in both groups.
Results: Total clinical pregnancies were 10.5% (pregnancy rate / cycle). There was not any difference between two groups in rate of pregnancy and also pregnancy outcome.
Conclusion: Intrauterine insemination used for treating male factor infertility has not shown excessive advantage when normal sperm morphology in semen analysis is more than 20% in comparison with ? 20%.

Retention of microorganisms in anaerobic digesters by providing an attachment medium can potentially increase their productivity at lower operating temperatures. The objective of this work was to investigate the effectiveness of attached-film bioreactors for psychrophilic anaerobic digestion of dairy manure. Eight digesters were maintained in an environmental chamber, with the temperature varied between 37 and 10°C. Two digesters were packed with limestone gravel, two with pieces cut from non-woven polyester matting, two with a combination of limestone gravel and polyester pieces, and two had no packing. Digester operation was initiated at a temperature of 37°C. After the digesters reached stable operation at the initial temperature, the temperature was lowered slowly to 10°C. The temperature was held at 10°C for 5 weeks after stabilizing. The polyester medium with its high porosity and surface to volume ratio had the best overall performance for methane productivity at both 37 and 10°C. The biogas production (ml/d) and methane production (ml/d) were significantly higher for the polyester medium when compared to the limestone and combination media reactors (p < 0.0001 and 0.0002, respectively). At 10°C, the polyester medium reactors performed significantly better than all others for biogas (ml/d) and methane (ml/d) production (p < 0.0001). The polyester medium also yielded the maximum reductions in volatile solids (VS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) at 37°C.

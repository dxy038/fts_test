Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate a protocol for the management of long-standing unexplained infertility. Study Design: A prospective study was conducted at an in vitro fertilizationâ€“embryo transfer center with 485 patients with the diagnosis of long-standing unexplained infertility. Patients were treated by means of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination for a maximum of 3 cycles. Those who did not become pregnant underwent in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection on sibling oocytes. Results: Among 485 patients, 921 cycles of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination were performed. The pregnancy rate was 15.7% per cycle and 29.8% per patient. Among those who did not become pregnant, 131 patients underwent in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection into sibling oocytes; 48 women became pregnant (36.7%). There was total failure of the in vitro fertilization oocytes in 23 cycles (17.6%). Conclusion: Management of long-standing unexplained infertility with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination resulted in a reasonable pregnancy rate. Treatment by means of in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection into sibling oocytes among patients who did not become pregnant resulted in a good pregnancy rate. The overall results showed that the proposed protocol for management of unexplained infertility is satisfactory. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:371-5.)

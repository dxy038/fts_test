Objective
to this study, the widely used tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell lines could only initiate tumours in immunodeficient mice, which greatly delayed studies on immune function during carcinogenesis. This study established a new tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line named ‘RSCC-1’, which can initiate tumours in both immunocompetent rabbits and immunodeficient nude mice and has high metastatic ability.

y tongue cancer was induced by DMBA and local mechanical stimulation in New Zealand White rabbits. The induced cancer was serially transplanted into homogeneous rabbits to establish transplanted models. At the same time, cancer samples were collected, cultured and passaged in vitro. Finally, a cell line named ‘RSCC-1’ was established. Its growth behaviour, cell cycle distribution and tumourigenicity in rabbits and nude mice were investigated.
s
 cells were cultured continuously in vitro for 19 months (165 passages). They contain between 54 and 196 chromosomes, with a modal number of 75. Tumourigenicity rates were 100% in both homogeneous rabbits and nude mice, with 20% lung metastasis and 50% cervical lymph node metastasis in homogeneous rabbits.
sion
 is a poorly differentiated, highly malignant rabbit tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line. Its behaviour in the inoculated animal model closely resembles human tongue cancer, and could metastasise to local lymph nodes and remote organs.

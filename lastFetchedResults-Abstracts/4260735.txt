Fast deploying and networking in a disaster area are of great importance. Firstly, we propose an architecture of Emergency Medical Networks in this paper. The objective of this study is to achieve the optimality of heterogeneous sensor nodes assignment in this network. To obtain the needed coverage, network designers initially need to determine how many sensor nodes should be deployed in the disaster area. In consideration of finite energy and sensing ranges in both sensors nodes and sink nodes, we apply the coverage process theory into the assignment of wireless sensor networks to improve the coverage ratio during a given time period. Further, the simulation data show that the reasonable assignment could get the precise estimation of the coverage ratio, which reflects the validity of this assignment. The optimality design provides helpful configuration guidelines for the practical Emergency Medical Networks deployment.

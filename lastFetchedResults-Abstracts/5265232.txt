This paper presents the validation of autopilot design for bank-to-turn (BTT) missiles with observer-based nonlinear model predictive tracking control (NMPTC) algorithms. The main control objective is accurate tracking of guidance commands. The performance of conventional NMPTC significantly degrades when measured feedback state is polluted by process and measurement noise. In order to avoid this performance degeneration, Kalman filtering technique is augmented to NMPTC framework. The proposed scheme is validated by numerical simulations.

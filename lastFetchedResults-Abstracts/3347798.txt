In this paper, an immune-algorithm-based PARETO optimal control strategy is proposed for multi-objective optimization of the output waveform quality and switching loss of a single-phase inverter. A picture of the relationship between the waveform quality and switching losses in the form of the Pareto frontier is plotted, forming an optimal Pareto optimal solution set in different inductive load. The calculation of the switching loss relies on the following factors: data sheet providing the characteristic parameters of the devices, load current (collector current), the switching gate signal and the DC bus voltage. Finally, the experimental platform based on DSP+FPGA as the core control system is established and adequate experiments are carried out, using the Holzer current sensor to collect the inverter output current signal and the thermistor PT100 to indirectly measure the switching loss of the inverter. Simulation and experimental data show that the method is feasible and effective.

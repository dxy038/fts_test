This paper proposes two reduced switch count AC drive systems. One of the configurations was conceived for drives based on two-phase motors and the other for three-phase motors. The drive system provides both bidirectional power flow and power factor control. The pulsewidth modulation technique and the control strategy for providing unity power factor operation are discussed. Experimental results are presented.

Many industrial problems are concerned with optimization of large and
complex systems involving many criteria. Indeed, optimization problems encountered in
practice are seldom mono-objective. In general, there are many con
icting objectives to
handle. This study introduces a new method for the solution of multi-objective optimization
problems. Multi-objective optimization is utilized to nd the most suitable solution, which
covers the requirements and demands of decision makers. The main goal of the resolution
of a multi-objective problem is to obtain a Pareto optimal set and, consequently, the
Pareto front. This method is based on the Charged System Search (CSS) algorithm,
which is inspired by the Coulomb and Gauss laws of electrostatics in physics. In order
to illustrate the eciency of the proposed method, numerical examples are solved and
results are compared to show the ability of the CSS in nding optimal solutions.

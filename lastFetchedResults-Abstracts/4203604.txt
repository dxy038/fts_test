Electrical discharge method has been used to remove the noxious flue-gas. In removing the flue-gas, it is important to dissociate or ionize the atoms and molecules by the collisions with energetic electrons and it produces the radicals that are used to decompose the pollutants. For that purpose, a bidirectional pulsed voltage is used to produce lots of energetic electrons efficiently and increase the power efficiency. The simulation was performed with changing the pulsewidth and repetition rate under the fixed applied voltage. Also the particle-mesh model coupling the NGP (nearest-grid-point) to FEM (finite element method) was used to simulate the spatio-temporal variation of the electric field for the streamer in discharge tube.

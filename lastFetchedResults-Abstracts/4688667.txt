Several multiscale objective functions for the direct segmentation of tomographic images are presented. Standard methods of signal detection and estimation are used to develop a theoretical performance analysis, which quantitatively predicts the performance at realistic noise levels. The analysis compares the relative merit of multiscale and monoscale segmentation, and shows the impact of the Shepp-Logan skullÂ´s quantization error

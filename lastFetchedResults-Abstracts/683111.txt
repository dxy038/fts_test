Large-eddy simulations (LESs) are applied to the problem of pollution dispersion within the urban canopy layer, specifically street canyons. The objective is to study the turbulence structure and hence the physical dispersion mechanisms of pollutants. LESs are implemented by incorporating the dynamic sub-grid scale stress model into the commercial computational fluids dynamics code CFX. To gain confidence in the approach, simulations are performed for a canyon-like geometry (roof garden) for which experimental measurements were also made. The experimental campaign consisted of using sonic anemometers to measure mean flow and turbulence intensities at a high sample rate of 60 Hz. Good agreement between simulations and experimental data are obtained. Real geometric features, such as non-uniform wall heights, result in a very much three-dimensional flow distribution. Comparisons with the kâ€“  model show that LESs are able to predict more accurately the turbulence statistics of the flow.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of cigarette filters on the chemical composition and toxicity of cigarette mainstream smoke. In this work, we used three types of cigarettes, including non-filter 2R4F cigarettes, cellulose acetate (CA)-filter 2R4F cigarettes, and carbon dual-filter 2R4F cigarettes. The cytotoxicity of TPM obtained from the filter cigarettes was not different from that of the non-filter cigarettes on an equal TPM basis. However, the EC50 vlaue of GVP from carbon-filter cigarettes were 40.9 puffs/L, thereby indicating the cytotoxicity of these cigarettes was approximately 37% and 21% lower than non-filter and CA-filter cigarettes, respectively. The cytotoxicity of GVP was correlated with carbonyl components. The mutagenicity of TPM obtained from non-filter cigarettes, calculated on an equal TPM basis, was up to 30â€“40% lower than that of the filter cigarettes. When calculated on a per cigarette basis, the mutagenicity of CA or carbon-filter cigarettes was found to be 35% lower than that of the non-filter cigarettes. The results of chemical composition analyses revealed that the observed increase in aromatic amine compound yields on an equal TPM basis in filter cigarettes may be related with the mutagenic activity determined in Ames assays.

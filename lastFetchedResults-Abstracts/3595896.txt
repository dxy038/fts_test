Proxy hit ratios tend to decrease as the demand and supply of Web contents are becoming more diverse. By case studies, we quantitatively confirm this trend and observe significant document duplications among a proxy and its client browsers´ caches. One reason behind this trend is that the client/server Web caching model does not support direct resource sharing among clients, causing the Web contents and the network bandwidths among clients to be relatively underutilized. To address these limits and improve Web caching performance, we have extensively enhanced and deployed our browsers-aware framework, a peer-to-peer Web caching management scheme. We make the browsers and their proxy share the contents to exploit the neglected but rich data locality in browsers and reduce document duplications among the proxy and browsers´ caches to effectively utilize the Web contents and network bandwidth among clients. The objective of our scheme is to improve the scalability of proxy-based caching both in the number of connected clients and in the diversity of Web documents. We show that building such a caching system with considerations of sharing contents among clients, minimizing document duplications, and achieving data integrity and communication anonymity is not only feasible but also highly effective.

The objective of this study was to develop a treatment system that can effectively reduce the concentration of pollutants in tannery wastewater to environmentally acceptable levels and that can greatly reduce the cost of discharging the effluents. Aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride were used as a coagulant in the process. The influence of pH and coagulant dosages on the coagulation process was studied and conditions were optimised corresponding to the best removal of organic matters, suspended solids as well as chromium. The COD and chromium were removed mainly through coagulation: 38–46% removal of suspended solids, 30–37% removal of total COD from settled tannery wastewaters and 74–99% removal of chromium at an initial concentration of 12 mg/l can be achieved by using the optimum coagulant dosage (800 mg/l) in the optimum pH range (around 7.5). Ferric chloride produced better results than aluminium sulphate. The initial chromium concentrations and pH values of the wastewater had a great effect on chromium removal efficiency. Low chromium concentrations and high pH produced a more effective result on chromium removal than high chromium concentrations and low pH. Higher dosages did not significantly increase pollutant removal and were not economical. Coagulation combined with centrifugation improved the removal efficiency of suspended solids (70%). A high degree of clarification is attained as indicated by an excess of 85–86% colour removal. The results provide useful information for tannery wastewater treatment.

Evaluation of the quality of image compression still remains an important issue. In this work, we propose the new objective measurements, which are developed from five traditionally simple measurements (Mean Square Error, Edge Measurement, Correlation Measurement, Visual Human System and Spectral Measurement). In our study, we evaluated the quality of the compressed gray-scale images using both objective and subjective tests. We found the relationship between objective and subjective measurements from the distribution data that can be modeled and defined by exponential least square method. From the experimental results, the reliabilities (Correlation coefficient) of our new proposed measurements are better than five traditionally simple measurements.

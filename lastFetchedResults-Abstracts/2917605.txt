Radar scattering from the sea surface at low grazing angles remains a poorly modelled phenomenon, despite extensive experimental and theoretical work. It is the objective of the work described to provide an additional domain to the measurement set and thereby constrain the range of physical explanations. Bistatic sea clutter measurements have been undertaken to provide insight into the EM scattering phenomenon at low grazing angles. Initial results show that simple multi-scatterer models and the composite model fail to explain the spikes observed at horizontal polarisation

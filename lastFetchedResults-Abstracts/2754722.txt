Network function virtualization is regarded as a promising candidate for future networks. Although many advantages are expected, there is still a lack of services that directly link to increased revenue for telecom operators. Therefore, we propose a new NFV-based service, virtual network integration as a service (VNIaaS). The service allows enterprise network administrators to construct and monitor virtual enterprise networks as necessary. As a key enabler, we further propose vConductor, an innovative technology due to its automatic network provisioning, multi-objective resource scheduling, and NFV-oriented inventory management characteristics. Finally, we show the feasibility through implementation of a prototype system. We believe that this contribution will be a catalyst to accelerate the industrialization of NFV.

The increasing demand for water in developed regions has led to numerous water supply challenges. Given their sensitivity and strategic importance as zones of cargo and passenger transfer, international airports are no exception to this general rule. The potential dangers to ground subsidence on the runway as a result of excessive groundwater withdrawal warrant plans aimed at developing models for optimal groundwater withdrawal as a measure of sustainable use of aquifers. In this study, consumption and withdrawal data are used and future development plans of the Imam Khomeini International Airport are considered to develop a model for groundwater use within the region based on multi-objective programming. Considering the objectives of maximizing water supply and minimizing costs of water transmission to demand zones, the model was used to develop an optimal water allocation system for the region containing monthly groundwater withdrawal policies and graphical distribution plans. The results show that the operation instructions thus developed for each well need to be carefully executed in order to ensure its safe exploitation. Strict adherence to the instructions is expected to enhance water supply reliability and to reduce the associated costs. This approach can be tailored and scaled up for future planning horizons and is also replicable in other areas by developing the relevant objective functions and constraints.

Introduction & Objective: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease, which seems to be caused by genetic and immunological factors. Several studies have shown that some hormones so such as prolactin have important role in the development of this disease. In this study, the se-rum levels of prolactin have been were measured in patients with psoriasis and compared with healthy peoples.
Materials & Methods: In this case –control study, we evaluated 24 ages and sex matched pa-tients with psoriasis referring to the department of dermatology of Farshchian hospital in Hamadan during one year (Apr.2013-May.2014) and compared them with healthy individuals. A PASI criterion was used to measure the severity of the disease. In the both groups, serum levels of prolactin and TSH (to discover hypothyroidism and due to hyperprolactinemia) were measured using ELISA method.
Results: Serum levels of prolactin in the patients and healthy peoples were 12.8±9.1 and 8.9±3.6 ng/ml, respectively. In evaluating prolactin the differences between  the patients and healthy peoples were significant (P=0.04).
Conclusion: These results indicate that serum PRL levels may serve as a biological marker of psoriatic disease activity.

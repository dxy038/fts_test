A bidirectional nonreciprocal wavelength-interleaving filter based on an optically coherent high birefringence fiber transversal filter structure is demonstrated. Stable, low loss, low dispersion, and high isolation operation is demonstrated with reconfigurable transfer characteristics for interleaved channel spacing of 0.8 nm.

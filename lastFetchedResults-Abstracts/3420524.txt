In the above-mentioned paper, Wei and Fahn proposed a neural architecture, the multisynapse neural network, to solve constrained optimization problems including high-order, logarithmic, and sinusoidal forms, etc. As one of its main applications, a fuzzy bidirectional associative clustering network (FBACN) was proposed for fuzzy-partition clustering according to the objective-functional method. The connection between the objective-functional-based fuzzy c-partition algorithms and FBACN is the Lagrange multiplier approach. Unfortunately, the Lagrange multiplier approach was incorrectly applied so that FBACN does not equivalently minimize its corresponding constrained objective-function. Additionally, Wei and Fahn adopted traditional definition of fuzzy c-partition, which is not satisfied by FBACN. Therefore, FBACN can not solve constrained optimization problems, either.

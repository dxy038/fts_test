Introduction: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a disorder, which is characterized by ulcers restricted to oral mucousa. Regarding the inspection of histological similarities between peptic ulcers and recurrent oral aphthous and the response of RAS to the broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment such as tetracycline and the identified role of H.pylori in peptic ulcers, the possibility of bacterial involvement in the progression of oral aphtous ulcers has been suggested. Hence, there are limited evidence available for colonization of H. pylori and its probable role in induction of oral aphthouse ulcers.
Objective: We aimed to distinguish the probable presence of H.pylori in brushed sample of oral aphthous ulcers by PCR method.
Materials and Methods: In this study, we sampled the oral aphtous ulcers with the toothbrush in patients with RAS. PCR which is a very precise and sensitive technique for isolation of H. pylori in ulcer samples of recurrent aphthous stomatitis and in samples from other parts of the oral cavity. Serologic tests such as ELISA were also done in all patients for determination of IgG antibody. Both PCR and ELISA were done in all patients. Evaluated patients were people presenting to the laboratory with the diagnosis of RAS, from the beginning of 2001 till the end of 2002.
Results: Study patients were between 18 to 60 years old and the average age among them was 32/38 Â± 11130.
26 patients (52%) had positive ELISA test and we obtained H.pylori DNA in one patient (2%) in a total of 50 evaluated patients.
Conclusion: According to the results of this study, H. Pylori DNA can't be found in aphthous ulcers of these patients, even in those with positive anti H. Pylori, anti body (IgG) results. And it is probable that these bacteria aren't involved in oral recurrent aphthous ulcers.

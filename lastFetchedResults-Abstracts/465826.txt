Objective:
We undertook this investigation to explore the effects of ethanol exposure on nitric oxide synthase levels and nitric oxide release. Our hypothesis was that ethanol exposure modifies nitric oxide activity within the placenta as a result of oxidative stress.
Study Design:
Four 10-g samples of term normal human placental villous tissue were perifused with nonrecirculating Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 25-mmoVL N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N â€²-[2-ethane-sulfonic acid] with 0-, 50-, 100-, or 200-mmol/L ethanol. After 2 hours of exposure, tissue was removed, fixed, and frozen for analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for subtype I or neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), subtype II or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and subtype III or endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) localization. Western blot analysis was performed for eNOS quantitation. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase levels were measured by electroimmunoassay and kinetic assay, respectively. Nitric oxide release was analyzed by a Sievers nitric oxide analyzer.
Results:
Immunohistochemical examination confirmed that only eNOS was localized to the syncytiotrophoblasts. After ethanol exposure, eNOS protein expression increased 2.5- to 3.0-fold over that of the control. Tissue cyclic guanosine monophosphate content and nitric oxide release into the effluent were decreased, whereas superoxide dismutase levels were increased at higher ethanol levels (P < .05).
Conclusions:
Ethanol exposure appears to induce oxidative stress, which may account for the decreased nitric oxide release, because nitric oxide may be shunted toward scavenging free radicals. Increased eNOS protein expression may be a response to the increased demand for nitric oxide. Decreased nitric oxide availability could adversely affect placental blood flow regulation, which could, in turn, account for the growth restriction seen in ethanol-exposed fetuses.

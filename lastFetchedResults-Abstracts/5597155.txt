In this work, we study the data symbol synchronizers of open loop. The recovered clock of this synchronizers hasnpsilat the capacity to follow the input changes. However, its simplicity allows operation at high data rates. We present four synchronizer types namely the tank circuit, the SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave) circuit, the monostable circuit and the astable circuit. The objective is to study the four synchronizers and to evaluate their output jitter UI-RMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Squared) versus input SNR (Signal - Noise Ratio).

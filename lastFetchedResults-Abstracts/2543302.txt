Groynes are one of the most prominent structures that used in shore protection to control the littoral sediment transportation. This structure can be used submerged and provide the necessary beach protection without negative aesthetic impact. Although, submerged structures adopt for beach protection, the shoreline response to these structures is not well understood at present. The objective of this study is to predict sediment transport in the vicinity of submerged groyne and comparison with nonsubmerged groyne with focus on a part of the coast at Dahane SAR Sefidrood, Guilan Province, Iran where serious coast erosion has occurred. The simulations were obtained using a oneline model, in this paper, a linear model is presented to estimate, shoreline deformation in the presence of these structures. The result of the present study show that using submerged groyne can have a good efficiency to control the sediment and beach erosion without causing severe environmental impact to the coast. The important outcome from this study may be employed in optimum design of groyne systems in marine projects.

The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between cadmium (Cd) intake and cadmium toxicity indicators by meta-analysis of literature data, in particular β2-microglobulin (β2MC), and to compare the results with the current Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) set by FAO/WHO. The literature survey identified 79 feeding trials involving 27,537 people that were suitable for extraction of cadmium intake, levels in blood and urine and β2-microglobulin in urine. There was an exponential increase in β2-microglobulin with increases in cadmium intake above 302 μg/day, which corresponds to a PTWI of 3.02 μg/kg of body weight, when a safety margin of 10 is included. This compares with the current level set by FAO/WHO of 7 μg/kg of body weight. Cadmium in blood and urine were also positively related to cadmium intake and participants’ age. There were two principal components of variation in the data set, first: cadmium intake, concentrations of cadmium in blood, urine and β2-microglobulin in urine, and second: duration and age of exposure.

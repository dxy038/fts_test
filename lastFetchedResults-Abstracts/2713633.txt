This paper deals with subsynchronous resonance (SSR) phenomena in a capacitive series-compensated DFIG-based wind farm. Using both modal analysis and time-domain simulation, it is shown that the DFIG wind farm is potentially unstable due to the SSR mode. In order to damp the SSR, the rotor-side converter (RSC) and grid-side converter (GSC) controllers of the DFIG are utilized. The objective is to design a simple proportional SSR damping controller (SSRDC) by properly choosing an optimum input control signal (ICS) to the SSRDC block, so that the SSR mode becomes stable without decreasing or destabilizing the other system modes. Moreover, an optimum point within the RSC and GSC controllers to insert the SSRDC is identified. Three different signals are tested as potential ICSs including rotor speed, line real power, and voltage across the series capacitor, and an optimum ICS is identified using residue-based analysis and root-locus method. Moreover, two methods are discussed in order to estimate the optimum ICS, without measuring it directly. The studied power system is a <inline-formula> <img alt="math\\bf{100;{\\rm MW}}" src="/images/tex/26012.gif"/> </inline-formula> DFIG-based wind farm connected to a series-compensated line whose parameters are taken from the IEEE first benchmark model (FBM) for computer simulation of the SSR. MATLAB/Simulink is used as a tool for modeling and designing the SSRDC, and power system computer aided design/electromagnetic transients including dc (PSCAD/EMTDC) is used to perform time-domain simulation for design process validation.

Receptor tyrosine kinases of the Eph family bind to cell surface-associated ephrin ligands on neighboring cells. The ensuing bidirectional signals have emerged as a major form of contact-dependent communication between cells. New findings reveal that Eph receptors and ephrins coordinate not only developmental processes but also the normal physiology and homeostasis of many adult organs. Imbalance of Eph/ephrin function may therefore contribute to a variety of diseases. The challenge now is to better understand the complex and seemingly paradoxical signaling mechanisms of Eph receptors and ephrins, which will enable effective strategies to target these proteins in the treatment of diseases such as diabetes and cancer.

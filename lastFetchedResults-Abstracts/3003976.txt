The objective is to design a computer-based software for hearing impaired childrenÂ´s speech training and learning. To use a visual assistant method for training and developing the speech ability of hearing impaired children, we used the technique of dynamic computer graphics to establish an animation display system. The system can display the dynamic relations among the basic elements of the articulators. The position and the change of nose chamber, mouth chamber, tongue, and lips during speech will be shown from different profiles. This makes sure that the subject with hearing impaired children can catch the accurate speech technique. In the future, we will use the network tuition model to assist special education teachers in their teaching methods. Using such an assistant system, we are sure of achieving improvement of the efficiency and efficacy for developing the language and speech ability of hearing impaired children.

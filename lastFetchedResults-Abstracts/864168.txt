Metallothionein (MT) is a low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich, metalbinding protein found in all vertebrates. The primary structure of the protein is evolutionary conserved, especially the location of cysteine-residues. There are nonetheless significant differences between MTs from different vertebrate classes, notably in major antigenic epitopes. Previous work has shown that MT from different fish species also differ. The objective of the present work was to characterize MT from temperate, sub-tropical and tropical fish species by their relative reactivities with two anti-fish MT antisera. One or both antisera cross-reacted with MT from all fish species investigated. Surprisingly, the relative reactivities of the two antisera with MT from species belonging to different taxonomic groups appeared to reflect differences at the level of family rather than differences between major phylogenetic lineages.

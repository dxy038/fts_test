Two major additions to the GQM (Goals/Questions/Metrics) method are presented based on seven years of experience with goal-oriented measurement programmes. GQM, is a method to organize software measurement programmes. Since the initial ideas of GQM were first published, much industrial experience has been gained and theory has been developed to underpin the approach. Two additions concern a thorough elaboration of the feedback of measurement data and a conjoined cost/benefit analysis of the GQM project. The first addition refers to establishing conditions that are necessary to facilitate learning in software measurement programmes. Learning about software quality is identified as the most important objective of a measurement programme. The second addition refers to identifying whether the measurement programme was actually worthwhile. Through a cost/benefit analysis, the software measurement activity is brought in perspective with other business objectives. Case study research illustrates the importance of both additions. In the past seven years, we have been involved in 15 measurement programmes in five industrial organizations. Successes and failures in these organizations support the importance of both additions. The two additions (feedback sessions and cost/benefit analyses) are described in detail

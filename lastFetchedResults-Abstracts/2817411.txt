Presented paper focuses on the area of analysis and classification of textual documents. We present the classification of documents based on boosting method applied on the decision tree algorithm. Main objective of the paper is to present the implementation of distributed boosting algorithm based on Map Reduce paradigm. We have used the GridGain framework as a platform for distributed data processing and have tested the implemented solution on two different dataset within our testing environment.

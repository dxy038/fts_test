In this paper, measures of performance (MOP´s) are discussed with which the effectiveness of sensor fusion can be assessed. A series of objective measures are outlined to characterize effectiveness of the detection, tracking and classification processes. The applicability of several MOP´s is demonstrated for an example in which radar and camera data are combined, showing the benefit of sensor fusion.

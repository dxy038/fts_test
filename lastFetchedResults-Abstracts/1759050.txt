Objective
rease adult caregiver Tdap vaccination rates by offering Tdap vaccine during infant well-child visits.
s
eloped a pilot vaccine initiative wherein pediatricians offered Tdap vaccine to mothers and non-mother caregivers attending the 2-week well-child visit at a hospital-based clinic serving predominantly low-income families. We evaluated this initiative by asking mothers and caregivers to participate in a survey after the 2-week visit to determine self-reported Tdap vaccination status, demographics, and the source of their adult primary care.
s
y (69%) participants received the Tdap vaccine during the newborns’ 2-week well-child visit. Forty-six percent of the infants’ 152 adult household contacts were vaccinated through this initiative. Of those mothers and caregivers, more caregivers reported not having insurance (38% vs 15%, P &lt; .001), and no routine medical care (23% vs 8%, P = .007).
sions
h this pilot initiative, we vaccinated 69% of mothers and non-mother caregivers presenting to the 2-week well-child visit. A large proportion of caregivers did not receive routine medical care or have insurance, which suggests that they otherwise may have poor access to the vaccine. Tdap vaccination in the pediatric office represents a substantial opportunity to increase vaccination rates.

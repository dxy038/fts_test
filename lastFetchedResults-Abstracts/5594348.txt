Arrangement of sorting sequence is an important part for formulation of stage plan on marshalling station. In this paper, we establish a model to minimize the waiting time of wagon as objective function ,and we present simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the problem of sorting sequence, through searching feasible solution in solution space, for each initial solution, we use distribution car flow algorithm pretreatment and calculate the fitness value, then according to the size of fitness value, we estimate the merits of sorting sequence, in light of the actual situation we describe implementation of the correlation method of simulated annealing algorithm. When applied to the computational experiments, the results indicate this method is feasible and effective.

Magnetic resonant coupling between two coils allows effective wireless transfer of power over distances in the range of tens of centimetres to a few metres. The resonant magnetic field also extends to the surroundings of the power transfer system. When a person is exposed to this magnetic field, electric fields are induced in the body. It is necessary to evaluate whether these fields satisfy the human exposure limits specified in international guidelines and standards. The objective of this work is to investigate the effectiveness of the quasistatic approximation for modelling human exposure to the magnetic fields of wireless power transfer systems. When valid, this approximation can greatly reduce the computational resources needed for the assessment of human exposure.

This paper describes the development of a static starting device for a gas turbine. The static starting device is a load commutated inverter (LCI), and also called static frequency converter (SFC). The main objective of this study is to miniaturize the dimensions of the converter structure. For this purpose, electrical ratings, mechanical structures, and several other elements were changed. With these changes, the developed device improved with respect to size, installation, and efficiency. Further, this paper describes the newly developed functions of the static starting device.

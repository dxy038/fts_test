Primary nasopharyngeal tuberculosis (TB) without pulmonary
                            involvement is rare, even in endemic areas. Herein, we present a rare
                            complication of primary nasopharyngeal TB accompanied with tuberculous
                            otomastoiditis (TOM) and ipsilateral facial nerve palsy, in a
                            24-year-old female patient, with computed tomography and magnetic
                            resonance imagery findings.

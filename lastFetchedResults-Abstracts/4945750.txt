In real-life, many practical applications involve agents that are nonlinear and nonholonomic. This paper investigates output synchronization of multiple mobile agents in a plane. The output synchronization of mobile agentÂ´s aims are two aspects: making the speed of each agent synchronized and tracking desired trajectories in a group. First, each agent dynamics is described by an affine control system and the communication topology among the agents is represented by a digraph. Using adjacent information and incidence matrix, a decentralized control law is acquired, which is composed of alignment control and cohesion control. Second, the stability of the group is proved by the decentralized control law and the synchronization control objective is realized. Finally, ten mobile agents are simulated to show the effectiveness of the present control law.

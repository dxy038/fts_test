We consider an investor whose wealth is determined by a single stock modeled by a geometric Brownian motion. The investor can consume part of his wealth at any time, but must pay both fixed and proportional transaction costs. The objective of the investor is to maximize expected utility from consumption. We solve this problem explicitly by applying the theory of stochastic impulse controls

This second part of a two-part study explores the performance of a new cooling scheme in which the primary working fluid flowing through a micro-channel heat sink is indirectly cooled by a refrigeration cooling system. The objective of this part of study is to explore the pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics of the heat sink. During single-phase cooling, pressure drop decreased with increasing heat flux because of decreased liquid viscosity. However, pressure drop began increasing with increasing heat flux following bubble departure. These opposite trends produced a minimum in the variation of pressure drop with heat flux. Increasing liquid subcooling decreased two-phase pressure drop because of decreased void fraction caused by strong condensation at bubble interfaces as well as decreased likelihood of bubble coalescence. It is shown macro-channel subcooled boiling pressure drop and heat transfer correlations are unsuitable for micro-channel flows. However, two new modified correlations produced good predictions of the present heat transfer data.

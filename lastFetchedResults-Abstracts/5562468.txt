Resources are scarce in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and one of the challenges is to design a lightweight communication protocol to support efficient and uniform power consumption among nodes. In this paper, we propose an energy aware routing scheme based on a cross-layer approach for WSNs with the objective to minimize the overall consumed energy; thus, maximizing the network lifetime. The remaining battery reserve capacity, link quality and transmission power for nodes within the local communication range are taken into consideration to determine the next hop relay node to reach the network sink. Parameters from different stack layers (i.e., physical, MAC, and network) are presented to a fuzzy logic system controller which makes a next hop routing decision. The performance of the proposed cross-layer algorithm is evaluated using discrete event simulation (OMNET++ Modeler).

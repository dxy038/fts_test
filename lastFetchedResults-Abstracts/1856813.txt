Background: An excessive level of heavy metals is one of the most common environmental pollutants that damage human health. Electrocoagulation (EC) is an electrochemical technique with different applications that has been used for lead removal from wastewater. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine efficiency of electrocoagulation process for lead removal from wastewater. 
Methods: This laboratory study was performed in School of Public Health affiliated to Qazvin University of Medical Sciences during 2013. A laboratory batch electrocoagulation reactor was designed and constructed from Perspex with dimensions of 17 cm* 12 cm* 40 cm and was applied for coagulation and flotation. The aluminium electrodes were connected in a bipolar configuration. Electrolysis was performed for 30 min in each run. Samples were taken every 5 minutes and parameters such as current density, electrolysis time, pH and different concentrations of lead were measured. The lead concentration was 5, 10 and 15 mg/l, and the pH was ranged from 5 to 9.
Findings: The removal efficiency was found to be dependent on the pH, initial concentration, current density, and electrolysis time. The removal efficiency was decreased with increased initial concentration while it was increased with increase in electrolysis time and current density. The removal efficiency of 94% was achieved for the current density of 33 A/m2, pH of 7, and electrolysis time of 30 min, respectively.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, the electrocoagulation process is an effective method for lead removal from wastewater.

Almost concurrent with the dilution of the concept, function and structure of urban areas in Iran, the theories and experiences of urban planning in the West have provided new insight into the urban development based on the concept of theneighborhood. One of such concepts is the quality of urban life which has substantially expanded in the developed and industrialized cities and countriessince the 1970s. This study, using both objective and subjective approaches, attempts to compare the quality of life in Saber andKosar neighborhoods in Mashhad. A descriptive - analytic study based on a questionnaire was used and the results were analyzed using multivariate regression methods. The results suggested that the physical indicatorsin each neighborhood had the greatestcausal influence. Saber and Kosar neighborhoods with a score of 2.93 and 3.24 enjoyed an average quality of life and a relatively highsatisfaction of their residents respectively. Despite having an average life quality, Kosar neighborhoodenjoyed higher satisfaction compared to the Saber neighborhood, and there was a significant relationship between economic indicators and life quality in both neighborhoods. Finally, some recommendations for improving the quality of life in each of the studied neighborhoods were presented.

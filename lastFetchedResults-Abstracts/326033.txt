Background: Numerous medications have been tested in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and/or schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). Although many of the medications tested have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear main treatment for BPD has emerged. Despite the efficacy of some of the medicines, acceptability and side effects have proven to be barriers to the use of medication. Therefore, an open-label olanzapine trial utilizing objective ratings was performed.
Methods: Patients suffering from BPD and dysthymia were included in an 8-week, open-label study of olanzapine monotherapy. The first 4 weeks of the trial allowed for flexible dosing; during the last 4 weeks, olanzapine dose was held constant. Patients were rated on Hopkins Symptoms Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Global Assessment of Function (GAF), Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS 11), and Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI).
Results: Eleven patients completed at least 2 weeks; nine of the patients finished the entire trial. There was a robust and statistically significant reduction in the five global ratings. Within the global ratings, symptoms of psychoticism, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and anger were among the symptoms to be reduced. No movement disorder symptoms were noted for any of the patients.
Conclusions: In this open-label pilot study, patients treated with olanzapine showed statistically significant reduction in self-rated and clinician-rated scales. Symptoms associated with BPD and dysthymia were among those to be substantially reduced. Further studies to explore olanzapineâ€™s efficacy versus placebo, as well as comparison to other potential treatments for BPD, are important next steps.

This letter presents a simultaneous band selection and endmember detection algorithm for hyperspectral imagery. This algorithm is an extension of the sparsity promoting iterated constrained endmember (SPICE) algorithm. The extension adds spectral band weights and a sparsity promoting prior to the SPICE objective function to provide integrated band selection. In addition to solving for endmembers, the number of endmembers, and end- member fractional maps, this algorithm attempts to autonomously perform band selection and to determine the number of spectral bands required for a particular scene. Results are presented on a simulated data set and the AVIRIS Indian Pines data set. Experiments on the simulated data set show the ability to find the correct endmembers and abundance values. Experiments on the Indian Pines data set show strong classification accuracies in comparison to previously published results.

The World Wide Web (WWW) provides new opportunities for distance education over the Internet. The Web, when combined with other network tools, can be used to create a virtual classroom to bring together a community of learners for interactive education. In this paper we discuss moving some of educational instructions of the Institute of Science Dokuz Eyliri University to the WWW. This objective is achieved by investigating the use of emerging network technologies for training full-time students and part-time students. This research focuses on developing a virtual classroom on the Web, using recent development tools.

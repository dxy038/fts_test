This paper derives a non linear optimal inventory policy involving instant
deterioration of perishable items with allowing price discounts. This
paper postulates that the inventory policy of perishable items very much
resembles that of price discounts. Such a parallel policy suggests that
improvements to production systems may be achievable by applying
price discounts to increase demand rate of the perishable items. This
paper shows how discounted approach reduces to perfect results, and
how the post deteriorated discounted EOQ model is a generalization of
optimization. The objective of this paper is to determine the optimal price
discount, the cycle length and the replenishment quantity so that the net
profit is maximized. The numerical analyses show that an appropriate
discounted pricing policy can benefit the retailer and that discounted
pricing policy is important, especially for deteriorating items.
Furthermore the instant post deteriorated price discount crisp economic
order quantity (CEOQ) model is shown to be superior in terms of profit
maximization. The sensitivity   analysis of parameters on the optimal
solution is carried out.

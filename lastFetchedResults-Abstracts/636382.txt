Simultaneously testing a family of n null hypotheses can arise in many applications.A common problem in
multiple hypothesis testing is to control Type-I error. The probability of at least one false rejection referred
to as the familywise error rate (FWER) is one of the earliest error rate measures. Many FWER-controlling
procedures have been proposed. The ability to control the FWER and achieve higher power is often
used to evaluate the performance of a controlling procedure. However, when testing multiple hypotheses,
FWER and power are not sufficient for evaluating controlling procedure’s performance. Furthermore, the
performance of a controlling procedure is also governed by experimental parameters such as the number of
hypotheses, sample size, the number of true null hypotheses and data structure. This paper evaluates, under
various experimental settings, the performance of some FWER-controlling procedures in terms of five
indices, the FWER, the false discovery rate, the false non-discovery rate, the sensitivity and the specificity.
The results can provide guidance on how to select an appropriate FWER-controlling procedure to meet a
study’s objective

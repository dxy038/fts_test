This study is done in library method in collecting data and documentary method in expressing the attitudes and
content analysis method in analyzing data and comparative study among the attitudes of interpreters, narrators
and other religious scholars (Shiite and Sunni) aiming to represent an appropriate concept of hadith and the
effort to achieve a consummate conclusion, in that the true concept of the terms tradition, norm, famous and
high places are explained. 1) tradition means famous, goodness and beneficence in various cases. 2) the terms
tradition and high places have been explained in the verses 46 and 48 of Sura Arraf meaning a high place in
which it comprised of the following cases: sandy mounds located between paradise and hell, cited by Ibn-
Abbas, a heightened and lofty place, 3) in some hadiths, the term "high place" means "horse's crest" and or
"peak as that of a rooster", or "a snake's wool" or "peacock's peak" and or "Hyena's hair". 4) The term high
places has been applied in two mentioned meanings in the interpretations or the verses of 46 and 48 in Sura
Araaf in various instances instead of subjective noun (mystics) and objective noun (famous people and
recognized ones) or probably in more than one meaning. 5). The term "common" has been used in various
instances instead of a recognized and common matter. Therefore, the term "tradition" has not been applied in
hadith meaning common speech or behavior. Henceforth, the attribution of this hadith for confirming the
evidence of tradition in its literal meaning- which includes speech, behavior and quitting the issues that are
known into human minds and are inserted into the hearts and its practical process is based on the continuation of
that action-is not correct in the science and bases of jurisprudence.

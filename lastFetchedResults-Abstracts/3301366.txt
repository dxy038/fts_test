Objective: To discuss traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) causes, pathogenesis and distribution of syndromes of primary dysmenorrhea (PD) through questionnaire investigation among female college students. Methods: The ordinary times status, menstrual period conditions and distribution of TCM syndromes of the female college students with PD were surveyed and analyzed by descriptive statistics. Results: Of all the 58 female college students with PD who finished this investigation, at ordinary times, 62.07% averted to cold, 48.28% had cold limbs, 70.69% preferred warm food and drinks and 93.10% did physical activities less than 3 times a week.

The Syndrome score of pattern of stagnation of cold-dampness was 10.99&#177;3.62, which was higher than other patterns. Conclusion: This study suggested that for PD, the major TCM cause is cold pathogen and the major TCM pathogenesis is stagnation of cold and dampness in uterus resulting from exterior cold pathogen, and the major TCM syndrome is stagnation of cold-dampness.

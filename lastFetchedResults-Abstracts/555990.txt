Introduction: This study seeks to discuss the light wave transport characteristics variation along the pericardium Meridian under different pressures.

Methods: We selected 36 healthy students at the school for this study, tied up the desktop blood pressure cuff onto subjectsâ€™right proximal arms, fixed the detection probe immovably on the Neiguan (PC6) acupoint and the reference point which was 1cm off the PC6, and collected the light signal along the meridian and non-meridian when the laser irradiate Jianshi(PC5), Ximen(PC4) and the corresponding reference points respectively under pressure of 0, 100, 130 and 160.

Results: The differences in optical transport properties between meridian and nonmeridian were significant: under the same pressures(0s, 100s,130s, and 160mmHg), the relative attenuation rate of optical signal at the same distance between meridian and non-meridian were significant(p < 0.001), the optical signal attenuates slower when it transported along meridians; however, there is no significant difference for the relative attenuation rate of optical signal along meridian or non-meridian under different pressures(p > 0.05). Under four different pressure situations, the optical signal at acupoint(PC5) and non-acupoint(NP) along the meridian were significantly different with the corresponding reference points along the non-meridian(P < 0.001); the optical signal on the meridian is stronger than the non-meridian one; the optical signals are strikingly different at acupoints, non-acupoints, and reference points between and 100, 130, and 160mmHg pressures (P?0.001); however, no difference was found between 100, 130, and 160mmHg pressures.

Conclusion: The optical signal on the meridian is stronger than the non-meridian. The optical signal attenuates slower when it transported along meridians. The human meridians may be the good pathway for light waves with certain wavelengths. That is to say light waves with certain wavelengths can transport and be blocked along meridian direction, when it irritates the meridians, or acupoints after excluding the influence of human anatomy structure, which verified again the objective existence of meridians transporting and the possibility of blocking from the optical view.

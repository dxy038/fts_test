Optimal allocation and sizing of distribution transformers is a common problem in distribution systems planning. This paper presents a novel approach for solving optimal sizing, sitting and determination the service area of MV/LV transformers. Cost of equipment, area, cables in LV side and energy loss of lines and transformers are incorporated in objective function. Uncertainty in loads is modeled using LR fuzzy numbers in load points. A problem specified genetic algorithm with new coding is used for optimization procedure. The success of the developed model is demonstrated through illustrative computer simulations

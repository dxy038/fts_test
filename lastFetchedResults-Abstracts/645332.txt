Improved understanding of coccinellid activity and predation on aphids in the field could clarify their potential in aphid biological control. Our objective was to determine the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on activity and predation by adults of three coccinellid species (Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, H. tredecimpunctata tibialis (Say), and Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer) in spring cereal fields. The proportion of time coccinellids spent searching was correlated with air temperature, aphid density, and time of day. The relationship between searching and these variables differed among species. Mean walking speed ranged from 66.4 cm/min for C. maculata to 83.2 cm/min for H. tredecimpunctata and increased with temperature for all species. The frequency of short flights (<2 m) by beetles increased with temperature and decreased with increasing aphid density for all species, but the relationship of short flight frequency to these variables differed among species. The frequency of long flights (>2 m) was similar for all species and influenced by temperature and calendar date. The frequencies with which aphids were encountered and eaten were correlated with aphid density and temperature for H. convergens and H. tredecimpunctata. Despite over 250 h spent observing adult coccinellid behavior in the field, predation data were insufficient to develop a useful predation model.

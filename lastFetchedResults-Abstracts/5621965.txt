Methods are investigated for the restoration of images degraded by both blur and noise. The objective is to develop estimation strategies to deal with images that exhibit spatially varying statistics. The restoration starts with transforming the image with nonstationary statistics into an image that exhibits stationary characteristics. This transformation can be viewed as a prewhitening filter that normalizes the local mean and local variance of the image, creating a stationary, or near stationary, field. Then the ideal image is estimated from the transformed image on the basis of the linear minimum-mean-square-error criterion. The process removes image blur and noise and at the same time inverts the effects of the transformation

The improvement of design quality is an important issue in project quality management. In this paper, the project life cycle theory is first introduced in design quality management to expand the connotation of design quality. Through questionnaire and expert interview, the design quality indicators based on project life cycle are concluded, which are used in establishing the design quality matrix based on Engineering Breakdown Structure (EBS) -Objective Breakdown Structure (OBS). The framework of project life cycle design is proposed. With the application of concurrent engineering, the interaction of design quality information in project life cycle comes true and the continuous improvement of design quality based on project life cycle can be achieved.

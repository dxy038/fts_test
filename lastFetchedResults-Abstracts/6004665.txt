This paper presents a linear goal programming method to solve thermal power generation and dispatch problems with interval data uncertainty. In the proposed approach, the nonlinear objectives inherently involved to a problem are first transformed into their linear equivalents in the decision situation. Then, target intervals for achieving objectives are defined in power generation planning horizon. In the model formulation, the objectives with target intervals are converted into standard form of goals in goal programming methodology. In goal achievement function, both the modeling aspects of goal programming, minsum and minimax formulations, are addressed for achieving objective values within target intervals specified in the decision environment. To illustrate the potential use of the approach, the model is tested on the standard IEEE 6-Generator 30-Bus System.

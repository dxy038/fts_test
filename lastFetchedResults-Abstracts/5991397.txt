As humanoid robots become more commonplace in our society, it is important to understand the relation between humans and humanoid robots. In human face-to-face interaction, the observation of another individual performing an action facilitates the execution of a similar action, and interferes with the execution of differmi action. This phenomenon has been explained by the existence of shared internal representations for the execution and perception of actions, which would be automatically activated by the perception of another individual??s action. In one interference experiment. null interference was reported when subjects observed a robotic ann perform the incongruent task, suggesting that this effect may be specific to interacting with other humans. This experimental paradigm, designed to investigate motor interference in human interactions, was adapted to investigate how similar the implicit perception of a humanoid robot is to a human agent. Subjects performed rhythmic movements while ohsening either a human agent or humanoid robot performing either congruent or incongruent movements. The variance of the executed movements was used as a measure of the amount of interference in the movements. Both the human and humanoid agents produced significant interference effect. These results suggest that observing the action of humanoid robot and human agent may rely on similar perceptual processes. Furthermore, the ratio of the variance in incongruent to congruent conditions varied between the human agent and humanoid robot. We speculate this ratio describes how the implicit perception of a robot is similar to that of a human, so that this paradigm could provide an objective measure of the reaction to different types of robots and be used to guide the design of humanoid robots interacting with humans.

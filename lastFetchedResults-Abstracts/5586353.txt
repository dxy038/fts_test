Consider a database that represents information about moving objects and their location. For example, for a database representing the location of taxi-cabs a typical query may be: retrieve the free cabs that are currently within 1 mile of 33 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago (to pickup a customer). In the military, moving object database applications arise in the context of the digital battlefield and in the civilian industry they arise in transportation systems. Currently, moving object database applications are being developed in an ad hoc fashion. Database management system (DBMS) technology provides a potential foundation upon which to develop these applications, however DBMSs are currently not used for this purpose. The reason is that there is a critical set of capabilities that are needed by moving object database applications and are lacking in existing DBMSs. The objective of our Databases fOr MovINg Objects (DOMINO) project is to build an envelope containing these capabilities on top of existing DBMSs. We describe the problems and our proposed solutions

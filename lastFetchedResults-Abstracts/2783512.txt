Routing in diffusion-based molecular communication (DMC) is an important issue that is not well-addressed in literature. Due to the simplicity of nanonetworks, routing protocols require minimal overhead. The main objective of this paper is to investigate opportunistic routing (OR) for DMC. Based on distance and concentration gradient information, a novel routing protocol has been proposed. Performance evaluation is carried out using analytical and simulation studies.

Objective:This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of teaching emotion regulation based on gross model in reducing impulsivity in drug dependent people. Method: This research project was some type of pilot studies that has employed pretest - posttest design with control group. For the present study, all the addicted referring to drug-quitting clinics in2011 at Marivan constituted the study population. A total of 30 drug-dependent persons was selected by simple random sampling and randomly assigned to one of the experiment and control groups. Findings: The results showed that emotion regulation training can be effective in reducing symptoms of impulsivity in drug-dependent individuals. Conclusion: Given that drug-dependent individuals are naturally more susceptible to negative emotions, they will probably act impulsively without having any plans in such situations. Therefore, emotion regulation training to such people can enhance their self-restraining power in such situations.

Study objective
Pralidoxime is indicated to treat patients poisoned with nerve agents. It is available in intravenous formulation for more seriously ill hospitalized patients and intramuscular formulation for field treatment and less seriously ill patients. Our study describes a method to convert the intramuscular formulation for intravenous use and determines the stability and sterility of the resulting formulation over time and under various environmental conditions.
Methods
An inventory was taken of all intravenous (Protopam) and intramuscular (Mark I Autoinjector kits) pralidoxime available in Franklin County, Ohio hospitals, and out-of-hospital stockpiles. A method was devised to safely convert the intramuscular pralidoxime to an intravenous formulation, which was then tested for stability and sterility under a variety of environmental temperatures over time.
Results
In Franklin County, Ohio (population 1.1 million), the 10 acute care hospitals and out-of-hospital community have 36 g of intravenous pralidoxime and 4,398 g (7,270 Mark I kits) of intramuscular pralidoxime. The reformulated pralidoxime retained greater than 90% stability and remained sterile at all environmental temperatures through day 28.
Conclusion
Available pralidoxime in Franklin County is predominantly in the intramuscular preparation. Conversion of intramuscular to intravenous pralidoxime results in a stable and sterile solution for up to 28 days under a variety of environmental conditions and should be considered in a mass casualty situation in which additional intravenous supplies are needed

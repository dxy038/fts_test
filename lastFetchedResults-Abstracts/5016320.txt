The objective of this research is to explore whether a two-dimensional BCI can be achieved by reliably decoding single-trial magneto-encephalography (MEG) signal associated with sustaining or ceasing right and left hand movements. Seven naiumlve subjects participated in the study. Signals were recorded from 275-channel MEG and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) was employed. The multi-class classification for four-directional control was evaluated offline from 10-fold cross-validation using direct-decision tree classifier and genetic algorithm based Mahalanobis linear distance. Beta band (15-30Hz) event-related desynchronization and event related synchronization were observed in right and left hand movement related motor areas for physical movements as well as motor imagery. The cross-validation accuracy for the proposed four-direction classification from SAM- filtered MEG signal was as high as 95-97% for physical movements and 86-87% for motor imagery. The high classification accuracy suggests that a reliable high performance two-dimensional BCI can be achieved from single trial detection of human natural movement intentions from SAM-filtered MEG signals, where user may not need extensive training.

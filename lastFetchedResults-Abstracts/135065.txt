Background : Nowadays, hospitals discharge normally delivered neonates after a short stay so as to prevent hospital infection. Despite, newborns readmission rate increases every year. Objective : To survey relationship between lenght of stay and other birth factors of newborns and neonatal hospital readmission.
Methods : This case-control study was implemented on 300 newborns (120 ones case group & 180 ones control group) whom were normally delivered in Semnan Amir Almomenin hospital since August 1998 until February 2001. Case group consisted of newborns who were readmitted to hospital during the first 30 days of their life. Control group were newborns who were not readmitted to hospital. Reviewing medical records and interviewing with mothers, data were collected & using Chi-Squre and Fisher tests they were analysed.
Findings: Newborns hospital readmission rate during the first 30 days after discharge increased from 0.24 to 0.84 in 1000 since August 1998 until February 2001. 26 percent of the readmitted newborns were readmitted in less than I day after discharge. There was a significant relation between lenght of stay and hospital readmission. There were also some significant relations between gestational age, apgar, breast feeding, neonate's birth situation, discharge & readmission. (P=0.033) ,(P=0.025),(P=0.004),(P=0.000).
Conclusion : Lenght of stay less than 24 hours increases the risk of hospital readmission in newborns. Therefore, it is recommended that newborns slay at least 24 hours in hospital.

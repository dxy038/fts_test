This paper illustrates the tribulations of implementing a technology-based system to aid management of information at a Spa and a Salon. While the implementation may itself appear to be rather simplistic, a number of issues of concern emerge. These range from inadequate planning, inability to define organizational processes, and resistance to change due to poor management of user skills and interests. While the organization eventually achieved the investment objective it had set out for itself, the process of implementation was riddled with problemsâ€”disgruntled employees, unfair compensation plans and a general discontentment with the system. The paper contextualizes a range of issues related to information management and how a technological solution resulted in resistance to change and business process management challenges.

The HEGRA experiment is a hybrid installation characterized by four different types of detectors (scintillator counters, open Cherenkov counters, Cherenkov telescopes and Geiger towers) located within one detector array. The Geiger towers are built with the objective to measure the local energy deposition and to reconstruct and identify muon tracks. In addition each tower may serve as an independent high resolution muon flux monitor. With these properties the Geiger towers are operating as geometric and energetic calibration instruments for the other detector components and as additional independent measurement instruments with respect to the Î³-hadron separation and the measurement of the chemical composition. In this paper the design, the performance, and the basic principles of the data analysis of the lead-concrete Geiger towers are described.

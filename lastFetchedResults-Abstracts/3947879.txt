Depth video coding is an essential part of 3-D video processing systems. Specifically, object boundary regions are important in depth video coding since these regions significantly affect the visual quality of a synthesized view. In this paper, we propose an efficient depth video coding method to determine precise intra prediction modes and thereby reduce the loss of boundary information. To achieve this objective, we analyze and exploit statistical and geometric characteristics of the depth video. Experimental results subsequently show that the proposed method performs better than the original intra prediction of H.264/AVC in terms of bit savings and rendering quality.

Major area of developments in the field of voice recognition is more natural way of interacting with web technology have been taking place. The concept that computers can comprehend our various gestures by eyes, voices, touch and our different movements to interact is called the Easy User Interface. Today, many elements are available in mobile phones, PCs and in other devices but the lack of voice to voice application on web are not efficient to the disabled people. Speech technologies particularly play a vital role in this evolving technology. Significant advancement in automatic voice recognition for well defined applications like dictation and medium vocabulary transaction processing assignments in web application is comparatively controlled environments have been made on web server. But, automatic speech recognition still has to reach a level needed for speech to become a completely pervasive user interface because even in clean acoustic surroundings in web application. Visual voice recognition, however, is a promising source of extra voice information and it has successfully exhibited to enhance noise robustness of automatic voice recognizers, so thereby promising to enhance their usability in the web application by use of voice interaction in web. In this paper, the main objective is to provide more easy interaction between user (disabled people) and web application. Today we are using web text by typing the text and in early days Google chrome enhances their functionality adding voice search. But we are trying to accessing all web text with the help of voice. We are using JSAPI components of speech recognition from the java technology, i.e., the voice and the text components along with the latest advancements made in the field of web uses. Further, the research goes beyond the recent advancements and discusses the future scope of speech recognition technology and mentions some likely future developments, evaluating each on the basis of its performance.

Demand Control System (DCV) is designed to optimise the energy consumption with respect to the demand of outdoor air
quantity based on the number of people indoors. However, if significant indoor pollutant sources exist, which is not a function of the
number of people, the DCV may cause the indoor air quality to be unacceptable. This paper discusses a procedure of calibrating the
building in respect of managing the indoor air quality. The objective is to set the minimum fresh air quantity which is a function of
the indoor pollutant concentrations rather than metabolic carbon dioxide. Radon is used as an example because it is a common
pollutant embedded in the building materials of high-rise buildings in Hong Kong. This paper also presents a year-round record of
the indoor air quality in a typical high-rise building which is very useful for building indoor air quality (IAQ) design.

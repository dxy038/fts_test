The objective of this study is to develop the transmitting environment simulation of uncompressed high-definition (HD) video system over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. This system analyzes and compares the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) performance over 16-QAM and QPSK modulation. Equal Error Protection (EEP) and Unequal Error Protection (UEP) methods for video streaming are also incorporated. In this paper, a selection modulation method is proposed to achieve a high quality picture for video streaming. By using this approach, an optimal solution of PSNR values can be maintained over different kinds of channel conditions.

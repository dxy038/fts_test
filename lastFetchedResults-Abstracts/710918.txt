Study Objective
The purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature of sexual activity and risk-taking behaviors among Asian-American youth.
Design
Literature review of sexual activity, alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use among Asian-American adolescents.
Results
Asian-Americans are the fastest growing racial group in the United States. Asian-American adolescents report lower involvement with sexual activity than all other racial/ethnic peer groups. Once initiated, however, Asian-American adolescents have sexual behavior patterns comparable to other adolescent groups. In general, Asian-Americans have low rates of alcohol and tobacco usage and the males have higher use rates than the females. Degree of acculturation in the United States appears to be associated with risk-taking behavior. Asian-American adolescents also initiate smoking later than other groups. Although drug use among Asian-American adolescents is historically low, there appears to be variability on the level of illicit drug use among certain Asian-American adolescent subgroups.
Conclusion
Clinicians should focus prevention efforts and education on the Asian-American groups associated with higher risk-taking behaviors, particularly males and those who are more acculturated. Furthermore, to benefit Asian-American youth, anti-smoking education should continue through high school and early adulthood.

The reflection of ultrasonic wave motion by planar defect distributions is investigated with a view towards developing a method for detecting and characterizing bond-plane defects and with an ultimate objective of providing information on the bond strength of metal-to-metal bonds. The authors are primarily concerned with an approximate approach to analyzing reflection by cavities and cracks distributed in a bond plane. The results show some of the characteristic features of reflection with variation of such parameters as angle of incidence, frequency, defect size, defect shape, and defect spacing

In this paper, we address the choice of the routing update period in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks with the objective of maximizing the capacity available at an arbitrary node acting as source. To this aim, first, the problem of the routing update period is reformulated to account for the slotted nature of the Cognitive Radio time induced by the spectrum sensing functionality. Then, we analytically derive the available capacity at the source node as function of the routing update period through closed-form expressions. The mathematical analysis is carried out by adopting three different routing update strategies and two different PU activity models. The theoretical analysis is validate through numerical simulations.

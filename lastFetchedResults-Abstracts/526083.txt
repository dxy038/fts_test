Abstract
According to the recently observed structural
damages, the structures which have been designed
upon existing seismic codes performed effectively in
the life safety. However, the structural and
economical damage was wide and unacceptable.
This caused the criteria of codes to change towards
the Performance Based Design (PBD).
Determination and prediction of structural damage is
one of the most important topics in the PBD and for
this purpose, certain levels and limitations have been
presented in the related standards. The main
objective of this research is to evaluate the
mentioned levels to decrease the structural damages.
In this regard, damage indices resulting from
nonlinear dynamic and static analyses are compared
together. Also performances of Iranian concrete and
2800 codes in limiting damage to RCMRFs are
evaluated. For this purpose, nonlinear dynamic and
static analyses were performed on several reinforced
concrete moment resisting frames subjected to seven
appropriate earthquake records. Then dynamic and
static damage indices were compared together.
According to the obtained results, the drift criterion
of FEMA & ATC40 do not show properly the
structural damages due to ignoring the ultimate
structural capacity while the proposed criterion in
this research, which is based on the ductility of
structures, can properly predict the damage to
structures.

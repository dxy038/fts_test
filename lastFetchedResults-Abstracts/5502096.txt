The paper presents an optimal approach to search the best path of a map considering the traffic loading conditions. The main objective of this work is to minimize the path length to get the best path planning for a given map. This study proposes a solution algorithm based on the ant colony optimization technique to search the shortest path from a desired origin to a desired destination of the map. The proposed algorithm is implemented in C++. Furthermore, the simulation program can randomly generate maps for evaluating its flexibility and performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain the shortest path of a map with fast speed.

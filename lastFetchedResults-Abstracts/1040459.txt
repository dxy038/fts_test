It is commonly believed that spring systems in upholstered furniture are considerably more durable as well as friendlier in usage than foam systems. The objective of this study was to design and develop new constructions of hybrid springs for mattresses and to compare their stiffness with the stiffness of typical springs used in production of furniture for lying. The performed investigations comprised attempts to numerical modelling of new spring constructions, making their physical prototypes and carrying out laboratory tests of uniaxial compression. It was demonstrated on the basis of the performed investigations and the analysis of their results that the new hybrid spring for mattresses has desired progressive stiffness characteristics and, from the point of its usage, it can effectively replace the traditional bonnell spring.

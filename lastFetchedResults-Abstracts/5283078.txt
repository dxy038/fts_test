In traditional communication networks, the open systems interconnection (OSI) layer architecture has been widely adopted, and the performance optimization is conducted largely within each individual protocol layer. Although the layered structure is still of great importance for next generation wireless networks, it is known that the conventional OSI architecture may not work well in many wireless data applications. Cross-layer design approaches are critical for efficient utilization of the scarce radio resources with QoS provisioning in 4G wireless networks and beyond. As proper utilization of limited network resources is very much essential to achieve the objective of high degree of optimization, resource allocation is an important issue. Here we have presented a QoS aware cross-layer optimized resource allocation scheme for WiMAX networks to optimize the system performance as well as maintaining the end-to-end QoS of individual users and propose an algorithm to cater the need of better resource management particularly for heterogeneous traffic consisting of soft and hard QoS constraints applications in 4G networks by exploiting time-diversity gain. Simulation results depict the improved performance of our proposed algorithm.

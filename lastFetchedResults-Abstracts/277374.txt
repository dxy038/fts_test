Visible light combined with naphthalimides has previously been shown to catalyze formation of physical bonds in avascular meniscal tissue. The first objective was to modify the existing in vitro testing method (i.e., adhesion testing using lap-jointed slices) to gain more sensitivity in detecting relative bonding strengths among candidate bonding agents. A repeated measures experimental design (RMED) was used to account for variability in properties among bovine menisci and was achieved by testing all treatments/controls on slices from each meniscus. Additionally, to make the method more clinically relevant in modeling a bucket-handle tear, the bovine meniscal slices were cut with collagen fibers parallel to the test slice's length. Peak stress was greater for the complete treatment group (light plus naphthalimide) than for the control or incomplete treatment groups (light only or napthalimide only). The second objective was to perform concentration and photoactivation time dose-response studies. In the concentration dose-response study, peak stress was greater for all treatments when compared with the control but not different among treatment groups; however, there was a trend of increased bonding strength with increased concentration. In the photoactivation time dose-response study, peak stress was greater for all treatments when compared with the control and greater for the 3-min treatment vs. the 6- and 9-min treatments. Peak stress was not different between the longer treatments. The RMED provided increased reproducibility and statistical sensitivity for detecting differences among treatments and will be used to test candidate bonding agents prior to in vivo testing.

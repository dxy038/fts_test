This paper proposes the development of an innovative measurement system for telerehabilitation with the aim to provide objective evaluation of functional capacity of patients subject to lower limb rehabilitation. In particular the system has based on the set of wearable MEMs sensors which detect the 3D orientation of the limbs and communicate with a Central Remote Unit for storing and elaborating all measurement data. The proposed study has been performed under the research project PRO-DOMO SUD funded by Apulia Region within the Project &#8220;Apulian ICT Living Labs&#8221;.

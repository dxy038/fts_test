In this paper, design and analysis of compact coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed ultra wideband (UWB) slot antenna is presented. The proposed antenna has a simple structure consisting of a rectangular slot and a triangular patch at the anterior portion of the feed that acts as tuning stub of the antenna. The analysis of the proposed antenna is performed by using MoM based electromagnetic solver, IE3D. The designed antenna is fabricated using FR4 substrate with 1.6 mm thickness. The return loss and standing wave ratio of the developed antenna are measured and compared, which shows that measured result is in good agreement with simulation. With the above structural features the overall dimension of the antenna is 21mm&#195;&#151;20mm&#195;&#151;1.6mm and the fractional impedance bandwidth of the antenna is about 99% with return loss better than -10 dB (VSWR &lt; 2). It is also seen that the proposed antenna has relatively stable omni directional radiation pattern in the H plane and bidirectional radiation pattern in the E plane over the frequency range of 4.1 GHz to 12.1 GHz. To verify the suitability of the antenna for transmission and reception of narrow pulses, the time domain analysis is also investigated and presented.

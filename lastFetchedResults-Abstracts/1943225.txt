Objective was to enquire the attributes of regionally obtainable BA (bagass, paper, peanut shell, sawdust) to inscribe the efficacy of BA at (10–40%) for moisture reduction. Sawdust was prominent in moisture reduction capability in 5–7 days. The prime physical changes in BA under various compression forces were as; by increasing compression force, BD rise and FAS decline, whereas PD had not exhibit any discrepancy. Proficient compost production entails meticulous understanding the process dynamics in terms of correlation between moisture reduction; FAS, BD and PD. FAS and moisture were negatively where as BD and moisture positively correlated.

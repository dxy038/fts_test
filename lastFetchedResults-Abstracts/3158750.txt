In order to realize the objective and synthetic evaluation of the feasibility in Low-carbon (LC) project, the paper constructs the knowledge representation system(i.e. attribute value of information system), applies the reduction and the mining rules of the Rough Set Theory, at same the time computing dynamic weight, subjective weight, objective weight are combined with Analytic Hierarchy Process to construct the Low-carbon project group decision model(LCPGDM) which is based on weight reasoning method. Through example this paper gives the basic steps of algorithm and compares with the traditional group decision theory, the results indicate this algorithm excludes the shortcoming of subjective factors, overcomes the effect of unbalance datas in dynamic distribution, objectively reflects the genuine essential of knowledge system, supplies a new idea and method for the benefit analyzing and risk evaluation in the LC project.

AbstractBackground
hmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) primarily is considered to be a desmosomal disease with a predominant right ventricular phenotype. Reduced signal intensity for junctional plakoglobin (JUP) at the intercalated disks has been proposed as a marker that contributes to diagnosis of the disease. In this technical study, we investigated how methodology-related differences caused by tissue preservation and antibody dilutions affect an appropriate diagnosis.
s
y and biopsy material was available from a total of 7 control and 25 AC patients that fulfilled the diagnostic Task Force Criteria as proposed in 2010. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on cryosections and formalin-fixed material using antibodies against JUP and N-Cadherin.
s
histochemistry (1:1000 antibody dilution) on formalin-fixed material showed a reduced signal for JUP in 7/10 AC patients in a bidirectional, double-blinded exchange experiment in which 77% of individuals were correctly classified. Unmasking this disturbed JUP pattern was highly dependent on tissue preservation and antibody dilution since on cryosections the disturbed pattern in patients could only be unmasked at a very strong antibody dilution of 1:100000.
sions
d immunoreactive signal of JUP at the intercalated disks can be observed in a majority of AC patients. These changes can comparably be detected on both cryo- (74%) and formalin-fixed material (70%) but demand a different, highly defined, and uniformly used approach.

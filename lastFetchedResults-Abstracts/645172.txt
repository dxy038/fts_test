Eretmocerussp. was found parasitizing the greenhouse whiteflyTrialeurodes vaporariorumon tomatoes in Argentina. The objective of the present paper is to make a contribution to the knowledge of some biological parameters ofEretmocerussp. and to evaluate its potential as an agent for biological control. Preimaginal developmental time was estimated simultaneously with that ofEncarsia formosa,another aphelinid parasitoid ofT. vaporariorum,at two different temperatures: 26 ± 1°C and 29 ± 1°C (relative humidity (RH): 50–75%, photoperiod: 14L:10D). The following biological parameters ofEretmocerussp. were also analyzed: longevity, survival rate (lx) and age-specific fertility (mx) of the adult, sex rate, intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm), net reproductive rate (R0), and generational time (Tc). For this purpose a life table was constructed for the parasitoid at 26 ± 1°C, RH: 50–80%, and photoperiod: 14L:10D. Results were as follows:Eretmocerussp. had a longer developmental time at 26 ± 1°C (19.8 days) than at 29 ± 1°C (19.3 days) (ANOVA,P < 0.05). This time was also longer than that ofE. formosaat both temperatures (ANOVA,P < 0.05). The life table showed mean longevity of the adult: 12.8 days (female) and 7.0 days (male);lx50(adults): 12–13 days; mean sex rate: 0.57 (females/(females + males));rm: 0.195 females/female/day;R0: 100.8 females/female;Tc: 23.7 days. Results suggest thatEretmocerussp. could be used in addition toE. formosain the control of the greenhouse whitefly.

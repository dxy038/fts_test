Objective
C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is the third member of the natriuretic peptide family. Cultured endothelial cells secrete CNP, and its secretion rate from the endothelial cells is augmented by lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α, which participate in the pathophysiology of inflammation. In this study, we investigated the regulation of CNP secretion from monocytes and macrophages to estimate its contribution to the progression of inflammation.
Materials and Methods

CNP secretion rates from two human leukemia cell lines (THP-1 and HL-60), human peripheral blood lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and mouse peritoneal macrophages were measured under conditions with or without stimulation. Immunoreactive CNP levels in the culture media of these cells were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay.
Results

The secretion rates of CNP from THP-1 and HL-60 cells were augmented according to the degree of their differentiation into macrophage-like cells under the stimulation with phorbol ester. Peripheral blood monocytes also increased the CNP secretion rate after their differentiation into macrophages. Retinoic acid elicited synergistic effects on the CNP secretion rate from HL-60 cells when administered with lipopolysaccharide, interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, or phorbol ester. In contrast, the phorbol ester-stimulated CNP secretion rate from THP-1 cells was suppressed with dexamethasone, which inhibits monocyte differentiation into macrophage.
Conclusions

The secretion rate of CNP from monocytes was shown to be regulated based on the degree of their differentiation. This study provides evidence that the monocyte/macrophage system is one of the sources of CNP, especially under inflammatory conditions.

In mobile cloud computing systems, cloud computing has a significant impact on wireless networks. Cloud computing and wireless networks have traditionally been addressed separately in the literature. In this paper, we jointly study the operations of cloud computing and wireless networks in mobile computing environments, where the objective is to improve the end-to-end performances of cloud mobile media delivered through mobile cloud computing systems. Unlike most existing studies on wireless networks, where only the spectrum efficiency is considered, we consider not only the spectrum efficiency in wireless networks but also the pricing information in the cloud, based on which power allocation and interference management in the wireless networks are performed. We formulate the problems encountered in the operations of mobile cloud computing environments, including determining the price to charge for media services, resource allocation, and interference management, as a Stackelberg game model. Moreover, we extend this game model with multiple players through network virtualization technology, and adopt the replicator dynamics method to solve the evolutionary game between the different groups of small cells. Furthermore, a backward induction method is used to analyze the proposed Stackelberg game. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

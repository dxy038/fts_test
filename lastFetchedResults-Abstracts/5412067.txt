The objective of this presentation is to review the topic of Nanoantennas, which find primary applications in the optical and terahertz frequency range, from the point of view of a microwave engineer. We begin by reviewing some of the proposed applications of nanoantennas, such as optical sensors, receptors of infrared energy in solar cells, lenses for terahertz radiation, and directed energy devices at infrared frequencies. Next, we point out some of the similarities as well as differences between optical and microwave antennas.

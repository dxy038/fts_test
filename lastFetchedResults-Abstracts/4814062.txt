New fashioned batteries such as nickel-zinc cell, has characteristics as follows: minimal internal resistance, maximal equivalent capacitance and opposing electromotive force. When testing its performance, the rectifier is required to have special abilities such as fast response, constant and adjustable output current and voltage, could work bidirectional etc. This paper indicated a fast bilateral filter which has low dissipation and fast response speed. The design method and component parameter selections are detailed presented. The merits of the filter are also testified by the MATLAB emulator, which matched the theoretical calculation very well. It has an important application value on bilateral converters

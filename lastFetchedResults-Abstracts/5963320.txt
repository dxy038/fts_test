This paper introduces a notion of divide-by-K reuse strategy, which allows for K-orthogonal chunks (sub-zones) of OFDMA data regions to be fully reused for all relay links throughout each cell in a TV-hop relay-enhanced cellular TDD-OFDMA system with KlesN. Our objective is to configure a topology of relay stations subject to the divide-by-K reuse strategy, such that the end-to-end routes for relay stations are determined while maximizing the bandwidth efficiency of resource available for relay links. We propose a sub-optimal algorithm for a topology control that reduces co-channel interference while balancing the time-varying traffic load in a dynamical manner. Our system-level simulation results show that the average system throughput can be significantly improved by the proposed algorithm for the divide-by-K reuse strategy, especially with K = 3.

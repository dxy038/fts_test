Static path analysis is a key process of Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) estimation, the objective of which is to find the execution path that has the largest execution time. Currently, there is an argument in the research community whether model checking is another good solution for WCET analysis, besides ILP. To our knowledge, no paper so far has addressed this argument with real performance data. In this paper, we implement both ILP and model checking for static path analysis of WCET, and the experiment results show that ILP yields very good performance, while model checking only works well for simple programs, and it is inclined to scalability problems when dealing with programs that have complex structures and large loop counts.

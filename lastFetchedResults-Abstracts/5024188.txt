With the development of information technology, a large number of software products enter the maintenance phase. The maintainability of software products continues to attract peopleÂ´s attention. This paper proposes a new synthetic maintainability evaluation model basing on fuzzy entropy theory. In the model, the weight of different indexes is calculated by combining the entropy weight and expert weight. The entropy weight can be obtained through measuring the difference of membership degree of the index which reflects the consistency of the expert opinion. The evaluation result is more objective and reasonable. It provides a guideline to design a software product with high maintainability.

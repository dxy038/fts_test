By applying hybrid functions of general block-pulse functions and Legendre polynomials, the linear-quadratic problem of linear time-varying systems with delays are transformed into the optimization problem of multivariate functions. The approximate solutions of the optimal control and state as well as the optimal value of the objective functional are derived. The numerical examples illustrate that the algorithms are valid.

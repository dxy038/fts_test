The design has progressed on the vacuum vessel and First Wall (FW)/blanket for the Reduced Technical Objective/Reduced Cost (RTO/RC) ITER. The basic functions and structures are the same as for the 1998 ITER design. The design has been improved to achieve, along with the size reduction, âˆ¼50% target reduction of the fabrication cost. The number of blanket modules has been minimized according to smaller dimensions of the machine and a higher payload capacity of the blanket Remote Handling tool. A concept without the back plate has been designed and assessed. The blanket module concept with flat separable FW panels has been developed to reduce the fabrication cost and future radioactive waste.

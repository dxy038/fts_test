The design of a wind farm involves several complex optimization problems. We consider the multi-objective optimization problem of maximizing the energy output under the consideration of wake effects and minimizing the cost of the turbines and land area used for the wind farm. We present an efficient particle swarm optimization algorithm that computes a set of trade-off solutions for the given task. Our algorithm can be easily integrated into the layout process for developing wind farms and gives designers new insights into the trade-off between energy output and land area.

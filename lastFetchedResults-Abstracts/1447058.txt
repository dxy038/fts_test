The objective of this study was to evaluate the growth and meat quality of hogs supplemented with creatine monohydrate (CMH) and (or) a simple carbohydrate (dextrose) for the last 30 days of production. Crossbred market barrows (n=32; 75 kg) were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to one of eight pens with four animals per pen. Dietary treatments were a control (normal corn and soybean meal diet), CMH (control diet supplemented with 0.55% CMH), DEXT (control diet supplemented with 2.1% dextrose), and COMBO (control diet supplemented with CMH and DEXT). Average daily gain on test, fat depth, hot carcass weight, and LMA (postmortem dot grid measurement) were not affected by dietary treatment. However, a nonsignificant trend (P=0.07) was observed for 10th rib loin muscle area (LMA) gain on test as determined by real-time ultrasound comparisons over the course of the 30 days feeding duration (COMBO=4.24 cm2 increase vs. control=1.0 cm2 increase). No significant differences in pork quality were noted across treatment groups.

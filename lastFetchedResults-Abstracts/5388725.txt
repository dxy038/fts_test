This paper provides an overview of a 118 MVA cogeneration application for a 1500 Adt/d green field pulp mill in Canada with a connection to a 25 kV limited capacity utility distribution system. The paper discusses, in detail, some of the unique challenges which were encountered in this application. The objective of the paper is to increase awareness of the special application concerns which result from the interconnection of a large industrial plant cogeneration facility and a limited capacity utility tie system.

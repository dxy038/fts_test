The Proportional Integral Derivative (PID)
controller is the most adopted controllers for industrial
plants, due to its simplicity and satisfactory performances
for a wide range of processes. It should be noted that the
accurate and efficient tuning of parameters such
controllers is very important. On the other hand, industrial
plants, such as power systems, usually have some
features, such as nonlinearity, time-variability of system
structure and time delay, which make controller parameter
tuning more complex. Thus, the optimal tuning of PID
gains is required to get the desired level of robust
performance under different operation conditions. This
paper presents an Adaptive Network based Fuzzy
Inference System (ANFIS) to tune on-line optimal gains
of a PID controller for Load Frequency Control (LFC)
design in a restructured time delay power system. The
problem of robustly off-line tuning of PID based LFC
design is formulated as an optimization problem
according to the time domain-based objective function
which is solved by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
technique that has a strong ability to find the most
optimistic results. It is used to yield optimal PID gains
over a wide range of plant parameter change and different
system time-delays for training the proposed ANFIS in
order to adopt the gains of the PID based load frequency
controller. This newly developed control strategy
combines the advantage of neural networks and fuzzy
inference system and has simple stricture that is easy to
implement and tune. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed control strategy a two-area restructured
power system is considered as a test system under
different operating conditions and system nonlinearities.
The simulation results show that the tuned gains of the
PID based load frequency controller using the ANFIS can
provide better damping of frequency oscillations.

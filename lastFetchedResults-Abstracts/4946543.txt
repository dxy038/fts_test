Discussing on several economic indexes and analyzing the root-causes for some incorrect calculation methods used in the optimized load distributed of power plant units, this paper indicates that the optimization of load distribution should take minimum total coal consumption of whole power plant as the target. Meanwhile the more exact coal consumption curve is gained by the disposal of original data and real-time data update, aiming at localizations of the traditional equal incremental principle. It is improved in the following aspects: Firstly, in the choice aspect of fitting methods, by adopting the hyperbola fitting method, it can assure that the objective function is protruding function; Secondly, in the disposal aspect of discontinuous consumption curve, after the discontinuous curves are managed approximately, the disadvantage working area can be avoided; the disposal continuous curve can be applied in the equal incremental principle. Thirdly, in the aspect of changing scope restriction of unit output, when the optimized load exceeds the changing scope restriction of unit output, we may obtain the satisfying results by combining the equal incremental principle with Kuhn-Tucker principle.

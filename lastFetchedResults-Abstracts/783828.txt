Objective Examine the association of physical impairment
with gender, depression, and socio-demographics in
the community in Aleppo, Syria.
Method We conducted a cross-sectional, populationbased
study in Aleppo on adults aged 18–65 (N = 2,038).
We used a computerized interviewer-administered structured
questionnaire. Physical impairment was measured via
an adapted 12-item World Health Organization, Health
State Description Individual Questionnaire which includes
both physical and emotional items. We used physical
impairment items score to classify individuals into low,
middle, and high physical impairment category. Self-report
of physician-diagnosed depression and chronic diseases
active in the past year and their current treatment status
were obtained.
Results Sample mean age (SD) was 35.3 (12.1) years,
55% were female, and 4.5% had depression. Female gender,
low socioeconomic status (SES), and depression were
associated with high physical impairment. Women had
more impairment (OR = 3.35, 95% CI: 2.15–5.21) with
little change after controlling for depression and chronic
diseases, but significantly decreased after controlling for
socio-demographics (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 0.84–2.73). The
association with low (vs. high) SES was prominent
(OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.32–4.67) after controlling for all
variables. Depression’s association (OR = 4.85, 95% CI:
1.93–12.15) lost significance after controlling for chronic
diseases (OR = 2.81, 95% CI: 0.96–8.25), but further
adjustment for socio-demographics had little effect.
Conclusion Women and individuals of low SES appear
more vulnerable to physical impairment in the community
in Aleppo. Depression’s association with physical impairment
may be mediated through co-existing chronic
diseases. Public health planning regarding physical
impairment in Syria should encompass these as putative
risk factors

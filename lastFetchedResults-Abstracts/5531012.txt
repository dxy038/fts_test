Different genetic operators suit different problems. Using several crossover operators should be an effective approach for improving the performance of an evolutionary algorithm. This paper studies the effect of the use of two crossover operators on MOEA/D-DRA for multi-objective optimization. It considers two crossover operators, namely, simplex crossover operator (SPX) and center of mass crossover operator (CMX). The probability of the use of each operator at each generation is updated in a adaptive way. The preliminary experimental results have indicated that this approach is promising.

This paper studies a deployment problem for a group of robots where individual agents operate with outdated information about each otherâ€™s locations. Our objective is to understand to what extent outdated information is still useful and at which point it becomes essential to obtain new, up-to-date information. We propose a self-triggered coordination algorithm based on spatial partitioning techniques with uncertain information. We analyze its correctness in synchronous and asynchronous scenarios, and establish the same convergence guarantees that a synchronous algorithm with perfect information at all times would achieve. The technical approach combines computational geometry, set-valued stability analysis, and event-based systems.

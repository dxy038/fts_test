The cytokine of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a
glycoprotein, which is synthesized in the female reproductive tract and has embryonic trophic
effect in mammals. The objective of this study was to examine the optimal dosage of GMCSF
to improve the mouse embryo development in vitro. To collect two and eight cells
embryos, the pregnant NMRI mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 48 h and 72 h
post hCG injections, respectively. The embryos were cultured randomlly in T6 medium
supplemented with 5 mg /ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0, 2, and 10 ng / ml human
rGM-CSF. The data of blastocyst formation and hatching in different groups of embryo
culture were compared by chi-square analysis. The results showed that the developmental
rates of 2 and 8 cells embryos to hatching blastocyst in the presence of 2 ng/ml of GM-CSF
their control groups (51.5% and 49.7%, respectively) were more than those in the other
groups, but insignificant. It seems more researches are necessary to confirm this suggestion
that the GM-CSF with 2 ng/ml concentration may have a better potential, not only to enhance
the developmental rates of 2 and 8 cells embryos but also for decreasing the degeneration of
those embryos.

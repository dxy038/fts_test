The objective of this study was to prepare NS-chitosan microparticles for the delivery of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) to the colon. Microparticles can spread out over a large area of colon allowing a more effective local efficacy of 5-ASA. N-Succinyl-chitosan was chosen as carrier system because of its excellent pharmaceutical properties in colon drug targeting such as poor solubility in acid environment, biocompatibility, mucoadhesive properties, and low toxicity. It was prepared by introducing succinic group into chitosan N-terminals of the glucosamine units. 5-ASA loaded NS-chitosan microparticles were prepared using spray-drying. As a control, a matrix obtained by freeze-drying technique was also prepared and tested. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction studies show the 5-ASA/NS-chitosan electrostatic interactions in both the systems. Mean size of the microparticles was around 5 Î¼m, zeta potential value of both systems was always negative. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show an acceptable spherical non porous structure of microparticles. In vitro swelling and drug release studies were in accordance with the polymer properties, showing the highest swelling ratio and drug release at pH = 7.4 (colonic pH) where microparticles were able to deliver more than 90% of 5-ASA during 24 h experiments. Rheological studies are in accordance with the swelling and release studies.

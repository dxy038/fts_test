This paper describes detailed 3-D scene editing procedure, using an on-screen declarative scheme. The aim is to relieve users from low-level manipulation metaphors related to object, light or camera positioning in a 3-D environment. The solving process is formulated as an optimization problem searching the parameters (transformation matrices) that can in some way be defined as optimal, and subject to a set of nonlinear constraints. This paper presents a way to apply direct search methods to solve specific constrained optimizations, which are more tolerant to the non-linearity and the presence of noise in both objective function and constraints.

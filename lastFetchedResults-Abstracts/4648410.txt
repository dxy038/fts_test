The objective of this paper is to provide an illustrative feedback on development of Open Source software among several partners. We describe the first stage of the design of a specific software package, namely a customized Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for biology applications. This software package is structured in several modules which are reusable and can be customized for other applications. In this paper, we address the problem of multi-licensing for the same software tools due to the participation of several partners, the reuse of code source, and the subsequent distribution of this produced software.

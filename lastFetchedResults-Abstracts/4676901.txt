In this paper we propose a comparative review between the proposed digital audio watermarking technique and those achieved by Luigi Rosa and Rolf Brigola. The performed technique operates in the frequency domain. The time-frequency mapping is done using a Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT). The technique developed by Luigi Rosa operates in the frequency domain but using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as transformation and that proposed by Rolf Brigola uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We studied the robustness of each technique against different types of attack and we evaluated the inaudibility by using a statistical approach by calculating the SNR and an objective approach by calculating the ODG notes given by PEAQ.

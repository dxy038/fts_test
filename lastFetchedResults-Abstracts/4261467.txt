This paper presents a highly efficient electrical circuit for battery fed electric vehicles (BFEVs) which is an amalgamation of a PI controlled bi-directional DC-DC converter and a boost converter. The PI controlled isolated DC-DC bidirectional converter is designed to provide the desired battery voltage for dc motor control and to run the flow of power under both steady-state and ephemeral conditions. For the period of the boost operation high voltage side is controlled by PI controller and low voltage side acts as a rectifier and vice versa. A boost converter is also designed by paralleling one IGBT with one MOSFET switches in order to condense the conduction loss and to guarantee a high output voltage. These both devices are used to control three modes of BFEVs namely steady state, acceleration and regenerative modes. An equivalent MATLAB/Simulink simulation model of the proposed system is developed to investigate the performance of the proposed converter circuits at different operating conditions. The proposed converter exhibits higher efficiency as compared to the conventional converter circuits.

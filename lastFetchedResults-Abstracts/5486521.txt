In this paper, a buck resonant voltage divider (BRVD) with bidirectional operation considered is presented with the fixed switching frequency all over the load range, which can be used as the first stage of the bus converter. The proposed buck resonant voltage divider with open loop control can obtain about half of the output voltage created from the resonant voltage divider. Above all, all switches have zero voltage switching (ZVS) operating characteristics. Besides, the bidirectional operation mode of the proposed topology is also taken into considerations. The detailed illustration of the proposed topology is provided along with some experimental results to verify their effectiveness.

We report a normally-off GaN-based monolithic bidirectional switch for the first time. The switch consists of a double-gate AlGaN/GaN gate injection transistor (GIT) which serves normally-off operation with high drain current utilizing the hole injection from the p-type gate. The fabricated bidirectional switch exhibits high breakdown voltage of 650 V for both polarities and low on-state resistance (R<sub>on</sub> <sup>.</sup>A) of 3.1 m&#937;cm<sup>2</sup> . The GaN-based bidirectional switch can be applied to AC-AC matrix converters with high efficiency.

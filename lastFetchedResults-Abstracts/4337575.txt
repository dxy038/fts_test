Today there is huge amount of data available on World Wide Web. One way to manage data is web page classification. One of the issues of web page classification considered in this paper is high dimensionality. Dimensionality refers to number of terms in a web page. High dimensionality of web pages causes problem while classifying them. The main objective of reducing dimensionality of web pages is to improve the performance of the classifier. This paper describes hybrid approach of dimensionality reduction for web page classification using a rough set and information gain method. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods are used to reduce the dimensionality of web pages. Information gain method is used as feature selection method. Rough set based Quick Reduct algorithm is used for dimensionality reduction. Web pages are classified using nai&#776;ve Bayesian method. Significant results are obtained and tested for proposed architecture.

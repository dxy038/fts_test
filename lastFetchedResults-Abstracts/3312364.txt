This paper researched on the communication between super capacitor energy storage elevator system and virtual instrument in the computer. The research included control module and acquisition module. The control module of the system mainly refers simulations of several typical elevator speeds, torque conditions to simulate the practical application using Lab VIEW software. The acquisition module of the system is defined to monitor system bidirectional DC-DC high and low side voltage and current signals using Lab VIEW software. Through these two modules, the control and data acquisition of super capacitor energy storage elevator control system can be attained and the communication with the host computer can be attained as well.

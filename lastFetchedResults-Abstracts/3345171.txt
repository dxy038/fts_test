To restrain the influences of the nonlinearities and uncertainties in missile servo control systems, the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) technique is introduced to real-time online estimate and compensate these factors. As to the problem of the difficulties in tuning ADRC parameters, an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the complete set of Pareto solutions for the control parameters, then a multi-criteria decision making algorithm based on utility function is chosen to determine the fittest solution. Then a test platform using TMS320C28346 floating-point DSP as control core is built to verify the research results. The experimental results show that the optimal ADRC parameter is appropriate for the servo control system. The system tracks the input commands smoothly and reliably, and has good robustness and adaptability to nonlinearities and parameters drifts. Also the strategy for tuning the ADRC parameters is practical and feasible.

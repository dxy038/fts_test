Here, we report on our proteomic studies in the field of cardiovascular medicine. Our research has been focused on understanding the role of proteins in cardiovascular disease with a particular focus on epigenetic regulation and biomarker discovery, with the objective of better understanding cardiovascular pathophysiology to lead to the development of new and better diagnostic and therapeutic methods. We have used mass spectrometry for over 5 years as a viable method to investigate proteinâ€“protein interactions and post-translational modifications in cellular proteins as well as a method to investigate the role of extra-cellular proteins. Use of mass spectrometry not only as a research tool but also as a potential diagnostic tool is a topic of interest. In addition to these functional proteomics studies, structural proteomic studies are also done with expectations to allow for pinpoint drug design and therapeutic intervention. Collectively, our proteomics studies are focused on understanding the functional role and potential therapeutically exploitable property of proteins in cardiovascular disease from both intra-cellular and extra-cellular aspects with both functional as well as structural proteomics approaches to allow for comprehensive analysis.

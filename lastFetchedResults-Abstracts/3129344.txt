After an investigation on existing ontology for three dimensional (3D) reconstructions of architectural objects from a cloud points achieved through 3D scanning, importance and imperativeness of completeness related issues is highlighted with the absence of logic connective &#194;&#191;negation&#194;&#191;. An EID-SCE based solution is proposed to fully model both humans side and machine side semantics to achieve completeness in the sense of integration and bridging of Closed world assumption (CWA) and Open world assumption (OWA). By consciously and explicitly modeling what is modeled previously implicitly and possibly unconsciously, decidability processes of object semantics are revealed with coherent traces of transformations from subjective Yes/No to objective True/False. Techniques of expressing behavioral/dynamic information and logic connective &#194;&#191;and&#194;&#191; without the need of extra constraints, with structural/static expressions, are also provided. Elementary implementation is shown with the creating an ontology for identification of 3D architectural objects.

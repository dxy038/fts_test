The objective of this paper is to implement the concept of wavelet based image compression to gray scale images using different techniques. The techniques involved in the comparison process are SPIHT, EZW and SOFM. These techniques are more efficient and provide a better quality in the image. In compression, wavelets have shown a good adaptability to a wide range of data, while being of reasonable complexity. This paper focuses important features of wavelet transform in compression of still images, including the extent to which the quality of image is degraded by the process of wavelet compression and decompression. The above techniques have been successfully used in many applications. The techniques are compared by using the performance parameters PSNR and MSE. Images obtained with those techniques yield very good results.

Introduction: Recently, hospitalization of IV drug abusers has increased and associated with somediagnosticandtherapeutic problems.This study designed to determine the epidemiologic features of these patients and to identify their common infections. Material and Methods: This study is a descriptive cross - sectional one. Data were obtained from 53 questional from hospitalized patients in infectious diseases ward of Immam Reza hospital in 1381-2.
Results:Keroin was the most commonly used illicit drug(94.33%).Other less commonly used drugs were crystal, opium and market drugs. The most common causes for IVDAs hospitalization, in decreasing order were infectious endocarditis (28. 31%), soft tissue infection (16.98%), pneumonia (15.9%), septic DVT (15.9%), nonseptic DVT (7.55%) and miscellaneous (7.55%).In overal, blood cultures were positive in 32.08% of cases; including 82.35% staphylococcus aurous, 11.76% streptococcus pyogen and 15.88% entrococci of positive cultures. There was no positive culture for aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Anti-HCV ab, Anti-HIV ab and HBsAg were positive in 67.92%, 5.66% and 3.77% of cases, respectively.
Conclusioin:This study indicates a high prevalence of probable HCV infection in IVDAs. Based on this study, it seem's raesonable to administer combination of Cloxacillin and amino glycoside empirically for infectious endocarditic, Septic DVT and sepsis in IVDAs.Due to high prevalence of tuberculosis in this group of patiens, we recommend to consider anti-TB drugs as part of empirical regimens for severe pneumonia in IVDAs.

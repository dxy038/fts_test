The overall objective of present research is to provide insight into physical properties and atomization characteristics of the Chlamydomonas algal biofuel. Biofuels are produced mainly from oil crops, animal fat and waste cooking oil. Because of low productivity and efficiency, these sources are not suitable for continuous and large-scale production of biofuel. Microalgae appear to be the only source of renewable biodiesel that is capable of meeting the global fuel demand. According to a novel physiological-molecular research, the naturally isolated microalga Chlamydomonas sp. MCCS 026 can be used as a valuable feedstock for biofuel production in our country. This species has high growth rate and lipid content requiring just a simple and low-cost culture medium. However, these benefits do not guarantee the practical usage of this new green fuel in DI engines. In order to employ a biodiesel well, it is necessary to know its key properties, i.e. density, viscosity and surface tension. These properties are closely related to the molecular structures of its fatty acid components. This study presents a predictive analytical investigation of the effects of viscosity, density and surface tension on atomization characteristics of the new suggested green fuel. Results from statistical analysis showed that Chlamydomonas algal fuel had near-similar properties to the petroleum diesel fuel. The atomization analysis indicated that for the same operating conditions, the novel biofuel shows better spray characteristics than well-known biofuels, i.e. soybean and canola methyl esters. Also, the results showed that the quality of this new biofuel is higher than other alga-based biofuels.

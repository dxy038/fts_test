The objective of this study was to determine if a mechanical vibration, applied at the feet with the subject in the seated position, would influence blood flow. Ten female volunteers in the age group of 22 to 59 were tested for 20 minutes with and without vibration (37 Hz, 0.2 g). Blood pressure and continuous heart rate were recorded. Frequency analysis by FFT was used to evaluate heart rate variability (HRV). Analysis of the power spectrum over the range of 0.005-0.5 Hz showed a significant decrease in the slope with age. Vibration resulted in a significant reduction in slope, consistent with having a "younger" HRV. These results are interpreted as the vibration "improving" lower limb circulation.

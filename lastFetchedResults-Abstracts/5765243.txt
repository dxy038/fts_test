Single Channel Speech Separation has been the objective of extensive research in recent years. In this paper, we propose a hybrid system of coherent and incoherent modulation filtering for separation of the target speech from the interference. In the proposed system, subband envelopes are determined using a coherently detected subband carrier based on the time-dependent spectral Center-Of-Gravity (COG) demodulation and then the interference signal is eliminated by applying the adaptive Affine Projection (AP) filter to the subband envelop. The reference signal for the adaptive AP filter is provided by a parallel incoherent system of modulation filtering. Our evaluations, based on several objective measures, indicate that the proposed system extracts the majority of target speech signal segments with minimal interference, outperforming previous systems in voiced speech separation.

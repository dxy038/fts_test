Reconfiguration of the distribution systems is a task related to operation especially in the presence of automation systems. Reconfiguration of distribution systems can be done with different goals that reduction of loss is most important of them. Ever, different reconfiguration methods presented for unbalanced distribution networks. In this paper reconfiguration of the unbalanced distribution system in the scheme of multi-objective model formulated to reduce the losses, and load imbalances. Imperialist competitive algorithm and graph theory implemented in MATLAB software have been used to solve the multi-objective reconfiguration problem and all results of applying the proposed method on a sample distribution system is presented.

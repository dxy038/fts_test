To optimize simultaneously machine loading, operation planning and operation routing in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), a binary as well as a mixed integer programming (MIP) is developed in this paper. The model is designed based on the concept of just-in-time. The objective is to make the load of the machines balanced, to decrease lot sizing for more flexibility as well as to adjust the scheduling for on-time delivery. Since the resulting model for real world problems happens to be a very large scale one, the classical methods are not capable of solving it. Thus, we also design a meta-heuristic algorithm to solve this model. It is called Tabu-SA. The computational experiments show the proposed model is superior over the existing methods as far as the computation time and the accuracy of the solution is concerned.

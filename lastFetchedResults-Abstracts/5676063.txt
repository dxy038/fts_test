Summary form only given. The model HDTV Station Project has carried out a year-long extensive RF field measurement program to evaluate WHD-TV stationÂ´s coverage under a number of different interference scenarios. The primary objective of the field testing program is to evaluate the performance of the ATSC system under real world conditions of variable terrain, high vegetation, and complex static and dynamic multipath generally encountered in the Washington, D.C., urban area. This paper presents information relating to the facilities employed, the test procedures used and a tabulated summary of the data collected. Indoor measurement results and comparison with other field measurement programs are also included.

New lattice vector quantizer design procedures for nonuniform sources that yield excellent performance while retaining the structure required for fast quantization are described. Analytical methods for truncating and scaling lattices to be used in vector quantization are given, and an analytical technique for piecewise-linear multidimensional companding is presented. The uniform and piecewise-uniform lattice vector quantizers are then used to quantize the discrete cosine transform coefficients of images, and their objective and subjective performance and complexity are contrasted with other lattice vector quantizers and with LBG training-mode designs

In this paper, we present a discrete-time predictive control strategy for the supervision of networked dynamic systems subject to coordination constraints. Such a network paradigm is characterized by a set of spatially distributed systems, possibly dynamically coupled and connected via communication links, which need to be controlled and coordinated in order to accomplish their overall objective. The network latency is modeled abstractly as a time-varying time-delay, which is allowed to become unbounded for taking into account data-loss. The method can be specialized to deal more efficiently either with random, possibly unbounded, time-delays, such as the case over the Internet, or constant/bounded time-delays, typically encountered in space and underwater applications. An example of coordination of two autonomous vehicles under input-saturation and formation accuracy constraints is presented.

This paper studies a method to solve the general multi-block standard problems whose objective is to design a stabilizing controller that minimizes the induced norm of a closed loop input-output map. It is shown that there is a sequence of augmented 1-block problems whose optimal solutions converges to that of multi-block problems in the weak-* topology. The method applies to L<sub>1</sub> and l<sub>1</sub> control as well as continuous/discrete time H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control

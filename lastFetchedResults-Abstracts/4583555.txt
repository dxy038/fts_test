Utilities around the world have been considering Demand Side Management (DSM) in their strategic planning. The costs of constructing and operating a new capacity generation unit are increasing everyday as well as Transmission and distribution and land issues for new generation plants, which force the utilities to search for another alternatives without any additional constraints on customers comfort level or quality of delivered product. De can be defined as the selection, planning, and implementation of measures intended to have an influence on the demand or customer-side of the electric meter, either caused directly or stimulated indirectly by the utility. DSM programs are peak clipping, Valley filling, Load shifting, Load building, energy conservation and flexible load shape. The main target of this paper is to show the impact of a DSM load shifting program on both utility and customer in residential areas by Maximizing load factor with minimizing area-gap-between load and supply from the utility point of view and minimizing the cost of energy consumption from the customer point of view with deriving the mathematical formulation of the objective function subjected to different constraints for different cases.

Background
Noradrenergic function has been linked to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and might have a role in mediating sleep disturbances of the disorder. Our objective was to relate a peripheral manifestation of noradrenergic function, sympathetic nervous system activity as indexed by heart rate variability during sleep, to the development of PTSD in subjects with recent traumatic injuries.
Methods
Subjects who had recall of life-threatening experiences were recruited from one of two regional trauma centers. Select subjects received a polysomnographic recording within 1 month of the trauma. Digitized electrocardiogram recordings were extracted from early and late rapid-eye-movement (REM) and preceding non-REM sleep periods. Autoregression was applied to R-R interval time series to calculate the ratios of low-frequency to high-frequency spectral densities (LF/HF ratios), which index sympathetic activation. Posttraumatic stress disorder status was determined at 2 months.
Results
There was a significant state Ã— group interaction: LF/HF ratios were higher during the REM sleep of the nine subjects who were positive for PTSD symptoms, compared with the 10 subjects who were PTSD negative.
Conclusions
Our findings are consistent with the possibility that increased noradrenergic activity during REM sleep contributes to the development of PTSD.

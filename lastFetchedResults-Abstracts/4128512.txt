A novel low-loss SAW (surface acoustic wave) filter for an intermediate frequency (IF) circuit in a color TV receiver has been developed. It consists of an apodized bidirectional and an unapodized group-type unidirectional transducer. The unidirectional transducer is designed to use different numbers of finger pairs in sending and reflecting electrodes for extension of the impedance-matching range. A thin-film capacitor for use as a phase shifter is monolithically fabricated on a 128 degrees Y-X LiNbO/sub 3/ substrate. A low insertion loss (11.3 dB) and impedance matching without adjustment are achieved at the same time without increasing the device chip size or number of electrical parts.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

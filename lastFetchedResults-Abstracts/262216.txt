A study is performed to find the optimal operating conditions of hydrogen polymer electrolyte fuel cells using an efficient optimization approach based on validated multi-resolution fuel cell simulation tool developed in house. Through the design of experiment method, a set of designed simulation runs were carried out using the fuel cell simulation tool. Based on the simulation results, an analytic metamodel was then constructed using the radial basis function approach. A feasible sequential quadratic programming scheme was then employed to optimize the metamodel to achieve the global optimal solutions. To illustrate the optimization approach, four control parameters including cell temperature, cathode stoichiometry, cathode pressure, and cathode relative humidity were considered. The optimization objective is defined as the maximization of the overall efficiency of the fuel cell system under ideal or realistic system assumptions. The study shows that different optimal solutions exist for different system assumptions, as well as different current loading levels, classified into small, medium, and large current densities. The approach adopted in this study is generic and can be readily applied to a larger number of control parameters and further to the fuel cell design optimizations.

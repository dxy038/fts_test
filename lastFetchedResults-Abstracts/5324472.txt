In order to carry out quantitative evaluation of technology readiness of weapon equipment in the engineering development phase, a detailed method for evaluating technology readiness level is proposed. Based on the feature that technology engineering performance parameter is objective and quantifiable and Key Engineering Performance Parameter(KEPP) being taken as evaluation index for technology readiness assessment(TRA), quantitative evaluation method of TRA is put forward in this approach and the calculating method of technology performance risk index is presented in light of degree of difficulty(DD) of technology.

Investigation of L-band linear cavity multiwavelength Brillouin-erbium fiber laser source has been experimentally studied. The effects of Brillouin pump power and wavelength on the threshold pump power are discussed in the paper. We found that there is a limited range for Brillouin pump wavelength to achieve a lasing condition in the laser cavity. Low threshold power of 23.4 mW is obtained from the linear cavity due to highly efficient from both double-pass amplification in the erbium gain medium and also bidirectional generation of Brillouin Stokes in the single mode fiber.

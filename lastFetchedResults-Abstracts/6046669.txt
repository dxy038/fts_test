Objective to investigate the plasma NT-proBNP in value in early diagnosis of aged patients with diastolic heart failure. 26 cases of cardiac function in normal checkup for the control group, a clear diagnosis in patients with systolic heart failure (LVEF&lt;;50%) Group of 25 cases, normal heart diastolic heart failure (LVEF &#8805; 50%, E/A &#8804; 1) 32 cases and heart expanding group of 38 cases of diastolic heart failure. ELISA method for the determination of plasma NT-proBNP concentration. Results 1. NYHA functional class associated with the NT-proBNP concentration is notable is a line (r=0.658, P&lt;;0.01), LVEF associated with NT-proBNP concentration is significantly negative linear (r=-0.608, P&lt;;0.01), NT-proBNP statistically significant difference between the NYHA classification (P&lt;;0.01). 2. the Group of plasma NT-proBNP level in heart failure with significant statistical differences between the various groups (P&lt;;0.01). Plasma NT-proBNP conclusions can do for objective indicators for evaluating severity of heart failure; Especially for early diagnosis of diastolic heart failure.

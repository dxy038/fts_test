Objective: In regard to the importance of measuring mechanical properties in studying of wound healing, a tensiometric technique was designed to measure mechanical characterization of the breaking and tensile strengths of linear incision wound healing in the rat.
Material and Methods: A tesiometer was designed with two clamps, a system of pully and thread, a transducer, water containers and a physiograph. Precision of the instrument was evaluated on 29 skin wounds, made on the back of 29 male Albino rats (200-250gr), 30 days after surgical procedure. Animals were divided into three groups as control 1 (n=10), control 2 (n=10) and trial (n=9), at the begining of experiments, animals were insised 3 cm of fullthickness derm is in the midline of the back. Mechanical measurements were obtained 30 days after surgical procedure in all of animals. In animals of control group 1, mechanical measurements were obtained by a routine method (in vitro). In the trial group mechanical properties of the skin were measured and recorded in vivo by a physiograph. Mechanical properties of the healed wound in control group 2 were measured same as the trial group but two dynamometers were used in horizontal position between one of the clamps in each side of animal. The power of breaking strength was showed by dynamometers.
Results: Statistical analyses showed that there was no significant relation between the mean of breaking strength and tensile strength in controls and trial groups. It is concluded that the designed tensiometer has enough accuracy for measuring mechanical properties of wound healing, and is able to record data by a physiograph.

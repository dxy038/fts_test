The objective of this paper is to present a numerical algorithm for calculating hyperelastic constitutive
equations characterizing the thermomechanical response of elastically isotropic elastic-viscoplastic materials.
The algorithm is developed within the context of an alternative formulation of plasticity in which elastic
distortional deformation is determined directly by integrating an evolution equation which includes the
current velocity gradient and quantities that depend only on the present state of the material. Consequently,
the formulation is independent of the particular choice of a measure of plastic deformation, the reference
configuration, and the total deformation gradient from the reference configuration. These features allow the
constitutive equations to be easily implemented into computer codes which currently use a hypoelastic
formulation for calculating plasticity.

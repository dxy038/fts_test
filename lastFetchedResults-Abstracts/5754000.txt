This paper addresses a feedback control methodology for asynchronous sequential machines. The control objective is model matching, namely designing a controller that compensates the closed-loop system so that it can match the behavior of a reference model. In particular, we propose a one-step corrective controller, which undergoes a minimum number of state transitions when operating the correction procedure. We present the existence condition and design procedure for the one-step corrective controller that realizes model matching with a given model. A controller with reduced state numbers requires a more strict condition on reachability of the considered machine than dynamic controllers. An illustrative example is provided for verifying the applicability of the proposed scheme.

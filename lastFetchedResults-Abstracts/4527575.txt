Image records are of extreme importance in the security technology. Recent color photographic cameras are mostly constructed in a single-chip sensor configuration and the color splitting structure is designed as a planar filter array, therefore some interpolation technique has to be used to compute full-color image. The final image quality is affected by selected interpolation technique. The applied interpolating algorithms are perceptually optimized but the security technology criteria are different. Four state-of-art interpolation techniques have been applied on the selected set of security image tests. After that the image quality has been evaluated by the group of observers and two different objective quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM) have been calculated for comparison. As security image tests, a human face has been chosen and test target has been partially covered by distracters (sunblind) and recorded under complex illumination conditions. Furthermore the influence of SNR is discussed and demonstrated.

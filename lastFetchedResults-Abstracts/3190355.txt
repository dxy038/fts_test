The objective of the study is to provide a method to simulate the mechanical behavior of windscreen laminated glass. The polyvinyl butyral (PVB) laminated glass is manufactured by pressing a layer of PVB film in between two pieces of glass plates under the high temperature condition. In this study, windscreen models are developed using different combination of glass and PVB with various connection types and two mesh sizes (5mm &amp; 10mm). Then each windscreen model was impacted with standard adult headform under LS-DYNA environment and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literature. The results show that the behavior of windscreen developed with double layered shell elements of glass and PVB each with tied element connection simulates best the test results. Furthermore, the influence of fracture stress of glass on the above mentioned windscreen was investigated. It was observed that the area of crack and the peak value of headform acceleration are determined by the critical fracture stress and 50MPa fracture stress of glass best predicts the headform acceleration level and the cracks of windscreen.

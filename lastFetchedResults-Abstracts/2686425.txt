This paper presents an economic study to find the switches that should participate in a switch upgrade plan, based on the results of reconfiguration. The traditional reconfiguration problem trend considers only one loading condition (mostly maximum demand), in order to find the optimum reconfiguration. However, as the distribution loading condition has hourly and daily variations, the optimum configuration continuously changes. Consequently, considering only one loading condition might lead to inefficiency of the results. In this paper, daily load curves of different types of distribution consumers, during various types of days (weekdays and holidays) and seasons (summer and winter), are used to obtain the best reconfiguration hours during a day. Then, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to obtain the optimum configuration during each time interval. The objective function applied to GA consists of loss and energy not supplied. The switches that contribute to reconfiguration should be remotely controlled in order to have the capability of immediate mode alteration. In order to evaluate the feasibility of automated switch installation, the benefit-to-cost ratio is calculated. The entire procedure is applied to a test distribution system, and the results are discussed in this paper.

Knowledge about water in soil profile and the efficiency with which crop use this water is essential for replacing conventional summer fallow with the objective to optimize legume-wheat rotation system in rainfed areas. A 2-year field experiments were carried out to assess the effects of rotational systems on crop yield, N2-fixation and water use efficiency (WUE) in two different locations of rainfed Pothwar. Two legumes crops (mung bean, Vigna radiata & mash bean, V. mungo) along with reference sorghum Sorghum bicolor were rotated with wheat (Triticum aestivum). The WUE values on N2-fixation basis was 25% and 16% higher in mash and mung bean with P fertilization over legumes with out P. WUE on grain basis 2.09 kg ha-1 mm-1, was 16% higher than mung bean with P fertilization. Over all 29% increase in grain WUE of legumes was observed in succeeding year. Soil water contents were 31% higher under mash bean fertilized with P than sorghum. Soil water distribution across soil profile showed that maximum quantity of water was found at 60-90 cm depth. Total soil profile water contents were 25 cm 100 cm-1, under legumes and lower, 23 cm 100 cm-1, under non-legume sorghum at harvest. Grain WUE of wheat was found 11-44% higher in the plots, which were previously under legumes crops as compared to non-legume sorghum. The P fertilization to legumes increased grain WUE of wheat by 22% compared to that of control. Â© Friends Science Publishers

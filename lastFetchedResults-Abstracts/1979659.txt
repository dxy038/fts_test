These teaching notes correspond to the Dole Carbon Neutral Fruits' case. Dole faces the issue of whether and how to begin producing carbon neutral bananas and pineapples. The teaching notes provide a short synopsis of the case, followed by suggestions of how to use the case, teaching objectives and finally, assignment questions. The assignment questions focus on strategic issues, so an overall look at the entire industry and market is presented and discussed. This discussion is followed by a closer look at the tropical fruits value chain, since carbon emissions along the value chain are distributed very unevenly, leading to disproportionate responsibilities in the carbon neutral strategy. To conclude the analysis, the financial performance of the company is reviewed with the objective to evaluate the financial implications of the different alternatives. The teaching notes finish with a short summary of the company's decision.

Sloshing absorbers work on a similar principle to that of tuned vibration absorbers. A sloshing absorber consists of a tank, partially filled with liquid. The absorber is attached to the structure to be controlled, and relies on the structure's motion to excite the liquid. Consequently, a sloshing wave is produced at the liquid free surface possessing energy dissipative qualities to suppress excessive vibrations of the structure.

n's egg has evolved to dissipate vibration energy rapidly to protect its contents. An uncooked hen's egg's capability to rapidly dissipate potentially harmful energy, is due to sloshing of its contents. Hence, there may be lessons to learn from the natural design of an egg which could be employed in the engineered (artificial) design of a sloshing absorber.

imary objective of this work is to identify the physical events responsible for effective energy dissipation in an eggshell, at different fill levels. A secondary objective is to demonstrate the suitability of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method for numerical predictions in such an unusually shaped shell. Through numerical predictions, the possibility of modifying the egg's design to further encourage dissipation patterns is explored briefly. Simple experiments are also presented to check the validity of the numerical predictions.

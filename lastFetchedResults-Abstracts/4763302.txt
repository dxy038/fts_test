The objective of this paper is to discuss and show advantages of the application of network-based intelligent distributed surveillance systems. The paper highlights the importance of capturing the appropriate user requirements in defining what is "fit for purpose" and covers the process and systems available that can be applied in this area. There is a section on key enabling technologies found in network-based surveillance solutions. It is important to emphasise that multiuse systems are not possible without the collaboration of key stakeholders. The paper also highlights potential challenges that designers and suppliers may face in development of large scale systems. The paper concludes by looking ahead at the power of intelligent cognitive "expert" systems that may enable a more efficient and safer public safety environment in high profile public spaces such as airports but raises some challenges around the Data Protection Act (DPA) and Human Rights Act.

The problem of dynamic optimization of a class of mass transportation systems is formulated, and a method for optimal solutions is developed. The dynamic formulation is based on previously estimated supply decision functions and disaggregate demand specifications. Conditions for the existence and stability of solutions are derived to establish the necessary boundary conditions for the optimization. Maximization of a cost-effectiveness objective is sought subject to performance constraints, while cost is the control. The optimal control algorithm uses PontryaginÂ´s necessary conditions of optimality with a penalty method. The initial values of the adjoint vector and the penalty coefficients are evaluated in such a way that the final conditions are satisfied and the extremal distances between the obtained trajectory and the constraints are imposed

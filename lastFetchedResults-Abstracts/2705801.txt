Evacuation planning with the contraflow technique is a complex planning problem. The problem is further complicated when more realistic situations such as evacuation priorities and the setup time for the contraflow operation are considered. Such a complex problem has yet to be discussed in the present literature. In this paper, we present a multiple-objective optimization model for this problem and a two-layer algorithm to solve this model. Experiments on three transportation networks with different network scales are presented to show the excellent performance of the proposed model and algorithm.

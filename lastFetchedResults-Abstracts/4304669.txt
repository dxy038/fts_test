A Class-E power amplifier has been designed to operate at 2.5 GHz using a commercial, packaged GaAs pHEMT. The design approach used a novel analysis of the package impedances. The objective was to present optimal harmonic loads to the transistor, using lumped-component matching on commercial PCB material. Using an MRFG35010 plastic packaged transistor, a drain efficiency of 72% with about 3 W output power was achieved at 2.55 GHz.

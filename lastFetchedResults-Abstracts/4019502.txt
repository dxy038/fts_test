Our objective is to provide a forum for sharing problems, experiences, and solutions that can help establish bridges among hardware engineers, software engineers, systems engineers, and project managers. We seek to publicize innovative solutions and engineering methodologies that address: complexity, model-based engineering (as exemplified by hardware/software codesign), and process management. We believe these three areas are critical to advancing the successful, integrated engineering of computer-based systems

This paper describes the voltage sag power quality issues pertaining to the semiconductor high-tech customers at Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park of Taiwan Power CompanyÂ´s System. TPC has initiated a project for Study and Monitoring of the Solution to Distribution Power Quality at Xfab of HSIP. The objective of the study is to use EPRI developed tools, hardware, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment susceptibility knowledge to measure, analyze, and recommend solutions to mitigate power quality problems being experienced by Xfab at HSIP. The PQ monitoring experiences and preliminary results, based on the mid-term report of the project, are presented.

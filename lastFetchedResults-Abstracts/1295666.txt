In this paper we present two approaches to duality in multiple objective linear programming. The first approach is based on a duality relation between maximal elements of a set and minimal elements of its complement. It offers a general duality scheme which unifies a number of known dual constructions and improves several existing duality relations. The second approach utilizes polarity between a convex polyhedral set and the epigraph of its support function. It leads to a parametric dual problem and yields strong duality relations, including those of geometric duality.

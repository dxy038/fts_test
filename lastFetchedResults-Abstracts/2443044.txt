In this paper, we develop a new efficient graph construction algorithm that is useful for many learning tasks. Unlike the main stream for graph construction, our proposed data self-representativeness approach simultaneously estimates the graph structure and its edge weights through sample coding. Compared with the recent â„“ 1 graph based on sparse coding, our proposed objective function has an analytical solution (based on self-representativeness of data) and thus is more efficient. This paper has two main contributions. Firstly, we introduce a principled Two Phase Weighted Regularized Least Square graph construction method. Secondly, the obtained data graph is used, in a semi-supervised context, in order to categorize detected objects in outdoor and indoor scenes using Local Binary Patterns as image descriptors. In many previous works, LBP descriptors (histograms) were used as feature vectors for object detection and recognition. However, our work exploits them in order to construct adaptive graphs using a self-representativeness coding. The experiments show that the proposed method can outperform competing methods.

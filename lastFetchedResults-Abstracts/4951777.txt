Preventive Maintenance Scheduling of generating units is an important requirement in a power system planning. The maintenance of the various equipments in a power System, especially the maintenance of generators is directly related to the overall reliability of the power system. However, the Maintenance Scheduling (MS) problem is a constrained optimization problem. The objective function of this problem is to reduce the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) for a power system. This paper presents Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to solve the constrained optimization problem. The algorithm is tested with a three unit system and well being index is evaluated for the system. The proposed approach aims at providing a feasible maintenance schedule for the generating units.

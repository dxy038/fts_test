Quantifying crop water consumption is essential for many applications in agriculture, such as crop zoning, yield forecast and irrigation management. The objective of this study was to determine evaporation (E), transpiration (T) and dual crop coefficients (Ke and Kcb) of coffee trees during crop production (3rd and 4th year of cultivation), conducted under sprinkler and drip irrigation and no irrigation, in Londrina, Paraná State, Brazil. Crop evapotranspiration (ET) was measured by weighing lysimeters cultivated with plants of cultivar IAPAR 59, E was measured by microlysimeters installed on the lysimeters and T was obtained by the difference between ET and E. The crop coefficient (Kc) was determined for the irrigated treatments as the ratio between ET and the reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Similarly, evaporation coefficient (Ke) and basal crop coefficient (Kcb) were determined as the ratio of E and T, respectively, to the value of ETo, which was estimated by the ASCE Penman–Monteith method on an hourly basis. The values of E and Ke varied due to atmospheric demand and water application method. Those factors, in addition to crop phenology and leaf area evolution, also influenced T and Kcb. Regardless irrigation treatment, the measured values of E represented 35% of ET, while T was 65% of ET. The recommended values of Ke were 0.46 and 0.26 for sprinkler and drip irrigation, respectively. The recommended values of Kcb were 0.52 and 0.82 for sprinkler-irrigated, and 0.5 and 0.65 for drip-irrigated treatments, varying as a function of daily ETo (ETo ≥ or <3 mm day−1, respectively).

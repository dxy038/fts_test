Trickle bed reactor performance and safety may suffer from radial and axial liquid maldistribution and thus from non-uniform utilization of
the catalyst packing. Therefore, experimental analysis and fluid dynamic simulation of liquid–gas flow in trickle bed reactors is an important
topic in chemical engineering. In the present study for the first time a truly high-resolution gamma ray tomography technique was applied to the
quantitative analysis of the liquid flow texture in a laboratory cold flow trickle bed reactor of 90mm diameter. The objective of this study was
to present the comparative analysis of the liquid flow dynamics for two different initial liquid distributions and two different types of reactor
configurations. Thus, the hydrodynamic behavior of a glass bead packing was compared to a porous Al2O3 catalyst particle packing using inlet
flow from a commercial spray nozzle (uniform initial liquid distribution) and inlet flow from a central point source (strongly non-uniform initial
liquid distribution), respectively. The column was operated in downflow mode at a gas flow rate of 180 L h−1 and at liquid flow rates of 15 and
25Lh^−1.

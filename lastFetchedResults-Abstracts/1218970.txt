The DnaA protein is essential for initiation of DNA replication in a wide variety of bacterial and plasmid replicons. The replication origin in these replicons invariably contains specific binding sites for the protein, called DnaA boxes. Plasmid P1 contains a set of DnaA boxes at each end of its origin but can function with either one of the sets. Here we report that the location of origin-opening, initiation site of replication forks and directionality of replication do not change whether the boxes are present at both or at one of the ends of the origin. Replication was bidirectional in all cases. These results imply that DnaA functions similarly from the two ends of the origin. However, origins with DnaA boxes proximal to the origin-opening location opened more efficiently and maintained plasmids at higher copy numbers. Origins with the distal set were inactive unless the adjacent P1 DNA sequences beyond the boxes were included. At either end, phasing of the boxes with respect to the remainder of the origin influenced the copy number. Thus, although the boxes can be at either end, their precise context is critical for efficient origin function.

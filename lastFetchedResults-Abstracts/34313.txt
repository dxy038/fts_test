Serologic diagnosis of bovine paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) with currently available tests may give false-positive results due to cross-reactions with avian and bovine tuberculosis viruses and other infectious agents. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for detection of antibodies against paratuberculosis based on antigens from Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (A-ELISA) and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (P-ELISA) were compared. Despite an expected higher specificity for M. a. parntuberculosis in the P-ELISA, the 2 antigens were equally suitable for demonstration of antibody to M. a. paratuberculosis in cattle. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to demonstrate the possible antigenic relationship. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each of the 2 ROC curves. The AUC for the PELISA ROC curve was 0.9197, and the AUC for the A-ELISA ROC curve was 0.9149, demonstrating a negligible difference in efficiency of the 2 tests (z = 0.182).

Objective:The goal of the present survey is to study the relationship between metacognition with 
belief in astrology and superstition and psychiatric health in two groups of the students in the 
fields of psychology and techno- engineering in the province Ardabil. Method: The sample mass 
of this survey was composed of 200 students of psychology and techno-engineering which were 
elected by the simple random sampling. Metacognition questionnaire (Cart-Wright â€“Hawtonwels 
,1997 ) and astrology and superstition questionnaire (Signet ,1987) and psychiatric health scale 
(Goldberg & hiller , 1979) were used for collecting data . Data of the survey was analyzed by 
Pierson statistical correlation method and (T) test. Results: Results of the survey indicated, there 
is a meaningful vice versa relationship between the two factors of metacognition and belief in 
superstition and there is a positive meaningful relationship between the belief in astrology and 
superstition and psychiatric health. Also it was presumed from the assumed information that there 
is no relation between metacognition and psychiatric health. The present survey demonstrates 
there is no difference among students of psychology and techno- engineering in metacognition and 
this difference was not observed in their belief in superstition and astrology and there is a 
meaningful relation among psychology students and techno-engineering students in their 
psychiatric health.Conclusion: Results gained from the present survey exerts that degree of belief 
in astrology and superstition in individuals who have better cognition and understanding of 
themselves is less than others and the higher the belief in astrology and superstition, the higher the 
psychiatric health level of the individual would be.

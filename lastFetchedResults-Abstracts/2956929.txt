ADTT (Advanced Digital Television Technologies) project, which started in June 94 will come to an end on 31 December 1996. The ADTT project is a EUREKA cooperative research project. Its objective is to maintain a high level of knowledge and technology in the field of advanced digital TV technologies without aiming at a defined introduction date of an HDTV service. 41 partners from 10 European countries are participating in this project. Its main goal was to set up a demonstrator of a complete DVB/MPEG2 compliant HD broadcasting chain. At the end of 1995, and in addition to this main goal, ADTT has started three sub-projects in the area of nonbroadcasting applications: (1) cinema oriented electronic production; (2) electronic theatre networks; (3) enhanced and high definition video communication

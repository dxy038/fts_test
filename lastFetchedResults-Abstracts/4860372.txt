Describes an approach for transmitter network modelling based on graph theory, that has more capabilities than current lattice planning methods. The model can take into account topography and morphography by interfaces to a wave propagation model and a terrain data base. Thus it will be able to access hidden topographical spectrum reserves. Transmitters can have arbitrary site, power and antenna diagram. Special problems of network tuning like planning gap-filling transmitters and multiple coverage can be handled. A graph theoretical model is described, objective functions and boundary conditions are discussed and an algorithm for minimizing interference during channel assignment is shown

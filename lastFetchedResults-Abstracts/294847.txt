A technique for the objective measurement of one parameter of burn scar hypertrophy is described. The technique involves capturing a video camera image on a computer and subsequent quantitative analysis of the colour of the scar using a custom-written computer programme1. By analysing multiple areas and comparing the identical areas over the course of treatment, it is theoretically possible to measure the progress and compare differing modes of therapy.

Visual saliency signifies the region of perceptual significance in an image to human vision system (HVS). It is the inherent quality that discriminates an object from its neighbors. The Saliency map computes such regions in an image. In this paper, we present the application of Wavelet domain data hiding in such prominent regions. The proposed algorithm embeds information into visually interesting areas within the host image, determined by the visual attention model. This algorithm is very simple in structure but enhanced robustness to survive against various geometric and filtering attacks. A thoroughly verified subjective and objective evaluation speaks out our claim of enhanced ability in maintaining image quality under such impairment.

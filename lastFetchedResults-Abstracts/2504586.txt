Background: There is some evidence regarding the effect of poly unsaturated fatty acid intake on androgen levels and gonadal function in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Objective: This study was conducted to determine the effect of omega-3 supplementation on sex hormone-binding protein (SHBG), testosterone, free androgen index (FAI) and menstrual status in women with PCOS.
Materials and Methods: This double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on 78 overweight/obese women with PCOS. Participants were randomized to receive omega-3 (3gr/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. Data about weight, height and nutrient intake as well as blood samples were collected before and after intervention. Serum concentrations of testosterone (nmol/L) and SHBG (nmol/L) were measured. FAI was also calculated as the ratio of testosterone to SHBG.
Results: Seventy eight patients (age: 26.92±5.46 yrs, Body Mass Index: 31.69±4.84 Kg/m2) completed the study. There was no significant difference in mean age, weight, height, Body Mass Index and intake of energy, and macronutrients between 2 study groups before and after treatment. All the participants had irregular periods. After the trial the percentage of regular menstruation in the omega-3 group was more than the placebo group (47.2% vs. 22.9%, p=0.049). Furthermore, testosterone concentration was significantly lower in the omega-3 group compared with placebo, after supplementation (p=0.04). SHBG and FAI did not change in either group.
Conclusion: Omega-3 supplementation could reduce serum concentrations of testosterone and regulate menstrual cycle without significant effect on SHBG and FAI. Future studies with longer period of supplementation are warranted.

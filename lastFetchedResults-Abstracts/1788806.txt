Photon-echo experiments in a Y2SiO5 crystal codoped with Eu3+, Pr3+ and Nd3+ were performed with the objective of studying the influence of excited neighboring ions on the rephasing properties of the ions studied by the coherent transient technique. A strong ‘scrambler’ pulse was applied to ions of one species before (or while) a two-pulse photon-echo experiment was carried out on a different species. The dependence of the echo intensity on the ‘scrambler’ wavelength as well as on the time delay between ‘scrambler’ pulse and echo sequence was investigated. Experimental agreement with a simple model has been obtained.

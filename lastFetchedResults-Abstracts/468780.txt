Objective
We hypothesized that normal fetal breathing, not acute asphyxial gasping, results in the movement of iron dextran from the amniotic cavity into the fetal lungs. In addition, the amount of iron dextran moving into the fetal lungs is cumulative with time.
Study design
Twelve pregnant New Zealand White rabbits at 25 days of gestation were sedated and underwent ultrasound-guided injections of iron dextran into the amniotic cavities of the rabbit fetuses in both horns of each pregnant doe. Oxygen saturation was maintained at >90% in the pregnant does. The 12 does were then equally assigned to four groups on the basis of the duration of fetal exposure to the dextran (0, 8, 16, and 24 hours). At the end of each time point, one half of the fetuses received an intracardiac injection of potassium chloride to induce gasping just before necropsy. Gasping was confirmed by ultrasound scanning. At necropsy, the fetal lungs were evaluated grossly and underwent histomorphometry for iron distribution and quantification in the fetal airways.
Results
In the animals that received iron dextran, there was no significant difference in iron accumulation at any time point between those animals that did and did not receive potassium chloride, which suggests that acute gasping does not increase the accumulation of amniotic fluid substances in the lungs. The amount of iron in the fetal airways increased significantly with progressive length of exposure.
Conclusion
We conclude that normal fetal breathing, not acute asphyxial gasping, resulted in the movement of intra-amniotic iron dextran into the fetal lungs and that the amount of substances that move into the fetal lungs accumulated with time

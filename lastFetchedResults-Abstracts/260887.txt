The objective of this paper is to derive the conditions for long-run neutrality assuming a model with nonstationary variables. First, we derive expressions that account for the long-run differential of a variable on another variable. We then obtain the conditions for long-run neutrality in terms of restrictions on the parameters of what we call the “structural form” of the model

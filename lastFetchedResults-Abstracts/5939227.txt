High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) can be used as a minimal invasive therapeutic modality for ablating diseased tissue. The objective of the present investigation was to determine the effect of of HIFU treatment on adjacent tissue of the treatment zone (i.e., tissue in the near field of the HIFU beam). Activity of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase and protein kinase C (PKC), and expression of early response gene (c-jun) were chosen to investigate changes in intracellular signalling in rat liver following HIFU treatment

Automatic recognition of parts is an important problem with applications in sorting parts for packing and assembly. Our objective is to recognize parts using inexpensive, widely-available robot hardware as an alternative to machine vision. Specifically, our aim is to determine the shape of a polygonal part from a sequence of diameter (width) measurements made by grasping the part with an instrumented parallel-jaw gripper. Since complete determination of shape is not possible using just diameter measurements, we consider the problem of recognizing a part from a known (finite) set of parts. Given a set of parts with a total of N faces, of which n are stable, we first construct an internal representation of the stable faces in O(N+n<sup>4</sup>) time. Then we give two off-line planning algorithms: one constructs an optimal sensing plan in time O(n<sup>4</sup>2<sup>n</sup>) the other constructs a suboptimal sensing plan in time O(n<sup>2</sup> log n). Neither plan requires more than n+1 online measurements

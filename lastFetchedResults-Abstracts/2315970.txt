The main objective of this work is to present the first version of the automatic mesocyclone detection algorithm for the Spanish weather Doppler radar, which has been developed during the last year at the Spanish Meteorological Service (INM). Taking into account that mesocyclones and other significant wind structures can be readily detected by single Doppler radar, the algorithm is based on the NSSL-MDA (The National Severe Storms Laboratory Mesoscale Detection Algorithm) approximation. It is specifically designed to automatically detect and identify radial velocity patterns associated with small-scale vortices and others wind structures. The different steps in the algorithm will be discussed and the application to a real situation will be presented. During 2004, the algorithm has been tested in an experimental phase, trying to adjust the needed parameters and thresholds. The plan for the future is to implement it within the operational procedure to automatically identify, analyse, diagnose, track and extrapolate convective structures and cells in radar data, improving the ability of the forecasters to provide timely warning of hazardous convective events.

As a new heuristic approach, differential evolution has shown superior performance in continuous space capable of handling nondifferentiable, nonlinear and multimodal objective functions. This paper reports a study of DE to operate on discrete binary variables, which are test patterns of sequential circuits. Preliminary experimental results of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) for sequential circuits based on DE are provided and comparisons are discussed

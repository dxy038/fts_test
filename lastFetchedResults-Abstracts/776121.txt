Introduction: The main objective of all organizations is to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the personnel’s performance and this partly
depends on effective management. Managers are valuable assets and studying
their behavior and personality dimensions may provide important guide for
effectiveness and efficiency improvement. In this connection, the objective
of this research is to determine the association between organizational
effectiveness and the personnel managers’ position of control in Shiraz
University of Medical Sciences.
Methods: The present research is a cross-sectional study. The statistical
societies of this research included all personnel and personnel managers in
Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. 168 subjects of 8 departments were
selected through accidental-stratified sampling and the data for the managers
of these departments were also collected. Two questionnaires, organizational
effectiveness and Ratters’ position of control, were used for data collection.
Results: The results of this research showed that there was a significant
association between organizational effectiveness and managers’ position of
control. However, we didn’t find a statistically significant association between
organizational effectiveness and managers’ position of control in terms of their
sex, managerial experience and education.
Conclusion: As managers with internal position of control are more effective
than those with external position of control, we can appoint individuals with
internal control position to managerial posts. Furthermore, we can train
managers to shift their external position of control to the internal one.

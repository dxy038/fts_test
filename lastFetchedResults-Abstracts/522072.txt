Objective: The implementation of family psychoeducation at the service delivery level is not without difficulty. Few mental health professionals receive special training to work with families especially in Iran. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of training health professionals in terms of their adherence to protocol. Method: Eight professionals (general practitioners, nurses and social workers) participated in a training program for health professionals as part of the Roozbeh First-Episode Psychosis Program (RooF) to conduct family psychoeducation. Training included a 3-day- workshop and 12 supervision sessions during the course of the implementation of the psychoeducation program. The family psychoeducation sessions (multiple-family group or single-family home-based) were tape-recorded. Transcripts of the audiotaped sessions were analyzed based on the content of the manual and were scored accordingly. Results: Twenty-four recorded sessions were analyzed in terms of the adherence to protocol, the number of questions and the time for each session. The overall rating showed a 72% adherence to the protocol. Multiple-family group sessions had a higher rate compared to the singlefamily home-based family psychoeducation sessions (79% to 69%) as well as the time spent and questions asked. The rate of adherence to the protocol of conducting the family psychoeducation sessions had not changed over time . Conclusion: Considering the amount of time taken for training and supervision, the level of adherence to the protocol was satisfactory. Tape recording sessions and regular supervision would be beneficial following specialized training. Further research is needed to tailor the amount of training and supervision required for professionals to conduct family psychoeducation programs in different settings.

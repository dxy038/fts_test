In order to support different types of multimedia applications, the IEEE 802.16 standard defines different service classes with their associated quality of service (QoS) parameters [1]. The scheduling algorithm is the crucial point in QoS provisioning over such broadband wireless access (BWA) network and it is important that the scheduling algorithm have a multi-dimensional objective of satisfying QoS requirements of the users, maximizing system utilization and ensuring fairness among users [2], [3]. In this article we present two different scheduling algorithms for the uplink (UL) connection. One is a combination of legacy scheduling algorithms earliest deadline first (EDF) and weighted fair queuing (WFQ). The other proposed algorithm is a cross-layer algorithm that pledges fairness among admitted connections and it also supports all service classes.

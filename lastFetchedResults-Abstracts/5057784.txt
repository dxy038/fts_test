It´s necessary to create a credible and general evaluating index model in network threat assessment. According to the network indices´ effect, this paper proposed an algorithm which combines grey correlation degree in grey theory with traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine the indices. It considered both objective and subjective factors. Experiments showed that this method had a strict mathematical theory basis, a definite meaning and a high practical value. It improved the evaluation methods´ credibility of network threat assessment.

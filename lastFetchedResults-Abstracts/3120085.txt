In this paper, a design and analysis of compact coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed ultra wideband (UWB) slot antenna is presented. The proposed antenna has simple structure consisting of rectangular slot, triangular structure on a rectangular patch act as a tuning stub of the antenna, placed at the anterior portion of the feed. The overall dimension of the antenna comes around 28 mm times 21 mm times 1.6 mm and fed by 50 coplanar waveguide. The impedance matching and radiation characteristics of the designed structure are investigated by using MoM based commercially available electromagnetic solver IE3D. The simulation results show that the antenna offers excellent performance for UWB system ranging from 3.3 GHz to 11.5 GHz and the impedance bandwidth of the antenna covers about 98% of UWB range with return loss better than -10 dB over the desired frequency spectrum. The proposed antenna gives bidirectional pattern in the E plane and omni directional radiation pattern in the H plane over the frequency range and relatively stable. This antenna configuration would be quiet useful for UWB indoor applications as it is easy to fabricate and integrate with RF circuitry.

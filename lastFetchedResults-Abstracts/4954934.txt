Objective image/video quality measures play important roles in various image/video processing applications, such as compression, communication, printing, analysis, registration, restoration and enhancement. Most proposed quality assessment approaches in the literature are error sensitivity-based methods. We follow a new philosophy in designing image/video quality metrics, which uses structural distortion as an estimation of perceived visual distortion. We develop a new approach for video quality assessment. Experiments on the video quality experts group (VQEG) test data set shows that the new quality measure has higher correlation with subjective quality measurement than the proposed methods in VQEGÂ´s Phase I tests for full-reference video quality assessment.

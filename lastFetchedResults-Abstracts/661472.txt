Most of the N in surface soils occurs in organic forms, and when mineralized it plays a key role in soil fertility and plant nutrition. Our objective was to study the effect of long-term applications of organic manure on the content and distribution of forms of organic N in bulk soil and soil particle size fractions to characterize the inherent soil nitrogen fertility. Five treatments were as follows: (1) CK (no fertilizer and no manure added), (2) mineral fertilizer only, (3) straw + NPK, (4) green manure + NPK and (5) pig manure + NPK. Soil particle size fractions (0–2, 2–10, 10–50 and 50–100 μm) were isolated without chemical pretreatment by ultrasonic dispersion in water followed by sedimentation. The content of total N and forms of organic N in the bulk soil increased after long-term fertilization, and the effect varied with fertilizer type. The plot treated with only mineral fertilizer gave the highest NH3-N and the lowest amino sugar-N content in all treatments. The highest content of amino sugar-N and amino acid-N was found in the treatment of pig manure + NPK. The content (g kg−1 fraction) of hydrolysable N within size fractions was in the order 0–2>2–10>50–100>10–50 μm, but the contribution of different size fraction to hydrolysable N decreased in the sequence 10–50>0–2>2–10>50–100 μm. Most of the applied mineral fertilizer N that remained in soils was distributed in the particle size fraction < 2 μm while most of the remaining N from manure applied with NPK was transferred into amino sugar-N in each size fraction, and amino acid-N in the size fractions > 2 μm during the process of humification.

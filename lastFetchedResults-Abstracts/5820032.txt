Objective: To analyze the strain distribution and drug sensitivity of Candida mycoderma isolated from patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis(VVC), to provide evidence for clinical rational drug use. Method:119 clinical strains were from patients´ leucorrhea sample. Those patients saw a doctor in TCM hospital of Guangdong Province´s Gynaecological and Dermatological department. Those clinical strains were detected by Chromagar candida colored culture medium and API / ATB kits, fungus drug sensitivity slab. Result: When it came to strain distribution, candida albicans accounted for 81.51%, Candida glabrata accounted for 15.13%, Candida tropicalis accounted for 1.68%, Candida parapsilosis accounted for 1.68%. When it confered to susceptibility test, the susceptibility of strains to amphotericin B was strongest. Conclusion: Candida albicans is the most important pathogenic bacterium of VVC. Other kinds of Candida mycoderma are more and more. Widespread usage of fluconazol is responsible for this phenomenon. In clinic, we should pay more attention to susceptibility test and rational use of drug to elevate therapeutic efficacy.

Software maintenance and evolution can be made easier if program comprehension techniques are used. Understanding a software system would typically necessitate a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques. The aim of this workshop is to gather together researchers working in the area of program comprehension with an emphasis on dynamic analysis. We are interested in investigating how dynamic analysis techniques are used or can be used to enable better comprehension of a software system. The objective is to find common case studies, compare existing techniques, and find possible symbioses for existing solutions. Building upon the two previous editions of the workshop, we aim to set up a forum for exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new ideas.

Ovulation-inducing agents are routinely used in broodmare practice. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two compounded deslorelin products and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in inducing ovulation in a clinical reproduction program. Breeding records of 203 mares administered an ovulation-inducing agent during the 2006 breeding season were reviewed. Estrous cycles were included for comparison if agents were administered when the largest follicle was 35 to 45 mm in diameter and endometrial edema was present. There was no significant difference (P > .05) in interval to ovulation for mares receiving deslorelin (1.9 ± 0.7 days) or hCG (2.0 ± 0.7 days). The percentage of mares that ovulated within 48 hours after treatment was also not significantly different between the agents (90.1% and 88.3%, respectively). In summary, clinical efficacy at inducing a timed ovulation in estrual mares with follicles 35 to 45 mm was similar between compounded deslorelin and hCG.

   Territory and territoriality are two key concepts in geopolitics and political geography that each of them cannot be studied without considering other. Territoriality  refers to the behavioral communication between control and space. Indeed, attempts of an individual or a group or a nation to influence or control people, phenomena, and relationships, through delimitation and monitoring a geographical area refers to territoriality phenomenon. But, discursive territoriality process refers to the goal-oriented process and definite strategy which dominant discourses, by using the domination tools are trying to generate discourse and then determine the specific territory for other people, groups or countries. The term “Shia Geopolitics “, which has been entered the west political literature after the cold war is a kind of discursive territoriality process which followed in line with the strategic interests of the west in south-west Asia. This paper, by using discursive approach is trying to explain the Shia Geopolitics discursive territoriality and dimensions behind it. In fact, the main argument of the paper is the Shia Geopolitics that the west claims, neither in  mapping nor in geographical level is objective and only discursive for sunni-shia conflict in the region and also to isolate Iran as one of the powerful Shiite countries in south west Asia.

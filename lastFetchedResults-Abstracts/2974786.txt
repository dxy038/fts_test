A controller design method which combines passivity based control and sliding mode control is presented for the feedback regulation of a class of switched power converters, the &#8220;power factor precompensators&#8221; (PFP). Aside from load voltage regulation to a prespecified constant level a vital additional control objective is to avoid reactive losses by keeping the input power factor close to unity. A passivity plus sliding mode control approach is proposed which forces the input current to follow a suitable reference signal which is in phase with the rectified supplied voltage. This results in approximately satisfying both control objectives for the converter. Simulation results are furnished for assessing the performance of the proposed feedback control laws

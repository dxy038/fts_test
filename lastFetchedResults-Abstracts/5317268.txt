Two stochastic neural models implementing a mix of clustering and factor analysis techniques are presented: the axial <e1>k</e1>-means and a more sophisticated local component analysis. Both converge to a local (resp. global) optimum of their objective function. Simulations and comparisons with classical algorithms are presented. The dynamicity of the model, i.e. instantaneous adaptation to any new data vector, is a desirable feature if many applications,

The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of solvent extraction (SE) for partial binder removal in the context of polymer co-extrusion with a thermoplastic binder component. Polymer co-extrusion is able to produce multilayered, functionally graded and/or textured structures in an efficient manufacturing process, but requires a polymer binder system with suitable flow characteristics. Traditionally, the binder is removed by thermal debinding (TD), which, however, is prone to form cracks or blisters, both of which are attributed to a lack of initial pore space that allows pyrolysis products to escape. The primary focus of this work is to demonstrate that a binder system with a high soluble binder content is suitable for conventional polymer co-extrusion and to document that a two-step binder removal process involving both SE and TD eliminates debinding defects. The overall fabrication process is documented for the extrusion of solid ceramic rods and co-extrusion of tubes, where alumina powder was batched with polyethylene butyl acrylate (PEBA) as backbone polymer and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as water soluble binder. SE for specimen with varying PEBA:PEG ratios was tested in water at three different temperatures for various times. The 1:1 mixture showed a PEG removal up to 80 wt.% of the original PEG content after 6 h extraction; after subsequent thermal debinding, rods and tubes sintered successfully without defects, demonstrating the viability of the process.

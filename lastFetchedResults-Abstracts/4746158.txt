How to properly handle the multiple conflicting objectives in automatic indoor wireless network planning is a matter of major concern. This issue has been usually addressed establishing beforehand some kind of preferences on the objectives. However, the high complexity of the indoor design problem makes any "a priori" assumption unreliable. This paper proposes a practical methodology to solve this drawback that relies on the remarkable properties of the new evolutionary multi-objective algorithms. The approach leads to an automatic system able to produce a set of adapted indoor network wireless plans that constitutes the optimal trade-off resolution of the designing conflict.

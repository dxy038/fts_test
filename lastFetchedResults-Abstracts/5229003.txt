The objective of this work is to be able to test wafer level packaged devices at 5 GHz given tight mechanical constraints such as very fine pitch (of the order of 100 micron) and large pin count of thousands. Good electrical contact at the wafer level after the attachment of interconnects is needed for producing reliable electrical test results.. This paper describes the details of modeling, fabrication and the test methodology as applied to the electrical characterization of fine pitch and large pin count wafer level packaged devices.

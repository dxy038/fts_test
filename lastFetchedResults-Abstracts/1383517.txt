In most balancing techniques currently in use, test weights and runs are required for the calculation of correction masses. This paper develops a new rotor balancing method without test runs, which uses the balancing objective of influence coefficient method and the initial phase point of Holospectrum. By calculating theoretical unbalance responses and measuring original unbalance vibrations, a new type of intelligent optimization technique, genetic algorithm, is applied to optimize the correction masses to minimize residual vibrations at selected measurement locations and balancing speeds. The implementation process and validity of this new method are discussed in detail through a numerical example, in which two cases are considered. In the field balancing experiment, a rotating rotor is balanced by employing the new method, in which average fluid oil coefficients within the balancing speeds are used in the calculation of unbalance responses, and the optimization correction masses are compared with those of the influence coefficient method. Both the simulation and experiment results show that this new method can reduce the residual vibrations effectively.

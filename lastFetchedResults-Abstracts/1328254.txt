The dynamic pulse buckling response of slender fiber-reinforce plastic (FRP) composite laminated beams, having initial geometric imperfections, subjected to an axial impulse is simulated by the finite difference method. The primary objective of this study is to study the effect of several parameters with the consideration of the beam's transverse inertia, transverse shear deformation and the cross-section's rotational inertia on the formulation of the beam. It is also desired to identify a parameter by which one can predict the onset of dynamic pulse buckling. The von-Karman nonlinear Strainâ€“Displacement relationship and the First-Order Shear Deformation Theory are used to describe the beams response. The effects of initial geometric imperfection and slenderness ratio of the beam on the pulse buckling response were investigated. The results obtained from the proposed formulation agree well with those of the finite element analysis. The numerical results show that the momentum can be considered as a criterion of pulse buckling. Also, the beam's initial geometric imperfection was found to play a more important role than its slenderness ratio.

In this paper, an energy source comprised of a PEMFC and a battery control PCS is presented, along with a mode analysis for a stand-alone fuel cell generation system. The fuel cell system includes a high frequency transformer DC/DC full-bridge converter and a single phase inverter transformed AC voltage from the DC/DC converter output power. The bidirectional DC/DC converter charges or discharges the battery. The proposed systemÂ´s control and mode analysis is verified through simulation and experimentation.

Background and objective: One of the causes of male infertility is the lack of proper mobility. One way to deal with this problem is to add adenosine to human sperms in the laboratory. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of different doses of adenosine on sperm motility in the ejaculates of fertile and infertile individuals. 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental laboratory study, 60 samples of seminal fluid of infertile and fertile men who referred to Yazd Infertility Center were analyzed according to WHO guidelines. Sperm counts, morphology and motility (fast, slow and immotile) were studied. After using Swim-up technique, the washed samples were divided into 4 groups, containing doses of 0, 2, 5 and 10 mg adenosine. The sperm parameters were evaluated after the addition of adenosine. Data were analyzed statistically using paired T-test and independent T-test. 
Results: The initial assessment indicated significant differences in sperm parameters, except for slow motility between the two groups. In fertile group, dose of 5 mg adenosine increased sperm count, and rapid motility, but lowered the rates of sperm immotility at doses of 5 and 10 mg. In the infertile group, sperm count improved at dose of 5 mg adenosine, but it showed no effect on slow sperm motility. 5 mg adenosine also improved rapid sperm motility, but dose of 10 mg had no effect. Both 5 and 10 mg adenosine significantly lowered rates of immotile sperms. 
Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that addition of 5 mg adenosine to washed sperms can improve sperm motility of infertile men in vitro.

In this paper, interleaved bidirectional DC-DC converter with ZVT cell using a single resonant inductor in continuous conduction mode is proposed. The proposed interleaved bidirectional DC-DC converter has advantages such as a simple circuit, ZVS during wide load range and minimization of current injection effect by using dual current injection time. Also, it is possible to reduce diode drop voltage occurred during dead time of convectional synchronous buck converter. The validity of the proposed converter is verified through experimental results.

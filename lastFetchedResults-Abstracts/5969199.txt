Detection and isolation of link failures in directed networks of LTI systems have been the focus of our previous study. Our results relate the failure of links in the network to jump discontinuities in the derivatives of the output responses of the nodes and exploit this relation to propose failure detection and isolation (FDI) techniques, accordingly. In this work, we consider these results in the context of single-integrator networked dynamics, and show that with the additional niceties of the integrator networks and the enhanced proofs, one is able to incorporate both unidirectional and bidirectional link failures in our FDI algorithms. Computer experiments with large networks and both directed and undirected topologies provide interesting insights as to the role of directionality, as well as the scalability of the proposed FDI techniques with the network size.

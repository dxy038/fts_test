A scheduling methodology is described for high-level synthesis of designs with a significant amount of control structure. The objective is to utilize all the available resources while scheduling with respect to resource restriction. To do so, a vector/matrix structure is built which provides a global view of resource usage at each node. It supports the migration of operations across basic blocks to wherever idle resources are available. With it, the authors formulate a list scheduling algorithm in which the dispatching priority changes dynamically with respect to resource availability

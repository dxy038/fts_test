This paper presents a process for restructuring the architecture of an object-oriented framework to make it conform to the MVA pattern. The objective of this work is to separate the code business logic (the Model), which is the most reusable part of a framework, from the code that implements the view and from the code that controls the processing of specific applications. The restructuring process is carried out by applying a set of 11 methods, resulting in a new object-oriented MVA architecture functionally equivalent to the original object-oriented framework.

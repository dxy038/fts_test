The paper deals with investigation of novel B3C converter which can be utilized as a part of power semiconductor system in traction, automotive, or industrial applications like renewable energy sources. Proposed solution of main circuit of B3C converter is based on buck-boost topology (BB), whereby energy transfer from source to load and vice versa is possible - bidirectional converter (B). Due to this description the designation of B3C was made. Based on previous abilities, parameters of electrical variables like voltage, current and power are able to be adapted based on the current requirements of application. Due to natural behvior of proposed topology their values can be increased or decreased in first (energy transfer from source to load) or in third (energy transfer from load to source) quadrant of converterÂ´s operation. The boost effect of output voltage can be increased - if it is not sufficient one - by appropriated ratio of number of inductor windings. In this paper the novel B3C converter will be presented together with analysis of operational intervals both for simulation as well as for experimental measurement.

The main objective of the theories of national security is the safety and security
of the nations in the international arena. But in order to achieve this, two
initiatives bust be activated. First, there must be a strategic plan in order to
strengthen national security. Second, this strategic plan must be manifested in
laws and regulations. This paper tries to analyze these two matters in the laws
of the economic, political, and cultural development program.
In the first step, we study different national security theories and categorize
them in strategic categories in order to test their success probability. Thus,
five major western security theories have been analyzed and introduced.
Then, strategic plans have been analyzed and applied to these theories.
Main strategic plans of obtaining security from the beginning of the
revolution have been analyzed in order to understand their characteristics.
The results show that the I.R.I. security approach has turned from a hard
and western attitude to a soft and Islamic one. This paper concludes that
only an Islamic comprehensive security strategy can ensure national
security of the I.R.I.

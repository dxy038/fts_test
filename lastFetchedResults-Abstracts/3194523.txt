We propose an approach as the circular generation process by the mutual transformation between music and narrative for a mechanism of the surface expression phase in our narrative generation system framework. In the concept for musical mechanism, music is not just the accompaniment for narrative and we extremely aim at using musical knowledge &amp; techniques and conceptual knowledge &amp; techniques in fusion by the medium of music. In addition, we expect that the blending of linguistic logic and musical logic leads to the unexpected narrative creation. This is also relating to a general idea that the creation of a novel product or idea is sometimes produced by the fusion of different things or ideas. This paper shows the newest prototyping system composed of eight transformation modules including automatic composition process and musical variation process. The objective of this system is to implement all of circulation routes experimentally with the revision of existing music-based programs. And through the simple preliminary evaluation, we discover several insufficient points in the quality of music and the correspondence of music to narrative.

A PCM to PWM converter is presented, based on a novel distortion compensating method which requires no oversampling to be applied in the digital PWM time domain and achieves high-fidelity audio performance at clock rates less than 90 Mbit/sec. The analysis of the performance of this converter is estimated using objective measurements (e.g., amplitude of the harmonics, THD&#247;noise) for sinewave modulating signals and auralisation tests of typical audio material

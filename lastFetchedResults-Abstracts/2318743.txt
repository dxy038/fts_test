Context. People affected by schizophrenia show deficits in social interaction (Cramer, Bowen, &amp; O’Neill, 1992); such a deficit may stem from an alteration in the representation of mental states. Object. In this study we have examined 42 people affected by schizophrenia, diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria, by testing them with an instrument (the Mach IV scale, Christie &amp; Geis, 1970) assessing “Machiavellian Intelligence” according to Niccolò Machiavelli’s assertions. Schizophrenic subjects were compared to a sample of normal controls, matched for age, sex, and education. Objective. The aim of our study was to evaluate if there were correlations between the ability to understand other people’s mental states and the capacity for interpreting “Machiavellian expressions.” Results. Results show that people affected by schizophrenia are less able to use Machiavellian-style “tactical” abilities than controls. Conclusion. Such a disabilty seems to be correlated to poor mentalising abilities.

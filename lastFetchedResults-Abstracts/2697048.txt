Earlier works studied the tradeoff between sensing performance and throughput of secondary users (SUs) for cooperative spectrum sensing. However, The tradeoff between sensing performance and energy consumption has not been well investigated in cognitive radio (CR) networks with relays. In this paper, the issues on cooperative spectrum sensing in a CR network with amplify-and-forward relay are studied. In particular, an optimization problem is formulated to analyze the tradeoff between sensing performance and energy consumption. The objective is to minimize energy consumption for spectrum sensing under given detection probability and false alarm probability constraints. We do so via finding an optimal pair of the parameters, i.e., the number of samples (proportional to sensing time) and the amplification gain. First, the case of fixed amplification gain is considered, in which the minimum number of samples is identified. Then, the case of varying amplification gain is further discussed, where an appropriate amplification gain is found such that the energy consumption is minimized while the sensing performance is kept above a threshold and the required throughput of the SU can be satisfied. The analytical and simulation results show that there exists an optimal pair of the number of samples and the amplification gain to strike the best tradeoff between sensing performance and energy consumption.

Background. Neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope occurs frequently and can be diagnosed with the head-up tilt table (HUTT) test. Our objective in this study was to identify clinical predictors of the positivity of HUTT test in neurocardiogenic syncope.

s. We conducted a prospective study of 117 cases (81 women and 36 men, 13â€“85 years of age) referred to our Institution for HUTT testing. The ability of 10 symptoms and signs of clinical history to predict HUTT positivity were evaluated using logistic regression analysis.

s. We observed a low rate of test-negative cases (24%) and 89 positives. Nearly all positives (87/89) were neurocardiogenic, principally of vasodepressor and mixed types (43 and 34 cases, respectively) and a few were cardioinhibitory (10, mostly young males). Regression analysis established that dizziness, nausea, and diaphoresis in past history were associated with HUTT positivity nearly 25 times more frequently than when absent.

sions. Our three conclusions are that syncope in absence of heart disease accompanied by dizziness, nausea, and diaphoresis may be treated as neurocardiogenic in settings where no HUTT is available. In addition, our low rate of negative tests may have been the result of our reexamining referrals prior to deciding test performance, and high frequency of young males in cardioinhibitory syncope needs further research.

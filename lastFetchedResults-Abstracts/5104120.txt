Robust control with robust tracking is considered for a class of pulse-width modulated systems (PWM) that appear, for example, in power electronics applications. The control objective is to regulate a high frequency ripple signal to robustly track a constant reference signal in an average sense. To achieve this goal, a new H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-control problem with integral action and averaged sampling is proposed. The design procedure is verified on a synchronous buck converter

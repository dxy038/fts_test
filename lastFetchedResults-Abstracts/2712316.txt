Economic transmission switching has been proposed as a new control paradigm to improve the economics of electric power systems. In practice, the transmission switching operation itself is a disruptive action to the system. Frequently switching lines into or out of service can create undesirable effects on the security and reliability of power systems and may require new investments in the automation and control systems. In this paper, we formulate an economic seasonal transmission switching model where transmission switching occurs once at the beginning of a time period (season) and then the transmission topology remains unchanged during that period. The proposed seasonal transmission switching model is a large-scale mixed integer programming problem. The objective of the optimization model is to minimize the total energy generation cost over the season subject to loads and N-1 reliability requirements. We develop a novel decomposition method that decomposes the seasonal problem into one-hour problems which are then solved efficiently. We demonstrate our model and the decomposition approach on the 14-bus, 39-bus, and 118-bus power systems and show potential cost savings in each case.

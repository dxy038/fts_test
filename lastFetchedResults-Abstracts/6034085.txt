This paper deals with musical noise resulting from subtractive type algorithms and especially Wiener filtering. We compare several methods that introduce perceptually motivated modifications of standard Wiener filtering and we propound a new speech enhancement technique. It aims to improve the quality of the enhanced speech signal provided by standard Wiener filtering by controlling the latter via a second filter regarded as a psychoacoustically motivated weighting factor. According to objective measures, the described process results in significant reduction of musical noise.

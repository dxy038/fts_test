The prime objective of the servant leaders is growth of their followers, while the organization-al goals are of secondary importance to them. The objective of this paper is to study this leader-ship style among principals of the schools. The statistical population of this research was all high school teachers of the city of Sanandaj. The sample consisted of 173 teachers. The data for the present study were collected through a questionnaire related to servant leadership style, including subscales of service, humbleness, agapao love, altruism, insight and trust. 
The findings of the research indicate that majority of the high school teachers maintained that the level of service-rendering of managers is high. Also, the internal and external factors are equally effective in the level of service. A comparative study of servant leadership in viewpoint of the Western and Muslim researchers showed that the leadership defined by the Western think-ers lacked the characteristics of service-based Islamic leadership. In Islam, leaders have always been the most prefect figures among their community and have been the most efficient, profes-sional, faithful, committed figures, enjoying the highest level of other human characteristics. In Islamic leadership, there is a high sensitivity towards justice, establishment of right, kindness to-wards the people and respect to their personality and rights.

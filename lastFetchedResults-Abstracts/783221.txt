Objective To analyse explanations of
service use in terms of resources, emotional (mood
or anxiety) disorder and functional impairment.
Method Data was derived from a prospective cohort
study in a sample representative (n = 4848) of the
Dutch adult general population. Results The occurrence
of an emotional (mood or anxiety) disorder led
to a greater use of services as a partial consequence of
the functional impairments that accompanied the
disorder, but this applied only to primary care services
and not to specialised mental health services.
After adjustment for the influence of all other determinants
in the model, people with more education
and those with higher neuroticism scores were more
likely to use specialised services in particular. Conclusions
Future research could benefit from applying
the models derived here to further clarify the use of
the two service modalities, as well as to assess additional
psychological resources.

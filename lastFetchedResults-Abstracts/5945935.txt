Analyze the relevance between these factors´ change and ICVD and try to explain the possible pathogenesis of ICVD. Methods: MBL haplotypes were detected by SSP-PCR, Plasma MBL levels were detected by ELISA assay. Results: ICVD patients and healthy MBL haplotype and genotype proportions were different (p &lt;;0.05); ICVD plasma MBL levels of patients (3372.18&#956;g / L) was significantly higher (P &lt;;0.01) than in healthy people (2065.29&#956;g / L). Conclusion: MBL may be involved in the development process of ICVD.

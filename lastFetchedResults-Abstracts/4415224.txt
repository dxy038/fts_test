The main objective of this project is to design a MEMS Vibratory gyroscope. A gyroscope is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation, based on the principle of angular momentum. MEMS gyroscopes are gaining popularity because of their high accuracy and low manufacturing costs in large quantities. Gyroscopes can also be used for detecting and monitoring Gait phase detection system (GPDS). In case of Gait phase movement asymmetry is one of the motor symptoms. Improper Gait phase is the disorder of the central nervous system due to Structural defect walking pattern. Gait phase of a person is important to know which plays a number of important physiological roles. Once Improper Gait phase detected at an early stage by the use of MEMS vibrating gyroscopes, patients are alerted with signals in order to prevent the fall.

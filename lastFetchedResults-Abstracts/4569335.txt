Joint design methods are based on an iterative scheme of model identification and controller design associated with each other. This paper proposes a new joint design method based on GIMC structure by carrying out on one-shot closed loop experiment. The proposed joint design method evaluates the performance degradation from the nominal performance explicitly so as to achieve the nominal performance for the actual plant. The identification of dual Youla-parameter R and the design of Youla-parameter Q are related to each other under the same control objective. Youla parameter Q is implemented in GIMC structure proposed by Zhou. The effectiveness of the proposed design method is verified by an actual control system

A novel multi-objective optimization scheme (MOEWE) is proposed for the purpose of generating the operation profiles of electric components, even if the control method of the componentsÂ´ system is unknown. This method continuously receives evaluation feedback from system outputs and updates the scalar weights for each objective to estimate them. A continuous/discrete hybrid radial basis function network (HRBFN) is adopted to describe the values of selected scalar weights. The values are updated by reinforcement learning with feedback rewards generated by an estimator that uses the system outputs. Applying the process sequentially brings the operation profile close to the desired one. The proposed scheme was applied to a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) simulation using the LA92 driving pattern. The results show that the scheme suitablygenerates the operation profiles of electric components.

Power systems for telecommunications are required to function in conditions of maximum safety and reliability in a difficult environment of vibrations, shocks and earthquakes. The main objective of this paper is to discuss computer simulation of the seismic NEBS test and the experimental modal intended to qualify the simulation results. The paper discuses the rationale for modal testing, the theoretical background and presents a case study of a power system designed for seismic applications. Finally, the paper shows that seismic test simulation doubled by experimental modal reduces the risk to have the design invalidated by NEBS seismic test, at this stage of product development, with the corollary of increased cost and product lunch delays.

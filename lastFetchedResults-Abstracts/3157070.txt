In order to solve the multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP), an immune clonal differential evolution algorithm, termed ICDEA, is proposed. ICDEA includes two populations which take immune clonal algorithm and differential evolution algorithm respectively. To balance global search ability and convergence speed, some excellent individuals are migrated between the two populations. ICDEA also improves the mutation operator of antibody and the mutation operator of differential evolution algorithm. So the convergence speed is further enhanced and the premature is avoided. Computer simulations are carried out and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

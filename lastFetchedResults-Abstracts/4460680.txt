Technology development has produced motion and position sensors small in size and capable of wireless communication, yet a suitable system for easy and reliable monitoring and interpretation of movement parameters responsive to the treatment for MS patients remains elusive. We designed a study with the following specific aims: 1) to identify core quantitative kinetic and kinematic gait variables that are responsive to temporary changes induced by the treatment; 2) to determine the association of clinical and gait laboratory measures with quantitative measures of motor function in the patientÂ´s home environment and quality of life measures. We present in this paper a preliminary investigation of identifying a few selected parameters that may capture the key parameters most responsive to the treatment. Our goal for this study is to develop a suitable monitoring device to track changes in gait performance on selected parameters to provide clinicians with objective and sensitive measures that can be easily obtained in clinic or at home. These objective assessments will assist the clinicians in making more effective treatment decisions and facilitate new treatment development.

The flow patterns of forebay and outflow conduit are analyzed for a stormwater pumping station in Hongqiao Traffic Centre of Shanghai with FLUENT software based on Reynolds average N-S equations and standard k-&#949; turbulence model. Geo-reconstruction VOF method is applied to track the free surface and the PISO algorithm is applied to calculated the flow filed. Taking the standard deviation of cross sectional velocities as the objective function and also based on the qualitative judgment of flow pattern and velocity distribution, the original design scheme of the pumping station is optimized. The results show that no unsatisfactory flow pattern will appear in the forebay and outflow conduct with the improved design.

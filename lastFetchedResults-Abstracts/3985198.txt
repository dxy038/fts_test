A MUSE (multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding) video disc with 60 min. of playback time per side of CLV disk has been developed. The recording density of the disc is double that of the NTSC video disc. A visible-laser diode with a wavelength of 670 nm and an objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.6 are used for playing the disc. A fine played-back image with a signal-to-noise ratio of 44 dB was obtained. Two kinds of audio signals are recorded, frequency-division multiplexed PCM (pulse code modulation) and time-division multiplexed PCM. In both systems, a low error rate which presents no practical problems was obtained

We study the problem of joint power control and beamforming for the uplink of a secondary wireless network that shares spectrum with a primary network to which the spectrum is licensed. The objective is to minimize the total transmitted power by the system and satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements of both primary and secondary users with priority being given to the primary users. We formulate two iterative algorithms considering two scenarios of spectrum sharing based on cooperation between the two networks. Simulation results are provided to show the convergence behavior of the iterative algortihms.

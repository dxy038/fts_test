In this paper, a new approach based on Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) optimization is proposed for solving the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. ICA is one of the evolutionary optimization algorithms which are based on colonialism as a social-political phenomenon. The objective of the OPF problem is to minimize the system total generation cost with regard to some inequality and equality constraints such as the unitsÂ´ active and reactive power output limits, generation/demand balance, power flow limit of lines, voltage on busses, and transformer taps. To validate the proposed algorithm, it is applied to the IEEE 30-buses system and results are compared with those of genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is justified.

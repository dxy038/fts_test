Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) through fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a simple and safe procedure with few complications. It is helpful in diagnosing diffuse and localized paranchymal lung diseases. Its diagnostic accuracy varies according to the character of lung lesions. Sarcoidosis and lymphangitic spread of cancer are more likely to be diagnosed by TBLB. This study is conducted to evaluate the histologic results of TBLB and to compare them with radiographic patterns. 134 patients, with lung lesions on chest radiography, went under TBLB during two years. At least, 3-4 biopsies were taken from the involved sites and sent for histologic study; histologic findings were then compared with different radiographic patterns while studying TBLB complications. From 134 cases, definite diagnosis was made for 75 cases (56%); in 56 cases (44%) the diagnosis was normal or non - specific. Tuberculosis, malignancy, sarcoidosis, fibrosis and miscelaneous diseases such as Boop, Eosinophilic pneumonia and pneumoconiosis were among diseases diagnosed by TBLB. Diagnostic yield was high in patients with bilateral hilarlymphadenopathy on their radiography (71%); it was 69% in diffuse paranchymal infiltration; the least diagnostic yield was observed in localized lung involvement (28%). Pneumothorax developed in three cases (22%); bleeding of less than 50cc in five patients (3.2%) ceased spontaneously in all cases. There was no fatality among patients.

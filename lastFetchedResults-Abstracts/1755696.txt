Objective
ntify the similarities and differences of risk factors and correlates of different groups of people fulfilling criteria for specified diagnostic groups according to current somatoform disorder (SDs) criteria, presence of anxiety and/or depression, and self-reported musculoskeletal disorders.
s
ipants of the Oslo–Lofoten general population cross-sectional study in 2000–2001 interviewed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) somatoform section were examined by comparing similarities and differences in 8 groups identified by cross-tabulation of current SDs, anxiety and/or depression, and musculoskeletal disorders. The current SDs group was computed from the CIDI somatoform section raw data, anxiety and/or depression from the CIDI diagnostic algorithms and musculoskeletal disorders by questionnaire and self evaluation.
s
 2001 sample of 1668 (875 women and 793 men) participants, the following eight disorder groups were identified: (i) current SDs, n=49 (75.5% women) (ii) musculoskeletal (functional somatic disorders), n=327; (53.5% women) (iii) anxiety and/or depression, n=148 (73.6% women); (iv) current SDs with anxiety and/or depression, n=38 (73.7% women); (v) current SDs with musculoskeletal, n=44 (72.7% women); (vi) current SDs with anxiety and/or depression and musculoskeletal, n=34 (76.5% women); (vii) musculoskeletal with anxiety and/or depression, n=101 (66.3% women); and (viii) no disorders, n=927 (43.3% women). Commonalities and differences between current SDs, anxiety and/or depression, and musculoskeletal disorders are apparent. Impairment of outcomes and risk factor load is high in current SDs with anxiety and/or depression and musculoskeletal.
sion
ta in this article could help toward the needed DSM-V and ICD-11 diagnostic revision of the SDs category.

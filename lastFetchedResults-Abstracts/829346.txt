The final object of this project is evaluating the effective technological factors on applying precision agriculture in sari’s rice fields, from the view of agriculture jihad’s experts. This project is among in correlative-descriptive research and in terms of its applied objective and the type of collecting data, it is a kind of descriptive and non-experimental research and it was done based on measurement. We use chronbach alpha coefficient for determining its reliability. The coefficient of 0.96 percent for all parts of this research shows that research instrument has good reliability. In the following, 157 questionnaires were distributed among agriculture jihad’s expert, by statistics. Data was analyzed by the software of spss20. The results showed that there is a significant correlation between the technological factors and the possibility of applying the precision agriculture. So the estimation equation show’s that our research’s independent variable establishes 33 percent of our research’s dependent variable ( the possibility of applying the precision agriculture.

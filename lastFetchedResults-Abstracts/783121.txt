Objective The aim of this study was to investigate
the association of the common apolipoprotein
E gene (APOE) variants with cognitive function
and cognitive decline in adult mid-life and explore the
possibility that APOE genotype mediates the link between
socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive function.
Methods Data on cognitive function, as measured
by five cognitive tests, together with APOE genotype
were obtained in an occupational cohort (the Whitehall
II study) of 6,004 participants aged 44–69 years
(1997–1999). Cognitive change was examined in 2,717
participants who had cognitive function measured at
baseline (1991–1993). Results SES based on civil service
employment grade was strongly related to cognitive
function. There was no association between
APOE genotype and employment grade. In women,
participants with APOE-ɛ4 had a lower memory score
(p<0.05), but the result was sensitive to data from a
small number of individuals. A marginal cross-sectional
difference in the semantic fluency score was
found (p=0.07), and there was a relative decline at follow-
up (p<0.001, net change=−1.19; 95% CI, −1.90 to
−0.49) in those with APOE-ɛ4 genotypes. Conclusions
APOE-ɛ4 has little influence on cognitive decline in
mid-life, whereas SES is a strong determinant, although
APOE genotype may emerge as an important factor in
cognitive function in later life

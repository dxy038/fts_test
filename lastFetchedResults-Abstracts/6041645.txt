This paper presents an active hybrid battery/ultra-capacitor based vehicular power system. The stand alone battery system may not be sufficient to satisfy peak demand periods during transients in HEVs. An ultra-capacitor bank can supply or recapture a large burst of power since it can be used with high C-rates. Active battery/ultra-capacitor hybrid model provides a better solution in terms of efficient power management and control flexibility. Moreover, the voltage of the battery pack can be selected to be less than ultra-capacitor, which will result in cost and size reduction of the battery pack. The power management is provided using a boost and a bidirectional DC/DC converter. The performance of the developed model and its control strategy is tested under various driving cycles. Results are obtained using MATLABreg, Simulinkreg, SimPower-Systemreg, and ADVISORreg platforms based on the mathematical and electrical models of the proposed system to present the effectiveness of the proposed topology.

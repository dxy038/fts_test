We consider the online scheduling of malleable jobs on parallel systems, such as clusters, symmetric multiprocessing computers, and multi-core processor computers. Malleable jobs is a model of parallel processing in which jobs adapt to the number of processors assigned to them. This model permits the scheduler and resource manager to make more efficient use of the available resources. Each malleable job is characterized by arrival time, deadline, and value. If the job completes by its deadline, the user earns the payoff indicated by the value; otherwise, she earns a payoff of zero. The scheduling objective is to maximize the sum of the values of the jobs that complete by their associated deadlines. Complicating the matter is that users in the real world are rational and they will attempt to manipulate the scheduler by misreporting their jobs´ parameters if it benefits them to do so. To mitigate this behavior, we design an incentive compatible online scheduling mechanism. Incentive compatibility assures us that the users will obtain the maximum payoff only if they truthfully report their jobs´ parameters to the scheduler. Finally, we simulate and study the mechanism to show the effects of misreports on the cheaters and on the system.

A brief description of the stripline position and intensity monitor for the SPEAR transport system is presented. The basic objective of this system is to visually display on an oscilloscope the current and position information of a 7 ns positron/electron beam of very low duty cycle (10-20 pps). The system incorporates and uses much of the video system at the Main Control Center (MCC) which was designed to display video pulses of 1.6 &#194;&#191;s width. In order to maintain compatibility with this system, the detected signals from the stripline monitors, which are 7 ns bipolar signals, are transformed into stretched signals of the order of 1 &#194;&#191;s, the amplitude and polarity of which reflect those of the original signals. System functions and the associated electronics are described in detail.

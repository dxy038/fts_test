Various diseases affect human motion (e.g. neurovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and musculoskeletal pain conditions). Currently, each medical discipline uses disease-specific clinical tests to assess motor (dys)function, based on subjectively scored and low-resolution clinimetric tests, qualitative video analysis, or cumbersome marker-based motion capturing. As such, no standard protocols for motion recording exist with respect to type of movements and activities of the upper extremity in various patient groups. For a better understanding of how different disorders affect motor function, a uniform, standardized and objective evaluation is a desirable goal in the study of motion disorders. Our aim is to explore the capabilities of the augmented reality (AR) technology for uniform assessment of the motor function, both for diagnosis and treatment.

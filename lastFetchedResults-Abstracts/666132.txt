The objective of this paper is to build a general correction model that takes into account all the different radiocarbon-dilution reactions and resolving the processes that are geochemically “aging” the groundwater in the Neogene Aquifer. For this, δ13C and radiocarbon in groundwater are investigated with their relationship to other chemical components in groundwater. The δ13C values in the Neogene Aquifer are influenced by various geochemical reactions like calcite dissolution, oxidation of organic matter and methanogenesis. Calcite dissolution and CH4 production increase δ13C while the oxidation of organic matter decreases δ13C in the groundwater. The reactions that modify δ13C also influence the 14C activity. Due to the complex geochemical environment, existing correction models are not applicable to this situation. A correction model for initial 14C activity is formulated in which the different C sources that influence 14C activity are taken into account. It is observed that recent dissolved organic matter plays an important role in redox reactions. The corrected 14C ages lie between −0.792 and 6.425 ka representing the maximum age. If a part of the organic matter that oxidises is fossil, the determined age will represent an overestimated age.

Environmental pollution is becoming a very crucial concern of our society. Water is one of the most important natural resources and has been at risk for some years now. Polluted water affects peopleÂ´s health and the flora - fauna of the ecosystem. Thus, water supplies monitoring, become increasingly essential for public health. The objective of this work is to properly blend systems at the edge of technology (i.e. mobile agents, wireless networks, sensors, intelligent systems) in order to form an adaptive and autonomous system for supporting advanced management services of environmental data and information mining. The proposed architecture is based on MAs (mobile agents) due to their ability to offer reliable, scalable and failover applications. The minimisation of task completion delay is considered as evaluation metric and early experimental results depict that the MA paradigm outperforms compared with classic client / server architecture.

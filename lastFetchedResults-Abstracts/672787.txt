This paper describes a case study of the 100 mile × 40 mile (161 km × 64 km) Mountains to Sound Greenway (MTSG) in Washington State, USA, as an example of an emerging greenway model that encompasses contiguous working, dwelling, recreational and protected landscapes and which is structured by an interstate highway. This “landscape-based greenway,” a large-scale, multi-objective greenway type, is defined and related to established greenway typologies and theory. The paper describes a framework of replicable planning, organizational and implementation factors that have contributed to the success of the MTSG, derived from study of the organization and supported by greenway and land planning literature. It presents methods used by the MTSG Trust to advance realization of this pioneering greenway concept, following the proposed planning, organizational, and implementation framework. Significant results in land acquisition, scenic highway status, trail network development, landscape restoration, cultural and educational resources, and preservation of small-town character, farms and forest resource lands are described, while challenges to the long-term viability of the accomplishments are raised. The author cites variations on the non-profit landscape-based greenway model and the corresponding need for replicative studies to further develop the framework of success factors, and notes its applicability to developing regions worldwide.

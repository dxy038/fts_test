The multiprocessor architecture based on a digital signal processor and a microcontroller to control an AC motor and a three-phase VS-PWM inverter is presented. The main objective is to design a powerful platform to enable the development and test of different pulse width modulation (PWM) methods and advanced motor control schemes. We discuss in detail the main considerations that had led us to choose this configuration: numerical processing of algorithms, and management of I/O signals. The control programs run concurrently on both processors, synchronizing data exchange through interrupt and polling routines, depending on the time critical tasks to be performed

A command to line-of-sight (CLOS) guidance law is derived via right inversion. This CLOS guidance law achieves the same objective as that given by Ha and Chong via feedback linearization (1992) yet is considerably simpler. This is made possible by reformulating the original nonlinear tracking problem as a right inversion problem for a linear time-varying system, and by making use of the orthogonal property of a rotational matrix.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

In this paper, a methodology for fast multi-objective design optimization of compact microwave circuits is presented. Our approach exploits an equivalent circuit model of the structure under consideration, corrected through implicit and frequency space mapping, then optimized by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The correction/optimization of the surrogate is iterated by design space confinement and segmentation based on a Pareto set representation obtained thus far in the process, aiming at improving the surrogate model in the vicinity of the Pareto-optimal solutions. Our technique is demonstrated by the design of a folded rat-race coupler.

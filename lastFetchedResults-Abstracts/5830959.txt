This paper deals with a study on the acoustic noise reduction according to the change of the pole angle in interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor with concentrated winding. This research is divided into 3 steps. Firstly, noise sources, such as resonant frequencies of stator and harmonic component of magnetic forces, are analyzed by the simulation and experimental results, respectively. Secondly, design of experiment (DOE) and optimal design using response surface methodology (RSM) are utilized to reduce the harmonic component of magnetic forces at a stator tooth compared with prototype. Objective function in the DOE and the optimal design is that the reduction of the summation of harmonic magnitude of normal force at a stator tooth. Finally, the reduction degree of the acoustic noise is compared by experimental results under the rated operating condition.

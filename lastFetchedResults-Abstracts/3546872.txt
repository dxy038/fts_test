A combinatorial optimization method is applied to the problem of device model optimization. A heuristic optimization technique called simulated annealing is applied to optimize the model parameters so that the device can be accurately simulated by the resulting model. This method avoids entrapment in the local minima of the objective function. Another application of this optimization process is to provide useful device parameters for a device process engineer. The effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated by results from three test cases

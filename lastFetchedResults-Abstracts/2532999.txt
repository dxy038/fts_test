Background and Objective: Nowadays, extensive research is carried out on the effect of plant extracts on variety of disorders. In this study, the effect of hydroethanolic extract of Lavandula officinalis on proliferation of neural stem cells as well as its antiapoptotic properties was assessed.

Materials and Methods: Neural stem cells were isolated from hippocus of neonatal rat brain. To determine the optimal concentration of Lavandula officinalis extract, isolated neural stem cells were treated with 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 micro g/ml of concentrate for 48 h. Then cell proliferation rate was evaluated via MTT assay. Meanwhile, the antiapoptotic property of Lavandula officinalis extract was evaluated using TUNEL assay method. 

Results: The results of this study showed a significant difference in cell proliferative and antiapoptotic property of Lavandula officinalis extract on neural stem cells comparing to the control group.

Conclusion: The hydroethanolic extract of Lavandula officinalis can be effective on proliferation elevation  and apoptosis reduction  in rat neural stem cells.

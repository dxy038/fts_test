This paper presents an improved algorithm for multi-objective optimization and design of high temperature superconducting (HTS) fault current limiters (FCL) based on analytical hierarchy process (AHP). To design a superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL), it is necessary to simulate and define electrical, magnetic and thermal properties in form of equivalent circuits and mathematical models. This paper reports the simulation results for electrical and thermal characteristics of a resistive SFCL from which optimized objectives such as; maximizing limiting impedance, minimizing current peaks, minimizing quench and restore times, and minimizing limiter and cooling system cost was obtained using multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and AHP.

The objective of coastal zone management (CZM) is to balance and optimize environmental protection, public uses and socioeconomic development. Today, the coastal areas in Taiwan are under heavy pressures of rapid development and incompatible uses. Concerning the degradation of the coastal environment, the authorities are actively undertaking several programs for a better management of the marine environment. However, the authority for the protection of the marine environment is still diffused among a number of central and local agencies. With the application of several criteria, this paper examines and identifies the issues of Taiwan’s coastal policy and administration. The paper suggests that an improved mechanism to enhance the integration and coordination of the existing administrative systems will be the central theme of Taiwan’s CZM in the future. In order to meet the challenges, several strategies to promote the performance of CZM are also proposed in this paper.

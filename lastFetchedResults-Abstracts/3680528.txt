This paper describes and compares several kinds of pulse search methods for multipulse excited speech coder realization. These pulse search methods are derived from minimization criterion for errorpower between original speech and synthetic speech, but their performances and required computation amounts are different. Objective and subjective evaluations are carried out to compare the performances. Further, the relation between speech quality and pulse search method complexity is described. Based on these results, pulse search methods suitable for realizing a high-quality multipulse coder using current VLSI technology are discussed.

The purpose of this paper is to review basic concepts of optimal process control. We define the formulation and basic elements of optimal process control which are models of physical processes, constraints, objective function, functional, history of optimization, and practical approaches to optimal control implementation. The classification comprises basic theory, methods, and techniques. The theory will be complemented by concrete examples from practice. Finally, the structures for optimal process control (feed forward and feedback optimal control) will be given in the paper.

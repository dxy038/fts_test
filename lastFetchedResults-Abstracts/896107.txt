Background and Objective: Estimation abilities are a group of processes that involve cognitive functions such as planning, attention, abstract reasoning, and memory. The goal of this study was to assess cognitive estimation in patients with schizophrenia, major depression disorder (MDD) and normal individuals.

Materials and Methods: Three groups including patients with schizophrenia, major depression disorder (MDD) and normal individuals (n=22 for each group) were selected using available sampling methods and inclusion and diagnostic criteria and were assessed by Cognitive Estimation Test (CET).

Results: Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed that patients with schizophrenia disorder were impaired in all cognitive estimation dimensions in comparison with patients with major depression disorder (MDD) and normal individuals and its total score. Also, major depression patients performed worse than normal individuals in size, weight and quantity of cognitive estimation dimensions and its total score.

Conclusion: A better understanding of the cognitive estimation in schizophrenia and depression could help identify the risk and modifying factors that influence the onset, severity and course of these diseases.

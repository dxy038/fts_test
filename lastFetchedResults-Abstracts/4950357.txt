The objective of this paper is to make a picture of the recent articles published on information fusion. Indeed, a great number of documents dealing with this technique are available in the literature. A classification scheme including application fields, fusion goals, fusion system architecture and mathematical tools is proposed. This overview of the last three years allows one to compute the article distribution in each class. Finally, some elements of a preliminary analysis of this classification are drawn.

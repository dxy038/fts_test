Objective:  The objective of this study was to determine the role of proteins in affecting elemental release from a variety of clinically available dental casting alloys. An important role for proteins was suspected based on previous reports about the corrosion of stainless steel and the cytotoxicity of alloys after exposure to a saline-protein solution.

Methods: Clinically available alloys with compositions ranging from 0 to 94 at.% noble elements were exposed for 1 week to either saline, saline with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), or complete cell-culture medium with 3% serum. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry was used to measure the release of elements from the alloys. Elemental release was normalized for the exposed surface area of the alloys.

Results: In general, more elemental release occurred into the saline-BSA solution compared to saline alone for all released elements (Ag, Cu, Pd, and Zn) except for Ni. Ni release from the NiCr alloy was lower in the presence of BSA. Each element responded somewhat differently with Pd being the least predictable in its behavior. Elemental release was less in the cell-culture medium than in the saline-BSA solution for most elements. For alloys which released multiple elements, all elements responded similarly but not identically to the presence of protein. A high elemental release during exposure to the saline-BSA solution correlated with a low alloy cytotoxicity post-exposure to the saline-BSA.

Significance: This study demonstrates the importance of defining exactly the composition of biological solutions used to assess in vitro corrosion and biocompatibility of dental casting alloys. Other molecules in addition to proteins appeared to be critical to the corrosion of these alloys in vitro.

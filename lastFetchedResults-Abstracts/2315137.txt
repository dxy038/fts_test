The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of short-term starvation and re-feeding on oxidative stress in Mesopotamichthys sharpeyi (GÃ¼nther, 1874). After two weeks adaptation to new conditions, a total number of 270 fingerlings were distributed into nine 300-L fiberglass tanks, equipped with aeration system in three treatments including 4, 8 and 16 days starvation (each in 3 replicates). After starvation, all groups were fed for 32 days. At the beginning of trial and at the end of starvation and re-feeding periods, blood samples were collected, plasma was separated and activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were assayed. Based on the results, no significant difference was observed in SOD activity at the end of starvation and also after re-feeding between the different treatments. At the end of starvation the activity of the CAT and GPX increased significantly in 8 and 16 days of starvation groups compared to the base. Moreover, a significant increase in MDA levels of plasma was found during food deprivation. These findings showed that short-time starvation increased antioxidant enzymes activity in plasma of M. sharpeyi but short-term food deprivation and re-feeding periods in this species does not cause disturbances in the antioxidant defense status.

In the paper, robust design and tuning of power system stabilizer (PSS) is considered. The objective is to tune a PSS so that the closed-loop response of a single machine-infinite bus system is made not only stable over a wider range of operating points but also the time responses are restricted to lie within specific bounds while requiring minimum control effort . The new robust PSS approach uses the Luus-Jaakola (LJ) optimization procedure in conjunction with genetic algorithm (GA). Simulation results on a single machine infinite bus model illustrate the design method.

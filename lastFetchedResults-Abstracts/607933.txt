Objective(s): Events occurring during life can affect people's physical, mental, social, and even spiritual health. 
Considering the stage of growth they are in, school age children when facing life events may be more vulnerable than adults and so require more attention in the assessment, treatment received and appropriate actions done by parents, physicians, school administrators, appropriate authority, and policy makers.
Methods: A mini review using the words "school", "children", "pupils", "events", "disasters", "accident", and "fire" carried out in official newspapers and news agencies websites in the absence of an office to register the events occurring inside and outside the schools in Iran to access a preliminary image of the subject and what is needed to be done in Iran.
Results: The findings of the study showed that similar events occur repeatedly in different provinces in Iran, some with victims more than the number expected. It seems factors such as lack of correct or inadequate training of school personnel, choosing non-standard recreation places for students, non-standard schools, lack of necessary facilities, possible problems in some roads, and â€¦ might be involved in occurrence of the events. Despite the high frequency of crises there is not a professionally developed program to reduce the disasters and help events victims to cope with the effects of them.
Conclusion: Considering the nature of the crises it seems at least some of these disasters could be prevented and there is a need for developing a practical program as well as using a contingency plan to cope with crises in schools of Iran.

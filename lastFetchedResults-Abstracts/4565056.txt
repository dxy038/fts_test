This paper describes and highlights the role of home and foreign agents in maintaining correct addressing and routing mechanism of video streaming over mobile ip network. The impact of user mobility and route optimization to the QoS performance is observed and analyzed through five and two real scenario respectively. Service parameters such as throughput, packet loss, delay, and jitter are measured. The experimentation results show that QoS of handover scenario is the worst among others because of the temporal broken connection occurred during handover and reconnection phase. We find as well that QoS of mobile nodes which returning to its home cell is similar to stationery mobile node. Compared to bidirectional tunneling, route optimization works better in terms of packet loss but performs worse in case of thoughput and jitter

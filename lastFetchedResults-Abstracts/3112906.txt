A self contained continuous power generation system as described at INTELEC 1979, was successfully commissioned and put into service in a major communications centre at Cardiff in Wales. The objective was to provide all telecommunications equipment and electrical building engineering services from a dual fuel engine-generating plant, and to recover waste heat energy to heat or cool the building. The plant, which is fully automatic, comprises five 1300kW engines using natural gas or diesel oil, and associated waste heat boiler and chiller systems. This paper reviews the functioning of the plant during its first three years of operation, and discusses the technical factors and further development of the system as experience was gained in the use of the plant.

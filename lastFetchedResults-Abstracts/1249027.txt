This paper describes multi-objective construction optimization of hydrodynamic torque converter with the application of a genetic algorithm. The main optimization criteria were: torque ratio, efficiency, permeability and a range of high efficiencies. Overall 16 variables were selected as main optimized parameters. Among them were: active diameter, parameters of meridional cross section, blade angles on core and shell. Value ranges of these variables were obtained from the analysis of constructed prototypes. Mathematical model based on multiple streams was applied. Sample calculations were provided for hydrodynamic torque converter type PH 410. The results of these calculations provided a set of suboptimal parameters that were utilized as a basis for further consideration. In addition, influence of range limitations of optimized parameters into optimization results was analyzed. The influence varies significantly.

In this paper, we study the problem of survivable impairment-aware virtual optical network mapping in flexible-grid optical networks (SIA-VONM). The objective is to minimize the total cost of transponders, regenerators, and shared infrastructure for a given set of virtual optical networks, which can survive single link failures. We first provide the problem definition of SIA-VONM, and then formulate the problem as an integer linear program (ILP). We also develop a novel heuristic algorithm together with a baseline algorithm and a lower bound. Numerical results show that our proposed heuristic achieves results that are very close to those of the ILP for small scale problems, and that our proposed heuristic can solve large scale problems very well.

Image retargeting techniques aim to obtain retargeted images with different sizes or aspect ratios for various display screens. Various content-aware image retargeting algorithms have been proposed recently. However, there is still no accurate objective metric for visual quality assessment of retargeted images. In this paper, we propose a novel objective metric for assessing visual quality of retargeted images based on perceptual geometric distortion and information loss. The proposed metric measures the geometric distortion of retargeted images by SIFT flow variation. Furthermore, a visual saliency map is derived to characterize human perception of the geometric distortion. On the other hand, the information loss in a retargeted image, which is calculated based on the saliency map, is integrated into the proposed metric. A user study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed metric. Experimental results show the consistency between the objective assessments from the proposed metric and subjective assessments.

The main objective of this paper is to expound the singular-value-decomposition (SVD)-based reduction technique proposed to single-input-single-output Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models to multivariable cases. The use of higher order singular value decomposition is proposed in this paper for the complexity reduction of multiple-input-singleoutput TS fuzzy model approximation. A detailed illustrative example of a nonlinear dynamic model is also discussed.

We propose a quality-driven method for network resource allocation with transmission power control in a multihop Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) Wireless Visual Sensor Network (WVSN). A multihop WVSN typically consists of source nodes that monitor different areas and relay nodes that retransmit recorded scenes. In order to achieve the best possible video quality at the receiver while consuming the least possible transmission power, we propose a joint optimization scheme that allocates the available resources among the nodes with respect to the imposed constraints. Moreover, we formulate a weighted bi-objective optimization problem and study the tradeoff between video quality and consumed transmission power. The simulation demonstrate that excessive transmission power is used when power control is omitted for a rather small quality gain for certain nodes.

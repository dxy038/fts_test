Objective
tudy aimed to investigate PDL's cytokine concentration fluctuations after induction of orthodontic force with and without extracorporeal shock wave therapy in a rat model.
als and methods
hodontic appliance was fabricated and applied between the molars and the incisors of rats. The rats were treated by a single episode of 1000 shock waves and gingival crevicular fluid was collected for 3 days. The expression and concentration of IL-1β and VEGF were evaluated by ELISA assay. On day 3 all rats were sacrificed and histologic and immunohistochemical assays were applied.
s
concentration rose in both the treated and non treated shockwave groups on the first day, however it was statistically significantly higher in the treated group on day 2. No statistically significant difference was detected between the groups on day 3. The number/area of TRAP positive cells was higher in the non shockwave group than in the treated group. The percentage of cells expressing VEGF displayed the opposite trend. The findings regarding the immunohistochemical assay for IL-1β corresponded with those of the ELISA assay on day 3.
sion
plication of shockwaves during orthodontic tooth movement influences the expression of IL-1β and VEGF and may alternate the periodontal remodelling expected rate.

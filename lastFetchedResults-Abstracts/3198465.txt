Load management and self-consumption is becoming common for distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation. The objective of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of load management and battery storage in residential grid connected PV systems without net metering. The power consumption of the home loads was divided into time manageable, storage capable and non-manageable. Load management to displace the time manageable and storage capable loads from evening hours to PV generation hours increased self-consumption by up to 50%. The addition of batteries to a grid tied PV system can increase self consumption to 100%, but there was no net cost savings due to the cost of the batteries and power conditioning unit. Grid tied PV systems with no net metering should be designed for daytime loads only to maximize cost effectiveness.

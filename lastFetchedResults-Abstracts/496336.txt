The optimal allocation of limited resources is one of the most applicable tools in management to achieve maximum benefits. The application of optimization techniques in order to optimally distribute land uses is also one of the strategies in watershed resources management. The present study has been conducted in Brimvand watershed in Kermanshah Province and comprises 9572ha with the aim to maximize benefit from land uses and minimizing wastes based on linear programming solution using simplex method and with the help of ADBASE software package. The net profits as well as standard maps of land use were used as input to the objective and constraint functions. The results of the study, considering all governed constraints, showed that using the proper allocation of land uses, besides reducing resources loss, profit increases by 18.62% which is owing to reduction in rainfed agriculture and increase in the area of orchards. The results of the sensitivity analysis also showed that object function is strongly susceptible to the extent of orchard area.

"Photovoltaic panel maximum power point tracker". As the name implied, it is a photovoltaic system that uses the photovoltaic array as a source of electrical power supply and since every photovoltaic (PV) array has an optimum operating point, called the maximum power point, which varies depending on cell temperature, the insolation level and array voltage. A maximum power point tracker (MPPT) is needed to operate the PV array at its maximum power point. The objective of this paper is to build MPPT to charge a 12-volts lead acid battery by using a (TBP1275) 74 - watts PV panel. A technique for efficiency extracting the maximum output power from a solar panel under varying meteorological conditions is presented. The methodology is based on connecting a pulse width modulated dc/dc SEPIC converter, which is controlled by a micro controller based unit. The main difference between the method used in the proposed MPPT systems and other technique used in the past is that PV array output power is used to directly control the dc/dc converter thus reducing the complexity of the system. The resulting system has high efficiency, low cost and can be easily modified. This approach ensured maximum power transfer under all conditions by using micro controller for calculation. The tracking capability of the proposed technique has been verified experimentally with a 74 W solar panel at different insolation levels.

The dual-coolant (DC) blanket—characterised by its simple construction, simple function, and high thermal efficiency—is one of the EU advanced blanket concepts to be investigated in the frame of the long-term power plant conceptual study (PPCS). Its basic concept is based on the use of helium-cooled ferritic steel structure, the self-cooled Pb–17Li breeding zone, and SiC/SiC flow channel inserts, serving as electrical and thermal insulators. The present work on PPCS is drawn extensively on the preparatory study on plant availability carried out in 1999 with an objective to perform the conceptual design of the DC blanket concept where some details are to be selected in accordance with the overall strategy, which allows an extrapolation of the present knowledge between the near-term solutions (helium-cooled pebble bed (HCPB), water-cooled lead–lithium (WCLL) blanket concepts), and the very advanced self-cooled Pb–17Li SiC/SiC (SCLL) blanket concept. In the PPCS the reactor power is adapted to a typical size of commercial reactors of 1500 MWe which requires iterative calculations between the blanket layout and the system code analysis. The results of the first iteration are reported. This work is under the coordination of FZK in co-operation with CEA, EFET, IBERTEF, UKAEA, VTT Processes and VR.

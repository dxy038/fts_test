In this study, the frequency optimization of laminated skew plates is investigated. The objective function is to maximize the fundamental frequency of the laminated skew plates and the fiber orientation is considered as design variable. The mathematical formulation is based on the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) for the frequency analysis of the laminated skew plates. The modified feasible direction (MFD) method is combined with the finite element solution of laminated skew plates for optimal designs. Therefore, a program based on FORTRAN is used. Finally, the effect of skew angles, boundary conditions, aspect ratios and functionally graded materials on the optimal results is investigated and the results are compared.

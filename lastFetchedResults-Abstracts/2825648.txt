Photovoltaic (PV) generation does not produce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during operations. Developing PV generation is an effective way of developing a low-carbon electricity system. However, PV power output has the stochastic nature. It brings uncertainty to traditional power system dispatch problems. Based on the concept of low-carbon economy, this paper introduces carbon trading mechanism into power system dispatch first. Then, a probability distribution model of solar irradiance and PV power output is established, and risk reserve based on chance constrained programming is used to deal with the stochastic nature of PV power output. On this basis, an optimal dispatch model under low-carbon economy with significant PV generation is proposed. With the system generation cost, carbon trading cost and load shedding penalty incorporated in the objective function, the model proposed can effectively evaluate the power dispatch problem under low-carbon economy with significant PV generation. Finally, a 10-unit test system is simulated by applying the proposed model.

Objective: Microbial plaque is the main cause of periodontal disease. Production of free oxygen radicals is an immune system mechanism to destroy invading microorganisms which per se results in further destruction of periodontal tissues. The present study sought to assess the efficacy of anti-oxidant application (vitamin E) as an adjuvant treatment following scaling and root planning in periodontal patients.
Methods: For this randomized clinical trial 10 patients aged 30 to 50 years suffering from moderate to severe periodontitis with no systemic disease were selected. After scaling and root planning, 5% vitamin E for one side and placebo for the opposite side were poured in a maxillary custom tray and placed inside the mouth.
Results: Type of treatment did not have a significant effect on the understudy factors. However, time had a significant effect on the majority of indices. Healing was significantly better at week 4 following initiation of treatment compared to week 2. The values in proximal and radicular sites were -0.151, p=0.002 and -0.31, p=0.001 for pocket depth, -0.217, p=0.002 and -0.401, p=0.001 for CAL, -4.188, p=0.001 and -0.391, p=0.272 for BOP and -0.219, p=0.05 for GI, respectively.
Conclusion: The present study showed that the effect of time was greater than the type of treatment on improvement of indices.

This study presents an approach for cleaner management of multipurpose batch chemical or biochemical plants. Given that manufacture of most of the products could be carried out in multiple ways depending on chosen production recipes, the scheduling framework is extended by involving the choice of appropriate production recipes. Using as optimization criteria the Global or Local Environmental Impact Assessments defined in Minimum Environmental Impact Methodology, the mathematical formulation that results in multi-objective optimization problems is presented for a special class of schedules.

proach is implemented on an example from dairy industry. Production of two types of curds by selection from two available recipes for each one of them is considered. The problem is translated to a single objective. Two most reliable solutions are obtained, which differ in chosen production recipes, milkfat content and units involved for tasks implementation. Comments on the impacts on the load of Biochemical Oxygen Demand at the end of each production cycle due to simultaneous curds manufacturing and contributions of individual dairy wastes in Global Biochemical Oxygen Demand are also provided.

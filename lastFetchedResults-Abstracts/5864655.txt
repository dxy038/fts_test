This paper presents evolutionary-based optimization procedure for designing truss structures. The Shuffled Complex Evolution optimizer (SCEO) is used for solving the nonlinear constrained optimization problems. In this optimum design formulation, the objective function is the material weight of the truss; the design variables are the cross-sections of the truss members; the constraints are the stresses in members and the displacements of the joints. The constraints were handled using non-stationary dynamically modified penalty functions. Two classical truss optimization examples are presented herein to demonstrate the efficiency of the SCE algorithm. The two test problems include a 17-bar planar truss subjected to a single load condition and a 25-bar space truss subjected to two load conditions. The result shows that the SCEO method is very efficient in finding the best discovered optimal solutions, which are better, or at the same level of the results of other structural optimization methods.

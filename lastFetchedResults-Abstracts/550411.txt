Introduction & Objective: Urinary complications are a common disorder which affects the quality of life of women. The objective of this study was to compare the therapeutic effects of Tibolone and classic hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the urinary complications of menopausal women,
Materials and methods: This randomized controlled trial study was conducted at Tarbiat Modarres University in 2007-2008 on 100 menopausal women which were divided into two therapeutic groups. Women in the first group used 2.5 mg tibolone plus one tablet of Ca+D daily. Women in the second group used HRT classic (0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen and 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) plus one tablet of Ca+D daily, for six months. Before and after each treatment, frequency, urgency, nocturia, stress and urge urine incontinence was recorded. The collected data was analyzed by the SPSS software using independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon test, and Fisher test.
Results: The data showed that the two groups were matched in age, menarche and menopausal age, gravid, education level, occupation and socio-economic level (P>0.05). After six months, all of the urinary complications reduced after treatment in each group,but Wilcoxon test showed that only the reduction of nocturia was significant (P=0.007, P=0.03). Mann-Whitney test showed that all of these complications in the HRT group reduced more in the tibolone group, but this reduction statistically wasn't significant (P>0.05).
Conclusion: Treatment by classic hormone replacement therapy reduces the urinary complications of menopausal women in comparison with Tibolone. Therefore care should be taken for considering of an appropriate medical approach in these cases.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to estimate whether the efficacy of treatment with intravaginal misoprostol for first-trimester pregnancy failure is enhanced by the addition of saline solution.
Study design
Eighty women with embryonic/fetal death or anembryonic pregnancy were assigned randomly to receive either 800 μg of misoprostol with saline solution (group I, 41 women) or without (group II, 39 women). Treatment was repeated on day 3 if the gestational sac remained. Curettage was performed if the gestational sac remained on day 8 or as necessary during at least 30 days of follow-up. Data were analyzed with the Student t test and the χ2 or Fisher exact test.
Results
By the first follow-up visit, 73% (group I) and 64% (group II) of women passed the gestational sac (P = .38). By the second follow-up visit, expulsion rates were 83% and 87%, respectively (P = .59). Five subjects in each group underwent curettage.
Conclusion
Misoprostol is effective for the treatment of failed first-trimester pregnancy. The expulsion rate is not improved by adding saline solution.

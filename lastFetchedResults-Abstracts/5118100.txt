A stable tracking control rule is proposed for nonholonomic vehicles. The stability of the rule is proved through the use of a Liapunov function. Inputs to the vehicle are a reference posture (<e1>x </e1><sub>r</sub>, <e1>y</e1><sub>r</sub>, &#952;<sub>r</sub>)<sup>t </sup> and reference velocities (&#957;<sub>r</sub>, &#969;<sub>r</sub>) <sup>t</sup>. The major objective of this study is to propose a control rule to find reasonable target linear and rotational velocities (&#957;, &#969;)<sup>t</sup>. Linearizing the systemÂ´s differential equation is useful for deciding parameters for critical dumping for a small disturbance. In order to avoid slippage, a velocity/acceleration limitation scheme is introduced. Several simulation results are presented with or without the velocity/acceleration limiter. The control rule and limiting method proposed are robot independent and hence can be applied to various kinds of mobile robots with a dead reckoning ability. This method was implemented on the autonomous mobile robot Yamabico-11. Experimental results obtained are close to the results with the velocity/acceleration limiter

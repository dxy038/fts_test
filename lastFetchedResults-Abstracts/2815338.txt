Microwave remote sensing instruments are an adequate way to provide soil moisture information at large scale. Microwave remote sensing data are linked to the electromagnetic properties of soil. In that context, the objective of this study is to develop an integrated approach to estimate effective electromagnetic properties of soils layers at different scale using ground-penetrating radar (GPR), L-band radiometer, dielectric laboratory measurements, modelling approaches and in situ measurements of essential state variables.

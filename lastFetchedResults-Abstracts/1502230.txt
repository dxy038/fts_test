Parameters such as heat transfer, arrangement type, covering and deviation from tilt angle of PV cells located on the wings of a solar-powered aircraft impact on the efficiency, power, flight duration and costs of the solar flyer. The objective of this paper is to represent these parameters and their influence on the efficiency and power to be considered before constructing. Related equations for design process and selecting PV cells are represented and discussed. Solar irradiance is not monotonic during the flight. Hence, components and algorithms for designing a MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracker) device from perspective of being utilized in solar-powered aircrafts are investigated. Furthermore, heat transfer on the cells of the wings and its influence on the efficiency is discussed which can help to make up the power reduction caused by covering and deviation from tilt angle of the cells.

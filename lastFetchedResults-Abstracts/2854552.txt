The purpose of this paper is to analyze the behavior of the human tibio-tarsal joint during static loading. The tibio-tarsal joint represents the transition area between the verticality of the calf and the foot. Along with the subtalar and transverse tarsal joints, it represents a crucial component of the ankle. A Finite Element Model (FEM) of the human tibia, fibula and talus was created, taking into consideration the anatomical characteristics of an average weight male adult. In order to analyze the behavior of the tibio-tarsal joint during static loading, the fore mentioned components were rendered in vertical position, and the relations between components were defined. The biomechanical properties (Young´s Modulus, Density and Poisson´s Ratio) of the human cortical bone were applied with regard to current literature and research. The resulting assembly was subjected to a uniformly distributed pressure of 0,625 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Displacement, vonMisses Stress and Strain were the selected output parameters. The software used to obtain the respective results was SolidWorks<sup>&#174;</sup> 2014. Understanding the biomechanical behavior of the tibio-tarsal joint during static as well as dynamic loading is essential in order to formulate objective treatment solutions in case of ankle trauma and fracture.

This paper proposes a new objective function for solving the optimal management of MicroGrid (MG) problem. This objective function aims to minimize MicroGridÂ´s operating cost as well as the emissions of atmospheric pollutants while constraining it to meet the load demands. Some Objective constraints are presented in this paper for the safety of MG system. Moreover, the particle swarm-based-simulated annealing (PSO-B-SA) optimization algorithm is proposed to optimizing microsource output for the MG problem. The simulation study is on a sixteen bus system for one day load demands. The results demonstrate the validity and high-efficiency of the proposed algorithm to reduce the cost as well as the emissions while satisfying the load demands.

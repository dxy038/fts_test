As a key constituent of their protective cell wall all mycobacteria produce a large structural component, the mycolyl-arabinogalactan (mAG) complex, which has at its core a galactan moiety of alternating β-(1→5) and β-(1→6) galactofuranosyl residues. Galactan biosynthesis is essential for mycobacterial viability and thus inhibitors of the enzymes involved in its assembly are potential drugs for the treatment of mycobacterial diseases, including tuberculosis. Only two galactofuranosyltransferases, GlfT1 and GlfT2, are responsible for the biosynthesis of the entire galactan domain of the mAG and we report here the first high-throughput assay for GlfT2. Successful implementation of the assay required the synthesis of multi-milligram amounts of the donor for the enzyme, UDP-Galf, 1, which was achieved using a chemoenzymatic approach. We also describe an improved expression system for GlfT2, which provides a larger amount of active protein for the assay. Kinetic analysis of 1 and a known trisaccharide acceptor for the enzyme, 2, have been carried out and the apparent Km and kcat values obtained for the latter are in agreement with those obtained using a previously reported radiochemical assay. The assay has been implemented in 384-well microtiter plates, which will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential GlfT2 inhibitors, with possible utility as novel anti-TB drugs.

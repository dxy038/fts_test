The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality and shelf life of raisins and dried apricot under different packaging metarials and storage conditions. Three different plastic films (polyamide, P. V. C polypropylen cellulose, and BOPP), which are commonly used in food packaging, were compared with samples packed in cardboard boxes wich are currentl;y used for dried fruits packaging in Iran in presence or absence of air. All differnt treatments were then stored at 15 and 30Â°C for eight months. The moisture content, degree of browning, and microbial load were then determined at 0, 4, and 8 months. Furthermore, texture, color, appearance, flavor, and total acceptance were dertemined by the sensory method using the multiple points hedonic test. Results shown that the type of packaging material had a significant effect on the moisture content, degree of browing, texture, appearance, flavor, total acceptance (P<0.01), and color (P<0.05) of all treatments. There was no significant difference between the vaccum packed and other samples except in moisture and texture of dried apricots (P<0.05). Storage temperature and time had a significant effect on all of the evaluated properties (P<0.01).

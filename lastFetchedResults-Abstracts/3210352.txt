In this paper further investigation of the previously proposed method of speeding up single-objective evolutionary algorithms is done. The method is based on reinforcement learning which is used to choose auxiliary fitness functions. The requirements for this method are formulated. The compliance of the method with these requirements is illustrated on model problems such as Royal Roads problem and H-IFF optimization problem. The experiments confirm that the method increases the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms.

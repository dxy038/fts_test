The present paper proposes high speed dense 8-channel bidirectional WDM-PON access system where spectrally-uniform ASE source is shared among multiple users for realization of downstream transmission. Upstream transmission is realized by using conventional laser based solution. Proposed system is based on ITU-T DWDM grid and operating at 10 Gbit/s per channel symmetrically on both directions. It is demonstrated that implemented spectrum slicing technology is capable to provide downstream data transmission over 20 km SMF fiber span with BER&lt;;10<sup>-12</sup> by using additional fiber Bragg grating chromatic dispersion compensation module and excess intensity noise reduction by additional semiconductor optical amplifier.

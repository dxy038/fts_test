Traditional models for planning interconnection between power systems are mainly concerned with the economic and security benefits. In this paper, the concept of low-carbon economy is introduced into the planning of interconnection while considering the emergence of new factors and their impact on the power system interconnection under the condition of low-carbon economy. The cost of low-carbon power technology and transaction expenses of the carbon trading mechanism involved are incorporated in the objective function, with the reduction targets of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions introduced into the constraints. An interconnection planning model is developed with the maximization of the overall interconnection benefit in the planning period under the low-carbon economy as the objective function. A study of the planning of interconnection between two provincial grids in South China shows that the model proposed is effective and practical.

The objective of the ESA DUE CoastColour project is to fully exploit the potential of the MERIS instrument for remote sensing of the coastal zone. The product requirements have been derived from a user consultation process. Users have provided in-situ data from many locations, which were used for algorithm development and validation. The MERIS data archive from 2005 onwards has been processed with the finally selected algorithms for 27 globally distributed coastal sites. The CoastColour dataset comprises an improved Level 1b product (L1P), a product that contains directional and normalised water leaving reflectances (L2R) and a product for water properties (L2W). The total data volume is 100TB. All data are online and available from the CoastColour Website. A near real time service was operated from October 2011 until end of the ENVISAT mission. Plans exist to continue the service with Sentinel data.

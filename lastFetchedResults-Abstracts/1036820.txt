The main objective of the present paper is to study the tensile and bending behaviors of unidirectional glass fiber (U)/random glass fiber (R)/epoxy hybrid composites with total fiber volume fraction (VfT) = 37%. Six kinds of laminated composites of average thickness 5.5 mm were manufactured using hand lay-up technique; i.e. [R]5, [U/R/U/R/U], [U/0.5R/U]S, [0.5R/U/U]S, [U/U/0.5R]S, and [U]5. In bending test, notched and unnotched specimens were tested. For this purpose different circular notch sizes (D = 3, 6, 9 mm) were drilled at the specimen center. Tensile strength, tensile modulus, Poissonâ€™s ratio, bending strength and bending modulus were determined experimentally. The effect of stacking sequences, random fiber relative volume fraction (VfR/VfT), and notch diameter on the mechanical properties of the mentioned composite types were studied. Failure modes of all specimens were investigated.

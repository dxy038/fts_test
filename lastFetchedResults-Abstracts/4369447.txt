A new multi-class call admission control mechanism is proposed which is based on dynamically forming a reservation pool for handoff requests. We first develop the notion of servicing various multi-class connections based on priority determined using the combined analysis of mobile movement information and the desired QoS requirements of multimedia traffic. We also provide a practical framework for determining the occurrence time of handoff request reservations. The simulation results show that the individual QoS criteria of multi-class traffic such as the handoff call dropping probability can be achieved within a targeted objective and the new call blocking probability is constrained to be below a given level

An audio enhancement method based on AAC bitstream is proposed in this paper. First, the improved weighted recursive averaging (IWRA) algorithm is introduced to estimate the noise. Second, the &#946;-order minimum mean-square error (&#946;-MMSE) enhancement approach is employed to obtain the spectral amplitude of audio signals. Finally, the IWRA method and &#946;-MMSE method are applied into MPEG AAC codec for suppressing the noises included in AAC bitstream. The objective and subjective listening test results show that the proposed method yields good noise reduction results, the performance is better than reference methods.

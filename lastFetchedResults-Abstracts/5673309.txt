Aiming at intelligent substation network performance, a hierarchical evaluation index system is established. Based on the traditional hierarchy process, this paper makes use of improved AHP combined with fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approach for the assessment of intelligent substation network. This method can evaluate the qualitative indexes quantitively. Finally, an example proves that the method is feasible and objective; policy-makers can get exact reference for intelligent substation network operates safely.

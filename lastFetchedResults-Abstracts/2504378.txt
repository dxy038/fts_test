Background: The preparation of endometrium for embryo reception is dependent on the ovarian
hormones, which are affected by ovarian hyperstimulation procedure.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in morphometrical indices of endometrium
by the daily injection of progesterone after mouse ovarian induction.
Materials and Methods: Adult virgin female mice were selected and divided into control and
experimental groups. Experimental groups were superovulated using human menopasual gonadotropic
hormone (HMG), and human chorionic gonadotropic hormone (HCG), then they, were subdivided into
two groups, which one group was also injected daily by progesterone. All control and hyperstimulated
groups were rendered pseudopregnant by cervical stimulation. Three and four days after the HCG
injection, the samples of uterine horns were aparted and processed for light microscopic studies.
Results: Our results showed that in the progesterone-injected group, the height of surface and glandular
epithelium was decreased on day three (17.6±3.55, 10.02±2.6) and day four (16.9±4.24, 1.6±0.84)
respectively, and it had low columnar morphology in comparison with the hyperstimulated and control
groups. Also the intercellular spaces of stroma in progesterone-injected group were narrower than these in
the other groups.
Conclusion: Ovarian hyperstimulation followed by progesterone injection alter the morphometrical
indices of surface and glandular epithelium of endometrium, which could affect on its receptivity.

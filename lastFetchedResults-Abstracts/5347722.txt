This paper deals with the corrective action with a power converter for a 100kW multiple fuel cells (FC) generator under fault and used for vehicle propulsion, or high power onboard electrical assistance. The objective is to permit, through the power converter and its control strategy, a soft shut-down of a FC stack in fault and guarantee a continuous of operation at a reduced power, acceptable by the specifications. The power converter should also realize the power management during the degraded working situation. Two power system architectures are studied and compared by numerical simulation.

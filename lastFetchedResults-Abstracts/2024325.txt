Background and objective: Personal protection has an essential role in preventing
and decreasing solar UV radiation-induced cancers. This study aimed to
determine the effect of education based on protection motivation theory on
the harmful effects of sun rays on male students.
Methods: This semi-experimental study was conducted on 200 male students
from eight primary schools randomly divided to control and experimental
groups. The tool used for data collection was a researcher-made questionnaire.
This questionnaire included demographic and protection motivation theory
questions. The validity of the study instruments was assessed and confirmed
by an expert panel and the reliability by Cronbakh Alpha test (s= 0.83) through
20 samples. After primary data collection, educational intervention including
lecture, with cartoon clip with PowerPoint, was performed for the intervation
group. Two months later, data in both groups were collected again and analyzed
through SPSS16 using descriptive and analytic statistics (independent and
paired t test, Chi-square, ANCOVA (p <  0.05).
Results: After intervention among experimental group, the mean scores of
knowledge and behavior increased from 9.55 to 15.88 and. from 6.15 to 10.55,
consecutively. Based on linear regression testing the model could predict 12%
of protective behaviors against UV radiation.
Conclusion: Educational intervention, based on protection motivation theory,
was useful in increasing knowledge and promoting preventive behaviors of ultraviolet
radiation disorders In male primary school students.

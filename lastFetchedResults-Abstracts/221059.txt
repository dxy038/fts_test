The reconstruction of images is an important operation
in many applications. From sampling theory, it is well
known that the sinc-function is the ideal interpolation kernel
which, however, cannot be used in practice. In order to be
able to obtain an acceptable reconstruction, both in terms of
computational speed and mathematical precision, it is required
to design a kernel that is of finite extent and resembles the sincfunction
as much as possible. In this paper, the applicability of the
sinc-approximating symmetrical piecewise nth-order polynomial
kernels is investigated in satisfying these requirements. After
the presentation of the general concept, kernels of first, third,
fifth and seventh order are derived. An objective, quantitative
evaluation of the reconstruction capabilities of these kernels
is obtained by analyzing the spatial and spectral behavior using
different measures, and by using them to translate, rotate,
and magnify a number of real-life test images. From the
experiments, it is concluded that while the improvement of
cubic convolution over linear interpolation is significant, the
use of higher order polynomials only yields marginal improvement.

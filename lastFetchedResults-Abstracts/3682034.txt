Total variation has proven to be a valuable concept in connection with the recovery of images featuring piecewise smooth components. So far, however, it has been used exclusively as an objective to be minimized under constraints. In this paper, we propose an alternative formulation in which total variation is used as a constraint in a general convex programming framework. This approach places no limitation on the incorporation of additional constraints in the restoration process and the resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently via block-iterative methods. Image denoising and deconvolution applications are demonstrated.

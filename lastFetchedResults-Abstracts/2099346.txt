In 1996, an independent scientific committee chaired by Professor John Krebs, tasked to review the problem of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in GB, concluded that vaccination of cattle offered the best long-term solution for controlling the disease in the National Herd. This view has been re-affirmed recently in the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee's report on Bovine TB (2004) and by the findings of the Independent Scientific Group Vaccine Scoping Sub-committee. Significant progress in developing TB vaccines for cattle has been made over the last 5 years. Specifically: (i) DNA or protein subunit vaccines used in combination with BCG have been shown to give superior protection against experimental challenge in cattle than BCG (heterologous prime-boost); (ii) prototype reagents that allow discrimination between vaccinated and infected animals have been developed; and (iii) and correlates of disease severity have been identified that can predict the success or failure of vaccination. These significant advances are detailed in this review with a summary of future directions that TB vaccine development for cattle is likely to take.

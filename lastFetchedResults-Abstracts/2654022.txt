Background and Objectives: One of the applications of population attributable risk percent (PAR%) is to estimate the disease burden in a population exposed to several risk factors. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimates the PAR% of the space-time clusters of pulmonary tuberculosis.

Methods: In this study, the data of pulmonary TB cases were obtained from the health department of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. After detecting significant clusters using the spatiotemporal scan statistic, PAR% was used to analyze the clusters and to detect the location of clusters more accurately.

Results: Four primary space-time clusters and three secondary spatiotemporal clusters were detected for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and 92% of the patients who did not have a clear state in term of HIV infection. Despite differences in the location of clusters and PAR%&nbsp; attributed to them, the second primary cluster of pulmonary tuberculosis cases (consisting of the cities of Razan, Famenain and Kabudrahang) had the highest amount of PAR% that needs more attention.

Conclusion: The presence of significance spatiotemporal clusters in Hamadan highlights the necessity of the use of PAR% to distinguish cluster areas and to implement prevention and control policy. However, more analytical studies are needed to detect the on the determinants of the occurrence of pulmonary TB.

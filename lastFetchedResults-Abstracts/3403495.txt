The task of automating the visual inspection of pin-in-hole solder joints is addressed. Two approaches are explored: statistical pattern recognition and expert systems. An objective dimensionality-reduction method is used to enhance the performance of traditional statistical pattern recognition approaches by decorrelating feature data, generating feature weights, and reducing run-time computations. The expert system uses features in a manner more analogous to the visual clues that a human inspector would rely on for classification. Rules using these cues are developed, and a voting scheme is implemented to accumulate classification evidence incrementally. Both methods compared favorably with human inspector performance

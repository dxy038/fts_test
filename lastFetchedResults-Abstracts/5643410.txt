Measurement of cellular speech quality has applications from equipment installation to daily network maintenance and benchmarking. The area is under development, driven by cost and lead-time of subjective listening tests. Lately, field tests has shown usability for objective speech quality methods. The new SQI-measure, based on radio link parameters is one of these methods. It is independent of transmitted signal and can provide better performance than PSQM and much better performance then RxQual, when used for network tuning. In this paper, the SQI measure is described and categorized, performance comparison figures are presented, and a motivation that speech quality is possible to estimate given radio link status is given

To generate the small sized optical pickup for high recording capacity, integrated optical pickup (IOP) corresponding to blu-ray disc specifications has been developed. The development of the IOP includes the design, fabrication, and evaluation of objective lens unit, silicon optical bench design and fabrication, and the evaluation process of focus error signal and tracking error signal

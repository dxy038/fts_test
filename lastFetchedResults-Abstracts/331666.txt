Objective: The purpose of this workshop was to bring together a tribologist (T.A.S.), a clinician (L.H.M) and a dental materials scientist (R.W.V) to discuss the fundamental mechanisms of wear and how these relate to the manifestations and measurement of wear in dentistry. Eighty delegates contributed to a valuable discussion led by the workshop chairman (C.H.L).

Key points: Wear is the net result of a number of fundamental processes: abrasion, adhesive effects, fatigue and corrosive effects which act in different combinations on the various classes of materials. In ceramics, sliding compression and surface corrosion greatly increase wear, whereas the ability to deform either plastically or elastically influences the wear of polymers. The filler particle distribution is a major variable influencing the wear of composites. In the mouth, wear can be considered in terms of its site, timing and mechanism. The latter may involve direct contact between surfaces or result from the action of slurries; both of which are affected by surface corrosion (erosion). Although wear can be categorized at the chairside, its precise measurement involves the use of replica models and surface contouring. Laboratory simulation is useful to study fundamental wear mechanisms; but it is not able to predict clinical wear.

Conclusions: The management of clinical wear requires a proper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This can only be achieved through close co-operation between all the disciplines which seek to understand and manage wear. The attendance of so many delegates at this workshop indicates the willingness to participate in this process.

This paper presents the applications of pulsed laser experiments for testing the reliability of SRAM-based FPGAs regarding natural radiation environment. The final objective is to understand the basement of configuration memory sensitivity and to highlight the testing possibilities provided by laser fault injection in running application. Static (Virtex 2) and dynamic (Virtex 1) experiments are presented.

ihe needs of system manufacturers for higher levels of system integration, improved performance and reduced costs have been met with the development of the power integrated circuit. The IPD03A/D03B/D203A are high voltage, high current monolithic bipolar power integrated circuits designed to drive DC motors, stepper motors and solenoids in applications which require bidirectional current control. Typical system designs incorporating these devices are presented. Device design issues relating to system applications are discussed and a revolutionary packaging concept for power integrated circuits is introduced.

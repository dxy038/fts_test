We have developed and evaluated RoamWare, a mobile physical/virtual meeting support system that is intended to support knowledge management (KM) in mobile CSCW (computer-supported cooperative work). The design of RoamWare was based on a previous empirical study of knowledge management and mobility at Telia Na/spl uml/ra (R. Lindgren et al., 2000). The evaluation of RoamWare was done in two ways: (1) by exercises and focus groups, and (2) by demonstrations and interviews. The main objective of this research was to explore two issues: (1) the use of the RoamWare system to support knowledge management, and (2) the way in which RoamWare could be integrated in everyday work. The paper ends by highlighting important aspects of knowledge management of particular concern when designing mobile CSCW systems, as well as summing up the impact of activity checklists as an analytical tool and the strengths of using the Umea approach to guide the design of knowledge management systems to support mobile CSCW.

The objective of the paper is to present some concepts of the structural dynamic design considering controllability and stability in vibration and motion control problems. The optimization problems are defined by the poles and the zeros of the open-loop system, and the natural modes of the structure. The sensitivities of the pole, zero and the natural mode with respect to the structural design variables are shown in the paper. The optimization problems are conducted by sensitivity analysis and nonlinear optimization method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by some application results

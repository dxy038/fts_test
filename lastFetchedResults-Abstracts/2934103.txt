The aim of this work is to present the design of a learning control system composed of a hierarchical stochastic reinforcement scheme with penalty to supervise and improve the convergence of a artificial feedforward neural network based on a backpropagation algorithm. The performance of this ANN system is tested while applied to the command and optimization of two different chemical processes: a continuous stirred-tank reactor with a control objective to follow the given operating set points, and a pulsed liquid-liquid extraction column with a control objective to maintain the column within its optimal operating zone

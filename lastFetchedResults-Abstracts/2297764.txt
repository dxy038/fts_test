This paper presents an analysis of the attitudes of farmers towards a policy approach that combines the instrument of set-aside of farmland with agri-environmental measures under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for achieving nature goals. One of the stated objectives of current agricultural and environmental policies is to give greater consideration to issues of nature conservation in agricultural landscapes. To fulfil this objective, there is an urgent need to develop approaches that, on the one hand, are capable of delivering tangible improvements in the ecological situation and nature conservation in agriculture and, on the other hand, are structured in such a way that farmers are willing to put them into practice. In addition, such approaches need to be economical and affordable for society. The Leibniz-Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF) has developed the concept of ‘nature-conservation set-aside’, especially for landscapes that are under predominantly arable use. Conservation set-aside refers to parts of arable farmland especially well suited to nature conservation, which are mandatorily withdrawn from agricultural production (for those who claim payment) and on which ecologically valuable habitats are created through specific management activities. To determine what kind of problems might arise for farmers in the course of implementing this concept as an agri-environmental measure, a survey was carried out in four largely arable regions of Germany. The results of this survey show the attitudes of German farmers regarding set-aside farmland for nature conservation in regions dominated by arable farming, and they demonstrate which factors influence the implementation of conservation set-aside.

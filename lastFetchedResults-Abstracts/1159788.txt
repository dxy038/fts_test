Finite element analysis and optimization technique have been integrated to solve the optimal process parameters of sheet metal forming by transforming multi-objective problem into a single-objective problem in many studies. In this paper, a Pareto-based multi-objective genetic algorithm was applied to optimize sheet metal forming process. In the proposed optimal model, blank-holding force and draw-bead restraining force were optimized as design variables in order to make objective functions of fracture, wrinkle, insufficient stretching and thickness varying minimized simultaneously. The steps of optimization procedure include the using of Latin hypercube design for sample producing, response surface model for coarse fitting and incremental finite element analysis program for exact solving. An auto-body panel stamping case shows that this approach is more effective and accurate than traditional finite element analysis method and the ‘trial and error’ procedure.

A novel bidirectional radio-over-fiber system is proposed and demonstrated based on the cross-polarization modulation (XPolM) and the cross-gain modulation (XGM) effects in a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). With a polarization beam splitter (PBS) placed at the remote antenna unit, the polarization modulation induced by the SOA is converted into two complementary (namely, non-inverted and inverted) intensity modulations. The former is used to cancel the inverted intensity modulation induced by the XGM effect, which generates a clean optical carrier for the uplink service, while the latter enhances the inverted intensity modulation signal generated by the XGM effect, providing the downlink service.

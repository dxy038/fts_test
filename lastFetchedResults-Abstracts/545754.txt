Objective 
Compared to other pediatric emergencies, febrile convulsions (FC), despite 
having an excellent prognosis, are a main cause of considerable anxiety 
among mothers of children faced with their child’s first febrile convulsion. 
Consequently, one of the physician’s most important responsibilities in the 
management of pediatric febrile convulsions is to educate and guide mothers 
on how to reduce their anxiety. This study was performed on mothers whose 
children had been admitted to Mofid Children’s Hospital following a first 
febrile convulsion, to determine the effect of education on lowering the levels 
of maternal anxiety after their child’s first febrile convulsion.
Materials and Methods
In this sequential control clinical trial, 84 volunteering mothers were divided 
in two matched groups, the intervention and the controls. Maternal anxiety 
levels were determined in both groups by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory 
(STAI) standard questionnaire (pretest). Following this, the intervention 
group of mothers underwent face-to-face education for 3 hours, whereas no 
intervention was used for the control group. After nine days, anxiety levels 
were determined in the two groups using the same questionnaire (post-test). 
The data was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney, the Wilcoxon Signed Rank 
Sum, and the McNemar tests, and chi-square analysis.
Results
Results show that in the intervention group, maternal anxiety decreased 
significantly (p < 0.001), whereas no significant difference was seen in the 
control group.
Conclusion 
This study demonstrates that maternal education on FCs significantly 
reduces maternal anxiety, in coping with stress following their child’s first 
febrile convulsion, and considering the results of similar studies, educational 
programs are highly recommended for mothers having children who suffer 
from the condition.

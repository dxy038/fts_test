Based on the modified co-evolutionary genetic algorithm, the signal timing of the urban single-point T intersection was optimized. In order to solve this problem, the shortest average delay was taken as objective, and the intersection geometry shape and prohibition of traffic flow conflicts were taken as restrictions. Simulation experiments show that the optimization signal phase figure results are consistent with the actual traffic situation, and the adaptive co-evolutionary genetic algorithm, which is a new global search algorithm, is feasible and effective for mixed-traffic signal timing at T signalized intersection.

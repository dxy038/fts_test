This paper addresses different laboratory experiences and computer tools to help teach undergraduate synchronous machines courses in Electrotechnics Department at University Mentouri Constantine (ED-UMC), Algeria. After a successful experience with induction motor, the authors outline in this article their recent work on synchronous machines, as part of Engineer report and Master thesis. At first, real lab experimental parametric identification of two salient-pole synchronous machines of respectively 0.3kW and 3kW is performed and the two-reaction diagram is automated using a user-friendly MATLAB program. Afterwards, simulations consisting on virtual laboratory manipulations using the previously identified parameters are carried-out under MATLAB/Simulink package. The main objective of the virtual lab is to improve the understanding level and the outcomes of students. Furthermore, it aims to preserve the real laboratory equipment and to overwhelm its deficiency.

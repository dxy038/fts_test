The present research aims to study the role of mosque in increasing social capital from the viewpoint of the Quran and Islamic narratives. For this reason, specifications of the mosque made in the Quran and narratives have been organized based on social capital indicators in order to identify the role of mosque in increasing production of social capital. The research uses a descriptive-analytic approach based on noble Islamic sources. Specifications of the mosque indicate that it has functions beyond being merely a place of worship (personal worship in its specific meaning). This institution produces and distributes social capital through influencing directly on the elements of common norms, trust, and cooperation. The first two elements create mental links among individuals and consequently their inclination to participate in the mosque-based community and the later element provides the ground for their objective union in institutions made inside the mosque.

Data hiding process embeds data into digital media for the purpose of security. Digital image is one of the best media to store data. It provides large capacity for hiding secret information which results into stego-image imperceptible to human vision, a novel steganographic approach based on data hiding method such as pixel-value differencing. This method provides both high embedding capacity and outstanding imperceptibility for the stego-image. In this paper, different image processing techniques are described for data hiding related to pixel value differencing. Pixel Value Differencing based techniques is carried out to produce modified data hiding method. Hamming is an error correcting method which is useful to hide some information where lost bit are detected and corrected. OPAP is used to minimize embedding error thus quality of stego-image is improved without disturbing secret data. ZigZag method enhances security and quality of image. In modified method Hamming, OPAP and ZigZag methods are combined. In adaptive method image is divided into blocks and then data will be hidden. Objective of the proposed work is to increase the stego-image quality as well as increase capacity of secret data. Result analysis compared for BMP images only, with calculation of evaluation metrics i.e. MSE, PSNR and SSIM.

Objective
tudy was designed to extend the use of a memory training technique, known as the repetition-lag procedure, to Alzheimer patients. The specificity of this procedure is to target the process of recollection for improvement.

p of 12 patients were trained individually for 6 h. The training procedure consisted of a series of yes/no recognition tasks in which some words were repeated throughout the test list across gradually increasing delays. Their performance was evaluated on pre-and-post tests and compared with a recognition practice group and a no contact control group.
s
lly, recollection training patients only performed accurately when the delay between repetitions consisted of one intervening word, but by the end of training their performance increased up to four-word intervals. Interestingly, these benefits generalized to other measures of memory, such as working memory, visual memory and source recognition.
sions
iveness of the repetition-lag procedure in Alzheimerâ€™s disease is discussed.

The objective of this paper is to present an analytic technique for power analysis under non-stationary conditions. We use the transitive closure calculation to identify the transient component in the behavior of the target machine and then, based on the fundamental matrix and a symbolic approach (or support from simulation), we find the actual power distribution that corresponds to the transient regime. The present technique complements the current techniques (either for average or peak power estimation) to handle the case when transient effects exist and cannot be ignored.

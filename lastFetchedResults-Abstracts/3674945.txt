An extension of the iterated constrained endmember (ICE) algorithm that incorporates sparsity-promoting priors to find the correct number of endmembers is presented. In addition to solving for endmembers and endmember fractional maps, this algorithm attempts to autonomously determine the number of endmembers that are required for a particular scene. The number of endmembers is found by adding a sparsity-promoting term to ICEÂ´s objective function.

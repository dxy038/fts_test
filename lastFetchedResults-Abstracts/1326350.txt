Situational awareness refers to the ability by equipment operators to sense their environment with the objective of increasing safety and improving productivity on construction sites. This paper reports on research related to situational awareness of construction equipment using differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), wireless and web-based technologies. In this investigation, the researchers developed and implemented technologies for vehicle tracking, and collision detection. The paper concludes with a summary of these applications, along with a discussion of the limitations of current implementations, and the required augmentation by other technologies.

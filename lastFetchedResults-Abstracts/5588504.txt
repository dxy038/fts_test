This paper presents a control strategy to emulate a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) with a permanent magnet DC machine (PMDC). The PMDC machine is coupled to a vector-controlled surface-mount permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM), allowing the investigation of PMSM control strategies. Simulation and experimental results using a TMS320F2812 DSP module confirm bidirectional constant power transfer during acceleration and deceleration modes. In both cases, the proposed scheme shows excellent potential and allows the demonstration of possible applications of PMSM control schemes for various flywheel applications.

Inroduction & Objective: Present study was carried out in collaboration with culture and propagation section of international research institute of Sturgeon fishes during fall 2014. Growth is one of the most complicated Phenomenons that food quality and quantity as well as ingredient of food are effective in it. Fish resistance level to infections should be improved using immunestimulator such as vitamins to reduce disease risks in fish. Since abnormal levels of vitamin D and Calcium  (Ca) is a accidental factor in most of the diseases; so food chain, growth and immune system are a chain cycle that increasing or decreasing of one of them affect to others directly. The aim of present study was to show that there is direct connection between growth parameters and immune system in Acipenser persicus during 8 weeks.
Material and Methods: 60 fingerlings with mean weight of 18.56 g were divided in to fifteen 50 L tanks each contain 4 fish. 4 experimental diets and 1 control group were designed with three replications. Fish in treatment 1, 2, 3 & 4 feed by 6g/Kg Ca, 3000 IU D, 12 g/Kg Ca and 6g/Kg  Ca + 3000 IU D respectively. Fish in control group feed by basal diet without Ca and D. fish weight and length were measured once 2 weeks and growth parameters were calculated. Blood parameters were measured at the end of experiment. 
Results: Results showed that all growth parameters in treatments1 and 2 were significantly more than other groups (P < 0.05). Also vitamin D level in blood plasma, WBC as well as Neutrophil showed significant differences with other treatments at the end of experiment (P < 0.05).

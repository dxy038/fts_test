Wireless sensor networks have emerged as a promising way to develop high security systems. This paper presents the optimizations of a space-based reconfigurable sensor network under hard constraints by employing an efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). First, a system model is proposed for cluster-based space wireless sensor networks. Second, the statement of multi-objective optimization problems is mathematically formulated under multiple constraints. Third, the MOEA is used to find multi- criteria solutions in the sense of Pareto optimizations. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of applying the MOEA to the multi-objective evolutionary optimizations of a space-based reconfigurable sensor network under hard constraints.

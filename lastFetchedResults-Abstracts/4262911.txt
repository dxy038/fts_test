Several interpolation methods performance are studied and compared. A quarter of a planar ellipse arc is used to be the desired objective curve. Straight-line and circular arc interpolations are used to approximate such desired curve to a specified tolerance. In straight-line interpolation, constant error approach and constant parameter increment based on the model of curvature circle are used. In circular arc interpolation, optimal circular arc interpolation based on the principal of min-max approximation, and the bi-arc interpolation with a polygon approximation are used. The effect of error is analyzed by mean of the number of interpolation points and the continuity of trajectory. The effect on motion control accuracy is also analyzed by different solving methods.

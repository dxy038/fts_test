The objective of this study is to develop a digital human model able to quantify the discomfort during the car entering/exiting movement. Simulating human motions for ergonomics analyses implies to consider alternative movement techniques. The aim of this paper is to identify alternative movement techniques during the car entering movement. A quantitative index called joint contribution vector (JCV) is used. The JCV is a motion in terms of contributions of individual joint degrees of freedom to the achievement of a task goal. The JCV is computed for 20 subjects. A k-mean clustering analysis and a multidimensional scaling analysis are conducted on the JCVs. The results suggest the existence of two motions clusters. The first group consists of 17 subjects and the second group consists of 3 subjects.

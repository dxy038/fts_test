In this paper, an active microwave module containing three MMICs is studied. Our objective is to analyse the MMIC radiation influence on module response. The finite element method is applied to perform a global electromagnetic analysis of the module distributed area. Then, we determine the effect of a metallic boundary placed between MMICs, which permits a decrease in the indirect interferences between these circuits.

Automatic Generation Control (AGC) and Automatic Voltage Control (AVC) are two main control schemes in modern power grid. However, there lacks a coordination between them. Therefore, this paper puts forward a method of coordinated control of AGC and AVC by `simultaneous solutionÂ´. The control variables are selected as power outputs and voltage magnitude of the generators to represent AGC and AVC, respectively. We consider the constraints of node voltage magnitude, line power flow etc. and solve the model using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). This algorithm is suitable for solving multi-objective optimization problem with constraints. Simulations have been carried out on New England 39-bus system, including AGC only, AVC only and the coordinated control of AGC and AVC. The results show the effectiveness of the control strategy.

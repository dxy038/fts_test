Cloud-based mobile services are interactive in nature. Due to the strong correlation between uplink (UL) requests and downlink (DL) responses, it is irrational to optimize the UL and DL resource control problems separately and independently. In this paper, a novel traffic model for interactive mobile cloud services (IMCSs) is constructed, based on which a joint UL-DL scheduling and power allocation strategy is developed. The objective is to minimize the roundtrip delay of causally related UL and DL data groups subject to the average UL transmission power constraint. The algorithm can operate without knowledge of the traffic arrival rates and be implemented in a distributed way so that the transmission overheads between the mobile terminals and the cloud server is reduced.

This research sought to assess the impact of occupational health safety (OHS) on productivity in the commercial food industry. The objective of the study was to explore OHS problems of different work areas and their impact on productivity. The research targeted production supervisors, shop floor employees and industrial clinic nurses. Questionnaires, interviews and observations were used as research instruments to collect data. The study found out that OHS related problems negatively affect workers' productive capacity in the food industry resulting in reduced worker output. Workers develop a negative attitude and low morale towards work. High incidents of accidents at work also occur. The study recommends that food industry factories should upgrade their OHS through training programmes and use up-to-date equipment.

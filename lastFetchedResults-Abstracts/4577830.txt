The cooperation between the Brazilian and Chinese governments established in 1988 led to the development of imaging satellites, which help monitor the natural resources of both countries. In Brazil, the CBERS program includes a policy of free distribution of the images, first inside the national territory and, more recently, to other countries. This distribution is done through a catalogue available on the Internet. The current catalogue is built on a structure based on PHP scripts and mysql relational database. The catalogueÂ´s search interface does not have an editing map, a geo-coding system and file upload. Although the catalogue provides data from many sensor systems, the searches are not multi-sensor. The eoPortal is a geoportal and the main entrance of an architecture, issued by ESA, called Service Support Environment (SSE), in which the users and the service providers can interact automatically and dynamically. The objective of this work was to integrate the CBERS catalogue in the eoPortal through the implementation of a web service. With the integration, the CBERS catalogue received a robust computational platform, a more flexible interface and greater visibility.

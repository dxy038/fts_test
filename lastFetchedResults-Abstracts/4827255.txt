The NIH categorizes premature infants as neonates born prior to 37 weeks of gestation. Due to the necessity for constant monitoring of biosignals, these infants will have a multitude of contact electrodes across their fragile skin, often causing abrasions, tears, and future scarring. The objective of this project is to design and build a smart vest for neonates that use non-adhesive electrodes to collect vital biosignals, eliminating the need for skin damaging adhesive. Electrodes for the detection of an electrocardiogram will be placed on the dorsal aspect of the smart vest in a triangle support structure made of silicone. Within the vest, a piezoelectric respiratory effort band will be integrated below the ribcage allowing for the continuous monitoring of respiratory effort without the use of adhesive electrodes. A pulse oximetry sensor will also be designed and constructed for integration into a bracelet attached to the sleeve of the vest. All of these components will be integrated into the vest and made compatible for use with the GE Dash 4000 cardiac monitor, which is commonly used in neonatal intensive care units. A large-scale version of the vest will be designed, built, tested, and optimized using adult human subjects.

Objective This research aims to compare
the effectiveness of two methods of teaching psychopathology
in reducing stigma toward mental illness.
Based on previous stigma research, a first-person,
narrative approach was contrasted with traditional,
diagnosis-centered education. Study 1 methods Participants
consisted of 53 undergraduates at a small,
public university enrolled in two introductory psychology
classes. During six hours of class time focused
on psychopathology, one class received the experimental
pedagogy while the other served as a control,
receiving traditional instruction. Stigma was assessed
pre- and post-intervention using a social distance scale
and vignette design. Statistical analyses compared
means and change scores between the two classes.
Study 1 results Students in the experimental classroom
showed a significant decrease in stigma following the
intervention, whereas those in the control group
showed no change. Study 2 methods A follow-up study
was conducted to replicate the promising effects demonstrated
in Study 1. Two additional classrooms
(n = 48) were both exposed to the first-person, narrative
pedagogy, and their stigma monitored pre- and
post- intervention. Study 2 results Students reported a
significant decrease in stigma following the intervention.
Conclusions Together, these studies suggest that
traditional methods of teaching psychopathology do
not lessen mental illness stigma, a serious concern that
can potentially be reconciled by incorporating more
person-centered instructional methods. Results are
discussed in terms of their implications for the way
psychopathology is taught throughout the mental
health field, as well as the practical application of stigma
interventions woven into the curriculum

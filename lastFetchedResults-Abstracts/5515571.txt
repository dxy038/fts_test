This paper presents a two-stage approach to solve the environmental/economic dispatch (EED) problem with competing objectives of fuel cost, emission and real power loss. In the first stage, a novel self-adaptive multi-objective differential evolution algorithm is presented to obtain the Pareto front. In the second stage, a technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is employed to help the decision maker to extract the best compromise solution. The proposed approach is carried out on the standard IEEE 30-bus 6-genrator test system, the results obtained demonstrate superiority of the approach and confirm its potential to solve the multi-objective EED problem.

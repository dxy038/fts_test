Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic impact of p53 and p16 expression in curettage material from patients with endometrial carcinoma.
Study design
Preoperative curettage material from a population-based series of 236 endometrial carcinomas from Norway with long and complete follow-up was studied immunohistochemically for p53 and p16 expression.
Results
Pathologic expression of p53 and p16 was seen in 24% and 25%, respectively, and was significantly correlated with high International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and serous/clear cell histologic subtypes. Pathologic p53 expression showed significant correlation with postmenopausal status, high grade, high tumor cell proliferation, and aneuploidy. Patients with normal expression had 85% 5-year survival compared with 51% and 50% when pathologic expression of p53 and p16, respectively. Five-year survival for patients with 2 pathologic markers was 13%, compared with 67% and 91% for 1 or no pathologic markers, respectively.
Conclusion
Pathologic expression of p53 and p16 in curettage material identifies high-risk endometrial carcinoma patients with poor prognosis.

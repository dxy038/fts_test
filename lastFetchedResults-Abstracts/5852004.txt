In this paper a new bidirectional inverter with nonlinear robust controller is presented to improve the circuit performance. In the control strategy, the output voltage is fedback and the input voltage and the inductor voltage are feedforwarded and combined in a special nonlinear way. As a result the output voltage remains dynamically robust when the input voltage and output current have large disturbances. Simulation has been performed for the new inverter. An experimental prototype was built to verify the analysis. Experimental results agree well with the simulation results

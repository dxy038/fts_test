A novel triple phase-shift (TPS) control strategy to extend the soft-switching operating range of the isolated bidirectional dual-active-bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter and achieve high efficiency in a large operating range is proposed. Controlled by the TPS scheme, four typical operating modes are identified with respect to the characterization of phase-shift groups. The power characteristics of operating modes are presented in terms of reactive power and rms current. The comparative analysis of the peak value of inductor current and efficiency for TPS and conventional PS (CPS) control are also presented. The improvement of efficiency is determined by the proper selection of operating modes and phase-shift group. Experimental results show good agreement with theoretical analysis.

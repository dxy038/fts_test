In this paper taking structure parameters as variables, and considering the mechanical restriction and temperature rise in it, we study the maximal force and minimal coil inductance. Based on fundamental of genetic algorithm (GA), we use its eximious character and associate with trait of Radial Bearing, Using dynamic programming, we construct mathematical model of Radial Bearing, thereby solve its itÂ´s Multi-Objective Optimization.

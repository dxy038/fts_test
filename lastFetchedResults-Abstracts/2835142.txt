The cable transmission of the information between computer devices or / and electronic devices is increasingly replaced by wireless transmission. Bluetooth modules are currently among the best performing wireless communication devices. They are characterized by their small size, excellent radio range and low power consumption. The Bluetooth technology is commonly used for creating wireless networks in the IT field (keyboard, mouse, printer...).However, this technology can be used in many more application. In this paper we describe a way to apply the Bluetooth technology in various industrial fields. The project objective is to establish a Bluetooth communication between industrial supervision system (SS) and a peripheral such as a motor. The peripheral is configured as a slave, while the supervision system is configured as a master.

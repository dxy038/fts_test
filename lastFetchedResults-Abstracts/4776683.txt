Many satellite sensing image fusion algorithms have been proposed to acquire a high-resolution multi-spectral image from a high-resolution panchromatic image and several low-resolution multi-spectral images. The intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) method is a typical technique for merging image with its low computational cost and spatial information well-preserving. Since spectral information is of great importance in many applications, the IHS-mean-corrected (IHS-MC) method considers the spectra as a priority, which can remove the color distortion efficiently. However, the fused image using IHS-MC suffers an obvious blocky artifacts. In this paper, an improved IHS-MC method is proposed, which can reduce the blocky artifacts effectively by adjusting the weighting factor. The experiments show that the proposed method can achieve better visual and objective quality both in spectral and spatial aspect.

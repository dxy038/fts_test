We present transmission experiments with an erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) without optical isolators, designed for bidirectional transmission. The combination of high gain and reflections/Rayleigh backscattering may result in laser action of the EDFA at the maximum-gain wavelength 1531 nm. It was demonstrated that wavelength-selective transmission at 1537 nm was unimpaired for G/sub 1531//sup 2/R/sub 1/R/sub 2//spl les/-15 dB. The gain saturation due to laser action and the multiple-reflection penalty were both less than 0.5 dB. A specification for the allowable maximum gain of a bidirectional EDFA is derived.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

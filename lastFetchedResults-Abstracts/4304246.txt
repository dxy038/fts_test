Summary form only given. For decades several definitions of apparent power have been developed aiming at an equation flexible enough to satisfy unbalanced and distorted electrical systems. Unfortunately, all of them have had application limitations. Defining the apparent power in sinusoidal systems is, in the authorsÂ´ opinion, the first and definite direction to be reached: Therefore the objective of this work is to analyze the related aspects of the apparent power present in a four-conductor unbalanced and sinusoidal electrical power system.

In order to improve output waveform quality of chain STATCOM by ladder wave modulation method, put forward to conduction Angle optimization method of total harmonic distortion rate (total harmonic distortion, THD) for direct optimization target, through the particle swarm optimization (particle swarm optimization, PSO) algorithm optimizing objective function of conduction Angle educed in this paper. Numerical experiment results show that the proposed PSO-THD chain STATCOM staircase optimization algorithm has smaller THD of output line voltage than traditional optimization algorithm.

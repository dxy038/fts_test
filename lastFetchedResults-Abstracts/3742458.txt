An experimental laser configuration used to investigate controlling by feedback the emission of a fully-pumped <img src="/images/tex/6.gif" alt="Q"/> -switched ruby laser is described. The objective has been to develop a laser system capable of emitting a 10-kW rectangular pulse of from 5 to 10 microseconds duration. Feedback control of the laser has been achieved. However, a high-frequency instability observed in a small portion of each pulse must be eliminated to give the desired constant amplitude. Theoretical calculations based on a mathematical model of the feedback-controlled laser correlate dramatically with experimental results in predicting the frequency and the onset time of the instability.

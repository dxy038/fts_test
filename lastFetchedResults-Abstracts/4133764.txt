A parametric study for the design of a planar compact dual-frequency antenna is presented. The proposed geometry and the suggested tailoring procedure provide a useful template for generating a single antenna able to serve as bidirectional node for a generic Wireless Sensor Network within the UHF and microwave frequency bands. The constructive parameters can be set to adapt the radiating device for different unlicensed bands and to comply with the international radiation power regulations. A careful design procedure will be described to tune the antenna template for working at the required frequencies. In order to prove the effectiveness of the suggested approach as well as the reliability of the adopted technique, comparisons between simulations and measurements of realized prototypes will be reported.

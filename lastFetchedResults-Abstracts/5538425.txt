In this paper we introduce the concepts of Network Planes and Parallel Internets, with the objective of designing and implementing a lightweight solution for viable end-to-end QoS provisioning. The proposed solution can be deployed with very small incremental additions to the existing best-effort Internet. Through Network Plane engineering and interconnection, mainly by means of intra- and inter-domain routing differentiation, end-to-end service differentiation across the Internet can be achieved.

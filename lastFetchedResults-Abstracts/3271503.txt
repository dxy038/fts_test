We experimentally demonstrated a novel bidirectional radio-over-fiber (ROF) architecture. In the central station (CS), two lightwaves were generated by the erbium-doped optical fiber laser (EDFL), and only one lightwave carried differential phase-shift-keying (DPSK) modulation downstream signals. In the base station (BS), 60 GHz millimeter wave (mm-wave) was generated by optical heterodyne method. At the same time, the downstream signal is remodulated with uplink signal by reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) and sent back to CS. At last the 60 GHz mm-wave of DPSK signal was received and demodulated by the end user. The result is showed with the eye diagram and the bit error rate (BER) curves.

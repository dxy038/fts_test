The purpose of this study was to compare the histologic appearance of the normal larynx and the larynx presumably affected by reflux. A secondary objective was to determine the safety of performing laryngeal biopsies. Biopsy specimens from the interarytenoid area of 15 patients with reflux laryngitis were compared with specimens from 9 control subjects. Control subjects were asymptomatic, had normal 24-hour pH studies, and had a normal videostroboscopic laryngeal examination. Patients with reflux laryngitis had abnormal pH studies and videostroboscopic examinations. There were no consistent changes in mucosal detail or cellular infiltration that distinguished the biopsies from normal patients and those with reflux laryngitis. In this small sample of subjects it was not possible to define any characteristic histologic features of reflux laryngitis.

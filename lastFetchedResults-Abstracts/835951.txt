To indicate the value of perceptions and the representation of universal concepts, Allamah Tabatabai in principles of philosophy and realistic Method has sought to introduce them through sense perception relevant to objective realities, thus giving a special analysis of sense perception. According to him, sense perception is the outcome of the influence of objective sensible on the organ of sensitive faculty and the formation of a material phenomenon in it. This material phenomenon is known intuitively and gives rise to creation of a sensible form in the sentiens and formation of sense perception. However, in Bidayah al Hikmah and Nihayah al Hikmah he considers the influence of the sensible on sensory organ and the resulted material interplay as the preparing cause of presence of sensory and imaginative forms in the soul. Sensory and imaginative forms are self- existent forms known to soul intuitively making them into acquired knowledge by taking certain subjective considerations and comparing them to external sensible things which are the source of external phenomena. His theories in these books are not the same and may be regarded somewhat inconsistent. The books Bidayah al Hikmah and Nihayah al Hikmah being the final works of Allamah Tabatabai, his final theory is the one raised in them rather than his other books. Therefore, sense perception is a specific consideration which mind takes towards abstract ideal form known intuitively

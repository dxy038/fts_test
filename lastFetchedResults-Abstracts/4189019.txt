The objective of this work is the design and development of the data acquisition and storage parts of a monitoring system that will be used for a certain control and guide equipment. The data captured and stored in a database will be an application that will diagnose failure of control and guide equipment. Data acquisition and data store were developed using finite-state machine model and virtual instrument. This paper focuses in the description of the data acquisition. The monitoring system is currently installed and applied on a certain control and guide equipment.

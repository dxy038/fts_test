This article presents a capstone project (CP) approach based on a two-semester effort developed individually to build up and reinforce skills fostered during a computer-engineering curriculum. The CP result is an artifact to be inserted in a context, which is developed, under guidance and monitoring. Besides the student, there are other three roles involved: the advisor for methodological issues; the co-advisor, for technical issues; and the client, to be the source for context knowledge. The student is responsible by planning, developing and managing the project, reporting it in a monograph that is presented in a public defense together with the artifact. The artifact must present a level of complexity that allows measuring some considered major skills. Student and co-advisor choose a methodology for the development effort, whose activities are planned and scheduled. The student should identify open problems in the considered context. One of these problems is chosen as an objective, which should be assessed. Assessment is considered an important issue in the development process. Results are promising: artifacts became real solutions, some even patented; students began graduation because of their CPs or were invited to work because of the acquired knowledge and skills; and students succeed with high self esteem and better communication skills.

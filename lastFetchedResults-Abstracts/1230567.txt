Conventionally optimized structures may show a tendency to be sensitive to variations, for instance in geometry and loading conditions. To avoid this, research has been carried out in the field of robust optimization where variations are taken into account in the optimization process. The overall objective is to create solutions that are optimal both in the sense of mean performance and minimum variability. This work presents an alternative approach to robust optimization, where the robustness of each design is assessed through multiple sampling of the stochastic variables at each design point. Meta-models for the robust optimization are created for both the mean value and the standard deviation of the response. Furthermore, the method is demonstrated on an analytical example and an example of an aluminium extrusion with quadratic cross-section subjected to axial crushing. It works well for the chosen examples and it is concluded that the method is especially well suited for problems with a large number of random variables, since the computational cost is essentially independent of the number of random variables. In addition, the presented approach makes it possible to take into consideration variations that cannot be described with a variable. This is demonstrated in this work by random geometrical perturbations described with the use of Gaussian random fields.

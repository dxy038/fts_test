A planning method for linear object manipulation including knotting/unknotting by one hand is proposed. Firstly, topological states of a linear object are represented as finite permutations of crossing points. Secondly, transitions among topological states are defined. Then, we can generate possible sequences of state transitions, that is, possible manipulation processes from the initial state to a given objective state. Thirdly, a method for determination of grasping points and their moving direction is proposed in order to realize derived manipulation processes. Furthermore, a planning method for one-handed manipulation is proposed. Knotting by one hand is possible as any manipulation processes can be realized by iteration of one-handed operations. Finally, it is demonstrated that our developed system based on the above method can generate manipulation plans for raveling out of an overhand knot.

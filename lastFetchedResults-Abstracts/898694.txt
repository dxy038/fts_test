BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder that is associated with thrombosis in both arteries and veins as well as pregnancy-related complications. The aim of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and safety of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the treatment of pregnant women with a history of recurrent abortion secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
METHODS: In this prospective study, 83 women with a history of 3 or more consecutive spontaneous abortions before 10th weeks of pregnancy and positive antiphospholipid antibodies were received either UFH (5000 units, twice daily), or LMWH (enoxaparin 40 mg, once daily) as soon as pregnancy was diagnosed. Information regarding these women was obtained from comprehensive medical records system of Social Security Corporation, Qom, Iran. Then pregnancy outcome was compared in two groups.
FINDINGS: Forty-two women in the LMWH group (95.5%) and 34 women in the UFH group (87.2%) delivered a viable infant (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences in age and birth weight between the two groups. The mean±SD of apgar score in LMWH was 8.4±1.2 and in UFH was 7.7±1.2. Apgar score was higher in LMWH group (p < 0.05) that was statistically significant. 
CONCLUSION: Both UFH and LMWH were effective in the treatment of pregnant women with a history of recurrent abortion secondary to APS. UFH was successfully used as an alternative to LMWH in the treatment of recurrent abortion secondary to APS.

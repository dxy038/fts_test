Background and Objective: C - reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein produced in liver. It is less than 5 mg per deciliter in the serum and body fluids of normal individuals, but it is increased suddenly   within a few hours following inflammatory reaction. In bacterial and viral infections, active rheumatic fever, acute myocardial infarction and rheumatoid arthritis are also increased. The aim of this study was   to investigate CRP level by Qualitative and Quantitative methods.

Material and Methods: The CRP of 200 patients was investigated by quantitative and qualitative methods. Qualitative CRP testing was conducted   three times by different people, using two kit of bionic and Omega, and  then the mean of the results was reported.  For quantitative CRP testing, Immunoturbidimetry was used. 

Results: In  qualitative   CRP test by  Bionic kit: 180  (90%)  were negative,  6 (3%) weakly positive, 9  (4.5%)  +1  and 5 (2.5 %) were + 2.  In qualitative   CRP test by Omega Kit: 148 (74%) were negative, 32 (16%) weakly positive, 13 (6.5%) +1, 4 (2%) +2 and 3 (1.5%) were +3.   A high percentage of Qualitative results, which were weakly positive, became negative by Quantitative methods.  The Qualitative results of +1 and the next became positive by Quantitative methods. 

Conclusion: It seems that in the early stages of inflammatory disease, quantitative methods are preferred to qualitative methods. Also, in cases that the CRP test results are weakly positive by qualitative methods, they should be controlled by quantitative methods too.

In the paper, by using topological degree theory and Lyapunov function method, the issue of global robust stability is investigated for a class of interval bidirectional associative memory neural networks with inverse Lipschitz neuron activations, a novel sufficient conditions are established towards the existence, uniqueness and global robust stability of the equilibrium point, finally, a examples with their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

Engineering the interface of oil-in-water emulsion droplets with biopolymers that modify its permeability could provide a novel technique to improve flavour retention in dry powders. The objective of this study was to determine if volatile compounds were more retained in dry emulsions stabilized by pea protein isolate (PPI)/pectin complex than that stabilized by PPI alone. The retention of ethyl esters during spray-drying increased with decreasing volatility of the encapsulated compound and ranged from 28% to 40%. The addition of pectin to feed emulsions was quite effective in markedly improving the retention of the three studied flavour compounds. In our previous work (Gharsallaoui et al., 2010), we showed that pectin was able to improve physical integrity of emulsion oil droplets during spray-drying. However, the pectin positive effect on both the droplet stability and the flavour retention at the time of spray-drying can also be explained by a protein molecular structure protective effect. Indeed, the obtained FTIR results showed that pectin was able to preserve the Î²-sheet secondary structure of pea protein when pea globulins/pectin complexes are heated. The study of the release characteristics of a flavour compound from dried powders showed that pectin addition did not affect the release profile mainly accomplished by the diffusion mechanism.

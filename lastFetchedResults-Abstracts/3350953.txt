In allusion to power structures featured by thermal power domination, difficulty of peaking regulation, and lack of peak power, this paper proposes demand response to solve the serious problems in hybrid system that lack of wind power integration capacity and waste wind energy seriously. In this paper, a time-variable multi-objective critical peak pricing decision model, which integrates the interests of wind farms, power consumers, and power electric company, is developed. In order to show its effectiveness and accuracy, the Monte Carlo simulation is introduced to depict wind speed and the improved genetic algorithm was used to solve the model. The results show that this method could significantly cut down the critical peak load of the system and improve the wind power accommodation capacity. It is proven to be a win-win solution: for wind farms, the wasted wind rate is reduced and wind energy is utilized more efficiently; for consumers, the average electricity price is lower; for power electric company, the gross profit is increased.

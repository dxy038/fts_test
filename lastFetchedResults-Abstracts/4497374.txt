A new methodology is introduced to design miniaturized patch antennas based on an in situ GA optimization of a single horizontal complementary resonant structure. Simulation results show that the resonant frequency can be shifted from 5 GHz to 500 MHz providing a size reduction of 90%. At each frequency, the target reflection coefficient, which was set to -15 dB, was obtained within 10 iterations of the GA. These results are not necessarily optimal, and a reduction greater than 90% might be achieved by optimizing on efficiency as well as reflection coefficient. Further analysis using a multi-objective fitness function should provide significant improvement.

Automatic segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) for tissue classification becomes more challenging when the image is corrupted with noise and intensity non-uniformity (INU). Several fuzzy clustering based statistical retrospective methods exist for simultaneous correction and segmentation of images but most of them fail to be robust in presence of noise, outliers and INU artifacts. In this paper, a hybridization of rough c-means and spatial fuzzy c-means clustering is presented whose objective function has been modified to accommodate INU field as well. While the membership function of fuzzy sets enables efficient handling of overlapping partitions, the concept of lower and upper approximations of rough sets deals with uncertainty, vagueness, and incompleteness in class definition. The experiments conducted on brain MR images show promising results in terms of segmentation accuracy and class separability. The usefulness of proposed algorithm is also investigated on high field MR images. The proposed algorithm Rough-Theoretic Bias-Corrected Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm (R-BCFCM) has significant performance improvement over other similar methods from rough-fuzzy family and can be employed for MRI corrupted with high intensity non-uniformity and noise.

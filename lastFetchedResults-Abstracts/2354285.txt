Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important factor for healing after tissue damage in
diverse experimental models. It plays an important role in liver regeneration (LR). The
objective of this experiment is to investigate the methylation variation of 10 CpG sites in
the Egf promoter region and their relevance to Egf expression during rat liver regeneration.
As a follow up of our previous study, rat liver tissue was collected after rat 2/3 partial
hepatectomy (PH) during the re-organization phase (from days 14 to days 28). Liver DNA
was extracted and modified by sodium bisulfate. The methylation status of 10 CpG sites in
Egf promoter region was determined using bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), as BSP method. The results showed that 3 (sites 3, 4 and 9) out of 10 CpG sites
have strikingly methylation changes during the re-organization phase compared to the
regeneration phase (from 2 hours to 168 hours, P=0.002, 0.048 and 0.018, respectively).
Our results showed that methylation modification of CpGs in the Egf promoter region could
be restored to the status before PH operation and changes of methylation didnâ€™t affect Egf
mRNA expression during the re-organization phase.

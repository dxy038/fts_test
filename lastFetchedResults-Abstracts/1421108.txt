The objective of present study is to address the signal responses of the acoustic emission (AE), vibration and torque in rolling contact fatigue (RCF) tests of the coatings. The Feâ€“Cr alloy coatings were deposited using plasma spraying technique. The AE, vibration and torque sensors were assembled to detect the coating failures during the RCF tests, respectively. The results show the signal responses of the vibration and torque accurately indicate the RCF failures of the coatings, but based on the coating losses. The AE signals can sensitively monitor fatigue fractures prior to the formation of the final failure.

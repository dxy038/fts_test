The recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has shown effective in improving the outcome of early acute ischemic if less than one third of the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was involved. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) method has been adopted to assess the MCA involvement by many institutions. However, ASPECTS scoring is still a challenge to clinicians in the stroke center. The purpose of this study is the development of an automated ASPECTS scoring system which provides objective assessment as well as decision making support. The very-high-accuracy-rate test results of such a system on 36 subjects as well as its fast response have demonstrated its potential of providing clinical support in acute stroke care.

ABSTRACT: Kelussiaodoratissimais an endangered medicinal plantwith sedative and inflammatory properties and it used to beconsumed as garnish. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on direct regeneration of this plant. Maximum rate of shoot multiplication(3.3 shoots per explant) was induced when petiole explants were incubated with 2 mg/l BAP and 0.1 mg/l NAA. However, when petiole explants were incubated in 2 mg/l BAP and 0.2 mg/l IBA as well as 1 mg/l BAP and 0.1 mg/l NAA, the percentage of regenerated explants were more (16.6). Taking the rate of proliferated shoots into consideration, petiole explants were superior to others. The combination of 0.2 mg/l BAP and 1 mg/l IBA was found as the most effective treatment for rooting of explants. Regenerated whole plantlets were acclimatized (76.2%) and maintained in standard greenhouse conditions for further growth. There are no published reports on multiplication of K. odoratissima, which may be due to long time seed dormancy and in vitro contamination of this plant; hence this study provides a basis for germplasm conservation and for further investigation of this endangered medicinal plant.

Power control strategy that guarantees users´ quality-of-service (QoS) in a power-efficient manner is a critical yet challenging issue in distributed wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem by considering the energy consumption and QoS provisioning simultaneously, where the QoS requirement is specified by the target signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The problem is represented as multi-objective optimization at each individual user. Then, we cast the formulation within a non-cooperative game framework where the weighted sum of the original objectives is the payoff function. Following our analyses on the properties of Nash equilibrium, we propose the target-SINR oriented power control (TOPC) strategy, which has the advantage of distributed implementation. Further, we reveal the condition for TOPC to converge and illustrate its performance in the extreme cases. Simulation results confirm our analytical results and demonstrate that, compared with the counterparts, our proposal more effectively guarantees users´ QoS with efficient power utilization.

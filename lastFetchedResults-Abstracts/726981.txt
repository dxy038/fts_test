Herein we explore some designs for nitro-aspirins, compounds potentially capable of releasing both aspirin and nitric oxide in vivo. A series of nitrate-bearing alkyl esters of aspirin were prepared based on the choline ester template preferred by human plasma butyrylcholinesterase. The degradation kinetics of the compounds were followed in human plasma solution. All compounds underwent hydrolysis rapidly (t1/2   1 min) but generating exclusively the corresponding nitro-salicylate. The one exception, an N-propyl, N-nitroxyethyl aminoethanol ester produced 9.2% aspirin in molar terms indicating that the nitro-aspirin objective is probably achievable if due cognisance can be paid to the demands of the activating enzyme. Even at this low level of aspirin release, this compound is the most successful nitro-aspirin reported to date in the key human plasma model.

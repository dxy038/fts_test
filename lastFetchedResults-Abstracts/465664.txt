Objective: We sought to determine cardiac troponin T concentrations in umbilical cord plasma from normal and complicated pregnancies. Study Design: At the time of delivery, umbilical cord arterial and venous samples were collected from 209 neonates, and cardiac troponin T levels were measured by immunoassay. Comparisons of clinical factors were made between neonates with normal and elevated cardiac troponin T levels. Significance was deemed present at P< .05. Results: Twelve neonates had elevated cardiac troponin T levels. Exposure to magnesium sulfate was associated with an elevated cardiac troponin T level (relative risk, 33.2; 95% confidence interval, 7.7-143). Conclusions: Cardiac troponin T levels were elevated in neonates exposed to magnesium sulfate in utero. The explanation of this finding and its clinical significance are unknown. Characterization of fetal and neonatal troponin T requires further study. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:1259-62.)

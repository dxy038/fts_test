This work has as its objective to evaluate the effect of incorporation of fine steel sludge waste on the properties and microstructure of a kaolinitic clay used to fabricate bricks and roofing tiles. Characterization tests of the steel sludge employed X-ray diffraction, chemical composition, particle size distribution, scanning electron microscopy and DTA/TG analysis. Compositions were prepared with additions of 0, 5, 10 and 20 wt.% waste in a kaolinitic clay from Brazil. To determine the technological properties such as bulk density, linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural strength, press molded specimens were fired in laboratory furnace at 900 Â°C. The microstructure of the fired specimens was evaluated by SEM and XRD. The results showed that incorporations up to 5 wt.% of fine steel sludge is beneficial to the red ceramic. By contrast, incorporations above 5 wt.% cause deleterious effect on the mechanical strength of the fired specimens.

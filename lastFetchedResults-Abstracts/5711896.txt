A novel contention-free multiple-access protocol for bidirectional-passive bus packet networks is proposed. One version has a simple fixed-assignment transmission scheduling similar to that of the time-division multiple-access protocol, except that left-going and right-going packets may be transmitted only in alternate rounds. Another version employs a simple reservation scheme to provide demand-assignment transmission scheduling. In either instance the protocol may offer a maximum throughput exceeding one packet per packet transmission time under appropriate conditions, where throughput is defined as the number of distinct packets transmitted successfully per packet transmission time. This is possible through channel reuse as explained

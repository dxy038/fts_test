Klebsiella pneumoniae is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia except in alcoholics. Klebsiella may mimic pulmonary reactivation tuberculosis because it presents with hemoptysis and cavitating lesions. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a difficult infection to treat because of the organism's thick capsule. Klebsiella is best treated with third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, or carbapenems. Monotherapy is just as effective as a combination treatment in Klebsiella pneumoniae because newer agents are used. In the past, older agents with less anti-Klebsiella activity were needed for effective treatment. The patient we present was initially thought to have pulmonary tuberculosis, and when found to have Klebsiella pneumoniae, the suggested treatment was monotherapy with ceftriaxone. The patient was treated parenterally initially, and then was treated for 3 weeks with oral ofloxacin.

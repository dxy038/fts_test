The objective of this research is to develop a reliable non invasive method to measure fat content in beef and fish fillet using ultrasound A-Mode scan. The results of the fat measurement from this non invasive method were then compared to the results of fat measurement using a proven method. The Soxhlet method is a standard fat measurement procedure recommended by the Association of Official Analytical Chemist (AOAC). The samples used in this investigation are chicken, meat and fish fillets. The experimental results showed that there is correlation between fat content and the measured ultrasound velocity travelled in the sample. This indicates that fat measurement using the ultrasound A-Mode scan technique can be used to determine fat content in fillet with reasonable accuracy.

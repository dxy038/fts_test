Firewalls and network address translators (NATs) cause significant connectivity problems along with benefits such as network protection and easy address planning. Connectivity problems make nodes separated by a firewall/NAT unable to communicate with each other. Due to the bidirectional and multi-organizational nature of grids, they are particularly susceptible to connectivity problems. These problems make collaboration difficult or impossible and cause resources to be wasted. This paper presents a system, called CODO, which provides applications end-to-end connectivity over firewalls/NATs in a secure way. CODO allows applications authorized through strong security mechanisms to traverse firewalls/NATs, while blocking unauthorized applications. This paper also formalizes the firewall/NAT traversal problem and clarifies how a traversal system fits in the overall security policy enforcement by a firewall/NAT.

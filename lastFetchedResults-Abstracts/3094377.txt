This paper presents an automated and objective method for extraction of swallowing sounds in a record of the tracheal breath and swallowing sounds. The proposed method takes advantage of the fact that swallowing sounds have more non-stationarity comparing with breath sounds and have large components in many wavelet scales whereas wavelet transform coefficients of breath sounds in higher wavelet scales are small. Therefore, a wavelet transform based filter was utilized in which a multiresolution decomposition-reconstruction process filters the signal. Swallowing sounds are detected in the filtered signal. The proposed method was applied to the tracheal sound recordings of 15 healthy and 11 dysphagic subjects. The results were validated manually by visual inspection using airflow measurement and spectrogram of the sounds and auditory means. Experimental results prove that the proposed method is more accurate, efficient, and objective than the methods proposed previously. Swallowing sound detection may be employed in a system for automated swallowing assessment and diagnosis of swallowing disorders (dysphagia) by acoustical means

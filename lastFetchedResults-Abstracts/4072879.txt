The capabilities of a system-diagnosis technique based on mutual testing are discussed. The technique is applied to hypercube computer systems. A one-step diagnosis of hypercubes that involves only one testing phase, in which processors test each other, is described. Two kinds of one-step diagnosis are presented: the precise one-step diagnosis and the pessimistic one-step diagnosis. Results indicate that the degree of diagnosability of the <e1>n</e1>-dimensional hypercube (for short, <e1>n</e1>-cube), where n&#10878;4, increases from <e1>n</e1> to 2<e1>n</e1>-2 as the diagnosis strategy changes from the precise one-step strategy to the pessimistic one-step diagnosis strategy. If the fault bound, the upper bound on the possible number of faulty processors, is kept to the same number <e1>n</e1> in both cases of diagnosis, then the pessimistic strategy requires fewer testing links per processor than the precise strategy. An algorithm for selecting the bidirectional links in an <e1>n</e1>-cube for use as testing links is also presented

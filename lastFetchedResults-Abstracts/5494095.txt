A novel non-isolated bidirectional Buck-Boost converter (NI-BBBC) with a negative-coupled-inductor (NCI) is proposed. By utilizing the induced potential of introduced NCI to block the MOSFET body diode, the reverse-recovery issue of the MOSFET body diode is solved and a high efficiency achieved as a result. The control of the proposed NI-BBBC is as easy as a conventional unidirectional Buck or Boost converter and no extra soft start circuit required for the NI-BBBC. The proposed converter has advantages of high efficiency, simple control and high reliability. The topology derivation and the operation principle of proposed NI-BBBC is analyzed in detail with experimental results given to verify the analysis.

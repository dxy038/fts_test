Background and Objective: In this study the effect of high intensity interval training on miR-29 expression that is expressed in the heart and in the regulation of physiological processes, including extracellular matrix and cardiac hypertrophy of healthy male rats were examined.
Materials and Methods: 16 Wistar rats were divided into training (n=8) and control (n=8) groups. After one week of familiarization, the training protocol was performed for 8 weeks. The progressive training protocol included 6 min warm up (with 50 to 60% of VO2max), 7 frequency (4 min with 80 to 90% of VO2max and 3 min with 50 to 60% of VO2max) and 5 min cool down with 50 to 60% of VO2max.The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last session of training program and cardiac samples were kept at a temperature of - 80 ° C and the variable expression levels (miR-29a، miR-29b and miR-29c) were measured by RT-PCR method. Analysis of the results was performed by independent t-test. 
Results: Training led to a significant increase in miR-29a (3.5 fold), miR-29b (2.24 fold) and miR-29c
(9.77 fold) gene expression in the training group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). Also training brought about 22% increase in heart weight to body weight ratio (HW/BW) in the training group (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: These results point out that training increases miR-29 expression which is associated with physiological cardiac hypertrophy and improved heart performance.

One of the objectives defined in the facility location problem is the maximum dispersing facility location. In these     issues, the goal is maximizing the distance between the facilities according to the available constraints. In some cases these issues use the location of radio stations, schools, sales representatives and general location with sensitive       facilities which have much application in passive defense principles. On the other hand, the facilities operating one principle of passive defense should be dispersed. Therefore, they should be established in a place where they can gain their mission correctly. As a result, the coefficient errors are reduced. Considering this issue (coefficient of perfor-mance and reduced error of candidate points), we suggest Data Envelopment Analysis with the criteria to choosing locations with efficient distribution model. So, in this paper a new multi-objective model for locating critical and     important facilities considering  passive defense principles is presented.

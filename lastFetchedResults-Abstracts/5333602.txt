In this paper, a three phase AC/DC buck converter is proposed. The proposed converter with 6 bidirectional power switches provides bidirectional power flow function. Also, the proposed converter can achieve sinusoidal input current, unity power factor, and adjustable step-down DC voltage. The voltage gain and the selection of the inductor are analyzed. Finally, computer simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis

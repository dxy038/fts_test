A top-level view of the architecture of the Parallel Programming Support Environment (PPSE), which is an experimental set of tools for use in the design and implementation of software systems for parallel computing systems, is proposed. The tools include a graphical design editor, a graphical target machine description system, a task mapper/scheduler tool, parallel code generator, and graphical aids for performance analysis. The objective is, to the extent possible, to design and develop parallel software with little regard for the details of the architecture of the target machine, programming language, or parallel computing paradigm that the program is to use. A prototype of the environment running on the Macintosh was developed. It was used to parallelize a small image-processing application and several simple programs.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

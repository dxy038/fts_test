Much research has been done to evolve cost-effective techniques for fault tolerance of applications running on static distributed systems. With the advent of technology, wireless systems emerged by the end of the last decade, and received considerable attention as useful environments for mobile distributed systems. The requirements for designing fault tolerant techniques for the mobile computing systems have also come to the front. The objective of this paper is to study, analyse the effectiveness of (i) triple modular redundancy (TMR) technique and (ii) checkpoint and recovery technique that may be used by wireless/mobile systems for tolerating faults. A wirelessTMR-(WTMR) checkpointing technique is proposed in the paper that uses checkpointing technique to add fault tolerance to a fault tolerant TMR node in wireless system

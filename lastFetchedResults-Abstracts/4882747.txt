At present, the feasible and pressing task is to adequately make use of the limited actual data of and human beingÂ´s limited knowledge on the fight mechanism of radar system vulnerability to ECM (RSVECM) to obtain a better rather than a best solution or objective function to RSVECM directly with the aggregation method. That is, the turning point of the dominance of utilizing the electromagnetic spectrum, and the basic index of radar anti-ECM is the relative improvement factor (RIF) which is determined mainly by the statistical result of computer dynamic course simulation

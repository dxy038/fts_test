The primary objective of this ongoing project is to create rigorous methodology and software capable of solving for the electromagnetic field coupling in 3-phase systems. The method and philosophy is to provide a concise introduction for finite difference method (FDM) in evaluation the complex electromagnetic field, and to evaluate practical field management (mitigation) strategies to reduce EMF exposure. The model developed in the project gives flexibility in evaluating the electric and magnetic field in a wide range of configurations arising in practice. The code provides simulation which presents an opportunity for an in depth look at the physical aspects of the electromagnetic fields set up by overhead transmission lines near any metallic structure. Railway represents one form of metallic structure, which, if in the proximity of power circuits, is subject to electrical interference in them. The greater the length of the metallic structure parallel to the power lines concerned, the greater is the exposure and the potential for interference.

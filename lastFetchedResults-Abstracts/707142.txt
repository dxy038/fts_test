The main study objective was to determine if experienced emergency physicians can accurately identify a subgroup of patients with anterior shoulder dislocation for whom prereduction radiographs do not alter patient management. Our prospective study evaluated 97 patients who presented to 2 ski-hill clinics and to our rural emergency department with possible shoulder dislocation between November 1996 and May 1997. Emergency physicians were certain of shoulder dislocation by clinical examination alone in 40 of 59 cases (67.8%) of possible dislocation. All 40 cases were found to have a dislocation (100%; 95% CI, 91.19% to 100%), and the prereduction radiograph did not affect management of the injury. Prereduction radiographs added 29.6 Â± 12.68 minutes to treatment. We conclude that shoulder dislocation is often readily apparent from history and physical examination. When the experienced emergency physician is certain of the diagnosis of anterior shoulder dislocation, prereduction radiography delays treatment and does not alter management.

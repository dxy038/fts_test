The objective of this work is to have the results concerning the electric characterization and modeling by Bond Graph of the photovoltaic system coupled to a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The modeling of the global system components is developed with the integration of inverter with filter. The model of the solar generating subsystem is particularly developed. It is shown that this model is interesting for analyzing the dynamic behavior of the system and for designing the control strategy. The operating point of a photovoltaic generator that is connected to a permanent magnet synchronous motor is determined by the intersection point of its characteristic curves. In general, this point is not the same as the generatorÂ´s maximum power point. This difference means losses in the system performance. Other point developed in this paper is presents an improved maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm of a PV system under real climatic conditions. The proposed MPPT is based on the perturbation and observation (P&amp;O) strategy and the variable step method that control the load voltage to ensure optimal operating points of a PV system.

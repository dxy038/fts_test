Background and Objective: The cardiovascular diseases are going to become a major problem in the world. Since a widespread range of physiological and psychological factors may have a role in the onset and continuation of cardiovascular diseases, a combination of all factors should be considered, in describing the onset and course of CV diseases. This study was accomplished in an attempt to investigate the effectiveness of drug therapy in combination with emotion regulation on the perception of anxiety control and cardiovascular responses in female patients with CV disease.

Materials and Methods: Thirty female patients with CV disease were selected via accessible sampling method according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. They were then assigned to experimental and control groups. The Intervention consisted of 10 sessions of emotion regulation, each session lasting 90 minutes. Both of the groups were asked to complete ACQ, and their hemodynamic cardiovascular responses were registered. The data was analyzed through repeated measure analysis of variance by SPSS-24. 

Results: The findings showed that emotion regulation was effective in improving cardiovascular responses and enhancement of the perception of anxiety control.

Conclusion: The results of current study suggest that decrement of cardiovascular responses and enhancement of the perception of anxiety control can be achieved through training of emotion regulation techniques.

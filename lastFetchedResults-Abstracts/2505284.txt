Primary neoplasms in the psoas muscle including schwannoma and soft
                            tissue sarcoma with secondary cystic degeneration are rare entities.
                            They are difficult to distinguish from psoas abscess purely based on
                            radiological findings. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) in the
                            retroperitoneum is an uncommon entity in contrast to liposarcoma and
                            leiomyosarcoma. Psoas abscess is a common infection in the
                            retroperitoneum, especially in regions where tuberculosis is endemic. In
                            the current case, the patient presented with gradually progressive lower
                            abdominal pain and raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),
                            lymphocyte count and sputum positive for acid fast bacilli. There was a
                            presence of previous history of skeletal tuberculosis. Imaging revealed
                            well-defined multilocular cystic lesion involving the left psoas muscle
                            which along with the clinical scenario suggested psoas abscess. However,
                            post-operative biopsy showed the lesion to be a MFH with extensive
                            cystic degeneration. To the best of our knowledge, cystic MFH mimicking
                            an abscess has been previously reported only once in an oncology
                            literature.

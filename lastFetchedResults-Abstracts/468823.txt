Objective
Alterations in endothelial function may explain the reduced risk of preeclampsia that is associated with smoking. We hypothesized that markers of endothelial function increase over pregnancy but decrease with smoking.
Study design
Plasma samples were obtained throughout pregnancy from 63 primiparous women with normal pregnancies. The samples were assayed for cellular fibronectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intracellular adhesion molecule-1. Smoking status was determined by urinary cotinine concentrations.
Results
Mean cellular fibronectin concentrations were different by time (P<.001) and smoking status (P = .01); the lowest concentrations were found in smokers. In contrast, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 was different by smoking status (P = .046); the highest concentrations were found in smokers. Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 was different over time (P<.001), but not by smoking status.
Conclusion
Smoking during pregnancy is associated with reduced cellular fibronectin and increased intracellular adhesion molecule-1. These differences may be the result of different aspects of endothelial function or the source of the marker. The explanation for reduced preeclampsia in smokers remains elusive.

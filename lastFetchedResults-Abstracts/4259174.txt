This article presents a case study about data mining applied in IVRÂ´s navigation trees. Using data from a call center, the main objective is to discover patterns with information about the phone calls. Using a specific part from this information, it shows an analysis about the navigation tree of the offered service. With the WEKA, a data mining toolkit, which provides a lot of possibilities of data mining algorithms, were used three types of data mining algorithms. After the mining process, new information about the navigation could be discovered and the data could be better understood.

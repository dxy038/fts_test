In his philosophy, Aristotle, on the one hand, has created a close relation between
existence and substance so that he can reduce questions about existence to those about
substance, and, on the other hand, believes in the substance-essence relation. That is
why it is very difficult in his philosophy to distinguish existence, substance, and essence
from each other. This has led experts on Aristotle to wonder if there is a distinction
between existence and essence in his philosophy. Moreover, they ask, if there is any
distinction, is it merely a mental/logical/epistemological one , or whether there is an
objective/metaphysical/real one as well ?
In this paper, we intend to show that what we see in Aristotle's works is only a mental
or subjective distinction between existence and essence. Therefore, there is no need to a
metaphysical one, nor could he believe in such a distinction. We will also discuss that, in
the world ofTslam, Farabi and Ibn Sina, by moving from the Aristotelian mental distinction
to the metaphysical distinction between existence and quiddity, managed to present a novel
interpretation and explanation of ontology, cosmology, and theology so that we can new
speak about an independent philosophical system for Muslims.

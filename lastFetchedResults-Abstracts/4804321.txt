A new method for calibrating the microcosmic model of water distribution network under the circumstance that the base demands have been known was set up. A gray-model concerning the ages, materials, and diameters of the pipes of municipal water distribution was set up on the basis of the measured representative friction factors, and then the friction factors of all the pipes of the whole network were estimated by the gray-model. Thus, pipesÂ´ friction factors of the whole network were calibrated accurately using genetic algorithm with the difference between the adjusted and estimated friction factors be a penalty in the objective function, making optimization process be carried through around the estimated values. The case study indicated that the optimization results of genetic algorithm were more consistent with the real situation through using this method.

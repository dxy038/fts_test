Objective: Clinical significance of neonatal positive temporal sharp waves (PTS) is controversial. The aim of this work is to study (1) PTS incidence in preterm infants with or without major ultrasound lesion (MUL) per gestational age (GA), and (2) the relationship between PTS in both sleep states and other electroencephalographic (EEG) findings with poor prognoses.
Methods: 97 preterm infants of <27–36 weeks GA, and 12 full-term healthy infants were presented. Prospective study included (1) neurodevelopmental assessment at 40–42 weeks conceptional age (CA), (2) serial neurosonography, and (3) EEG recording at postnatal week 1, 2, 4 and at 40–42 weeks CA.
Results: In 50 neonates without MUL, peak PTS was at 31–32 weeks GA. In 47 neonates with MUL, PTS increased significantly from week 2 after birth, descending at the 4th. Neonates of <33 weeks GA with MUL showed significantly increased PTS at term. A significant relationship was found between PTS and other EEG abnormalities with poor neurologic prognoses. PTS incidence varied with sleep states, being predominant in indeterminate sleep in neonates with MUL.
Conclusions: PTS increased significantly in infants with MUL, mainly at week 2 of postnatal life, persisting high until term CA, and correlated with other abnormal EEG findings.
Significance: PTS are highly sensitive to MUL.

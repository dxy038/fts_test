In road layer compaction, it is essential that the right level of energy should be transmitted to the material, with a uniform distribution. This energy depends on the number of runs, or passes, of the machine. The main objective of CIRCOM is to assist the driver to perform the exact number of passes, at the right speed, everywhere on the surface to be compacted. From this improvement of quality in terms of level and uniformity of density, will result significant gains in road life-time, equipment operating time and material savings. To perform this task, it is essential to provide the operator and the system with an accurate and continuous location of the machine. The second objective is to record the actual work achieved by the compactor, in terms of trajectory and number of passes on every point, in order to feed the site database and to perform a global quality control at the site level. The main constraint is at the level of ergonomics; the system must be very simple and user-friendly

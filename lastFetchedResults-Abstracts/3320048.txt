This study focuses on the development of software tools integrated with speech processing technology for speech pathologists and for patients with speech/language disorders and voice quality problems. An integrated interface called CATSEAR is under development for database collection, data analysis, therapy design, and patient monitoring. Automatic assessment techniques using pattern recognition algorithms enable the speech pathologist to employ objective criteria during speech therapy as well as guide the patients when the pathologist is not available. The performance of the patient can be monitored over time. CATSEAR enables sharing of databases among speech therapists with remote collaboration and pre-recorded analysis facilities. It can also be used for relatively mild disorders like mispronunciation and for singing voice training.

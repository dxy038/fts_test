This paper describes the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) of Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) using Multi-Fidelity Model (MFM). Multidisciplinary feasible approach is implemented to decompose a coupling variable in a mission and a weight analysis module effectively. The necessary low-fidelity codes, which are based on empirical equations, are developed and validated for aircraft conceptual design. Meanwhile, the strategy of MFM, which constructs accurate and reliable meta-models by using the high-fidelity analysis, is implemented to improve the accuracy of the design method for UCAVs without any noticeable increase in design turnaround time. Minimization of multi-objective design optimization which consists of range and weight is performed and the design result shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the present multi-fidelity technique under MDO problem.

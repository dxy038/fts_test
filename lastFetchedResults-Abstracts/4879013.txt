In this paper, a new motion compensated interpolation (MCI) algorithm based on backward multiple reference frame (BMRF) MCI is introduced into distributed video coding (DVC) system to perform the interpolation of side information. The algorithm has been compared with two other common MCI methods (linear, bidirectional) in the aspects of PSNR performance, perceptual quality and computational complexity. The simulation results clearly showed that the new BMRF method is the optimum choice to interpolate the side information for having advantage in reducing computational complexity without compensating interpolation quality.

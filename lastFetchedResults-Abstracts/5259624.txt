This paper gives some new non-linear controller and CAD method for the multi-objective control systems. Then discusses how to use the new nonlinear controller to perform it. Finally, In this paper, an example of the electronic hydraulic pressure servo control system designed with CAD of multi-objective optimal design method is given. The performance index checked by computer simulation way shows that the performance index of multi-objective optimal system is better than that of linear optimal system. The design method is simple and easy, universal and suitable for engineering design.

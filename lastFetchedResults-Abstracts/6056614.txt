Business-to-business (B2B) market of information processing devices such as printers, copier, fax, database servers, data storage arrays and laptops is growing seamlessly and rapidly, especially in developing country. Radio frequency identification (RFID) system can be the most promising system for information technology (IT) asset management because of its well-developed level of technology, worldwide standards and its lower price than other wireless protocol such as WiFi, WiMAX, Bluetooth and so forth. However, RFID system for IT asset management in B2B environment is limited by several constraints. So, Surface Acoustic Wave based RFID at 2.4 GHz and UHF passive RFID at 900 MHz are discussed as a candidate of it. By analyzing objective data, estimating their future performance, and measuring the readability of SAW RFID system in the standard office, we concluded that the most hopeful candidate for B2B information processing device asset management is surface acoustic wave technology based RFID because of its batteryless passive RFID characteristic, relatively long readable range and its potential, and inherent sensor capability and its expandability as well.

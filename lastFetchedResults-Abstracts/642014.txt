Objective
This paper provides a review of research on partially hydrolyzed guar gum that is relevant to clinical nutrition practice.
Methods
All relevant papers published on partially hydrolyzed guar gum were reviewed and the results summarized.
Results
Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) is a water-soluble dietary fiber with a wide range of uses in clinical nutrition. Its low viscosity allows its use in enteral products and beverages. PHGG can be added to enteral formulas and food products as a dietary fiber source. PHGG provides the benefits associated with dietary fiber ingestion. Addition of PHGG to the diet reduced laxative dependence in a nursing home population. PHGG also reduced the incidence of diarrhea in septic patients receiving total enteral nutrition and reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. PHGG also increased production of Bifidobacterium in the gut.
Conclusion
The ease of use of PHGG and its clinical effectiveness make it a good choice in clinical nutrition practice.

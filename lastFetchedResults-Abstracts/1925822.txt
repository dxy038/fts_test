Outcome data regarding postoperative acute coronary syndrome treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are limited. The objective of this study was to determine clinical outcomes of patients undergoing PCI within 7 days after a surgical procedure. We assessed outcomes of 517 patients who underwent PCI within 7 days after a surgery across 44 hospitals from January 2010 to December 2011 from the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium registry. Patients with postoperative PCI were compared with all other patients with PCI using propensity-matched analysis. Of the 65,175 patients who underwent PCI within the study period, 517 patients had undergone surgery within the previous 7 days. In unadjusted analysis, patients with postsurgical PCI had higher in-hospital mortality (6.96% vs 1.33%), stroke (0.96% vs 0.26%), bleeding events (6.96% vs 2.6%), heart failure (6.96% vs 2.36%), and cardiogenic shock (7.16% vs 1.95%). After propensity matching, mortality remained higher in postsurgical patients (6.5% vs 3.96%, odds ratio 1.7 [1.1 to 2.6], p = 0.02). The odds of mortality were especially high among patients who would otherwise be considered low risk (&lt;1% of predicted mortality in a nonsurgical setting) in whom a recent surgery was strongly associated with death (odds ratio 5.7, p = 0.02). In conclusion, PCI performed within 7 days after a surgical procedure is associated with an increased risk of early mortality. Although some of this increased risk is related to an adverse clinical profile, higher mortality is also observed in patients otherwise considered low risk for PCI.

In this paper a fast flux search controller based on the Neuro-fuzzy systems is proposed to achieve the best efficiency of a direct torque controlled induction motor at light load. In this method the reference flux value is determined through a minimization algorithm with stator current as objective function. This paper discusses and demonstrates the application of Neurofuzzy filtering to stator current estimation. Simulation and experimental results are presented to show the fast response of proposed controller.

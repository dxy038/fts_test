Abstract 
Objective: This research investigated the role of achievement goals orientation and shyness in help-avoidance behavior in ninth grade students of the math–physics branch.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study 150 ninth grade students (87 girls and 63 boys) from the math–physics branch of Varamin Township’s high schools were selected through stratified random sampling. All of them completed the (Elliot-McGregor) achievement goals orientation questionnaire, the (Zimbardo) shyness questionnaire and (Ryan–Pintrich) help-seeking questionnaire. Data were analyzed by stepwise regression.
Results: The findings showed that shyness and performance–avoidance goal orientation have positive and significant associations with help–avoidance behavior (p < 0.01). Together, shyness and avoidance goal orientation predicted 46 percent of the variance in help–avoidance behavior. However, shyness made the greatest contribution to prediction of help–avoidance behavior.
Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of motivational–social (achievement goals orientation) and personality (shyness) variables in help–avoidance behavior.

Objective: To evaluate the performance of two different immuno chromatographic based devices, developed for the rapid diagnosis of malaria without the aid of a microscope. Material and Methods: This prospective study was carried out in Pathology Department PGMI/LRH, Peshawar from May to December 2003. A total of 50 blood samples were collected, 41 from patients, who were smear positive on conventional microscopy and 09 smear negative healthy ndividuals. Thick and thin smears were stained with Giemsa's stain. Tests were performed on Now ICT and OptiMAL devices according to the instructions provided by the manufacturers.Results: On microscopy there were 16 positive cases of P. vivax and 25 positive cases of P. falciparum. ICT and optimal demonstrated 14 and 12 cases positive for P. vivax respectively while 25 out of 25 cases were turned out to be positive for P. falciparum on both the devices showing 100% sensitivity and specificity for P.falciparum and 75 to 87.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity for .vivax.Conclusion: These devices were found highly sensitive and specific for the detection of malarial parasites in peripheral blood and can be used as a first line diagnostic tool.

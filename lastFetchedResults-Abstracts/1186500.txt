This paper presents a multi-objective fuzzy logic controller (PSO–FLC) for active vibration control of seismically exited buildings by combining a new self configurable multi-objective PSO (particle swarm optimisation) algorithm with fuzzy logic controller. The rule base of the proposed PSO–FLC is tuned for optimal control performance by simultaneously optimizing displacement, drift ratio, acceleration and average control force. In addition, the proposed PSO–FLC algorithm also optimises the number as well as the optimal locations of the actuators. Six and 10 storey framed structures subjected to seismic excitations are considered as numerical examples to demonstrate the superior performance of the PSO–FLC algorithm over other control algorithms.

Reports progress in an investigation of wide bandwidth waveforms giving improved range resolution but with discontinuous spectra. The objective is to have a signal occupying a large section of the HF band, but interrupted at several frequencies where other uses are present. The main reasons for using a discontinuous spectrum is to prevent the radar transmissions from disrupting other users and to prevent other signal traffic appearing as large spectral noise spikes in the radar receiver

The authors review the performance of a computer-based marketing information system that was implemented in June 1982. Attention is focused on the reasons why the system was implemented, the process of system design, the impact of the system on corporate strategy and activity, and the system´s effectiveness as perceived by the organization´s executives, users, and information specialists. The objective is to provide a behind-the-scenes look at a system. The authors conclude with a list of suggestions that readers can consider in maximizing the performance of computer-based management information and decision support systems.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The concept of using rectangular patch resonator (RPR) sensors for microwave characterization of biological materials is the non-invasive nature of the technique. It is being used extensively for the complex dielectric properties measurements of materials in the microwave region. Applications in microwave systems, the dielectric substrate and superstrate are made with low loss materials for the best operation. When RPR is used as the sensor, the superstrate is made with the unknown material under test; the objective is then to extract from measurements the dielectric parameters of this material. An accurate modeling of structures, associated with measurement data, is required to obtain, right values of dielectric parameters of unknown material by solving the inverse problem. Our research was established on the implementation of RPR prototypes, in order to be used as a biosensor for non-invasive testing and medical applications to characterize the dielectric properties of various biological materials. Our measurements showed that the complex dielectric properties obtained by this technique are in good agreement with simulations using C.Gabriel &amp; al comparative data.

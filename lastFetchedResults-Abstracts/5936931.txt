The process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network and analyzing them for sign of intrusions is known as intrusion detection system (IDS). The objective of this paper is to extract fuzzy classification rules for intrusion detection in computer networks. The proposed method is based on the iterative rule learning approach (IRL) to fuzzy rule base system design. The fuzzy rule base is generated in an incremental fashion, in that the evolutionary algorithm optimizes one fuzzy classifier rule at a time. The performance of final fuzzy classification system has been investigated using intrusion detection problem as a high-dimensional classification problem. Results show that the presented algorithm produces fuzzy rules, which can be used to construct a reliable intrusion detection system.

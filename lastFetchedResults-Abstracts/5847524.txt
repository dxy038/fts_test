This paper demonstrates a robust layered video scheme, based on data-partitioning and intended for IPTV streaming over wireless broadband. Equal error protection through rateless coding is applied, whereby higher-priority data partitioned packets are protected by appropriate selection of quantization parameter and picture slicing, so as to regulate packet size. In the mobile WiMAX channel investigated, both packet drops from congestion and adverse channel conditions are shown to be affected by packet size. The main proposal is for adaptive rateless coding in which additional redundant data are retransmitted to heal corrupted packets. However, though these packets are always repairable, delay increases as the percentage of corrupted packets increases, affecting the design parameters. Intra-refresh macro blocks are added to prevent the objective video quality falling below an acceptable level. Picture slicing further reduces the packet size to increase robustness in the face of measurement noise during channel estimation and the effects of slow and fast fading.

The use of an analogue computer for short-term optimum hydroelectric-power-generation scheduling is presented. The optimum objective is to minimise the instantaneous energy taken from the system reservoirs, subject to satisfying a predetermined load demand. All downstream stations on a river system are treated as run-of-the-river types. Flowtime delays between stations are neglected in the optimising process, and nonconforming loads are treated as negative generators.

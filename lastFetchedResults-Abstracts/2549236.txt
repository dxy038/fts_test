Objective: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of vitrification and in vitro
culture of human ovarian tissue on the expression of oocytic and follicular cell-related
genes.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, ovarian tissue samples were
obtained from eight transsexual women. Samples were cut into small fragments and
were then assigned to vitrified and non-vitrified groups. In each group, some tissue
fragments were divided into un-cultured and cultured (in ?-MEM medium for 2 weeks)
subgroups. The normality of follicles was assessed by morphological observation under
a light microscope using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Expression levels
of factor in the germ line alpha (FIGLA), KIT ligand (KL), growth differentiation factor
9 (GDF-9) and follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) genes were quantified in
both groups by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
at the beginning and the end of culture.
Results: The percentage of normal follicles was similar between non-cultured vitrified
and non-vitrified groups (P > 0.05), however, cultured tissues had significantly fewer
normal follicles than non-cultured tissues in both vitrified and non-vitrified groups
(P < 0.05). In both cultured groups the rate of primary and secondary follicles was significantly
higher than non-cultured tissues (P < 0.05). The expression of all examined
genes was not significantly altered in both non-cultured groups. Whiles, in comparison
with cultured tissues non-cultured tissues, the expression of FIGLA gene was significantly
decreased, KL gene was not changed, GDF-9 and FSHR genes was significantly
increased (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Human ovarian vitrification following in vitro culture has no impairing
effects on follicle normality and development and expression of related-genes. However,
in vitro culture condition has deleterious effects on normality of follicles.

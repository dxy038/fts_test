The main objective of this work was to enable quality improvement of diabetes services through better monitoring of clinical care in countries of the Black Sea area. We have created a diabetes health record system based on the Good European Health Record (GEHR). Diabetes has served as a prototype for development of a model for chronic illness care. This architecture provides a common data structure for electronic health care records (EHCRs), taking into account ethical, legal, security and educational requirements. A wide range of data types (including laboratory data, photographs, bio-signals, etc.), created in many sources can be recorded. The system offers support for the process of clinical care and medical education. The BSTD (Black Sea Tele Diab) system was developed using a modular design and object-oriented method approach. The Patient Records function offers options for the management of the EHCRs (creation/correction/visualization), such as registration of a new patient and recording of his/her first basic information sheet; the recording of a new sheet; the correction/visualization of the sheet; the recording of data about the patientÂ´s death, etc. The System Administration function allows: the definition of the health care facility; the management of people who use the system or fill in the sheets; the management of passwords and access rights for the users; the management of units used for measurement; and the management of the interface of the system. The system is currently undergoing formal clinical evaluation in diabetes centers from Romania, Ukraine and Moldavia

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fetal and neonatal complications are more common in premature than full term. There are lots of prescription drugs to suppression of premature labor but they are not effective completely. The aim of this study was to compare the nifedipine and magnesium sulfate to delay premature labor.
METHODS: This randomized case control clinical trial study was performed on 100 women with gestational age 24-37 weeks, singleton pregnancy and preterm labor symptoms who admitted to Al- Zahra hospital in Rasht, Iran. Women with fetal or maternal indications that need termination were excluded from the study. There are 50 cases in each group (magnesium sulfate 4gr IV loading infusion and then 2gr/hr until decreased or suppressed uterine contraction and nifedipine10mg capsule and if the contraction did not stop, the second capsule was administered. Vital signs, vaginal bleeding, ruptured membranes, fetal heart rate, uterine contractions and their blood pressure were controlled precisely. (IRCT: 2012062310089N1) 
FINDINGS: Delivery was delayed more than 48 hours in 48% (24) of cases in the magnesium sulfate group and in 72% (36) in nifedipine group (p=0.03). The most cause of cesarean section in 28 of cases was fetal distress in two groups that in magnesium sulfate group was more than the nifedipine group. There was no significant difference in complication between two groups. 
CONCLUSION: The results showed that nifedipine in more effective than magnesium sulfate to postpone delivery more than 48 hours.

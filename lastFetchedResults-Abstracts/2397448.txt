
Objective: Considering the importance of annular dynamics in the valvular and ventricular function, we sought to evaluate the effects of treated pericardial annuloplasty rings on mitral annular dynamics and left-ventricular (LV) function after mitral valve repair. The results were compared with the mitral annular dynamics and LV function in patients with rigid and flexible rings and also in those without any heart problems.

Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients with a myxomatous mitral valve and severe regurgitation were prospectively enrolled in this observational cohort study. The patients underwent comparable surgical mitral valve reconstruction; of these 100 received autologous pericardium rings (Group I), 20 were given flexible prosthetic rings (Group II), and 16 received rigid rings (Group III). Other repair modalities were also performed, depending on the involved segments. The patients were compared with 100 normal subjects in whom an evaluation of the coronary artery was not indicative of valvular or myocardial abnormalities (Group IV). At follow-up, LV systolic indices were assessed via two-dimensional echocardiography at rest and during dobutamine stress echocardiography. Mitral annular motion was examined through mitral annulus systolic excursion (MASE). Peak transmitral flow velocities (TMFV) and mitral valve area (MVA) were also evaluated by means of continuous-wave Doppler.

Results: A postoperative echocardiographic study showed significant mitral regurgitation ( > =2+) in one patient in Group I, one patient in Group II, and none in Group III. None of the patients died. There was a noteworthy increase in TMFV with stress in all the groups, the increase being more considerable in the prosthetic ring groups (Group I from 1.10 ± 0.08 to 1.36 ± 0.13 m/s, Group II from 1.30 ± 0.11 to 1.59 ± 0.19 m/s, Group III from 1.33 ± 0.09 to 1.69 ± 0.21 m/s, and Group IV from 1.08 ± 0.08 to 1.21 ± 0.12 m/s). Recruitment of LVEF reserve during stress was observed in the pericardial ring and normal groups (Group I from 54.6±6.2 to 64.6±7.3%, P < 0.005; and Group IV from 55.3 ± 5.7 to 66 ± 6.2%, P < 0.05), but no significant changes were detected in the prosthetic ring groups (Group II from 50.4 ± 5 to 55.0 ± 5.1, and Group III from 51.1 ± 6.6 to 53.8 ± 4.7). There was a significant MASE increase in both of the studied longitudinal segments at rest and during stress in Groups I and IV compared with the prosthetic ring groups. There was no calcification of the pericardial rings.

Conclusions: The use of treated autologous pericardium rings for mitral valve annuloplasty yields excellent mitral annular dynamics, preserves LV function during stress conditions, and leaves no echocardiographic signs of degeneration.

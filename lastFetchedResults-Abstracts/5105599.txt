We present a resolution-adaptive strategy aimed at increasing the efficiency of probabilistic path planning. Our method represents a modification of the recently proposed RRT-connect planning algorithm. The objective is to reduce the computational load by performing less collision checks in problems involving many degrees of freedom and complex environments, where the cost of such operation is very high. To this end, we introduce an adaptive rule for selecting the step size of the expansion process and delay any collision checking to the solution path verification stage. Experimental results show the benefits of the proposed technique.

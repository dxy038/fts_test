In this article, we present results of recent efforts to identify biomarkers for tuberculosis using a differential mobility spectrometer (DMS). We focus specifically on the capability of exploiting a data collection system that employs a DMS in parallel with a mass spectrometer. This system permits previously developed algorithms for DMS to be used in conjunction with a device considered a gold-standard for chemical identification, making it a unique discovery tool for the determination of biomarkers.

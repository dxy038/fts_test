Accurate measurement, inference and modeling techniques are fundamental to Internet topology research. Spatial analysis of the Internet is needed to develop network planning, optimal routing algorithms, and failure detection measures. A first step toward achieving such goals is the availability of network topologies at different levels of granularity, facilitating realistic simulations of new Internet systems. The main objective of this survey is to familiarize the reader with research on network topology over the past decade. We study techniques for inference, modeling, and generation of the Internet topology at both the router and administrative levels. We also compare the mathematical models assigned to various topologies and the generation tools based on them. We conclude with a look at emerging areas of research and potential future research directions.


Objective: The interest in cosmetic surgery has increased dramatically during recent years
and psychologists have focused on the associations of this interest. The present study aimed to
compare cosmetic surgery patients and normal individuals in terms of their early maladaptive
schemas (EMSs), body image (BI), and self-esteem, as well as investigate the relationships of
EMSs and self-esteem with BI. Methods: 120 university students (60 patients with cosmetic surgery and 60 normal
individuals) completed the Short Form of the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-SF),
Multidimensional Body-Self Questionnaire (MBSRQ), and Cooper-Smith Self-Esteem Test
(CSEI). To investigate data, multivariate analysis of variance, Pearson correlation coefficient
test, and multiple regressions were administered. SPSS-20 software was used for statistical
analysis. Results: Groups study showed significant differences in their appearance evaluation. Findings
indicated significant correlations between domains of disconnection and rejection, impaired
autonomy, and self-esteem with BI. Also, results indicated that EMSs and self-esteem were the
significant predictors of BI. Conclusion: Cosmetic surgery can improve one’s appearance, but to gain a comprehensive
understanding of its causes and outcomes, we must consider various social and psychological
factors and their interactions.

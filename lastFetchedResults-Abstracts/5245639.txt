This paper uses a team of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to cooperatively search, an area of interest that contains regions of opportunity and regions of potential hazard. The objective of the UAV team is to visit as many opportunities as possible, while avoiding as many hazards as possible. To enable cooperation, the UAVs are constrained to stay within communication range of one another. Collision avoidance is also required. Algorithms for team-optimal and individually-optimal/team-suboptimal solutions are developed and their computational complexity compared. Simulation results demonstrating the feasibility of the cooperative search algorithms are presented.

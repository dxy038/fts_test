Introduction & Objective: Visfatin is a newly discovered adipokine which increases with obesity. It is not clear whether resistance versus endurance training which induces changes in adipose tissue and blood lipids might decrease the plasma level of visfatin. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of eight weeks of resistance versus endurance training on plasma level of visfatin in middle-aged men.
Materials & Methods: This clinical-trial study was conducted in 2010, in Ghachsaran, Iran. Twenty eight healthy middle-aged men (aged 38.3 ± 4.7 years; height 173.5 ± 5.9 cm; BMI 25.9 ± 2.9 kg/m2) were the subjects of this study. The subjects were randomly assigned into resistance training group (n=9), endurance training group (n=9) or control group (n=10). Resistance training performed 3 d/wk at an intensity corresponding to 65-80% of one-repetition maximum, 8-12 repetitions and 2-4 sets for 8 weeks. Endurance training group underwent an 8-week intervention with a frequency of 3 d/wk at an intensity corresponding to 65 - 80% maximum heart rate for 20 - 34 minutes. Collected data were analyzed by SPSS version 15.5 software using t-test.
Results: The results showed that the body fat percent, WHR and plasma visfatin were decreased after resistance and endurance training (P<0.05). Maximum oxygen consumption, on the other hand, increases significantly in the two training groups compared with the control group (P<0.05). Plasma visfatin levels at baseline were positively correlated with body fat percent and triglyceride concentration (P<0.05).
Conclusion: It seems that eight weeks of resistance and endurance training induces change in adipose tissue, and also decreases the plasma visfatin level in middle-aged men.

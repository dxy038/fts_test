This paper describes a line-interactive single-phase to three-phase converter. A typical application is in rural areas supplied by a single-wire with earth return system. The traditional objective of feeding a three-phase induction motor is not anymore the main concern for such conversion. Due to the evolution of the farm technology, some of the local loads (as electronic power converters, computers, communication equipments, etc) require high power quality that is intended as sinusoidal, symmetrical, and balanced three-phase voltage. Additionally, to maximize the power from the feeder, the system provides a unity power factor to the grid. A three-phase voltage source inverter-pulsewidth modulation converter is used for this purpose. The power converter processes a fraction of the load power and the energy necessary to regulate the dc link voltage. As it does not need to supply active power, it is not necessary to have a source at the dc side. However, if island mode operation is needed, a dc source must be available at the dc link to supply the load. The control strategy, design criteria, and experimental results are presented

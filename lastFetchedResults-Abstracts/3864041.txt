The objective of the DARPA Network Centric Radio System Program was to design, develop, integrate, and demonstrate the enabling communication technologies and system capabilities required to enable network-centric warfare. NCRS is a first-generation mobile ad hoc network designed to enable ground and airborne vehicle based on-the-move and on-the-halt network-centric connectivity using both IP and non-IP enabled devices. It demonstrated a gateway architecture that can offer radio interoperability among various current, future, coalition, and first responder communications radios via the network, not the radio. This capability illustrated a new dimension for communications interoperability for radio systems developers.

This paper presents the information on development of study on simulation of tool wear of metal cutting in all over the world. Tool wear in metal cutting on the tool-chip and tool-workpiece interfaces are strongly influenced by the cutting temperature, contact stresses, and relative strains. Finite element method (FEM) is a powerful tool to predict cutting process variables, which are difficult to obtain with experimental methods. The objective of this work is focus on the new development in predicting the tool wear evolution and tool life in orthogonal cutting with FEM simulations.

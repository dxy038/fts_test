Background: Iron is an essential micronutrient that may effect on the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of medicinal plants.
Objective: The effect of foliar application of nano-iron chalate were studied on phytochemical and morpho-physiological traits of dragonhead (Dracocephalum moldavica L.). 
Methods: Foliar application of nano-iron chalate on phytochemical and morpho-physiological traits of dragonhead, an experiment was performed in randomized complete block design with three replications in 2014 at Marandâ€™s Payame Noor University. Treatments were including: control (no foliar application), and foliar application of nano-iron chelate (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 g/lit) at stem elongation and beginning of flowering stages.
Results: Foliar application of 2 g/L nano-iron chelate had negative effect on most of the traits in stem elongation and beginning of flowering stages. The maximum and minimum magnitudes of content and yield of essential oil were obtained by foliar application of 1.5 and 2 g/L nano-iron chelate, respectively. The highest and the lowest amounts of chlorophyll were obtained with application of 1 g/L nano-iron chelate at beginning of flowering stage and control, respectively. The highest and the lowest amounts of flavonoid and anthocyanin were achieved by foliar application of 1.5 g/L nano-iron chelate at beginning of flowering stage and control treatment, respectively.
Conclusion: Application of 2 g/L nano-iron chelate had significant effect on most of the traits. Foliar application of nano-iron chelate (1.5 g/L) not only improve the quantitative and qualitative of dragonhead traits but also it causes to move towards sustainable agriculture.

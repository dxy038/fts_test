<p><strong>Objective</strong>: This study aims to describe the blood pressure profile of newborns of preeclampsia mothers in Vali-e-Asr hospital during 2003-2004.<br /><strong>Materials and methods</strong>: In this cross-sectional descriptive analytical study 200 mothers and their newborns were studied. Blood pressure of all newborns was checked by oscillometric method on the first day after birth and recorded in a questionnaire along with information pertaining to the mother, obtained by interview or through medical file retrieval.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: The newborns of mothers with high systolic (&gt;140 mmHg) and diastolic (&gt;90 mmHg) blood pressure had mean systolic (65.40 mmHg) and diastolic (42.85 mmHg) blood pressures higher than that in neonates of normotensive mothers( P &lt;0.006). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure of neonates whose mothers were preeclampsia (68.2/42.11 mmHg or chronically hypertensive (68.59/ 41.50 mmHg-) were significantly higher than neonates of normotensive mothers (P&lt;0.0001 and P&lt;0.002, respectively).Newborns of smokers had significantly higher blood pressures too (P&lt;0.02).<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Mother's blood pressure can affect neonatal blood pressure. Chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and cigarette smoking in mothers can adversely alter neonatal blood pressure. These maternal conditions should be screened and managed as soon as possible.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

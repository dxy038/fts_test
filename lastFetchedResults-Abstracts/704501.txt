Evaluating human immune response to defined Mycobacterium tuberculosis  antigens in patients with different clinical forms of tuberculosis may help in elucidating pathogenesis and in vaccine development. In the present report we evaluated the lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production and natural killer cell cytotoxicity as parameters to screen four mycobacterial recombinant antigens. Pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 13 HIV-negative patients with tuberculous pleurisy, living in a tropical region of Brazil were used in these assays. Crude M. tuberculosis antigen and recombinant 70-, 65- and 38-kDa mycobacterial antigens, induced greater proliferation in PFMC than in PBMC. IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 were evaluated in the PFMC supernatants stimulated by these antigens. Both crude and 70-kDa antigens induced higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10. There was a significant positive correlation between IFN-γ and the proliferative response induced by crude M. tuberculosis  antigen, and an inverse correlation was identified between IL-10 and cell proliferation. IL-4 was not detected in the supernatants of pleural fluid mononuclear cell cultures stimulated by either crude, or recombinant antigens. TNF-α was detected in variable amounts in supernatants of PFMC stimulated by all antigens tested. Natural killer cytotoxicity was induced by both crude and 70-kDa antigen. Our results demonstrate that cells present at the site of disease recognized three of the antigens screened, as shown by lymphocyte proliferation and production of regulatory and inflammatory cytokines, and the results obtained with PFMC were consistently higher than those obtained with homologous PBMC.

Introduction: Development of effective antiretroviral therapies (ART) has reduced mortality and increased life expectancy among individuals with HIV infection. Antiretroviral therapy regiments have improved symptoms and quality of life among these patients, whose sexual and reproductive needs, have, therefore, increased as well. In 2010, 20.8% of HIV-infected Iranians acquired the disease through sexual relations. The objective of this study was to define high-risk sexual behaviors among individuals infected with HIV referred to the Triangular Clinics of Universities of Medical Sciences in Tehran.
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional interview-based survey included 400 HIV-positive individuals selected by consequential sampling.
Results: The majority (60%) of the subjects was males, and 44.2% of men and 51.3% of women with HIV were in the age group 34-25 years. On the whole, 15.6% of the women and 49.6% of the men had high-risk sexual behaviors after diagnosis of HIV infection. Further analysis of the data showed that 62.5%  of HIV-positive individuals were not aware of the risks of unsafe sexual relationship (using no condom) for HIV-positive transmission.. Based on the logistic regression module, it was found that factors strongly associated with high-risk sexual behavior were being male, being single, under high school diploma/graduate degree, alcohol intake and use of hormonal and permanent methods of family planning  (p<0.05).
Conclusion: The findings of this study confirm previous reports showing common high-risk sexual behaviour after diagnosis in HIV-positive populations. Providing suitable health services and advice on fertility and sexual health will result in no- or low-risk sexual life for couples.

Objective  The aim was to identify the prognostic factors which relate to the results, in terms of survival and quality of life, of palliative surgery in cancer patients presenting with an occlusion. Methods  The files of 109 patients with a neoplasm who were operated on for occlusion between 1990 and 2000 have been re-examined. The prognostic factors studied were age, sex, the location of the primary tumour, the extension of the cancer at the time of the operation, and the surgical procedure carried out. The impact on the quality of life was assessed by the resumption of transit and the return home. Results  The median survival was 64 days and the peroperative mortality was 21%. The quality of life of patients has been improved in 65% of cases. The only factors clearly correlating to survival and the success of the operation are the aetiological diagnosis of the occlusion (local recurrence better than carcinomatosis) and the type of procedure it was possible to carry out (resection better than bypass). Conclusion  Palliative surgery can, in a certain number of cases, improve the quality of life of patients, but it has not been possible for us to demonstrate prognostic factors which would allow the selection of patients who could benefit the most from such surgery.

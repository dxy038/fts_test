This paper gives an overview of the ECOCLIMAP-II database, which is a new surface parameters global dataset at a 1 km resolution. The aim of this database is to initialize soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) schemes in meteorological and climate modeling. The overall objective of this paper is then to provide elements of the method used to derive surface parameters at 1 km resolution departing from existing land cover maps, and satellite information. The new concept of classification relies on the analysis of time series of SPOT/ VEGETATION NDVI, in order to define homogeneous ecosystems from a criterion of functioning. For the European product shown here, the more recent CORINE land cover is considered to bring up improvement in regional legends. Surface parameters are derived for each of these ecosystems based on look-up tables. The key parameter is the leaf area index (LAI) since, at the exception of albedo, derivation of other parameter depends on it. This database can be used in meso-scale models,NWP models and GCM models.

Introduction and objective: Candida albicans is the most virulent among the Candida species, and can cause several forms of candidiasis in human. Extracellular phospholipases in C. albicans is discussed as one of the virulence factors. The present study, focused on extracellular phospholipase activities in different isolates of C. albicans isolated from vagina and urine samples from Ahvaz, Iran. In addition, phospholipase activities were compared in C. albicans isolated from two different sources. 
Materials and methods: In the present study, phospholipase activity of 100 isolates of C. albicans with urine and vaginitis origin was demonstrated using Sabouraud's dextrose agar supplemented with egg yolk. 
Results: The phospholipase activity was detected in all tested isolates with a high level in Pz < 0.70. In the present study phospholipase activity with higher Pz values was more common in vaginal isolates (84.7% isolates with Pz value  < 0.70) compared with 75% in urine isolates. 
Conclusion: In the present study, 100% clinical isolates of C. albicans from vaginitis and urine samples demonstrated phospholipase activity.

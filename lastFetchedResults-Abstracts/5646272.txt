To solve the multi-objective optimization problem of material selection, analysis hierarchy set pair model integrating analysis hierarchy process with set pair analysis is presented. Firstly the hierarchy recursive structure was constructed in the model. Secondly the relative closeness was used to evaluate material properties. At last with hierarchy synthesis weight modified the relative closeness. The model avoids the casualness of weight in set pair analysis, and complexity of consistency check in analysis hierarchy process. Based on the model, a material seleciton expert system put into use on Hebei manufacturing informatization platform.

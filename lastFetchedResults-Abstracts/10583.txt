For channels with composite roughness, an equivalent uniform roughness coefficient and flow geometric elements are used in an optimal design method using the Manning equation. The optimal design problems are formulated in a nonlinear optimization framework with the objective function being a cost function per unit length of the canal. Constraints are the Manning equation, positive values for design variables, and specified values of side slopes or top width. The constrained problem is transformed into an unconstrained problem using the Lagrangian multipliers. To obtain an optimal solution for the resulting unconstrained problem, the first-order necessary conditions for optima are applied. The resulting simultaneous nonlinear equations are solved using the computational methodology developed. This technique is applied to illustrative numerical examples. The evaluations establish the potential applicability of the developed computational methodology for optimal design of open channel cross sections with composite roughness.

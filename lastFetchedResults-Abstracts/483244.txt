Background: Dentistry systems should meet criteria of infection controls. Higher compatibility will result in more desirable system situation.
Objective: To determine the conformation rates of governmental dentistry centers located in south and southwest of Tehran with desirable criteria for infection control and the affecting factors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study performed on 74 governmental dentistry centers in south and south west of Tehran province in 2004. Achecklist including 10 axes was used to investigate 141 identities for their conformity to meet infectious control criteria via direct observation. Following the analysis of data by SPSS-V11.5 and the application of t-test and Chi square test, the situation of centers were placed into three rankings as follows: Under expected (<50%), Medium (50-75%), and desirable (>75%). Their desirable degree was tested by 10 presumptive effective factors.
Findings: Among 74 investigated centers in the study, 40 centers were located in the south of Tehran, 24 in Shahr-e-Rey, and 10 in Islamshahr with a mean conformation to desirable criteria of 56.3, 52.5, and 60.1%, respectively. Collectively,, 12 centers (16.2%) were placed in under expected, 60 centers (81.1%) in medium, and 2 centers (2.7%) in desirable ranking. Availability of dentists with specialty, being a member of academic staff, and the presence of dental clinic in universityhospital s were found to produce a significant impact towards the desirability, statistically (p<0.05).
Conclusion: According to our findings, monitoring and solving the problems of centers with under expectable limit to meet the desirable criteria is suggested.

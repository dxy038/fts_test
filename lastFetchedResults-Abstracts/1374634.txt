This paper describes a novel colorimetric method for detection of nucleic acid targets in a homogeneous format with improved sensitivity by means of a system based on the combination of a tunable monochromatic light source and an amorphous/nanocrystalline silicon photodetector that detects color and light intensity changes undergone by samples/assays containing tailored gold nanoparticles probes. This new low cost, portable, fast and simple optoelectronic platform, with the possibility to be re-used, permits detection of at least 400 fentomole of specific DNA sequences without target or signal amplification and was applied to the rapid detection of human pathogens in large variety of clinical samples such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

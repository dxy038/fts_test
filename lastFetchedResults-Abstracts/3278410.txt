Clustering in wireless sensor networks is an important technique to improve routing, reduce the communication overhead in several cases and reduce the energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm for mobile wireless sensor networks. The objective of our proposed algorithm is improving the network stability and saving the energy consumption while keeping the network connectivity. This is realized by an adequate and adaptive choice of cluster-heads during the formation of cluster process. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of our clustering algorithm by comparing its performance with those of previous works. The results of simulation demonstrate that our proposed clustering algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption.

In this work, we present two synchronizer groups: the synchronous and the asynchronous. The synchronous group is based in forward logic with flip flops and the asynchronous group is based in forward logic with delay line feedback. In each group we consider two versions: the manual and the automatic. The main objective is to study the two groups, each one with two versions and to observe its jitter performance as function of the noise.

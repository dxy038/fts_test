Damage to wheels and rails due to wear and fatigue affects the safety and maintenance of railway vehicles. The present study optimizes profile of the wheel flange for reducing flange wear and surface fatigue on a curved track. The railway dynamic analysis program VAMPIRE is employed to calculate different loading conditions, contact pressure, wear and fatigue on the running surface of the wheel. The multi-objective optimization of minimizing both flange wear and surface fatigue is handled by a fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, NSGA-II. Optimized designs yield better performance and reduced wear and fatigue compared to an initial wheel profile.

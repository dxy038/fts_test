The main objective of the paper is to study the possible interactions between contact fatigue and dynamic tooth loads on gears. A specific 3D dynamic gear model is combined to contact fatigue models accounting for crack initiation and propagation. The numerical findings compare well with the experimental evidence from a back-to-back test rig. Three characteristic points on a tooth profile are analysed and it is shown that contact fatigue on spur gears clearly depends on dynamic phenomena. Finally, the introduction of profile relief is discussed and its positive influence on the risk of failures at engagement is emphasised.

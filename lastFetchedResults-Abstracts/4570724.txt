The objective of this paper is to present a feature model as a main deliverable of a domain analysis for context-aware Mobile Patient Monitoring Systems (MPMS). This model is a part of ongoing work to design an application framework to develop context-aware MPMS. These systems will enable elderly populations and patients with chronic diseases to undertake monitoring of themselves during their daily life. Unfortunately, developing these systems is very complex. An application framework, as an ideal reuse technique, is one of the most suitable solutions to simplify the development of such systems and overcome their development complexity. The scope of this paper is limited to construction process for context-aware MPMS feature model. The expected benefits of the resulted model are twofold. First, it enhances the understanding of the domain of context-aware MPMS. Second, it supports designing frameworks that satisfy the main characteristics of application frameworks, which are framework extensibility and reusability.

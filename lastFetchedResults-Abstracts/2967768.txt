We extend the basic Bellman and ZadehÂ´s (1970) model of multistage control (decision making) in a fuzzy environment to include both objective and subjective fuzzy constraints on controls and fuzzy goals on states at the consecutive control stages. Moreover, we consider some aggregation operators to reflect different attitudes towards the satisfaction and substitutability of the fuzzy constraints and fuzzy goals. We present an extended fuzzy dynamic programming model covering those aspects. The extension is motivated by a socio-economic regional planning problem discussed in Kacprzyk and Straszak (1982, 1984), which is outlined in this paper

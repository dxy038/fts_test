Walking like human might be considered as the most important objective for humanoid robots. Toe-joint is perhaps one of the most important missing parts of the structure of humanoid, which can play essential role in natural walking. Regarding this fact, the effect of toe-joint in improving performance of motion is studied in this paper. To this end, a nine-link biped is studied and compared with a similar toe-less seven-link biped. Three indices of energy consumption, joint torque demand, power consumption, are compared during a complete step of both bipeds. Both single support and double support phases are considered in this study.

An interesting hierarchy of random number generators is introduced in this paper based on the review of random numbers characteristics and chaotic functions theory. The main objective of this paper is to produce an ergodic dynamical system which can be implemented in random number generators. In order to check the efficacy of pseudo random number generators based on this map, we have carried out certain statistical tests on a series of numbers obtained from the introduced hierarchy. The results of the tests were promising, as the hierarchy passed the tests satisfactorily, and offers a great capability to be employed in a pseudo random number generator.

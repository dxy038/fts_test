Pharmacological conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm in horses can be difficult. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of transvenous electrical cardioversion with custom made catheters in eight horses, of which three had failed cardioversion using quinidine sulfate. Two cardioversion catheters and one pacing/sensing electrode were inserted via the right jugular vein and placed using ultrasound guidance into the left pulmonary artery, the right atrium and the right ventricle, respectively. Because immediate recurrence of AF was encountered in the second horse treated, pre-treatment with amiodarone was given to each of the remaining six horses. Induction of general anaesthesia was associated with dislocation of the cardioversion catheter in three horses, requiring a second catheterisation procedure. During general anaesthesia, biphasic R wave synchronised shocks of up to 360 J were delivered between both cardioversion electrodes.

 horses (75%), including two which had failed quinidine sulfate treatment, sinus rhythm was restored with a mean energy level of 295 Â± 62 J. No side effects were observed. Blood analysis 3 h after cardioversion revealed normal parameters, including cardiac troponin I values. Transvenous electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation with custom made cardioversion catheters can be considered as a treatment option for atrial fibrillation in horses, especially when conventional drugs fail.

A primary factor affecting optimum performance of microwave multipliers employing nonlinear devices is the proper termination of the fundamental and other harmonic frequency components. The objective of this paper is to present a quantitative analysis leading to the assessment of optimum terminating impedances in the design of active frequency multipliers. The analysis includes computer modelled HEMT data and supporting measured data for corresponding circuit realizations. An experimental design reveals an improvement in multiplier gain of 77% over the conventional approach.

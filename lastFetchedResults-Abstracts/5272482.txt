This paper focuses on the research of distributed rate control algorithms for the reverse link of 1times EV-DO systems. First, following the basic idea proposed by Kelly (1997), a utility maximization system model is formulated. The objective of the rate control algorithms is to make the system converge to the optimal state of the system model. We investigate the performance of two distributed rate control algorithms: the conventional distributed rate control (CDRC) algorithm and the modified distributed rate control (MDRC) algorithm. The CDRC is based on the MAC algorithm in CDMA2000 1times EV-DO Standard (2005). With the CDRC, we give our conclusions as how to design the specific functions of the algorithm according to the utility functions to ensure the objective mentioned above. The MDRC is a new proposed algorithm based on the optimal solution of the system problem which can also ensure the objective. Our numerical simulation results give the performance comparisons between them and validate our deduction.

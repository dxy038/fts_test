The authors describe Wavescan, a multipurpose data buoy specially designed for directional wave measurements and meteorological data collection. Their objective was to produce a second-generation high-capability metocean data buoy, with full in situ processing, real-time telemetry, and onshore result presentation. Emphasis is on the design of a buoy hull with the wave-following capability needed to accurately measure wave slope while at the same time retaining the stability to operate and collect meteorological data under the extreme conditions the buoy is likely to meet. The authors briefly review the advantages and disadvantages of the various buoy hulls that have been employed for collection of metocean data. The stability and dynamic response of the final design are then discussed, and results from a field test intercomparison during which a prototype buoy was deployed for several weeks off the mid-Norway shore are examined. The Wavescan system functions and the directional wave analysis are summarized. It is concluded that Wavescan has reached its design goals

ABSTRACT:  This study was done with the intention of finding the effect of self-assessment on reading skill and vocabulary Knowledge. To accomplish the objective of the study, 192 intermediate EFL learners were chosen after going through an Oxford placement test and then participated in the study. One week after, the participants were given the TOEFL reading and vocabulary tests. The tests had two sections, one was the reading section which they were supposed to do it in 15 minutes and the other section was the vocabulary test which they were supposed to finish it in 20 minutes. A week later, the researcher gave the participants the self-assessment questionnaire to fill in. The participants were supposed to check the number 0-10 for each item in the questionnaire to express how much they agreed or disagreed with the items. After extracting the data from the questionnaires, the data was analyzed by SPSS software. To analyze data Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was applied. The results showed that self-assessment had a significant effect on reading and no impact on vocabulary.

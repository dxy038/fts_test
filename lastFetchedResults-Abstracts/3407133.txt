A stereo microphone array developed for a high-definition videophone system is presented. The array consists of a pair of fixed beamformers to collect sounds in stereo clearly while suppressing the far-end talk emitted from the loudspeakers to decrease the undesirable influence of acoustic echo. Both the objective and subjective experimental results demonstrate that the microphone array satisfies the required specifications, which have not been achieved by several conventional schemes.

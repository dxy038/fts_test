Objectives
Our objective in this research was the evaluation of the long-term results after directional atherectomy using the Silverhawk device (FoxHollow Technologies, Redwood City, California) of femoro-popliteal lesions.
Background

Considering reports on stent fractures in femoro-popliteal arteries, atherectomy may be a valuable alternative to stenting.
Methods

Eighty-four patients with 100 legs and 131 lesions with peripheral occlusive disease Rutherford categories 2 to 5 were included in a prospective registry. Forty-five lesions were de novo lesions (group 1; 34%), 43 lesions native vessel restenoses (group 2; 33%), and 43 lesions in-stent restenoses (group 3; 33%). Additional low pressure balloon angioplasty was used in 78 of 131 lesions (59%) and stenting in 8 lesions (6%).
Results

Technical success rate was 86% for atherectomy only and 100% after additional therapy. Mean lesion length was 43 ± 54 mm, 105 ± 122 mm, and 131 ± 111 mm for group 1, group 2, and group 3, respectively (p < 0.001). Primary patency, defined as freedom of a >50% restenosis detected by duplex, was 84%, 54%, and 54% at 12 months (p = 0.002) and 73%, 42%, and 49%, at 18 months (p = 0.008); secondary patency rates were 100%, 93%, and 91% at 12 months (p = NS) and 89%, 67%, and 79% at 18 months (p = 0.001), respectively; and target lesion revascularization rate was 16%, 44%, and 47% at 12 months and 22%, 56%, and 49% at 18 months (p = 0.003 each) for group 1, group 2, and group 3, respectively. The only independent predictor for restenosis was treatment of restenotic lesions. Ankle-brachial index was significantly improved after 12 months and 18 months in all groups.
Conclusions

Long-term technical and clinical results after directional atherectomy of femoro-popliteal lesions are in favor of de novo lesions compared with restenotic lesions.

Summary form only given. In order to obtain high-current charged particle beams, linear induction accelerators (LIA´s) of two types have been already constructed. Conventional LIA´s adopt a unidirectional pulse injected from an external-pulser. In this case, toroidal magnetic cores surrounding a beam path are usually loaded in each cavity to increase shunt inductances. Since the magnetic energy stored in the core during the pulse is impossible to recover, the energy transfer efficiency of the pulser-accelerator system is necessarily low. The other LIA´s, one of which has been proposed and constructed by Pavlovskii et al., have accelerating cavities made from pulse forming lines (PFL´s). In this case, no magnetic core loaded in the cavity is necessary. However, the injected pulse must be a bidirectional one. Since a part of the voltage pulse with reversed polarity is used to accelerate a beam, it is possible to make the time integral of the output voltage zero. Thus the final magnetic energy stored in the cavity can be made zero at the end of the pulse, and the pulser-accelerator system attains the energy transfer efficiency of 100%. Accelerators of this type can be devided into two kinds, one of which has cavities with internal energy storage, and the other has cavities with energy injected from external bidirectional pulsers. The accelerator of latter type has been first proposed by Smith, but it has not been realized.

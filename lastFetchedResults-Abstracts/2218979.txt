Objective(s):This study investigated the effects of melatonin, famotidine, mirtazapine, and thiamine pyrophosphate on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in diabetic rats and evaluated oxidant and antioxidant marker measurement results. It also examined the effects of the drugs aimed at preventing infertility that may result from I/R injury. Materials and Methods: Diabetic rats were divided into a control group (IRC) to be exposed to I/R, an ovarian I/R + 2.2 mg/kg melatonin (IRML) group, an ovarian I/R + famotidine (IRFA) group, an ovarian I/R + 20 mg/kg mirtazapine (IRMR) group, an ovarian I/R + 20 mg/kg thiamine pyrophosphate (IRTP) group, and a sham operation (SO) group. Results: In the control group exposed to I/R, the levels of the oxidant parameters Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Myeloperoxidase(MPO) were significantly higher compared with the SO group, while the levels of the antioxidant parameters glutathione (GSH), Glutathioneperoxidase(GPO), Glutathione reductase (GSHRd), Glutathione S - transferase (GST), and[y1]   Superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly lower. Melatonin, famotidine, mirtazapine, and thiamin pyrophosphate prevented a rise in oxidant parameters and a decrease in antioxidants in ovarian tissue exposed to I/R. However, apart from thiamin pyrophosphate, none of the drugs were able to prevent infertility caused by I/R injury.   Conclusion: Prevention of ovarian I/R injury-related infertility in rats with induced diabetes is not through antioxidant activity. Thiamine pyrophosphate prevents infertility through an as yet unknown mechanism. This study suggests that thiamine pyrophosphate may be useful in the prevention of I/R-related infertility in diabetics.

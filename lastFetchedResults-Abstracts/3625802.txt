The retrial phenomenon and its significant effect on network performance have been taking into account in the literature (e.g., random access protocols in computer networks, cellular mobile telephony). Most studies assume exponential distributions to guarantee the tractability of the mathematical model. However, this is a serious drawback in practice where the exponentiality is not a realistic assumption. The objective is to find a good balance between realistic assumptions and tractability. In this paper, the objective is achieved by proposing a multichannel queueing model with quasi-random input and retrial and service times of phase type.

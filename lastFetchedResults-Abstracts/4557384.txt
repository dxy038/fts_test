We propose a low-cost high-power-factor three-phase rectifier with a turn-on current suppression circuit. With the proposed suppression circuit, standard rectifier diodes can be used instead of fast-recovery diodes in the main diode bridge even with a pulse-width-modulation (PWM) frequency above 10 kHz of the bidirectional switches. We also propose a detection method of the ac source phase using only resistors and a table-based PWM control method, with which the harmonic currents can be limited under the IEC61000-3-2 standard over an extended output range. We present the simulation and experimental results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed suppression circuit and the control methods.

The main objective in this study was to investigate the impacts of mechanization on farm labour employment. Also, using Chow Test, the impacts of export growth on structural shift in labour employment were studied. Data were collected from various data sites such as PDS, FAO and ECONSTATS sites as well as various publications of Iranian Statistics Centre for years 1350-1379. In order to study the impacts of factors such as growth rate of real export, real capital stock, real gross domestic production, real non export output and technology (capital to labour ratio) on the growth rate of labour employment, four regression equations were estimated through ARDL method. The results revealed that, in the long run, there is a positive relationship between labour employment and real export, real capital stock, real gross domestic production and real non export output. However, the impact of technology on labour employment was negative. Also, in the short run, relationships between labour employment and the factors of real export, and technology were negative. In addition, real non export output, real capital stock, real gross domestic production were positively related to labour employment. The measure in adjustment rate varied from three months to one year, indicating that less than one year is required for policy impacts to be observed. Results of Chow Test indicated that impact of export growth on structure of labour employment in farm sector was statistically significant.

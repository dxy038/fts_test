The concept of min-cut is central to the partitioning problem, a scheme so as to minimize the number of edges between any two areas. Based on this concept, we propose a heuristic cell partitioning scheme to minimize overhead when the mobile host crosses from one cell to another in a cellular networks. In this study, we expand to the scheme adapted for cellular networks from the min-cut concept, and formulate objective functions so as to minimize partitioning. Also, we present test results of the proposed scheme

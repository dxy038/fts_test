Objective
luate the open laminate technique using glass ionomer cements (GIC) in association with a low shrink composite for restoring root filled premolars.
s
ive MOD cavities plus endodontic access and root filling were performed in intact extracted maxillary premolars. Three restoration types were evaluated: (1) resin composite alone; (2) resin-modified GIC (RM-GIC) open laminate plus resin composite; (3) conventional GIC open laminate plus resin composite (n = 8 for all groups and tests). Three tests were conducted to assess restorations: (A) inward cusp deflection during light curing, using DCDTs; (B) fracture strength using a ramped oblique load at 45° to the long axis in a servohydraulic testing machine in comparison with intact and unrestored teeth; (C) proximal marginal leakage using methylene blue dye and the effect of thermocycling. Data were analysed using 1-way ANOVA for cuspal deflection and fracture strength and Fisher's exact test for leakage.
s
te restorations resulted in significantly less cuspal deflection compared with resin composite (4.2 ± 1.2 μm for RM-GIC and 5.1 ± 2.3 μm for conventional GIC vs. 12.2 ± 2.6 μm for composite, P &lt; 0.001). Fracture strength was not significantly different among all groups. Failure with all restorations was predominantly adhesive at the tooth-restoration interface. The two laminate groups showed significantly better marginal seal than composite alone, but sealing ability of conventional GIC deteriorated after thermocycling.
sions
te restoration of root filled teeth had beneficial effects in terms of reducing cuspal deflection and marginal seal, with acceptable fracture strength.

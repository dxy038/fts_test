This paper presents a new model-free technique to design fixed-structure controllers for linear unknown systems. In the current control design approaches, measured data are used to first identify a model of the plant, then a controller is designed based on the identified model. Due to errors associated with the identification process, degradation in the controller performance is expected. Hence, we use the measured data to directly design the controller without the need for model identification. Our objective here is to design measurement-based controllers for stable and unstable systems, even when the closed-loop architecture is unknown. This proposed method can be very useful for many industrial applications. The proposed control methodology is a reference model design approach which aims at finding suitable parameter values of a fixed-order controller so that the closed-loop frequency response matches a desired frequency response. This reference model design problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem using the concept of bounded error, which can then be solved to find suitable values of the controller parameters. In addition to the well-known advantages of data-based control methods, the main features of our proposed approach are: (1) the error is guaranteed to be bounded, (2) it enables us to avoid issues related to the use of minimization methods, (3) it can be applied to stable and unstable plants and does not require any knowledge about the closed-loop architecture, and (4) the controller structure can be selected a priori, which means that low-order controllers can be designed. The proposed technique is experimentally validated through a real position control problem of a DC servomotor, where the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

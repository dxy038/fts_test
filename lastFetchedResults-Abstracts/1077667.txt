Cashew apple is a tropical fruit that presents high vitamin C content, rich flavour and aroma. Brazilian market of cashew apple juice is about 40,000 ton/y and it presents a low consumption at the international market. This work had the objective of studying the shelf-life stability of cashew apple juice clarified by microfiltration associated with enzymes, supposedly to present a lower astringency and a better physical stability. Cashew apple pulp was used as raw material. It was first hydrolysed and then microfiltered in a 0.3-μm pore size tubular membrane. Permeate juice was collected in a sterilised closed system and stored at room (30°C) and refrigeration (4°C) temperatures for 2 months. Ascorbic acid and tannin contents, haze, pH, acidity, soluble solids of the juice as well as microbiological counting were determined each 15 d. Juice storage at the lower temperature was appropriate for consumption after a 2-month shelf life, still as a vitamin C source and without any haze.

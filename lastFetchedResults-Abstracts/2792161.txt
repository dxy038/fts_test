Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the preliminary version of a fourth generation (4G) mobile communication system. Its aim is to support different services with high data rates and strict Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements of users. The main aim of this study is to present a prediction model based on Random Neural Networks (RNNs) for objective, non-intrusive prediction of video quality over LTE for video applications. A three layer feed-forward RNN model with gradient descent training algorithm has been developed. This model uses a combination of objective parameters in the application and network layers, such as Content Type (CT), Sender Bit Rate (SBR), resolution size, Frame Rate (FR), codec, and packet loss rate (PLR). The video quality was predicted in terms of the Mean Opinion Score (MOS). The results show an approximate 50% increase in accuracy using this model, compared to previous models. LTE-Sim software has been used to generate different samples for testing and training RNN model.

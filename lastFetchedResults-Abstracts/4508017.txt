An iterative approach is proposed for the design of two-channel QMF banks with low reconstruction delays. The perfect reconstruction condition is formed in the time-domain and the design efficiency is significantly improved by formulating a quadratic objective function in each step of an iterative process whose minimum point can be obtained in closed form. The proposed method is demonstrated by a design example

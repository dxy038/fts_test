Objective (s): During recent years fertility rate is decreasing in Iran. This study aimed to assess fertility desire and its correlates in Tehran, Iran. 
Methods: This was population-based study. A sample of married individuals living in all 22 districts in Tehran recruited and were asked whether they intend to have a child at present. Participants were interviewed via a structured questionnaire including items on socio-demographic and reproductive information. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between fertility desire and independent variables.
Results: In all 1200 individuals (600 male and 600 female) were interviewed. The mean age of participants was 33.6 (SD = 7.31) years. Overall 36.8% of respondents indicated that they wish to have a child while the remaining 68.2 said that they did not. The results obtained from logistic regression analysis showed that infertility disinterest was associated with marriage duration (OR = 0.91, P = 0.0001, male gender (OR = 1.45, P = 0.02), number of children at present (OR = 2.9, P = 0.0001), poor income (OR = 2.77, P = 0.0001). Other independent variables also showed association in the expected direction, but the associations were not significant.
Conclusion: These preliminary findings could shed some light on the topic. It seems there is need to conduct a national survey to have a better insight on fertility desire among Iranians.

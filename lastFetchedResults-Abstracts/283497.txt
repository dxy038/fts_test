The objective of the present study was to examine personality differences among professional orchestra instrumental groups and possible differences in their working conditions. The sample consisted of 122 members of six top-level professional orchestras in Germany. The musicians were asked to complete questionnaires measuring various personality traits and work variables. The three instrumental groups: strings, woodwinds, and brass players evinced less difference in their personality traits than the stereotyped view of them suggests. Apart from the finding that the string players were more conscientious than the other musicians, none of the results from other publications conducted with pupil or student musicians could be replicated. However, some other differences in personality traits and working conditions were found between the instrumental groups. It is assumed that top level professional orchestra musicians are characterized by personality traits that are more homogeneous than those of pupil or student orchestra musicians.

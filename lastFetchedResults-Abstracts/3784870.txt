The basic equations for synthesizing a double-cage rotor slot have been derived and the procedure suitable for programming on a digital computer has been discussed. To summarize, the steps in the procedure are as follows: 1. Select a satisfactory single-cage design of the same horsepower rating and speed as the double-cage rating to be designed. 2. Establish the desired objectives for locked-rotor torque and breakdown torque. 3. Select a winding which will give 15% higher flux than the starting point singlecage motor and make a complete performance calculation on this design. 4. From the results of the single-cage calculation values for r1, x1, rm, xm, x34, and rer can be closely estimated. 5. Calculate the value of r4 required to give the desired full-load slip. 6. Calculate x4&#194;&#191; using equations 1 and 6 and the breakdown torque objective. 7. Calculate r3 using equation 11 and the locked-rotor torque objective. 8. Design the double-cage slot to provide the desired values of r3, r4, and x4&#194;&#191;. 9. Make a complete performance calculation on the resulting double-cage design. If the results are not sufficiently close to the desired objectives and if positive, real numbers were obtained in the solutions for x4&#194;&#191; and r3 in steps 6 and 7, then a more accurate estimate of the 6 parameters r1, x1, rm, xm, x34, and rer is required. Use the newly calculated values of these in place of the ones estimated from the single-cage calculation and repeat steps 5 through 8.

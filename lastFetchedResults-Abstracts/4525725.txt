The rectangular pieces layout optimization is a typical combinatorial optimization problem. This optimal problem is represented by the AND/OR tree and then its optimal objective becomes to find the binary tree, whose utilization rate of the area is maximum. The Max-Min Ant System can effectively implement to search this kind of tree, and then the optimal solution of the rectangular pieces layout optimization will be obtained.

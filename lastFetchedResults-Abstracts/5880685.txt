At the beginning of the new millennium we continue to witness in the modern information technology industry two fundamental trends: ongoing Internet revolution and global consolidation. IT departments of all kinds have their resources free to deal with the consequences of these phenomena. Integration of data and services is rapidly becoming their number one task. Information stored in different types of providers distributed throughout the enterprise network must be integrated, and used to build new kinds of e-commerce applications, information portals, and other types of applications leveraging the power of distributed computing. We recognized these trends and developed Jasmine ii, a new information management infrastructure to build, deploy, and manage such distributed applications capable of bringing together data from distributed and heterogeneous sources of information. The infrastructure is designed to be scalable and transparent with regards to concurrency, replication, access, and location. We describe how we achieve such design objective by illustrating the key components of the infrastructure: object cache manager, event manager, and transaction manager. We also explain some novel features of each component

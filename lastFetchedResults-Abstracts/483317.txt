The aim of the present study is to investigate the existence of probable relationship between the popular music consumption and aggressive, antiÂ­social behaviors. we took the fact of the existence of some kind of anti-social aggression amongst the students interested in popular music, as the basis for the this study. The instrument used to collect data for this project was a self-report questionnaire, not objective observation. The questionnaires were distributed to 410 students of the University of Isfahan .The interpretation of survey results indicates the existence of an actual and meaningful relationship between the use of popular music and aggressive behaviors. Survey results indicate negative feedback about the popular music consumption from the post-Revolutionary era (referring to 1978 Revolution in Iran), and reveal positive response with regard to the use of popular music from the post-Revolutionary era. Another interesting result uncovers that the most aggressive students are amongst the audience for the Western genres of popular music (rap, rock, heavy metal). As a result and considering the musicological features of the "popular music" ,as well as the socio-psychological characteristics of the youth, one may conclude that all types and genres of popular music from the post-Revolutionary era, seem to be more appropriate to the young population of nowadays Iran.

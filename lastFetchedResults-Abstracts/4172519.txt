This study addresses the problem of joint blind timing and carrier synchronisation in a (distributed-<i>M</i>)&#215;<i>N</i> antenna system where the objective is to estimate the <i>M</i> carrier offsets, the <i>M</i> timing offsets and to recover the transmitted symbols for each of the <i>M</i> users given only the measured signal at the <i>N</i> antennas of the receiver. The authors propose a modular receiver structure that exploits blind source separation to reduce the problem into more tractable sub-problems of estimating individual timing and carrier offsets for multiple users. This leads to a robust solution of low complexity. The authors investigate the performance of the estimators analytically using modified Cramer-Rao bounds and computer simulations. The results show that the proposed receiver exhibits robust performance over a wide range of parameter values, even with worst-case Doppler of 200-300-Hz and frame size as small as 400 symbols. This work is relevant to future wireless networks and is a complete solution to the problem of estimating multiple timing and carrier offsets in distributed multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communication systems.

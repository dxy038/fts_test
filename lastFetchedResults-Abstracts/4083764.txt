This Letter analyzes the outage performance of a multiuser bidirectional cooperative cellular network in which one base station (BS) and one out of N mobile stations (MSs) exchange messages with the aid of one amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. Our analysis allows for a practical fading scenario where the MS-relay and the BS-relay channels undergo independent Rayleigh and Rician fading, respectively. In this case, a tight closed-form lower bound for the outage probability of the considered system is derived. Furthermore, asymptotic analysis is performed to characterize the outage behavior in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Interestingly, in high SNR regime, it is analytically shown that when the number of MS is greater than one, the outage performance is dominated by the BS-relay link regardless of the number of MS and of the fading severity pertaining to MS-relay links. Finally, simulation results are presented in order to corroborate the theoretical analysis.

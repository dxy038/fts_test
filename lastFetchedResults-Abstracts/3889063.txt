The theory and implementation of a module generator for CMOS buffers are presented. The generator is written in the C language, and outputs optimal buffer designs in respect to a preselected objective function and layout. The user has the choice of minimizing delay, power, and area, or a combination of these, plus the choice of layout configuration. The research concentrates mainly on theoretical analysis, where variations of process, design, and layout parameters with respect to each objective function are studied in detail

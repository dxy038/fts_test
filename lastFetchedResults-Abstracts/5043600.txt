A new objective non-reference quality metric for the performance of pixel level image fusion is proposed in this paper. The novel metric employs a luminance model that is widely used in visual psychophysics and a new contrast model which correlates better with human visual sensitivity to calculate the similarity between fused image and the sources. Experiments show that the metric is effective and compliant with subjective evaluations compared with other metrics.

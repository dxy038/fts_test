A hub port logistics deals with thousands of daily transfers thanks to a multimodal transport. A crucial challenge in this domain is to avoid delays in the global supply chain and to ensure deliveries on time by optimising container management. This involves engines operating planning, resources management and container storage optimisation. This paper addresses this challenge, in which a multiagent approach aiming to modelise and to simulate container management is presented. The proposed model is based-on an individual-centred approach and has as objective to enable engines to meet container demands while ensuring their satisfactions. First experimentations of a multiagent simulator measuring container satisfactions are presented. Results about the effectiveness of the multiagent approach in container management and handling are then discussed.

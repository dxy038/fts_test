The core of civilized life is identified as the village in the history of man.
With all the advances made in urbanization, the rural area has not lost its
essence in the practical behavior of a cultureâ€™s socioeconomic life. However,
with the increasing threats whether natural or manmade, the susceptibility of
rural area is the same as urban area and the same efforts regarding the
sustainability of urban area must be taken for the rural area on national bases.

monitored: sustainability of the natural resources, social sustainability,
political sustainability and economic sustainability. In fact sustainable
development of the country/village is not justified through its environmental
wellbeing, but through the total of the above mentioned factors. In this

Biodiesel is an alternative to petroleum diesel fuel. It is a renewable, a biodegradable, and also a non-toxic fuel. The general interest to produce biodiesel from Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) seeds oil has increased but its ability to grow on drought-prone areas has barely been investigated. The objective of this work was to identify some physiological processes that allow the Jatropha to produce in severe arid conditions by studying its leaf gas exchange and antioxidant systems under drought stress and recovering. It measured the activity of antioxidant enzymes involved in the scavenge of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutamine synthetase (GS), as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content. It was also analyzed the chlorophyll (CHL), carotenoids, amino acids and soluble proteins contents. Net photosynthesis (A) and stomata conductance (gs) decreased associate with drought stress and dropped to zero in soil water beneath 5%. Drought induced decrease in stomatal and non-stomatal photosynthetic activity. The activities of SOD, CAT, APX and GS and MDA content in leaves were significantly higher in the water-stressed plants compared to well-watered plants and decreased when the plants were rewatered. These observations suggest that oxidative stress resulting from drought deficit in Jatropha could result in the production of antioxidative enzymes to counteract the oxidative damage, and the enzymes may contribute to its ability to survive in the adverse arid environment.

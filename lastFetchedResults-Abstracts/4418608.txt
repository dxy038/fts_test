In this paper we present a full and effective system allowing the deployment of N semi-autonomous robots in order to cover a given area for video surveillance and search purposes. The coverage problem is solved through a new technique based on the exploitation of Voronoi tessellations. To supervise a given area, a set of viewpoints are extracted, then visited by a group of mobile rover. Robots paths are calculated by resorting a salesman problem through Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms. In the running phase, robots deal with both motion and sensors uncertainties while performing the pre-established paths. Results of indoor scenario are given.

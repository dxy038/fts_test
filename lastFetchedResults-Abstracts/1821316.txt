Objective
m of this in situ study was to compare the remineralization potential of pastes containing CPP–ACP and CPP–ACP with 900 ppm fluoride on human enamel softened by a cola drink.

five enamel specimens obtained from human third molar teeth were eroded in a cola drink for 8 min and then attached to intra-oral devices worn by five volunteers. The specimens were subjected to three different in situ remineralization protocols using: (1) CPP–ACP (Group I), (2) CPP–ACP with 900 ppm fluoride (Group II), and (3) saliva (Group III, control). Vickers microhardness measurements were obtained at baseline followed by demineralization and remineralization stages.
s
P–ACP, CPP–ACP with 900 ppm fluoride and saliva controls resulted in 46.24%, 64.25% and 2.98% increase in post-erosion microhardness values, respectively. One-way ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences in the mean microhardness values between pastes containing CPP–ACP and CPP–ACP with 900 ppm fluoride.
sions
PP–ACP and CPP–ACP with 900 ppm fluoride substantially remineralized the softened enamel, with the CPP–ACP and fluoride combination showing higher remineralization potential than CPP–ACP. This study confirmed the synergistic effect of fluoride with CPP–ACP on remineralization of eroded enamel.

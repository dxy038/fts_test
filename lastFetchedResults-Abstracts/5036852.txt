This paper presents a bidirectional power conditioner based on a solar photovoltaic panel and storage battery bank. The power processing system implementation incorporating a multi-functional control strategy introduced as switching mode schemes between stand-alone and utility-interactive operations is also discussed. Furthermore, experimental results tested through a 3 kVA prototype power conditioner using PV power systems and their effectivenesses are illustrated and evaluated in experiments

Objective: Diabetes plays an important role in the progression of tissue damage. Influencing factors of the cellular matrix can lead to changes in the structure and function of tissues or their failure. Herbal consumption can be effective in reducing tissue failure. The aim of the this study is to research the effect Portulaca oleracea seeds on the levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2, 9 and tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods: This semi-empirical study included 15 women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the experimental and control groups. Participants' mean age was 45 years. Portulaca oleracea seeds at a total dose of 7.5 g per day (2.5 mg with lunch and 5 mg with dinner) were consumed for eight weeks. Blood sampling was carried out before and after the eight-week period. Participants fasted for 12 hours prior to blood sampling. The t-test was used to analyze study results. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: After eight weeks, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2, 9 significantly reduced in the experimental group (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between groups. Tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 levels increased significantly in the experimental group. There was also a significant difference between the experimental and control groups (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The results have shown that Portulaca oleracea seed did not adequately improve matrix metalloproteinases in diabetic patients. Thus, more research is needed to derive accurate conclusions.

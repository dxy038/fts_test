This study introduces a new green method synthesis of silver nanoparticles on the cotton fabric surface through using Tollensâ€™ reagent. In this approach, silver nitrate (AgNO3) was transformed to Ag2O followed by an aqueous solution with ammonia; subsequently, silver nanoparticles were synthesized on the cotton fabric directly. The main objective of this research was to successfully employ the reducing and stabilizing features of cellulose to synthesize nano silver. Accordingly, the antibacterial efficiency was evaluated against two common pathogenic bacteria: S. aureus and E. coli. Additionally, the color variation on the cotton fabric and durability of the antibacterial properties on the fabric were assessed and reported. The Raman spectra, CHN elemental analysis, SEM images, XRD patterns, and EDS spectrum were employed to characterize the treated cotton fabrics. The treated fabrics demonstrated an excellent antibacterial activity against the mentioned bacteria. A slight decrease in the antibacterial feature of the cotton fabrics was observed after successive washings. However, an efficient antibacterial activity remained on the fabrics.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of combination of impact modifier on the mechanical properties and morphology of cellulose fiber polypropylene (PP) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) composites. The impact modifier were ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) for PP and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) for HDPE and fibers were of alpha cellulose and wastepaper. The elastomer (modifier) was mixed with composite at 5, 7.5 and 10% by weight and the fillers were mixed with PP at 35% and HDPE at 30% by weight. The results have indicated that the notched impact strength, elongation-at-break and bending strains have increased with the inclusion of elastomer, but the tensile strength, bending strength and modulus of elasticity have decreased. The impact modifier, however, did not affect the hardness. The fibers enhanced the tensile strength, bending strength, hardness and modulus of elasticity but decreases were noticed for the impact strength, tensile and bending strains. In fact the highest impact strength was obtained by adding 10% elastomer to the composites, and the highest value for tensile strength, bending strength, hardness and modulus of elasticity were attributed to the absence of elastomer ( except the pure polymer).

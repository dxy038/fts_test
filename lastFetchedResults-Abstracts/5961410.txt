This paper presents an effective power quality monitor (PQM) placement method for voltage sag assessment by utilizing quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization technique. The optimization handles the observability constraints based on the topological monitor reach area concept and solves a multi-objective function in obtaining the optimal number and placement of PQMs in power systems. The objective function consists of two functions which are based on monitor overlapping index and sag severity index. In this study, the optimization performance of the proposed technique is compared to that of the standard binary particle swarm optimization and the existing method using genetic algorithm. All the optimization algorithms have been implemented and tested on the IEEE 69-bus and the 118-bus test systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the techniques.

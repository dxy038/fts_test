Islands represent a unique challenge in terms of energy supply. A great deal of work has been carried out in this specific aspect of energy supply on different islands in the world. Unfortunately due to island specific energy use profile, resources and different kind of environmental conditions, study of one island cannot be easily applied to other islands. The Lakshadweep group of islands in Arabian Sea is one of the two major groups of Islands in India having Diesel generators as the main source of electricity. Considering the remoteness of the Island and polluting nature of existing Diesel generators, it is desirable to adopt a strategy to utilize available potential of non-polluting renewable energy sources for these ecologically sensitive Islands. A multi objective optimization methodology is applied on the Kavaratti Island of Lakshadweep Islands group, where various renewable energy sources exists and could be exploited to satisfy electrical energy need along with environmental pollution mitigation. Specific mathematical model is developed with two objective functions that work reversibly. Application of specific mathematical tools will lead to a set of energy solutions called pareto set, which satisfy the multiplicity of criteria, namely environmental pollution, Energy demand, cost and resource constraints.

Sensor scheduling problem in infrared LEO constellation by bearing-only location is studied to ensure its continuous tracking and parallel processing multitask. Firstly, the problem is defined in detail, and a mathematical model is presented. Secondly, an adaptive multitask programming on probabilistic selection algorithm(AMPPSA) is proposed, which utilizes trend catching, random selection and clone variation to keep from sub optimizing and applies heuristic rules to avoid blind searching. Finally, simulations show that the algorithm fits to sensor management of multi-objective optimization in infrared LEO constellation.

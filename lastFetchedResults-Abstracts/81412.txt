A novel methodology to non-invasively and objectively predict sensory traits and intramuscular fat content of dry-cured Iberian loins was studied. Texture analysis of magnetic resonance images was performed on 47 dry-cured Iberian loins. Appearance and texture traits were assessed by a 18-member trained panel, and intramuscular fat content was chemically extracted and quantified for the same samples. Three classes of dry-cured loin according to each sensory and chemical trait were established (low, medium and high). Using the texture features selected by the floating search method (FSM), a system accuracy of 83% for intramuscular fat content and not lower than 70% for all sensory traits was obtained. These results are encouraging for the application of this methodology, allowing in situ, automatic, objective and non-destructive classification of loins.

The object oriented data paradigm rests on the assumption that the world can be described in terms of objects (entities), and the relationships among these objects and the standard operations on these objects. The most difficult part of the paradigm is to identity the objects. Assuming that the objects have been identified, the next step is to discover the various relationships among the objects. One objective of this paper specifies three basic relationships in the context of three levels of abstraction. A simple object language description is developed that describes these levels of abstraction. These relationships serve as constraints on the system, Furthermore, these relationships also require the creation of attributes of the objects to hold these relationships. The size of the domain analysis of even a medium size problem has grown beyond the paper recording mechanism and now requires automated help to manage the object names and their relationships. Another objective outlines the development of the model of a tool that will support the code automation of the basic relationships among the objects. The paper addresses these three basic constructs: the hierarchical (is-a) construct, the aggregate construct, and the binary degree construct. Each construct appears in three format levels of abstraction. The formats are a textual format, a skeleton format and a user defined format. The paper also cites the rationale for each format

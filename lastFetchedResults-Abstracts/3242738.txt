Evaluation and validation of software architectures in cognitive science often lack objective evaluation criteria and test mechanisms. Hence, in this article we present an in-house developed use case to evaluate the cognitive architecture ARS, together with its psychoanalytically-inspired functionalities. The use case was developed by a team of psychoanalysts and comprehends humanÂ´s behavior patterns in a competitive situation. We describe the preconditions, the development, and the setting of the use case, followed by the results and screenshots to document the dataflow within the modules. Different outcomes of the use case depending on the variation of personality parameters of the ARS system play a pivotal role. Furthermore, we provide a general description of the ARS system, of the top-down development process, and of the psychoanalytic theory behind it. We give insight into functionalities of ARS like the decision making process and the association of objects. Finally, we evaluate these functionalities by implementing and simulating the developed use case.

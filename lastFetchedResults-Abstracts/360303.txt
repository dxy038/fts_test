Study objective: To determine the significance of scapular fractures in blunt-trauma patients compared with blunt-trauma patients without scapular fractures. Design: Retrospective chart review of 11,500 blunt-trauma patients with a control group matched for age, sex, and mechanism of injury. Setting: Two Level I trauma centers. Participants: Ninety-two blunt-trauma patients with scapular fractures and 81 control patients. Results:  Mortality, neurovascular injury, and injury severity scores were compared for blunt-trauma patients with scapular fractures with those of the control group. Analysis revealed a 1% incidence of scapular fractures in blunt trauma with no neurovascular injury and no mortality. Scapular fractures were associated with thoracic injury in 49% of the patients, compared with 6% in the control group (difference, 43%; 95% confidence interval, 31.6 to 51.4; P<.001, Fisher's exact test). Conclusion:  Scapular fractures are not a significant marker of greater mortality or of neurovascular morbidity in blunt-trauma patients.

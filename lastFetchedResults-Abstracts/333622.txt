Objective: To indicate the use of 3D electron beam computerized tomography angiography (EBCTA) for renal artery lesions, vascular variants that are crucial to detect before surgery, especially partial nephrectomy and extension of the intravascular tumor. Methods: Forty patients (30 men, 10 women, age range 13â€“82, mean age 54.2) underwent EBCT (GE-Imatron, C 150 ultrafast CT scanner) of the renal arteries. It is essential to review the axial images for all necessary information before the 3D technique is performed. Results: Maximum intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendering (VR) images were excellent in demonstrating stenosis of the renal arteries. Accessory and main renal arteries were easily depicted, and stenosis has been shown. In our study, among 40 renal angiography patients, 21 had stenosis of the renal arteries with different percentages. A total of 12 accessory renal arteries (five left, seven right) were detected. EBCT, with its 3D techniques, was found to be accurate and useful for renal vascular anatomy as a noninvasive test to delineate renal tumors and renal anatomy prior to nephron sparing surgery because it is known to conserve normal renal parenchyma adjacent to tumor. Conclusion: EBCT, with its noninvasive VR and MIP techniques, is easy to apply and is functional and accurate for neoplasms, renal vascular anatomy and renal artery stenosis.

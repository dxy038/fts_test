Objective
The aim of this study was to determine if protein metabolism was altered in small and large intestines by feeding pectin, a soluble fiber known to stimulate cecal production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and to have a trophic effect in these tissues.
Methods

Twenty-four weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed ad libitum for 14 d with a balanced control diet or an isoproteic, isocaloric pectin (citrus) diet (80 g/kg). SCFA production, intestinal histomorphometry, and protein synthesis were determined in the proximal and distal parts of the small intestine, the cecum, and the colon. Protein synthesis rates were determined by measuring the 13C valine incorporation rate in tissue proteins.
Results

Pectin feeding slightly decreased food intake and growth rate. It increased the acetate, propionate, and butyrate pools in the cecum. Pectin feeding resulted in heavier intestinal tissues corresponding to higher villus height in the small intestine and crypt depth in the small and large intestines compared with feeding of the control diet. Compared with the control group, the rats fed the pectin diet had significantly higher protein synthesis rates in all the parts of their intestines.
Conclusion

Supplementation of pectin, as a soluble fiber, in the diets, stimulated SCFA production, had a trophic effect on the different parts of the intestines, and greatly stimulated protein synthesis in those tissues.

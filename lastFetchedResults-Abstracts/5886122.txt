The non-uniformities of series connected Lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicle severely decrease the storage capacity and cycle life time of the batteries, so it is very important to research on battery equalization and management system. This paper reviews the disadvantages of previous equalization systems, and then presents a bidirectional equalization and management system applied on EV. Furthermore, two classes of control strategies for the system are analyzed. The proposed control strategies are adopted by the system, and ensure safe operation of lithium-ion batteries and enhancing battery life circle.

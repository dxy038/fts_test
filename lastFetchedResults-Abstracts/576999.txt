Background and Objective: Caesarean sections are the most common surgery in obstetrics and gynecology. However, like any other surgical procedures, they have some disadvantages. Nowadays, unfortunately, Caesarean sections are not carried out necessarily to save the mother and/or the baby, and due to excessive applications they have become a problem worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the related causes of Cesarean delivery in Zanjan.
Material and Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, a total of 697 mothers were selected through random sampling. A questionnaire was completed by each participant and the collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods, including chi-square test, Fisher exact, ANOVA, and multivariate logistic analysis.
Results: According to our analysis, the recent rate of the Cesarean in Zanjan was about 43%, out of which 43% were elective. The majority of the cases (57.8%), were repeated Cesarean sections and most mothers chose Cesarean because of either fear of pain or for termination of the pregnancy (43.3%). In the present study, the Cesarean section rate correlated significantly with the level of education in mothers (P < 0.0001) and family financial status (P=0.01).
Conclusion: According to our analysis, promoting public awareness and also efforts towards applying Cesarean sections in only necessary cases could reduce the rate of cesarean in general.

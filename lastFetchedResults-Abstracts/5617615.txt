The objective of this paper is to study the effect of high damping aluminum alloy on dynamic stability of Nipper Mechanism, in order to improve its stability of motion. Based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the partial differential equation of motion with damping was formulated. According to Floquent theory, GalerkinÂ´s method and Fourier series method were then applied to obtain the stable and instable boundaries by FORTRAN programming. The results show that the locations of instability regions considering damping are the same to those without damping, and the damping influence the width of instability regions which become narrower with damping increasing, till disappearance. Therefore, high damping aluminum alloys play an important role in the dynamic stability of Nipper Mechanism.

The Sematcch Die Level Product Assurance Team is working to build a model for how hot chuck probing and enhanced reliability technologies can be combined to produce a KGD that is equivalent to the packaged part, The model consists of hot chuck probe card availability, hot chuck probe metrology, enhanced reliability screens, production plans, and quality standards. The Sematech member companies will help drive the standards for what is referred to as &#8220;Quality 2&#8221; KGD. The Quality 2 KGD will have the same quality and reliability as a packaged part, but different process tactics will be utilized to achieve the same product quality level. The objective of this paper is to acquaint the members of the MCM community with the activities of the Sematech team and update the conference of the project status. The teamÂ´s roadmap is also discussed

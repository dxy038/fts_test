Models play key roles in analyzing and studying complex systems in the objective world. The most important relations between a real system and its model are abstraction and mapping, which make up the basis of modeling process. In practice, it is advantageous and sometime essential to formalize and canonize systems models, because the normalized models are easy to use and analyze theoretically. This paper describes some abstraction and formalization ideas for modeling complex systems

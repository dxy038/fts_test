A novel VLSI architecture, PA<sup>3</sup>(Programmable Array of Array Adders) is introduced in depth in [1,2]. The concept of PA<sup>3</sup>architecture is a major attempt towards the realization of an efficient and effective universal mask/field programmable VLSI macrocell structure for special-purpose, as well as general purpose, system implementations. This leads to several advantages over the conventional VLSI architectures. An integrated database system describing the logic model and circuit model (macro) of the-PA<sup>3</sup>macrocell, with regard to layout model, is presented in [1]. The objective of this paper is to discuss the programming techniques-for PA<sup>3</sup>arrays to realize functional systems. Programming the PA<sup>3</sup>arrays is achieved by direct mapping of Boolean expressions, describing the functional systems to be implemented using these expandable arrays. This mapping can be performed either manually (resulting in better chip area usage) or through a PA<sup>3</sup>compiler.

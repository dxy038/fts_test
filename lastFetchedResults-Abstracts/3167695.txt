THz technology, after having been for long a niche for space based science, promises to be a gold mine for Telecomunications and Security scenarios. These application domains are facing potentially explosive progresses with the full THz regime being essentially the only untapped source of spectral bandwidth (BW) still available. The advances are now possible mostly thanks to the availability of nano-fabrication capabilities which allow miniaturized scale components and that can be potentially arrayed by the millions just like happened for digital cameras (in the visible regimes) in the last 10 years. However the realization of truly large Imaging cameras in the THz regime, that exploit the BW itself, only unused THz resource is far from easy. This contribution describes a research strategy aimed at realizing for the first time broad band imaging cameras. This objective is the core of a long term cooperation between the author, representing the chair of Applied Electromagnetism at TU Delft, together with a number of collaborating Institutions, specififcally, SRON, TNO, Universitad Complutense de Madrid and University of Florence.

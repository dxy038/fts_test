The incorporation of wind power generation is growing steadily, a fact that is making the utilities evaluate the various influencing aspects of wind power generation onto power systems. On the other hand, the breakthrough of new technologies in the field of electric energy storage makes possible its incorporation into power systems. The characteristics of these energy storages offer a great potential in the improvement of power quality in power systems. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the influence of the wind farm size on the storage capacity of the storage device. Another objective of the paper is to make a comparative analysis to determine the most suitable storage technology for mitigating problems on power quality introduced by wind power short-term fluctuations.

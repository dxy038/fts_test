Demand Response is a major component of Smart Grid. For Demand Response(DR) schemes to succeed, consumers should schedule their load. This problem is an active area of research now. Various optimization models have been proposed by researchers. There are works related to specific appliance models which are more energy consuming and models which pertains to general schedulable loads. The various DR methods provide objective function for minimization of energy cost along with satisfying the Maximum Demand limit and device operating constraints. This paper surveys the different models being developed by various researchers for Demand Response in residential power sector and the solution methods suggested for the same. It gives an overview of the current status of research in this field.

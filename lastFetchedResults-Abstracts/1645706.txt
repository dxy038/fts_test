Inroduction & Objective: Prebiotic dietary supplements that have the potential to reduce the harmful effects of infectious agents and have beneficial effects on host health. In this study, the prebiotic of yeast cell wall Saccharomyces cerevisia at different levels to evaluate the blood indices and immune indices in rainbow trout juveniles were used.
Materials and Methods: To conduct this study, 120 rainbow trout fry with a mean weight 3.61Â± 0.12 gr were randomly assigned into 12 fiberglass tub drainage volume of 100 ml distribution and breeding were given. An experiment to determine the optimum level of prebiotic effect of dietary yeast cell wall in the diet of rainbow trout fry in 1% prebiotic treatments, 1.5% prebiotic, 2% prebiotic prebiotic-free control, in a balanced design with three replications each were studied. At the end of the period rearing, blood indices and immune indices  juveniles were studied.
Results: The results of some blood indices such as levels of White blood cells, Red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and neutrophil counts were not significantly different between the treatment and control groups were observed in 2% and other treatments (P < 0.05).The factors mean corpuscular volume and the other blood factors statistically significant difference was not observed between the treatments (P > 0.05). The results showed that non-specific immune indices in blood, such as lysozyme and specific immune IgM and Ig statistically significant difference between treatment groups fed with 2 % prebiotic yeast cell wall with the other treatments and the control group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Based on these results it can be stated that the level of 2% prebiotic yeast cell wall used in the diet caused a significant increase in immune indices , and some blood parameters of studied, An important role in immune function and improve blood indices of rainbow trout fry can play

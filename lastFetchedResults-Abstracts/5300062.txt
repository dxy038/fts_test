In the current research we consider the scenario of post disaster rescue operations using multiple robots inside damaged buildings where the damage is not very extreme. The objective the of the work is to develop systems to support efficient rescue missions involving creation and exchange of environment maps enriched with information important to rescue operations, among multiple robots and rescue workers. In current days many research institutes are developing robots with widely different types and capabilities to support rescue operations. In rescue missions involving multiple robots it is essential to have sharable map information for efficient search and navigation irrespective of the differences in the structures and capabilities of the participating robots. In this paper we address the above issue by proposing a map description which combines the geographical data as well as the information about robot behaviors called &#194;&#191;behavioral trace map&#194;&#191;. We describe the algorithm for generation of such maps and we present experimental results using rescue robots developed in our laboratory.

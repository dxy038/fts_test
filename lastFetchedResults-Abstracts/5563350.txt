Energy efficiency has drawn considerable attention in booming economy. Despite energy conservation has received much attention in industry, energy minimization has not been sufficiently studied in robotics society. This paper extends a previous report of our study on optimal motion planning of a mobile robot with the objective of minimum energy consumption [1]. The new contribution of this paper lies in the improvement of the energy consumption model. The modeling parameters are further identified in an example of Pioneer 3DX mobile robot. Experiments are finally performed to demonstrate the validity of using this energy model in the optimal motion planning [1] for energy saving.

A multi-microprocessor-based structure for controlling the manipulator motion in Cartesian space is presented. The objective is to investigate the feasibility of implementing hand-based control laws using present day microprocessors. computational complexity analysis indicates that the control schemes involving full inverse-kinematics and inverse-dynamics computations can be realised using the proposed control structure.

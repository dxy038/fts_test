A Multi-objective optimization procedure has been developed to determine some kinetic parameters of free radical polymerization of vinyl acetate based on genetic algorithm. For this purpose, mathematical modeling of free radical polymerization of vinyl acetate is carried out first and then selected kinetic parameters are optimized by minimizing objective functions defined from comparing experimental data and mathematical modeling outcomes. A ranking procedure is applied to classification of solutions, and a Pareto optimal set filter is used to preserve the non-dominated solutions on the basis of Pareto optimality definition. Results show by this optimization technique, kinetic parameters are calculated in reasonable time and computational costs near the global optimum without scalarization of objective functions into a single objective function.

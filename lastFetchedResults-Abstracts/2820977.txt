One of the most important key components of intelligent power grids is the distributed energy storage. On the other hand the electrification of person transport vehicle seems to be a inevitable trend. Thus an attractive way to store the energy of the grid is to use the onboard battery of these electric vehicles by connecting them to the grid &#8220;Vehicle to Grid (V2G)&#8221;. The conventional way to do this is to use a wired (cable connection). This is not an effective way since the driver connects his car mostly to charge and not to serve as a storage medium. An alternative is inductive power supply which permits an automated connection to the grid without interaction of the driver and meets the efficiency requirement of more than 90%. Combined with a PV-Module the bidirectional connection of an EV gets more attractive, when realized with an inductive wireless energy transfer system, since the automatic connection to the grid happens more often and regular than with a cable connection. This solution contributes to a reduction of critical states of the supply grid and the number of conventional &#8220;Must-Run-Units&#8221; and thus to a better integration in the energy economical system.

The Federal regulation on Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals became effective in 1992. The objective of the regulation was to prevent the accidental release of any of the highly hazardous chemicals listed in the appendix of the regulation and to minimize the consequences of any such release. The regulation came about as the result of a marked increase in process incidents which occurred in manufacturing facilities in the United States and abroad that resulted in lives being lost and large economic expenses. The standard lists approximately 140 specific toxic or flammable chemicals and a broad category range of flammable hydrocarbons and their threshold amounts. Any facility that uses or stores the listed chemicals in excess of the threshold quantity, and there is a possibility of releasing the threshold amount, is required to comply with the requirements of the standard. Process safety differs from worker safety in that the main focus is on the process equipment and conditions that could result in a failure and release of some highly hazardous chemical. The Process Safety regulation is a management system that requires extensive documentation of the process design, maintenance practices, training, system changes, operational procedures, etc., all of which must be continually updated and communicated to all who would be affected. The elements of the safety management system that was developed consists of fourteen parts which are discussed by the author.

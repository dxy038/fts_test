Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has become a basic, reliable and sensitive modern technique, in both biological research and clinical diagnosis, for investigation of gene expression and validation of cDNA microarray analysis. Accurate mRNA quantification using quantitative RT-PCR commonly requires data normalization through stable housekeeping genes (HKGs). Selection of HKGs for data normalization is critical for accurate mRNA quantification. Our objective was to evaluate a set of candidate HKGs as internal controls for gene expression studies using quantitative RT-PCR in equine tissues and cell culture. One-step quantitative RT-PCR for 6 HKGs was performed using total RNA from equine tissue samples and cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The stability of HKGs was mainly evaluated by analysis of variance, analyses of the standard deviation and coefficient of variation of Ct, and change of Ct of HKGs between control and treated samples. 18S rRNA consistently showed the smallest standard deviation and coefficient of variation, and the least change of Ct between control and treated samples, thus was identified as the most stable HKG for mRNA data normalization in quantitative RT-PCR for studying gene expression in equine tissues and cultured PBMCs.

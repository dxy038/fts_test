Aiming at dispatching the load among the units of hydropower plant, economical operation of hydropower plant (EOHP) should consider the stochastic aspect of water resources systems and electricity network. As a stochastic optimization procedure, evolutionary programming (EP) is proved to be useful in optimizing difficult functions. Prior to deterministic optimization methods, a self-adaptive mutation evolutionary programming (SEP) based method for EOHP is proposed, and a mathematical model is developed. In this model, the fitness function is constructed by including the constraints in the objective function as penalty terms. Comparison with traditional EP method, the example shows the effectiveness of SEP one.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii is a gram-negative non-fermentative coccobacilli with increasing relevance in a variety of hospital-acquired infections. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of bla-OXA-2 and bla-OXA-10 resistance genes and class I Integron among Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from patients referred to Imam Reza hospital of Tabriz city, Iran.
METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on 100 Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from patients referred to Imam Reza hospital of Tabriz, Iran in 2009-2010. The isolates were identified using standard biochemical and microbiological tests. ESBL production was determined in isolates by Combined Disc test. The presence of bla-OXA-10, bla-OXA-2 and INT-1 genes in clinical isolates was investigated by PCR technique. 
FINDINGS: The results of antimicrobial sensitivity tests revealed that the highest resistance was against cefixime (100%), ceftizoxime (100%) and ticaracilin (100%), whereas the highest susceptibility was observed for polymyxin B (84%), colistin (77%) and rifampin (73%). Combined Disc Test showed that 60% of isolated were ESBL producer among them 7 cases (11.6%) were positive for bla-OXA-2 and 5 cases (8.3%) for bla-OXA-10 genes. Screening for INT-1 genes demonstrated that 73% of isolates were positive for Int-1 insertion sequence.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed the presence of OXA-2 and OXA-10 type ESBLs and class I integron genes among drug resistant Acinetobacter strains that reminding the necessity of preventive measures for inhibiting dissemination of these resistant isolates.

European energy policy strives towards an affordable, sustainable and secure energy supply. These three goals put strong demands on the entire value chain. The paper investigates how transmission grid planning, as the central element in this value chain, is influenced by these objectives. Especially it tries to examine how these objectives interact. It provides a first answer to the question whether the objectives are rivals or friends. To this extent a linear optimization model is set up. It combines an optimal power flow and optimal line capacities for the three policy goals and the combined multi-objective problem.

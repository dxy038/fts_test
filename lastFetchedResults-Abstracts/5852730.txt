A novel 1 &#215; 4 planar UWB antenna array is proposed. The utilized single element is a compact planar circular slot micro-strip antenna. The feeding network is 1 to 4 Wilkinson power divider. The bandwidth of the antenna array is from 3.1GHz to 12.4GHz and the radiation pattern is bidirectional.

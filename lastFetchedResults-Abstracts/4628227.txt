Based on the concept of reservoir ecological operation, the domestic and foreign research advance of reservoir ecological operation is reviewed. Aiming at the main existent problems in this field, the future development trend of reservoir ecological operation research is put forward. It is suggested that the further study of reservoir ecological operation should be emphasized on aspects of the theoretical framework system, quantitative objectives of ecological operation, multi-objective optimization and simulation technology, effect evaluation of operation schemes and the management system of reservoir ecological operation. It provides the reference for carrying out multi-objective ecological operation of reservoirs in the future.

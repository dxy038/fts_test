This paper presents a stochastic model for optimal generating unitspsila restoration planning. Restoration plans will be performed based on different objectives i.e. total system risk, total served energy in the period of restoration, and total restoration time. The proposed model is a multi objective stochastic program in which generating unitspsila restoration plan is assumed to optimize different kinds of objective function. The proposed approach to the optimal restoration of generating units can be used by vertically integrated utilities as well as the ISOs in electricity markets. The approach coordinates the optimal start up of generating units within the restoration period. Physical constraints of generating units and power system restoration constraints are taken into account. The proposed approach highlights a trade-off between different objectives of power system restoration. A simple system is used for detailed analyses and simulation results exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed restoration approach.

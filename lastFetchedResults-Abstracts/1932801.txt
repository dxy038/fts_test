Currently, there are few inexpensive, reliable, effective methods for commercially separating X- and Y-chromosome bearing fresh and frozen bovine sperm. The objective of these experiments was to determine the efficacy of a commercially available post-thaw bovine semen sexing kit, HeiferPlus™ (HP) which claims to alter the sex ratio in favor of female calves following artificial insemination. Three trials included the insemination of hyperstimulated cows with Control or HP-treated semen, non-surgical embryo collection on Day 7, and a combined PCR/dot blot assay to determine embryo sex. Chi-square analysis showed that the Control group produced a greater proportion (p &lt; 0.0005) of female embryos than the HP group. There were no differences in the proportions of transferable compared with degenerate embryos or in number of ovulations, embryos, and unfertilized ova collected from Control compared with HP groups. When treatments were combined, one of the two bulls used in the hyperstimulation studies produced an overall greater proportion of females (p &lt; 0.05), suggesting a bull effect.

r trial involved the insemination of cows synchronized via OvSynch® with fetal sexing via ultrasonography. Results of these studies indicated that HP semen sexing kit did not alter the sex ratio in favor of females in either hyperstimulated or single-ovulating cows; however, potential bull effects may be further evaluated to understand the capacity of HP with semen from specific bulls. Additionally, perhaps the sex of the surviving embryo can be manipulated by the maternal side, through ovarian, hormonal, oviductal, or uterine influences.

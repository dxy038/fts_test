A nonblocking four-port bidirectional multiwavelength message router for use in photonic network-on-chip (NoC) architectures implementing two-dimensional mesh or torus topologies is fully characterized with bit-error-rate measurements and eye diagrams using three wavelength-parallel 10-Gb/s channels. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using this advanced switching subsystem within dynamically routed multiwavelength photonic NoCs.

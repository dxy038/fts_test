Introduction & Objective: This research was performed in cooperation with hatchery rainbow tout larvae “research center of Persian drug shafagh” located in kharf village of  Somesara town. Growth is one of the most complex phenomena effected by the quantity and quality of food ingredients. In order to reduce the risk of these diseases, level of resistance to infections should be increased by stimulating the body immunity by improving food quality including vitamins. Since abnormal levels of vitamin D are a random factor of many diseases, the Purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between growth factors and immune system of Baby rainbow trout treated with vitamin D. 
Materials and Methods. This test was carried out with 120 fish with an average weight of 3 gr with 10 densities in 12 fiberglass tanks .This experiment was done in 3 dietary treatments with 3 replicates and 1 control group at concentration of 3000, 4000, 5000 international units of vitamin D3. Every other week, growth indices were measured and at the end the rate of white blood cells, blood vitamin D3 and total were also measured. 
Results: At the end of experiment, this study showed that all growth factors were more in treatments with 4000 and 5000 than  other treatments and a significant difference was observed (P < 0.05). Also, levels of blood vitamin D and Total immunoglobulin were statistically significantly different with other treatments at the end of experiment (P < 0.05).Based on the finding   it can be concluded that optimal growth was parallel with increased immune system.
Key words: Oncorhynchusmykiss, Vitamin D, Growth factor, Immune system.

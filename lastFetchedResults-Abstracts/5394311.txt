The cellular networks have experienced impressive growth in recent years, and with the inevitable convergence of wireless network and the Internet, bandwidth resources may not match the workload and workloads may vary significantly over time and space. Due to the intrinsic limitation of wireless bandwidth, it is crucial to provide QoS guarantees while achieving reasonable bandwidth utilization. Moreover, achieving fairness among multi-classes of service is also an important issue. Our objective here is to accommodate maximum number of users and achieve fair bandwidth allocation while providing acceptable QoS to each class of service. We propose a protocol that can dynamically adjust the priority of each class and determine whether new coming calls can be accepted and how much bandwidth should be assigned based on the current system state. This scheme is simple to implement and shown to be very efficient.

Abstract
Introduction: Malnutrition is the cause of many problems in orthopedic patients. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition in patients who were hospitalized for ten days.
Objective:Control the potential damage caused by malnutrition in orthopedic patients
Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in which the prevalence of malnutrition in patients admitted to the Poursina hospital during the year 2011 was determined. A researcher -made questionnaire was formulated for each patient and their features were recorded on the first day of hospitalization, then, on the same day and the tenth day of hospitalization in these patients by nutritional tests, and lymphocyte count and serum albumin levels, were evaluated as well. Upon data collection, they were entered into SPSS version 16.
Results: Of the 377 patients admitted to the orthopedic ward on the first day, 99 patients with malnutrition were recorded that reached to 81 cases on the tenth day. Malnutrition rate in open fractures increased in day 10 of hospitalization but reduced during the same period in closed fractures (P < 0,005). Most of the malnourished patients had fracture of the femur. In patients with fractures of the femur, pelvis and multiple injuries, unlike other fracture sites, an increased incidence or severity of malnutrition during 10 days hospitalization was seen.
Conclusion: Due to the negative impact of malnutrition on patient improvement and orthopedic complications, dietary control is essential in these patients.

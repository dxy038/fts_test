This paper develops a model for determining locations of capacitated facilities on a network when the model is multicommodity. It is formulated as bi-objective since the problem of locating facilities faces many conflicting criteria. The objectives which used are related to total cost and dispersion of located facilities. Since these models are categorized in NP hard model, a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm was applied to solve problem. Also for converting bi-objective model to single objective a global criterion (GC) method was applied. At the end an example of model with numerical results are shown.

In the recent years, the importance of the linear landscape structures (hedge, embankment, and belt trees) increased, due to changes in the landscape and the needs for soil and water conservation. The objective of this research is to quantify the hedgerow impact on some of the hydraulics' soil properties and use of this knowledge for a better understanding the effect of hedgerow network on soil water transfer. Bulk density, hydraulic conductivity and soil retentions curves were established for any horizon and in different distance from hedgerow at a 2m depth ditch. Bulk density and hydraulic conductivity increased with soil depth at all distances. Decreased flood risk, peak flow, and erosion are potential consequences of hedgerow presence.

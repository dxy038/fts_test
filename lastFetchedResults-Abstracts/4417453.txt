Alpha matting is an ill-posed problem, as such the user must supply dense partial labels for an acceptable solution to be reached. Unfortunately this labelling can be time consuming. In this paper we introduce the w-penalty function, which when incorporated into existing matting techniques allows users to supply extremely sparse input. The formulated objective function encourages driving matte values to 0 and 1. The experiments demonstrate the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art KNN matting algorithm. MATLAB code for our proposed method is freely available in the MatteKit package.

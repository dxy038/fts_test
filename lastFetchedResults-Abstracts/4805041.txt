Safety and operation of existing critical structures hit by natural hazards are key aspects of the resilience of a developed country, especially in highly urbanized areas. In this context, health facilities (hospitals) are required to stand under operation to frequent earthquakes and suffer limited damage. Modern seismic codes reflect such objectives and provide specific requirements to both structural and non-structural components. As a consequence, performance and safety requirements do not apply only to primary structural components, but also to electro-mechanical, medical and other equipment. In the present paper, a review of the health facilities primary vulnerability factors and of the issues related to a rational and objective assessment of performance and health state of structural and non-structural components is presented. Strategies and recommendations for a sustainable implementation of Smart Health Facilities (SHF) according to the AtoEparadigm (Accuracy, Budget compliance, Computational burden, Durability, Ease of use) on a long term basis, are discussed, taking into account the specific requirements and characteristics of the different subsystems in a hospital. Key aspects of the system implementation are also presented in the light of advanced operational modal analysis techniques for automated data reduction.

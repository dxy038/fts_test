We developed the "Integrated database for supporting inter-school activities" which is to support cooperative and collaborative learning; the database functions not only as a "registration" and "search" tool for schools looking for an eager partner to work together in a collaborative learning program, but is also designed to assist schools in "finding a subject of study" or "case example," to help their earlier stage in determinating a program to start for. In our study to develop this database system, we tried to integrate the following features; (1) to find a partner school for interactive study, based on learning subjects and themes; (2) to encourage interactive study; and (3) to cultivate a relationship between partner schools, through sessions of the studying objective. We also had teachers actually use the database to improve the usability of it. Presentation of the studies to develop the "Integrated database for supporting inter-school activities" that assists in finding a collaborative learning partner among schools, which aims to work together on certain programs and subjects.

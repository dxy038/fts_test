Waveband switching (WBS) has been proposed to reduce the complexity and size of multi-granular optical cross-connect (MG-OXC) in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. In order to effectively solve the problem of WBS with dynamic network load, it is necessary to consider balancing traffic in WBS networks. Based on a three-layer MG-OXC, we present a legible graph of port assignment and propose a new dynamic balancing traffic algorithm (DBTA) with the objective to minimize the total ports on an available route. We compare the performance of our scheme under various traffic scenarios by simulations. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in blocking probability and port saves

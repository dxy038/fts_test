This paper presents a room equalization method based on iterative simple complex smoothing of measured acoustic impulse responses. This is useful in cases of long duration impulse responses. Corresponding time reduced impulse responses are derived which conform to perceptual principles. The smoothed impulse responses are then used to design equalization filters. Results from an audio-conferencing reverberant room using objective and subjective tests show that we can improve the measured and perceived quality of audio reproduction

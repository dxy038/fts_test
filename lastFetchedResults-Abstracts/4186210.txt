This paper proposes a novel converter topology that interfaces three power ports: a source, a bidirectional storage port, and an isolated load port. The proposed converter is based on a modified version of the isolated half-bridge converter topology that utilizes three basic modes of operation within a constant-frequency switching cycle to provide two independent control variables. This allows tight control over two of the converter ports, while the third port provides the power balance in the system. The switching sequence ensures a clamping path for the energy of the leakage inductance of the transformer at all times. This energy is further utilized to achieve zero-voltage switching for all primary switches for a wide range of source and load conditions. Steady-state analysis of the proposed converter is included, together with a suggested structure for feedback control. Key experimental results are presented that validate the converter operation and confirm its ability to achieve tight independent control over two power processing paths. This topology promises significant savings in component count and losses for power-harvesting systems. The proposed topology and control is particularly relevant to battery-backed power systems sourced by solar or fuel cells.

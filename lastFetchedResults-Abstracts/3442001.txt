The principal objective of this paper was to investigate the efficiency of the enhanced version of the MDF feature extractor for signature verification. Investigations adding new feature values to MDF were performed, assessing the impact on the verification rate of the signatures, using six-fold cross validation. Two different neural classifiers were used and two methodologies for verification were applied. The experiments conducted, whereby MDF was merged with the new features, provided very encouraging results

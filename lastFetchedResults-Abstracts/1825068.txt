The microcell-mediated transfer of a normal human chromosome 3 induces replicative senescence in otherwise immortal renal cell carcinoma cells. To identify the genes involved in the chromosome 3-induced cellular mortality, we previously performed a cDNA subtraction experiment using the immortal renal cell carcinoma cells (RCC23) and the mortal counterpart with the transferred chromosome 3 (RCC23+3). We here report the cDNA cloning and characterization of one of the differentially expressed genes, which encodes KIAA1199 protein of unknown function. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed striking upregulation of KIAA1199 mRNA in mortal RCC23+3 compared with immortal RCC23. However, no significant change in KIAA1199 mRNA expression was observed during replicative aging in vitro (from early passage culture to senescent culture) of mortal human cells including RCC23+3, normal fibroblasts and prostate epithelial cells. Interestingly, an immortal fibroblast cell line and two breast cancer cell lines expressed much lower amounts of KIAA1199 mRNA than their normal counterparts. KIAA1199 mRNA is expressed in a wide range of normal human tissues, with the highest level of expression in brain. The gene is located on chromosome band 15q25, where a brain tumor suppressor gene has been mapped. These findings suggest that KIAA1199 gene may play a role in cellular mortality of normal human cells, which counters cell immortalization and carcinogenesis.

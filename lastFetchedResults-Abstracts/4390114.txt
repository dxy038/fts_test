In this paper we propose a high performance bidirectional path preserving trellis search (PPTS) detector for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The error analysis between single direction and bidirectional PPTS detector is given. We prove that the bidirectional PPTS detector can minimize the detection error effectively. Moreover, the proposed detector saves 10% hardware cost with a 0.1 dB Frame Error Rate (FER) gain compared with traditional PPTS detectors.

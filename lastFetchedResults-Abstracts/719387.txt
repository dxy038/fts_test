This research is an endeavor to study social capital in advantaged and disadvantaged neighborhoods of Tehran and compare dimensions of social capital, objective and subjective, and its components such as social support, relationships, participation, consciousness, reciprocity and social trust in these neighborhoods.
To do this, we used the theory of social capital and the literature related to the impact of neighborhood factors, especially Wilson, Harding and Tourney’s views regarding the effects of disadvantage neighborhoods on individuals’ social behaviors.
The research population consists of individuals aged 15 to 65 years old who are inhabitants of Tehran’s different neighborhoods. The neighborhoods are divided to advantaged, semi advantaged and disadvantaged based on their economic condition, women’s literacy rate and emigration. Then 10 neighborhoods from each group are randomly chosen. The study data are gathered using a questionnaire and interviews with 450 inhabitants of these neighborhoods.    
The results of this study demonstrate that means of individual’s objective and subjective social capital is different among Tehran’s neighborhoods. In comparison, the size of networks and the level of social support, participation, reciprocity and social consciousness in disadvantaged neighborhoods are smaller and lower than advantaged neighborhoods. While the level of social trust in disadvantaged neighborhoods is higher than advantaged neighborhoods.
Overall, the research findings are in accordance with the existing theories regarding the limitation of resources and opportunities for social capital in disadvantaged neighborhoods compared to advantaged ones.

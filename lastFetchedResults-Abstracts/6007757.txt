State-of-the-art in digital coding/decoding includes discrete image transformation, quantization, and entropy coding. The key to efficient data compression is associated with image transformation/reconstruction processes. In this paper, we present a different filters wavelet-based intra-frame video coding technique. The wavelet transformation is developed and optimized in order to enhance the visual quality especially at very low bit rate. The proposed coding technique reduces the bit rate while performing well regarding PSNR and visual quality. In comparison with the conventional coding methods, our proposed coding technique provides significant performance gains in objective and subjective quality.

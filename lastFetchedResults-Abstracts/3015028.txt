The objective of this research is to develop vision systems based on visual predators of the amphibian family (toads, frogs and salamanders). The initial phase of the project is modeling a retina (R2, R3, R4) and several neuron layers (T3, and TH-1), and their inhibitory and excitatory synapses using Genesis, a general purpose neural simulator. Since the network parameters are unknown, we are using genetic algorithms to search for a combination of parameters that produces the desired output of correctly identifying prey.

This paper investigates the ability of immune algorithm (IA) in designing power system stabilizer (PSS) to damp the power system inter-area oscillation. For this the parameters of the PSS are determined by IA using a phase-based objective function. The numerical results are presented on a 2- area 4-machine system to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method. To show the effectiveness of the designed PSSs, a three phase fault is applied. The simulation study shows that the designed PSSs improve the stability of the system. Also, to validate the results obtained by IA, a simple genetic algorithm (GA) is applied for comparison.

Abstract:Designing a new greenhouse is mostly aimed at reaching higher productivities. Currently, there are numerous greenhouses in Iran and other developing countries insufficiently equipped to control inside temperature, humidity, and air circulation. The cost of plant production is much higher in such greenhouses, and therefore, it is not economically reasonable for the owners. The objective of the present study is to design and test a simple microcontroller-based system in order to manage and control different environmental parameters including temperature and humidity in old greenhouses. A wired network sensor has been designed and connected to the main system via RS-485 protocol to reach for users and managers on their cell-phones and short-messaging systems. The main system collects environmental parameters inside greenhouse tunnel every 10 seconds. The parameters are collected by a network sensor, and after being logged, they are sent as short messages to the users as an event-based system. This designed system was installed and run in thirty old greenhouses in Iran for more than 5 years. The results showed that the system is capable of controlling different phenomena including chilblain, freezing, heating stresses, and quantity and quality of production increases. The cost-effectiveness and ease of access associated with low-cost logging and monitoring give its advantages over costly industrial quality control systems.

Objective: Stress and cortisol increase blood glucose. Considering the role of central catecholaminergic pathways on hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical axis, and results of some studies that alprazolam (a benzodiazepine) has inhibitory effect on catecholamines, it seems that alprazolam may reduce blood glucose. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of alprazolam on serum insulin level in non-diabetic rats.
Materials and Methods: This was an experimental study done on 20 male adult rats weighing 180-200g which were selected randomly and divided into three treatment and one control groups. Animals in test groups were administrated different alprazolam doses (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) intraperitoneally and blood insulin and glucose levels were assessed 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours following the treatment. General Linear Model was used to compare the alterations in serum insulin and glucose levels between four groups in different times. For comparison of mean serum glucose levels between two different times paired t-test and for insulin, Wilcoxon test was used.
Results: The serum insulin level alternations were significant in 2 mg/kg group (P=0.0001), with a peak at 4 hour. These alternations were not significant in 0.5 and 1 mg/kg groups, as well as controls.
Conclusion: Our findings show thatblood insulin increases in response to alprazolam injection and this effect is dose-dependent. Maximum increase is induced by the dose of 2 mg/kg.

This paper presents controllers design procedure for dynamic trajectory tracking of a highly automated vehicle. The main objective is to follow the planned trajectories generated by a co-pilot module in the safe way despite the presence of vehicle model uncertainties and also to guarantee a passenger comfort by generating soft actions on the steering wheel and accelerations. A decoupled design approach of longitudinal and lateral controller is adopted. For the longitudinal controller, a proportional including a feedforward terms is adopted. On the other hand, an adaptive backstepping approach is used in lateral case to deal with model nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties. The developed controller is integrated and tested in simulation environment. Performance of this controller are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

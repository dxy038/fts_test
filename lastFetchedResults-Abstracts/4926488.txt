We consider the problem of minimum power bidirectional topology optimization in wireless networks with sectored antennas. We first develop a mixed integer linear programming model for optimal solution of the problem with sectored antennas. Subsequently, we discuss a centralized heuristic algorithm which is based on Kruskal´s algorithm for the minimum spanning tree problem. However, unlike Kruskal´s algorithm which chooses minimum cost edges from a set of edge weights, our algorithm uses an incremental cost mechanism to select edges. This incremental cost mechanism is motivated by the inherently broadcast nature of the wireless medium. We also discuss a simple branch exchange heuristic which can be used to improve the topology generated by the Kruskal-like algorithm. Simulation results indicate that reasonably good solutions can be obtained using the proposed heuristic algorithms.

Hydraulic conductivity is one of the most important soil physical properties for determining infiltration rate, developing irrigation and drainage systems, and other hydrological processes. The objective of this study was to compare the multiple constant head (MCH), the simplified falling-head (SFH) and the tension infiltrometer (TI) methods for measuring field saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) in some vertisols and entisols. Therefore, Kfs was measured in soils with different shrinkage and swelling ration in wet and dry initial moisture conditions. The results showed that because of the preferential flow at the dry initial moisture condition measurement of Kfs was not possible by MCH and SFH methods. While, TI method provided measuring of this parameter throughout by of preferential flow. At the wet initial moisture condition, the measured Kfs values by SFH and MCH methods were higher than those obtained by TI method. However, the correlations between measured Kfs values by the mentioned methods were significantly positive. The highest observed correlation coefficient was between MCH and SFH methods (r=0.97) and the lowest one obtained between FSH and TI methods (0.73). Statistical analysis of t-test showed that there was no significant difference between Kfs values measured with the three methods at the wet initial condition (P < 0.05). Considering the adventages of SFH and TI methods, they can be recommended as suitable methods for measuring Kfs in swelling soils.

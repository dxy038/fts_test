BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The mission of the educational branch of the Center for Biological Defense at the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida is to promote homeland security through the training of professionals and the community. Assessment of participant evaluations after the first year of the program indicated a need for more interactive sessions. In response to these evaluations, two interactive educational formats were developed and added to the program. The objective of this analysis was to compare participant evaluations of didactic and interactive techniques used to teach information about the Category A Agents of Bioterrorism.

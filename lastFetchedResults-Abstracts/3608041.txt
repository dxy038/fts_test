The European Telecommunications Standards Institute is guiding the continent-wide progress toward a unified telecommunications market. The objective of the Institute is to produce the technical standards which are necessary to achieve a large unified European telecommunications market. Further, the principal role of the Institute is technical prestandardization and standardization at the European level in the following fields: areas common to telecommunications and information technology subject to decisions by the Information Technology Steering Committee (ITSTC); and areas common to telecommunications and sound and TV broadcasting in cooperation with other organizations such as the European Broadcasting Union. The activities of the Institute build upon worldwide standards, existing or in preparation, and contribute to the production of harmonized new worldwide standards in the same fields.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

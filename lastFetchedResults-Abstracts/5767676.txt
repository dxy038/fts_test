With the recent trend towards deregulating power systems around the world, transfer capability computation emerges as the key issue to a smoothly running power market with multiple transactions. Total Transfer Capability (TTC) is the basic measure for evaluating available transfer capability (ATC). The paper presents the calculation of TTC through an optimal power flow approach. The objective function is to maximize the sum of the sending end-end generation and receiving-end load of specified buses. The constraints are ac power flow equations and system operation limits. The sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method is used for the optimization process. The IEEE 30 bus system is used for testing the proposed algorithm and the results compared favorably with that from the Continuation Power Flow (CPF) method.

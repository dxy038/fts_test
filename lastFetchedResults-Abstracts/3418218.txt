This paper proposes a new approach for designing a cost-effective, on-chip, deterministic, built-in, self-test generator. Given a set of precomputed test vectors (obtained by an ATPG tool) with a predetermined fault coverage, a simple test vector generator (TVG) is synthesized to apply the given test set in a minimal test time. To achieve this objective, cellular automata (CA) structures have been used in which the rule space is not limited to the linear rules commonly used in CA studies recently. Based on some new notations and new formulations of CA properties, two techniques are developed to synthesize such a TVG which is used to generate an ordered/unordered deterministic test vector set. The resulting TVG is very efficient in terms of hardware size and speed performance, and is very regular and testable. Simulation of various benchmark combinational circuits has given good results when compared to alternative solutions

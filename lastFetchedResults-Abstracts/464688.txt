OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the cost or quality of life associated with surgical treatment of presumed early-stage endometrial cancer differed on the basis of the surgical approach. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was performed on a consecutive series of women with presumed early-stage endometrial cancer treated at the Women's Cancer Center of Northern California. The senior author was the surgeon, cosurgeon, or assistant on all cases. The women comprise two groups with different surgical approaches. The first group of 17 women underwent exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy. The second group of 13 women underwent the same surgery by laparoscopy. The two groups were compared with a two-tailed Student t test. Variables analyzed included age, height, weight, Quetelet index, and predisposing medical problems. Lymph node counts were compiled. Hospital costs were broken down into four cost categories: (1) operating room, (2) hospital bed, (3) pharmacy, and (4) anesthesia. A two-tailed Student t test was also used in this analysis. Issues examined regarding quality of life included (1) average hospital stay, (2) complications, and (3) time to return to normal activity. RESULTS: The patient population differed significantly (p< 005) with regard to weight and Quetelet index. The laparotomy group required significantly longer hospitalization than the laparoscopy group (6.3 vs 2.4 days, p< 0.001), resulting in higher overall hospital costs ($19,158 vs $13,988, p< 005). Similarly, patients undergoing laparotomy took longer to return to normal activity (5.3 weeks vs 2.4 weeks, p< 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic management of endometrial cancer may result in significant cost savings and improved quality of life as demonstrated by shortened hospital stays and an earlier return to normal activity.

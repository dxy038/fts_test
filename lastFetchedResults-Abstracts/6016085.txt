The design and performance of a complete three-phase converter system and field-oriented induction motor drive based on a 20 kHz AC link is described. By using the same converter for the AC input side as for the output load side, it is shown that power can be transferred in either direction. It is also shown that with the use of a current regulator, both power flow on the link and the link-voltage amplitude can be regulated. By suitable feedback control, the power factor at the input to the converter can be adjusted to unity. Both computer and experimental results show unit power factor operation, low harmonic current both in the input and output of the system, and bidirectional power-flow capability.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

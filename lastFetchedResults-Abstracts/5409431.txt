In this paper, we study the problem of an optimal assignment of a tree-structured context reasoning procedure onto the computation resources in a host-satellites configuration. The objective function to be minimized is the end-to-end processing delay, which is a crucial factor in a number of context-aware applications, e.g. mobile healthcare applications. The presented solution is a modification of an earlier method proposed by Bokhari, in which the optimal assignment problem to minimize the bottleneck processing time is transformed into a path-searching problem in a doubly weighted graph. Due to the incompatible requirements raised in our study, e.g. a-prior known location of the sensors, we propose a colouring scheme and a new search algorithm in this paper to obtain the optimal assignment in order to satisfy our objective.

This paper studies the volt/var control strategy for smart distribution system by formulating and solving system optimization problems. In the study, solid state transformers (SST) are used for continuous var compensation, while voltage regulators (VR) are for voltage regulation. The objectives are to minimize total system power loss while maintaining voltages along the feeder within acceptable limits. A two step optimization volt/var control method for multiple, discrete/continuous mixed regulating device is introduced in this paper. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique is able to achieve the objective efficiently.

The increasing interest of the research community to the probabilistic analysis concerning the civil structures with space-variant properties points out the problem of achieving a reliable discretization of random processes (or random fields in a multi-dimensional domain). Given a discretization method, a continuous random process is approximated by a finite set of random variables. Its dimension affects significantly the accuracy of the approximation, in terms of the relevant properties of the continuous random process under investigation. The paper presents a discretization procedure based on the truncated Karhunen–Loève series expansion and the finite element method. The objective is to link in a rational way the number of random variables involved in the approximation to a quantitative measure of the discretization accuracy. The finite element method is applied to evaluate the terms of the series expansion when a closed form expression is not available. An iterative refinement of the finite element mesh is proposed in this paper, leading to an accurate random process discretization. The technique is tested with respect to the exponential covariance function, that enables a comparison with analytical expressions of the approximated properties of the random process. Then, the procedure is applied to the square exponential covariance functions, which is one of the most used covariance models in the structural engineering field. The comparison of the adaptive refinement of the discretization with a non-adaptive procedure and with the wavelet Galerkin approach allows to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposal within the framework of the Karhunen–Loève series expansion. A comparison with the Expansion Optimal Linear Estimation (EOLE) method is performed in terms of efficiency of the discretization strategy.

Three visibility methods have been chosen with the objective of comparing their results in terms of computational time and RCS values. Two of them -trimming method, cone method - have been already described. The trimming method is considered to be the more accurate one due to the fact that only totally lit or non-lit facets can exist. Nonetheless, the computational cost is ten times the one associated with the cone method, whose relative error is 4.67%. Consequently, the employment of cone method implies a faster software execution but the price to pay is decrease of the accuracy. On the other hand, the recursive implementation of the binary space partitioning algorithm overloads the process and does not improve the results of the other methodologies.

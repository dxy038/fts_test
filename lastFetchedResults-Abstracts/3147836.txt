Measurement of the breathing capacity in the respiratory function of patients, a health examination of common people, and an industrial disaster evaluation are planned for the entire nation. Particularly, in typical environments as the importance of emotional technology increases, interest in research related to emotion reasoning according to breathing capacity has increased. Data collected by breathing capacity sensors can extract emotion data through ISO/IEC 11179 - MDR (Meta Data Registries) standard model. After measuring and analyzing respiration among other biological signs, the human single-dimension emotions of Pleasantness, Unpleasantness, Arousal, and Relaxation were expressed via objective and quantitative data by mapping in a two-dimension domain.

A circuit topology of the forward-mode three-level inverter is proposed. The kind of circuit topologies are constituted of three-level converter, high frequency transformer, output cycloconverter, output filter and so on. The inverter has the advantages such as simple topology, two-stage power conversions(DC/HFAC/LFAC), bidirectional power flow, high frequency electrical isolation, three-level voltage across the output filter and so on. The operation principle of the inverter is investigated, theoretical waveforms are shown, relevant formulas are deducted. The control strategy is also designed in this paper. The results of the simulation indicate that the new inverter has the advantage of simple structure and high efficiency transformation.

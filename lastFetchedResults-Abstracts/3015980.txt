With the rapid development of information technology, it is widely accepted that computer and information communication literacy has become extremely important, and is the main new ability required from society everywhere. The purpose of this study is to propose and develop the integrated e-learning system-RAPSODY. The structure, function and mechanism of RAPSODY based on Distance Ecological Model is described, and the educational meaning of this model in consideration of the new learning ecology is discussed, which is based on multi-modality and new learning situations and forms. We also report on our experiences with the introduction of this practical program, about the framework, settings actual implementation and first results. The target objective of this program is the harmonization of university level educational research, society practice and practical business. We analyze these results and the problems encountered, as well as its constructive solutions.

In this paper, we present a low-complexity Interference Aware Multiple Relay Selection (IAMRS) scheme for cognitive radio system. The main objective in selecting multiple relays is to maximize the SNR at the destination under the constraint of acceptable interference to the primary users (PU). The computational complexity of finding an optimal IAMRS by exhaustive search grows exponentially with the number of relays. In this paper, we propose an interference-aware greedy algorithm for the relay selection problem. The proposed algorithm has low computational complexity, and its effectiveness is verified through simulation results.

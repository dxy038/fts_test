Propagating uncertainty is one of the key issues in complex measurement systems. This paper addresses the propagation of uncertainty applied to the field of optical measurement systems, focusing on the objective speckle correlation (OSC) technique for strain and displacement measurement on rough surfaces in a contact-less manner. Due to the complexity of the underlying physical and electrical phenomena we apply a Monte-Carlo analysis to determine the uncertainties for a given experimental setup, and verify some of the outcomes of investigations with practical measurements under laboratory conditions

Political, economic, social and technological changes have a significant impact on such organizations as Agricultural Extension. Only those organizations can perform their activities effectively and efficiently that take the changes into account and organize their structures and services accordingly. Dealing with these challenges necessitates the use of performance- and client-oriented as two effective approaches by agricultural extension organizations. The performance-oriented approach sets the objectives and priorities essential for achieving sustainable results. The client-oriented approach is a type of organizational culture that creates required behaviors for generating superior values for those who receive these services. The objective of this paper is to explain agricultural extension organizations approaches using library research method.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to establish the cause of and treatment for chronic vaginal discharge after uterine artery embolization.
Study design
This was a retrospective review of the diagnosis and treatment of the procedure at 3 months.
Results
In 94% of patients, the condition either completely resolved or diminished to a nonproblematic level.
Conclusion
The persistent discharge in these patients was due to a superficial cavity within the infarcted fibroid tumor that was communicating with the endometrial cavity through a hole in the endometrium. This situation is indicated by a specific appearance on TII sagittal magnetic resonance images. Hysteroscopic resection of the necrotic fibroid tumor cavity was usually curative.

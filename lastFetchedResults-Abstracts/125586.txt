Background & Objective: Multiple Sclerosis (MS.) is rare in less than 10 years, usually presents after menstrual age and third decay of life. Affects myelinization of central nervous system, with
unknown etiology and pathogenesis, but viruses and autoimmuity may have a role. Clinical presentation is variable from mild to severe, progressive, debilitated one.
Materials & Methods: This is a prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study on twenthy, patients with M.S. at neurologic ward of Mofid ped-hospital from (1996-2000). 14 girls and 6 boys, age (4 years-13 years). Results: Brain-magnetic resonance imaging (M.R.I.) in all the patients with multiple plaques confirmed the diagnosis. Visual Evoked Response (V.E.R.) in most the patients showed the increased latency. The commonest clinical presentation were: increased DTR, Ataxia, Diplopia, decreased muscle power, walking defect, vertigo and paresthesia. For all the patients, CBC, electrolytes, CSF and analysis LE, ANA, Anti dnase were done and for some of the patients if needed, Auditory Brain Response (A.B.R.), somata sensory evoked potential (S.S.E.P.) and spinal M.R.I. were done.
Conclusion: We tried to discuss about M.S. by clinical manifestation, neuro imaging and Electro diagnostic test in children.

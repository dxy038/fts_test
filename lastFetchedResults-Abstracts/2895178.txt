In this paper, a 100W PEM fuel cell as the primary power supply provides DC power for a Peltier based cooling process. For the fuel cell, there exist slow dynamic response and soft characteristic. Therefore, fuel cell based hybrid power system is designed, including fuel cell, battery, unidirectional DC-DC converter and bidirectional DC-DC converter. In order to reduce the slow dynamic response and soft characteristic, it is the most important that the duty ratio of PWM wave of the DC-DC converter is required to be controlled real-time. A control scheme combining feedforward and feedback is proposed for the DC-DC converter, where feedforward control is based on the output voltage of the fuel cell and feedback control is based on the requirement voltage of the load. Simulation results by using the designed circuit and proposed method are given to verify the performance of the DC-DC converter.

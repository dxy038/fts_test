The main objective of this paper is to investigate the reliability of Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu low-Ag lead-free solder alloy. The wettability, mechanical property and microstructure of Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC105) and Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) lead-free solder alloys were comparatively investigated. Experimental studies have shown that the wetting property of low-Ag lead-free solder alloy SAC105 remains to be improved and mechanical strength is lower to SAC305, but its anti-drop and anti-shock performance are outstanding. Though the wetting property of SAC105 is inferior to SAC305, the melting point and wettability of SAC105 can meet the actual reliability requirements of products. Matched with appropriate process, low-Ag lead-free solder can also form reliable solder joints to meet the reliability standards in industrial production.

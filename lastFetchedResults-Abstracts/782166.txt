The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of repeated administration of hCG
on the follicular and luteal charactristics and serum progesterone concentrations in eCGsuperovulated
Merghoz does. The estrous cycles of 40 adult does were synchronized
following a 12-day treatment with intravaginal sponges (Chronogest®), with 1000 IU eCG
injected 2 days prior to sponge removal. On the day of sponge removal (day 0), the females
were randomly assigned to 4 treatments. The first group (h1; n = 10), received an i.m. hCG
injection (500 IU; Pregnyl®) on the day 0. The second group (h2; n = 10), received an i.m.
hCG (500 IU) injection on days 0 and 1, while the third group (h3; n = 10) received i.m. hCG
(500 IU) on days 0–2. Does in the control group (n = 10) did not receive any hCG treatment.
Blood samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 5 and 8 and analysed for serum progesterone
(P4) concentrations. Premature luteal regression was considered to have occurred if the
P4 concentrations declined to less than 1 ng/mL by day 8 following sponge removal. On
day 8 goats were slaughtered and ovaries recovered for evaluation. In each case the CL’s
were counted and classified according to their appearance – as normal or as regressing.
According to the serum P4 concentration on day 8, 42.8% (3/7), 0% (0/8), 0% (0/7) and 0%
(0/6) of the goats underwent premature luteal regression in the control, h1, h2 and h3
groups, respectively. The control group was the only group in which there was a significant
increase in the number of regressing CL’s on day 8 (5.1±1.5; P < 0.05). The characteristics
of the CL’s, including the mean diameter and weight was greater (P < 0.05) in the h2
and h3 groups, compared to the control group (10.9±0.7, 11.0±0.9 vs. 7.9±1.1mm and
640.0±101.4, 691.7±111.7 vs. 294.3±143.7 mg, respectively). No differences (P < 0.05) in
the number of large follicles present on the ovaries were recorded on day 8 between the
groups. However, the diameter of the large follicles present on the ovaries on day 8 was
greater (P < 0.05) in goats in the h2 and the h3 groups, compared to the control (15.3±0.6
and 12.9±0.3 vs. 8.6±1.7mm, respectively; P < 0.05). The serum P4 concentrations were
higher in the h2 and the h3 groups than in the control group on days 2 and 8. The serum P4
concentrations on day 8 also recorded a positive correlation with the normal CL’s, CL diameter
and CL weight (P < 0.001). These results indicate that the repeated administration of
hCG post-sponge removal presumably prevents premature luteal regression and improves
luteal function in goats after eCG-superovulatory treatment. However, neither the number
of persistent follicles nor the diameter of the persistent follicles was reduced.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of treatment with additional progesterone (P4 or 17β-oestradiol (E2) at the end of a period of P4 treatment on ovarian follicular development, ovulation time, and plasma gonadotrophin and steroid hormone concentrations of Bos indicus cows. Initially, two injections of PGF2α were given 14 days apart, and at the time of the second injection (Day 0) all cows received a single P4-releasing controlled internal drug release (CIDR) device that was removed 10 days later. Control cows (Group 1, n = 8) received no other treatment. On Day 8, cows in Group 2 (n = 8) and Group 3 (n = 8) received either a s.c. implant containing E2, or a second CIDR device, respectively. All CIDR devices and E2 implants were removed at a similar time on Day 10. Treatment with E2 or P4 delayed mean (± SD) time of ovulation (113.1 ± 25.6 h, 153.4 ± 44.5 h and 150.8 ± 25.1 h for Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) and the mean time (± SD) of the luteinising hormone (LH) peak (87.4 ± 24.5 h, 124.3 ± 45.0 h and 122.3 ± 25.04 h for Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Both treatments delayed the mean (± SD) day of emergence of the ovulatory follicle (7.7 ± 3.6 days, 11.3 ± 1.7 days and 11.1 ± 1.5 days for Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively; P &lt; 0.05), and reduced the variability in the day of emergence of the ovulatory follicle (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the control cows. Variability in age and duration of dominance of the ovulatory follicle was greater in control animals compared with treated animals (P &lt; 0.05). Treatment with E2 on Days 9 and 10 did not alter mean concentrations of gonadotrophins in the cows in Group 2 compared with control cows (P &gt; 0.05), whereas treatment of cows with an additional CIDR device resulted in greater mean concentrations of FSH and lesser concentrations of LH on Day 9 (P &lt; 0.05) compared with cows in Groups 1 and 2. By Day 10 mean concentrations of gonadotrophins were similar among cows in all three groups. Concentrations of E2 were less in cows in Group 3 compared with cows in Groups 1 and 2 from Day 9 to Day 11 (P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that treatment with either E2 or P4 can influence the pattern of ovarian follicular development and ovulation in cattle; however, the mechanism of action of the two treatments may differ. Atretogenic treatments for ovarian follicles applied at the end of a period of progesterone treatment did not improve synchrony of ovulation.

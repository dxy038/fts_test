Our researchÂ´s main objective is to design an architecture prototype to govern an intelligent robot which can work quickly and efficiently in a vague dynamical environment, typically where various robots and human cooperate each other to accomplish a common global goal. To realize such kind of system, a new planning and control architecture with abilities of real-time control and easy implementation of control knowledge is required. The architecture proposed here is based on the idea of memory-based reasoning systems and behavior-based control systems. Then, to confirm its performance, a simple simulation example of two mobile robots that cooperate to capture a target is showed

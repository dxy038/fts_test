Objective
 complaints are a common finding in outpatients, especially in psychosomatic and neurological practice. In a substantial group of patients persistent memory complaints are found in the absence of abnormal neuropsychology. Different labels such as “functional memory complaint” have been suggested for this phenomenon. We characterise a group of patients with such memory complaints, which we termed functional memory disorder (FMD). The aim of the present study is to describe patients with FMD.
s
-nine patients with FMD were compared to 38 control subjects. Data were collected on the German version of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning test and the Zahlenverbindungstest (cognitive speed), subscales of the Metamemory in Adulthood questionnaire (MIA), the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Symptom Checklist, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and other psychological questionnaire measures.
s
nd significant group differences on all psychological questionnaire measures, with more pathological scores in the patient group. GSI and PSQ were the best predictors of memory self-efficacy. MIA-Memory Self-Efficacy (MSE), MIA-Achievement, and BDI were the best predictors of group membership (FMD vs. control group). When MSE was excluded, MIA-Achievement and BDI or GSI were the only predictors of group membership. Neuropsychological measures predicted neither MSE nor group membership.
sions
ogical scores on measures of metamemory, stress, and depression are typical of FMD. Low MSE and a high memory-related achievement motivation seem to be key features of FMD. Other important features are increased perceived stress, general psychosomatic complaint, and elevated depression scores. Neuropsychological test performance is not associated with FMD symptoms.

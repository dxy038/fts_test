Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a secondary metabolite of Aspergillus and Penicillium species, including Aspergillus ochraceus, a species that can be found in stored cereal grains such as barley. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of water activity (aw, 0.80–0.99), temperature (10, 20, 30 °C), and A. ochraceus isolate differences on radial growth and OTA production in irradiated barley grains. The three isolates showed optimal conditions for growth and ochratoxin A production at 0.99 aw and 30 °C, with a marked decrease of growth rates and OTA production at the lowest levels of aw and temperature assayed. The minimum aw level for growth, observed in this study, was 0.85 and 0.90 aw for OTA production. Significant differences among the isolates were found. Lag phases prior to fungal growth and OTA production values were modelled by multiple linear regression and response surface models. These models could provide an approximate prediction of growth and OTA production.

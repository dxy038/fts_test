Multi-constrained QoS routing deals with finding routes that satisfies multiple independent QoS constraints simultaneously. This paper proposes a Fuzzy cost based Multi constrained Quality of Service Routing (FCMQR) protocol to select an optimal path by considering multiple independent QoS metrics such as bandwidth, end-to-end delay, number of intermediate hops etc. This is based on multi criterion objective fuzzy measure. In this method all the available resources of the path is converted into a single metric fuzzy cost. Mobility prediction is done to find the lifetime of the path. The path with the maximum lifetime and minimum fuzzy cost will be considered to be the optimal one and used for transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed FCMQR provides an accurate and efficient method of estimating and evaluating the QoS routing stability and cost in dynamic mobile networks.

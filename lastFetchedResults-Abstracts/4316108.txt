Incorporating sensor nodes with data aggregation capability to transmit less data flow in wireless sensor networks could reduce the total energy consumption. This calls for the efficient and effective data-centric routing algorithm to facilitate this advantage. In this paper, we model the data-centric routing problem by a rigorous mixed integer and linear mathematical formulation where the objective function is to minimize the total transmission cost subject to multicast tree constraints. The solution approach is based on Lagrangean relaxation in conjunction with the optimization-based heuristics. From the computational experiments, it is shown that the proposed algorithm calculates a better solution than other existing heuristics with improvement ratio up to 169% for a network with 300 random generated nodes in five minutes of computational time.

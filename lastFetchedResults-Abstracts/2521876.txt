Transport of fluoride and consumption of groundwater with excess fluoride concentrations poses a health threat to millions of people around the world. The objective of this study was to simulate transport of fluoride (F) using HYDRUS1D model. The study was conducted in lysimeters at Lavark research station site in Isfahan. The treatments consisted of two concentrations of F (157 and 315 mg kg1). The duration of the study was 125 days. Some of soil physical and chemical properties, soluble F and total F concentration were determined during the study. The results showed the transport of F in calcareous soil profiles. This may be due to the high pH and desorption of F ion as a result of repulsion by the more negatively charged soil surfaces. The highest concentration of total F and water soluble F were observed in the 10 cm surface soil layer. The concentration of F decreased with increased soil depth. The correlation coefficient was significant between the water soluble fluoride and the total fluoride (1% level). Also, the difference between the observed t value and a critical value on the t distribution is statistically insignificant. It showed that the model simulated successfully water soluble F concentration in the soil profile.

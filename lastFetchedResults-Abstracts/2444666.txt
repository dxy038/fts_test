Inroduction & Objective: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women in the world. Axin gene includes axin1 and axin2. The C-myc and other genes of this family encode transcription factors that play a vital role in cell proliferation, growth, differentiation and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate semi-quantitative genes expression of AXIN1,CMYC in mRNA tissue of Iranian patients with CRC and checking the communication ON or OFF of this genes in each tumor stages and pathologic factors of patients
Material and Methods: Therefore, we have done RT-PCR with specific primers for Axin1,CMYC and B-actin genes on the 54 tumor and 41 normal tissues as fresh samples which obtained from 54 unrelated patients referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital.
Results: According the results, 55% of the samples were ON and 45% of the samples were OFF  for AXIN1 gene expression and 87.5% of the samples were ON and 12.5% of the samples were OFF for CMYC gene expression  respectively . Statistical analysis with SPSS, T-test and X2 showed that  there is a significant differences of the Axin1 and CMYC expression between two groups of samples; normal, tumor(P  < 0.05).
Conclusion: According the results, 55% of the samples were ON and 45% of the samples were OFF  for AXIN1 gene expression and 87.5% of the samples were ON and 12.5% of the samples were OFF for CMYC gene expression  respectively . Statistical analysis with SPSS, T-test and X2 showed that  there is a significant differences of the Axin1 and CMYC expression between two groups of samples; normal, tumor(P  < 0.05).

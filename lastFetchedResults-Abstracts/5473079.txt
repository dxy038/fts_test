The relative motion between the camera and the scene leads to blurring of images. By appealing to traveling wave equations, the restoration of the motion-blurred images can be achieved and a criterion of objective quality assessment can be obtained for these restored versions even without any a priori knowledge of the original image. Most significantly, this criterion actually applies to any categories of image restoration methods as long as the image blur is caused by a linear uniform motion with good sensitivity and consistency.

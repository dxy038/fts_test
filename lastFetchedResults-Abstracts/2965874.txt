In this paper we propose a method for face recognition from an off-frontal input image. Our method is based on the bidirectional view synthesis. Firstly, from an off-frontal input image, a frontal &#8220;virtual&#8221; view is synthesized based on the linear combination model. Then, pattern matching is performed to select the possible matches. If several candidates for the matching remain, the backward view synthesis, from each candidate to the input view, is carried out. A reliable result is obtained by this bidirectional view synthesis method

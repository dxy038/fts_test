The objective of this study was to clarify experimentally and analytically the loading capacities, deformations and failure modes of various types of reinforced-concrete structure subjected to loads applied at various rates. Flat slabs, slabs with beams and cylindrical walls were tested under static, low speed and high speed loading. Analysis was applied to estimate the test results by the finite element method using a layered shell element. The analysis closely simulated the experimental results until punching shear failure occured.

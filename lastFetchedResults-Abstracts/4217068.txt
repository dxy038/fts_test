This paper analyzes factors that influence the quality of product innovation design, and proposes a method of combining the Analytical Hierarchy Process with Objective Tree method based on fuzzy mathematic theory. Then we put forward a delaminating multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method for the product innovative design. The square root method is applied to simplify the weight set of fuzzy evaluation computing process. The results are impersonal, which can be easy to appraise and compare. The method is proved to be feasible through fuzzy comprehensive evaluating of the design model.

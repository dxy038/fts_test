This paper investigates the rate and power control problem in a frequency-selective interference channel. The objective of the rate and power control is to maximize the achievable rate region, given an average power constraint for each user. We then propose a centralized algorithm with which a spectrum-management center determines the data rate and power of each user. The proposed algorithm is based on the multi-user discrete bit-loading algorithm that considers the bit and power allocation over frequency and users simultaneously. Simulation results for the upstream transmission in very high-speed digital subscriber line systems show that the proposed rate and power control algorithm enlarges the rate region achieved by the existing distributed algorithms.

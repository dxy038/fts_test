Background: Balloon bionic midwifery has been applied in clinical obstetrics in China for 10 years, although played a certain role in controlling and improving the quality of obstetrics and caesarean section rate, but some questions have not been resolved. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of airbag midwifery. Materials and Methods: Primiparas (2410 cases) with various medical conditions were randomly divided into airbag and control groups undergoing the same obstetrical treatments, but airbag midwifery as a birthing option was chosen twice when the cervix was dilated to 2-4 cm during labor. Results: The duration of the first and second stages, as well as the total delivery process, of the airbag group was shorter than that for the controls. The natural delivery rate of the airbag group was higher than that of the control group. The forcep delivery rate, cesarean section rate, amount of vaginal bleeding within 2 h after delivery, rate of postpartum hemorrhage, fetal distress, and pitocin use in the airbag group were all lower than those in the control group. No significant difference in the rate of maternal and fetal complications was observed in the two groups. The bionic airbag midwifery approach did not contribute to the incidence rate of urine retention, leukocyte count, neutrophil proportion, and level of creactive protein and IL-6 24 h after delivery. Conclusion: Airbag midwifery skill is a simple, effective, and safe procedure

Flooding is an unavoidable disaster. However, the impact and the risk to be affected by flooding can be reduced. Recently, floodplain modeling known as new method applied in river engineering modeling and has been used by many researchers in determining flood prone area, The objective of this research is to explore the integration of Geographic Information System (GIS) and hydraulic simulation model, Hydrologic Engineering Centers River Analysis System (HEC RAS) in determining the steady flow simulation model and possibility flooding areas for Bandar Segamat Johor. The methodology of this research is divided into 5 stages, include study area identification, data acquisition, data processing (spatial data generation), data processing (simulation), result and analysis. In this research, steady flow for Segamat River and Kapeh River was simulated. Flood map was produced by integrating both GIS and HEC RAS analysis. The results suggest that the integration of HEC RAS and GIS analysis can lead to a better visualization for flood mapping to be used by the society and considered to be helpful for future development.

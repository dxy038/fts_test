Inroduction & Objective: Japanese Threadfin Bream, Nemipterus japonicus, is one of the most important commercial fishes and constitutes an important part of the trawl catch in Persian Gulf. The purpose of this study was Fecundity of Japanese Threadfin Bream, Nemipterus japonicus, in Persian Gulf (the Coastal Waters of Bushehr Province).
Material and Methods: In this present a total of 595 specimens collected for absolute and relative fecundity researches. The specimens were caught monthly by bottom trawler in the northern part of Persian Gulf (Bushehr Province).
Results: The fecundity of 41mature were studied, that ranged from 114 to 210 mm in fork length. The mean fork length and gonad weight were calculated 189mm (SD = 27.8) and 3.84g (SD = 2.29), respectively. The maximum and minimum absolute fecundity were calculated 1240910 and 84031related to 210 and 114mm FL, respectively. The mean absolute and relative fecundities were 472388 42633 and 3817 293 (X SE), respectively. The maximum, minimum and mean of oocyte diameter were 0.448, 0.022 0.221mm (SE = 0.071), respectively.

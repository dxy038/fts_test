An optimization method, such as the steepest gradient methods, could not easily obtain globally optimum solutions for devising antenna design parameters that allow the antenna to simultaneously improve multiple performances such as gain, sidelobe level, and input impedance. The genetic algorithm (GA) is suitable for empirically solving optimization problems and is effective in designing an antenna. In particular, this method can solve the multiobjective optimization problem using various Pareto-optimal solutions in an extremely efficient manner. In this paper, the Pareto GA, by which various Pareto-optimal solutions for each objective function (performance) can be obtained in a single trial of a numerical simulation and which enables the selection of parameters in accordance with the design requirement, is applied to the multiobjective optimization design of the Yagi-Uda antenna. The effectiveness of the Pareto GA was demonstrated by comparing the performances obtained by the Pareto GA with those of the previously reported values, which were obtained by the conventional GA, and with the values of the design benchmark reference.

Objective
To describe magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings in a cohort of healthy neonates.
Methods
We performed MEG and single channel EEG concomitantly in 21 healthy newborns. MEG and EEG signals were reviewed for gross comparison of general patterns and individual waveform characteristics. Spectral analysis was performed to quantify the signals.
Results
Our MEG recordings showed patterns comparable to classical neonatal EEG. Seventy-nine percent of the subjects exhibited the ‘continuous polyfrequency activity’ at some point in their recording. Sixty-three percent had the ‘continuous slow’ pattern, and 47% had the ‘trace alternant’ pattern. Spectral analysis revealed maximal power at frequencies of less than 4 Hz (delta band) in both MEG and EEG with a decline towards higher frequencies.
Conclusions
Neonatal MEG is feasible and shares the basic EEG features and frequency content, with predominant activity in the slow frequency delta band. The latter corresponds to reports from earlier neonatal EEG studies.
Significance
MEG may prove to be useful in studies of neonatal brain functions

In this letter, considering the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer scheme, we study the robust artificial noise (AN)-aided secure transmission design in multiple-input-single-output channels where the channel uncertainties are modeled by worst-case model. Our objective is to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate with respect to both the worst-case channel uncertainties and the worst-case eavesdropper among multiple eavesdroppers, under the transmit power constraint and the worst-case energy harvesting constraint. The optimal solution to the problem can be found by two-dimensional (2-D) search. Since the 2-D search algorithm has high computational complexity, we propose to neglect the correlation of the channel uncertainties from the transmitter to the information-decoding receiver and reformulate the problem as a sequence of convex semidefinite programming (SDP) which is solved efficiently by SDP based one-dimensional line search method. It is shown through computer simulations that the proposed robust AN-aided secure transmission schemes have significant performance gain over the non-robust AN-aided secure transmission scheme and the robust secure transmission scheme without the aid of AN.

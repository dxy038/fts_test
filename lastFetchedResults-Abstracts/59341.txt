LRFD shows promise as a viable alternative to the present working stress design (WSD) approach to shallow foundation design. The key improvements of LRFD over the traditional WSD are the ability to provide a more consistent level of reliability and the possibility of accounting for load and resistance uncertainties separately. For LRFD to gain acceptance in geotechnical engineering, a framework for the objective assessment of resistance factors is needed. Such a framework, based on reliability analysis, is proposed in this paper. Probability density functions (PDFs), representing design variable uncertainties, are required for analysis. A systematic approach to the selection of PDFs is presented. A procedure such as that proposed provides a rational probabilistic basis for the development of LRFD methods in geotechnical engineering.

This paper presents a proposal for transmitting and recovering images using Multiple Description Coding (MDC) techniques over unreliable multiple links in a mesh network, while using network coding technique to add a protection path. In pure MDC, the loss of one description degrades the received image quality. In the proposed technique, the protection path ensures that all the descriptions are received even when one description is lost, but at the expense of additional link. The image is divided into subimages called descriptions by the sender. Each description is encoded by JPEG standard. The descriptions transmitted on different links or channels. The proposed method (MDC+NC) can recover the exact lost pixels rather than the interpolated pixels in classical methods such as interpolations. A comparative evaluation and objective quality metrics based on simulation is presented.

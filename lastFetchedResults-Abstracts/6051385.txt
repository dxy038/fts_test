This paper presents a control-oriented model of the magnetic flux in the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor (ITER) actuated with Electron Cyclotron Current Drive (ECCD) at different locations. The main objective of the control-oriented modeling is to derive an input/output representation of the magnetic profile written as a state-space model. The state-space model allows determination of the most suitable actuation strategies using the concept of controllability analysis. To illustrate the controllability analysis of the magnetic flux actuated at different locations, we present numerical results based on space dependent parameters obtained from the integrated modeling code CRONOS.

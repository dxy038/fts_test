Analytical models of the distributed tactical decision making process that can be used for analyzing the performance of alternative organizational designs are considered. The objective is to develop executable models that represent more realistic decision processes. A colored Petri net implementation of the mathematical model of a decision making organization that forms the basis of an experiment currently being carried out is presented. The model is used to investigate coordination mechanisms by decoupling the information flow paths and the coordination mechanisms into two interacting layers in which the coordination layer coordinates the behavior of the information flows. Simulation results are presented for different coordination functions

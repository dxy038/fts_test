The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a slow-release coated urea product (CU, 1% as dry matter of diet) on ruminal disappearance and fermentation, as well as on growth performance of beef steers. Soybean meal in control diet was replaced by CU and steam-rolled corn. For the growth performance trial, 20 beef steers (330±20 kg) were used. For the ruminal trial, four ruminally cannulat-ed steers (230±20 kg) were used.Dry matter intake, daily gain, feed efficiency and carcass dressing were not affected (P> 0.05) by CU. Ruminal ammonia N was higher (P<0.05) with CU than control diet. Potential disappearance and total ruminal disappearance of dry matter were increased, while the potential disappearance rate of neutral detergent fibre was reduced with CU. Slow coated urea at 1% of total diet did not affect growth performance and carcass dressing of beef steers.

This paper presents the use of multi-objective optimization when designing a dual-antenna system for MIMO application. As a study case, a user device is selected operating within two separate frequency bands, namely 750-800 MHz and 2.5-2.7 GHz. The MIMO performance of such an antenna system depends strongly on the antenna efficiency in a noise-limited environment but also on the correlation between the antenna branch signals. The antennas also share space with other components in a user device, which puts restrictions on the occupied area. This leads to conflicting requirements that are handled with a multi-objective optimization procedure.

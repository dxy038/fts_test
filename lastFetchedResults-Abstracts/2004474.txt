Food allergy is recognised as an important human health problem. Fish represent one of the most important causes of food hypersensitivity reaction. Small amounts of the allergen can cause severe reactions in sensitive individuals, so correct labelling is essential to ensure the protection of consumers. The objective of the present work was to develop a reliable, sensitive and specific real-time PCR method for the detection of fish and traces of fish in all kind of products included those that have undergone aggressive treatments such as high temperature or pressure. This methodology was validated simulating products likely to contain this allergen and spiking them with fish cooking water. In addition, a comparison between the performance of in-house methodology and a commercial kit, both of them based on real-time PCR, was carried out.

ork is relevant because it is the first, rapid real-time PCR method developed to date for the detection of fish in processed food products.

sults obtained confirm the present assay is a useful tool in detecting fish and, therefore, minimising exposure and reducing incidences of allergic reaction to fish in contaminated products.

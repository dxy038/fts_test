Hypoglycemia is dangerous and considered as a limiting factor of the glycemic control therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Nocturnal hypoglycemia is especially feared because early warning symptoms are unclear during sleep so an episode of hypoglycemia may lead to a fatal effect on patients. The main objective of this paper is to explore the correlation between hypoglycemia and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To do this, the EEG of five T1DM adolescents from an overnight insulin-induced study is analyzed by spectral analysis to extract four different parameters. We aim to explore the response of these parameters during the clamp study which includes three main phases of normal, hypoglycemia and recovery. We also look at data at the blood glucose level (BGL) of 3.3-3.9 mmol/l to find a threshold to distinguish between non-hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia states. The results show that extracted EEG parameters are highly correlated with patientsÂ´ conditions during the study. It is also shown that at the BGL of 3.3 mmol/l, responses to hypoglycemia in EEG signals start to significantly occur.

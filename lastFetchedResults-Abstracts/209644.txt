Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is accompanied with a higher incidence of cardiovascular disorders and
atherosclerosis. With regard to antidiabetic potential of derivatives of Allium latifolium (AL), the effect of oral
administration of this plant on the contractile reactivity of isolated aorta in diabetic rats was investigated during 6
weeks.
Objective: Survey the Effect of Feeding of Allium Latifolium on Contractile Reactivity of Aorta of Diabetic
rats.
Materials and Methods: In this study male wistar rats (0=32) were randomly divided into 4 groups, i.e. control,
At-treated control, diabetic, and At-treated diabetic groups. For induction of diabetes. streptozotocin (60
mglkg: i.p.) was used The treatment groups received oral administration of plant-mixed standard pelleted food
(6.25%) for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, contractile reactivity of aortic rings to KCI and nor adrenaline was
determined by using isolated tissue setup.
Results: Serum glucose level in diabetic group increased during 6 weeks after the experiment as compared with
one week before the study (p<O.OOl) AL treatment of diabetic rats showed a significant hypoglycemic effect
(p<O.OI). In addition, the latter group showed a lower contraction to KCI (P<O.05) and nor adrenaline (P<O.OI)
as compared with diabetic group. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference between control and ALtreated
control groups regarding contractile reactivity.
Conclusion: lise of Oral administration of AL tor (, weeks can attenuate the contractile responsiveness of the
vascular system and this may prevent the development of hypertension in diabetic rats.

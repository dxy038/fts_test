A method for controlling single-link lightweight flexible manipulators is proposed. The objective is to control the tip position of the flexible manipulator in the presence of joint friction and changes in payload. Both linear and nonlinear frictions are overcome by using a very robust control scheme for flexible manipulators. The control scheme is based on two nested feedback loops: an inner loop, to control the position of the motor, and an outer loop, to control the tip position. Compensation for changes in load is achieved by decoupling the dynamics of the system and then applying a very simple adaptive control for the tip position. This results in a simple control law that needs minimal computing effort and, thus, can be used for real-time control of the flexible arms.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

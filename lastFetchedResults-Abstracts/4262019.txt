Time/cost trade-offs problems in the project management is the important role. The project scheduling with the traditional approach does not consider the difference execution time on the unit period for all activities of project. In this paper, firstly, it presents an introduction of the problem description of time-switch constraints. Then, the project scheduling with time-switch constraints under the resource constraints is proposed. Time/cost trade-offs problems, it takes the Max-NPV as the objective function. Moreover, we build the mathematic model about the TCTPTSC from the view of the contractor. Finally, it validates by adopting a numerical example. The results show that time-switch constraints can change the arrangements for project scheduling more closely to realistic situation, with the view real returns by the NPV(Net present value), so the contractor can carry out accurate decision-making and project control.

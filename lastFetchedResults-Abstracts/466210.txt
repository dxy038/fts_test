Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether a short interpregnancy interval is associated with uterine scar failure in laboring patients with previous low transverse cesarean delivery. Study Design: This was a case-control study of uterine scar failures among laboring patients with previous low transverse cesarean delivery. Control patients underwent abdominal delivery during labor after failure of an attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery in the same month as case patients. Results: An interpregnancy interval of <6 months was significantly more prevalent among case patients with uterine scar failure (P = .02). Mean interpregnancy interval was less in all cases of uterine scar failure (P = .06). Conclusions: Interpregnancy interval was inversely associated with likelihood of uterine scar failure during subsequent labor. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:1180-3.)

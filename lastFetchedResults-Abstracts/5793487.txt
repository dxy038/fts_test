Microstrip antennas have many applications in various communicational systems. To meet the requirement of miniaturization of the carry-home equipments, a novel spiral microstrip antenna is, described. The new design is made on conventional microstrip spiral antenna, and the dimension of the antenna is reduced nearly 40% compared with the conventional spiral antenna. Furthermore, the new designed antenna has a bidirectional radiation pattern because of the small ground plate below the bottom of the substrate.The configuration of the antenna is simple and easy to fabricate. Details of the proposed antenna design and simulation results were presented and discussed. The simulation results show the validity of the design.

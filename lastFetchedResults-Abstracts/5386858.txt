Delivery of advanced telecommunication-based services to the home requires the implementation of bidirectional communication in the access network, from and to the customer premises. In shared-medium access networks, e.g., hybrid fibre-coax and fibre-to-the-curb networks, the return path is shared by a large number of customers. Controlling access to such a network requires an access protocol. This paper describes a collision-free reservation protocol called Bit-Map, and analyses its performance. The results show that the protocol combines simplicity with good performance

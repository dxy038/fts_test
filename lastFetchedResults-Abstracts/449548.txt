Purpoe
To compare the wavefront aberration in pot-laer in itu keratomileui (LAIK) dry eye patient before and after punctal occluion.
Deign
Propective, comparative, nonrandomized tudy.
Method
Wavefront aberrometry wa performed on 16 eye of eight patient with dry eye after LAIK urgery. Wavefront meaurement were taken before and 1 month after punctal plug placement and compared with 10 eye of pot-LAIK patient without clinically dry eye meaured twice 1 month apart. tudent t tet were ued to ae the tatitical ignificance of difference between pre- and pot-punctal plug meaurement.
Reult
Punctal occluion in the pot-LAIK dry eye patient ignificantly reduced total, lower, and higher order wavefront aberration by 47% to 63% (P < .01). Among higher-order aberration, there were ignificant reduction in coma and pherical aberration but not in trefoil, after punctal occluion. The reduction of wavefront aberration by punctal occluion in pot-LAIK dry eye patient reulted in a ignificant improvement in quantitative viual acuity aeed uing an Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy tudy chart and in ubjective qualitative viion, confirmed by convolutional analyi uing image imulation. No tatitically ignificant difference in any of thee metric were found in the pot-LAIK control group without clinically dry eye meaured twice at a imilar time interval.
Concluion
Wavefront aberrometry provide a ueful, objective aement of pot-LAIK dry eye patient before and after punctal plug placement. Aggreive treatment of dry eye may be important before obtaining wavefront meaurement that erve a the bai for planning refractive corneal laer treatment and retreatment.

The introduction of 3rd generation networks poses new problems to the integration of existing and emerging technologies. At the same time, it will bring about an opportunity for a much sought-after service unification. The new 3G system will create a new &#8220;technological centre of gravity&#8221; and is likely to function as an aggregator towards service convergence and network integration. Major changes in current architectures will impact the local loop and wireless access, while core networks may undergo a significant shift from circuit to packet switched paradigms. Technology stemming from both the IT and telecommunication worlds will continue to drive the evolution of access, core and service environments. Within this context, operators and service providers will need to plan evolutionary scenarios for their networks and service platforms in order to meet service requirements. Evaluation methods based on objective criteria will assist service convergence design both across networks and through evolutionary states. This paper describes such a method

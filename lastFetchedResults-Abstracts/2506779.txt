Â Objective :  The major objective of this study was to determine the means and 95% confidence interval of normal 6 years old children&apos;s motor-verbal skills. Based on the results of this study we could develop a measure to diagnose abnormal motor skills. In addition, in this follow-up study, we compared the first-graders&apos; motor-verbal skills to their own skills one year earlier. Method: In this follow-up study, the development of motor-verbal skills was studied in 220 normal readers in the first-grade after 1 year. We administered naming speed test and word and phrase repetition to assess motor-verbal skills. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistic and paired t-test. Results: The mean of the 6 years old first-graders&apos; speed naming was 87 words per 100 second. In addition, means and standard deviations of word and phrase repetition were 8.41(2.92) and 6.51(1.73) respectively. In addition,, paired t-test showed a significant difference between naming speed, word and phrase repetition first-grade and 5 years old children score(naming speed: t=10.95, p<0.001, word repetition: t= 14.23, p<0.001, phrase repetition: t=12.11, p<0.001) . Conclusion:In general, 5 years old children&apos;s motor-verbal skills significantly improved after one year. Furthermore, the results of this study provide the norm for speech and language pathologists and other professionals. It is important to note that if 5 years old children&apos;s motor-verbal skills are under this norm, it will be anticipated that they are at the risk of literacy problem and dyslexia.

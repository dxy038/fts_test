We report the case of a 65-year-old male who developed an oropharyngeal carcinoma, an oesophageal carcinoma and two primary bronchial carcinomas in combination with a renal cell carcinoma as an additional primary entity. By means of an aggressive diagnostic regimen including radiological and nuclear imaging techniques all carcinomas were detected early and could be treated with curative intention.

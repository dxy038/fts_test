A paper moisture conditioning system has been designed and developed to prepare different moisture level samples for voltage response measurement. The moisture conditioning system has good moisture level predetermining ability. The moisture conditioned samples and the artificially aged samples are tested with the voltage response techniques: decay voltage and return voltage measurement (single cycle). The objective was to see if we could use decay voltage measurement and return voltage measurement to separately investigate the moisture and ageing in the oil impregnated paper insulation. Results from these measurements are presented and discussed in the paper.

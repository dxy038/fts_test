Objective:  The objective of this investigation was to carry out residual mercury (Hg) determinations and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) analysis of used amalgam capsules.

Methods: For residual Hg analysis, 25 capsules (20 capsules for one brand) from each of 10 different brands of amalgam were analyzed. Total residual Hg levels per capsule were determined using United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Method 7471. For TCLP analysis, 25 amalgam capsules for each of 10 brands were extracted using a modification of USEPA Method 1311. Hg analysis of the TCLP extracts was done with USEPA Method 7470A. Analysis of silver (Ag) concentrations in the TCLP extract was done with USEPA Method 6010B.

Results: Analysis of the residual Hg data resulted in the segregation of brands into three groups: Dispersalloy™ capsules, Group A, retained the most Hg (1.225 mg/capsule). These capsules were the only ones to include a pestle. Group B capsules, Valliant PhD™, Optaloy™ II, Megalloy™ and Valliant Snap Set™, retained the next highest amount of Hg (0.534–0.770 mg/capsule), and were characterized by a groove in the inside of the capsule. Group C, Tytin™ regular set double-spill, Tytin FC™, Contour™, Sybraloy™ regular set, and Tytin™ regular set single-spill retained the least amount of Hg (0.125–0.266 mg/capsule). TCLP analysis of the triturated capsules showed Sybraloy™ and Contour™ leached Hg at greater than the 0.2 mg/l Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) limit.

Significance: This study demonstrated that residual mercury may be related to capsule design features and that TCLP extracts from these capsules could, in some brands, exceed RCRA Hg limits, making their disposal problematic. At current RCRA limits, the leaching of Ag is not a problem.

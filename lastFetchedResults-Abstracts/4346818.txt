There are many objectives in location-routing problem of reverse logistics, which are helpful to improve practicability of reverse logistics. In this paper, a multi-objective programming model about location-routing of reverse logistics is proposed, and grey relational analysis and particle swarm optimization are combined to resolve it. The results of example show that the model and multi-objective algorithm are effective for dealing with multi-objective location-routing problem of reverse logistics.

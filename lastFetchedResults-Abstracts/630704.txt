Sensitivity to subtle cues regarding the emotions that others are experiencing is vital for effective interactions in social
situations. The ‘‘Eyes Test’’ has been proposed, and utilized, as a measure of mild social impairment amongst adults. In this
paper we consider the nature of this impairment and identify some limitations in the use of the Eyes Test as a measure of
perceiver sensitivity to the psychological state of others. In addition, 25 participants completed the ‘‘Eyes Test’’ in the
absence of the stimulus photograph. For over half of the items, participants selected the correct item. Implications for the
Eyes Test and measurement of social impairment are considered. In summary, we advocate that future tests of social
impairment use targets for which the affective state is known, use objective accuracy criterion, bear in mind the
differentiation between genuine and posed expressions of emotion, and consider of the impact of contextual factors.

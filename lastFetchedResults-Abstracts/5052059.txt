The objective of this paper is to present an innovative technique for the extraction of the electromagnetic dispersion of civil engineering materials using GPR. This technique is based on a coupling between modified forms of the two-dimensional Fourier transform and a method for the quality factor estimation. It allows identifying the material dispersion phenomena as a variation of the complex permittivity in function of frequency. For each method, an analytical validation is first carried out on simulated propagation signals (generated from one of the JonscherÂ´s model variants). Second, the radar data collected with the Wide-Angle Reflection and Refraction (WARR) multi-offset geometry were used for experimental validation on limestone and concrete slabs. The complex permittivity obtained by this &#8220;inter-method coupling&#8221; was compared with that obtained by the semi-destructive measurements using a cylindrical transmission line which is considered as the reference.

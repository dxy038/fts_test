Introduction & Objective : Today use of drugs with few side effects such as post operative nausea and vomiting and high recovery rate is highly important. The present study seeks to investigate the simultaneous use of alfentanil and propofol in comparison with the common use of morphine sodium thiopental in reducing the rate of nausea and vomiting after appendectomy and during recovery.
Materials & Methods: This study was carried out in a setting of double blinded randomized clinical trial from 1378 to 1381. Forty two patients, candidated for emergency appendectomy in class ASA I, under general anesthesia, were chosen and randomly divided into two groups. The first group patients were injected alfentanil (10pglkg) and propofol (2mg/kg thenl00 lag/kg/min) and the other group received Morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and Sodium Thiopental (5mg/kg) intravenously for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Then post operative nausea, vomiting and recovery time were recorded. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate were also measured before and after 5 minutes following induction of anesthesia and in recovery room.
Results: 9.5 percent of morphine-thiopental group and all the patients in alfentanil-aropofol group had post operative nausea and vomiting (p>0.05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 5 minutes after induction and pulse rate after 5 minutes after induction in morphine-thiopental group was greater than that in alfentanil group.
Conclusion: The combination of propofol and alfentanil required less recovery time and homodynamic change after induction of general anesthesia and turned out to be useful for short term operations.

Currently, functional treatment of fracture non-unions and bone loss remains a significant challenge in the field of orthopaedic surgery. Tissue engineering of bone has emerged as a new treatment alternative in bone repair and regeneration. Our approach is to combine a polymeric matrix with a cellular vehicle for delivery of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), constructed through retroviral gene transfer. The objective of this study is to develop an osteoinductive, tissue-engineered bone replacement system by culturing BMP-2-producing cells on an osteoconductive, biodegradable, polymeric-ceramic matrix. The hypothesis is that retroviral gene transfer can be used effectively in combination with a biodegradable matrix to promote bone formation. First, we examined the in vitro attachment and growth of transfected BMP-producing cells on a PLAGAâ€“HA scaffold. Second, the bioactivity of the produced BMP in vitro was evaluated using a mouse model. It was found that the polymer-ceramic scaffold supported BMP-2 production, allowing the attachment and growth of retroviral transfected, BMP-2-producing cells. In vivo, the scaffold successfully functioned as a delivery vehicle for bioactive BMP-2, as it induced heterotopic bone formation in a SCID mouse model.

A new method based on genetic algorithm to evolve fuzzy rules is proposed for security robots. We constitute kinematics model of the actual robot, and use integer coding to design effective chromosome, multi-objective optimization of fitness is also designed. After the fuzzy rules are evolved in the simulation environment, they are transplanted to the hardware of security robot. Experiment results prove the method is correct and feasible.

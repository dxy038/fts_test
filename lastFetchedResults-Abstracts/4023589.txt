Proper installation of flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) in existing transmission networks can improve transmission system loading margin (LM) to a certain degree and reduce network expansion cost. In the paper, under each contingency with high risk index (RI) value, the modal analysis (MA) technique is used to determine which buses need static var compensator (SVC) installation, and with maximum LM and minimum SVC installation cost composed into the multi-objective function the optimal LM enhancement problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) and solved by using the fitness sharing multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm for a Pareto front set. In the Pareto front set for each considered contingency, the solution with the biggest performance index value is determined for SVC installation. Finally, an SVC installation scheme derived from the union of the SVC installations for all considered contingencies is recommended for LM enhancement. The proposed method is validated on the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system (RTS) and a practical power system.

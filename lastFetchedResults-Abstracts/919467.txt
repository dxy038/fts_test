Ground waters in geothermal regions contain arsenic concentrations that exceed the recommended drinking water standards. In addition, when these regions have agricultural activities, the waters also contain high levels of nitrates and phosphates. These contaminants can be removed from the water with the use of filters containing zero valent iron (ZVI). The objective of this study was to model the removal of arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)) by ZVI and to model the effect of competing ions (phosphate and nitrate) on arsenate removal. Arsenic immobilization by ZVI columns was simulated by the HM-1D chemical transport and speciation model and an one-dimensional analytical solution model. Laboratory column studies were conducted in order to obtain representative experimental data for simulation with both models. Arsenic speciation and the presence of competing ions greatly affect arsenic removal by ZVI. Most arsenic is precipitated/co-precipitated on ZVI and on the corrosion products formed on ZVI. The simulations suggested that As(V) process parameters are higher than the As(III) parameters and that they are affected by the presence of nitrates and phosphates in the system. Such models can be used to design treatment units by incorporating the impact of nitrates and phosphates in the removal of arsenic by ZVI as well as the impact of temperature on the process.

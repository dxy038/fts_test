Background: Since preterm delivery is an important problem in obstetrics, it is necessary to know the risk factors. Periodontal disease is an infectious disease and infection is risk factor for preterm delivery. Respecting to the mechanisms of preterm delivery and because involved mediators in this procedure are synthesized in periodontal disease, gum disease is investigated as risk factor for preterm delivery. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association between preterm, low birth weight with periodontal diseases to improve the mothers’ and the children’s health. Materials and Methods: This cases-control study was done on 70 women (mean age 25.01 yrs.) 35 women with preterm delivery, gestational age  < 37 weeks and birth weight  < 2500 gr as case group and 35 women with term delivery, gestational age  > 37 weeks and birth weight  > 2500 gr as control group referring to Imam Reza Hospital. Mean Probing Depth (MPD), percent of sites with more than 3 mm in probing, bleeding Index (BI), Plaque Index (PI), and Extent and Severity Index (Ext. and Sev.) were measured using a mirror and a standard William's periodontal probe. Results: Significant difference was found in Mean Probing Deep (MPD), percentage of sites with more than 3 mm in probing, BI, PI, Ext. and Sev. indices in case and control groups. There was no significant difference in patient’s job, age, education, and husband’s job and education. No difference was observed between two groups in monthly income and gravidity. Conclusion: Gum disease can be a risk factor for preterm delivery.

Novel phage-piezoelectric sensor was constructed for rapid drug susceptibility testing based on the proposed method of phage amplified multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal sensor (PA-MSPQC) for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and criterion of resistant strains by CLSI. Under the condition of anti-TB drugs, the resistant M. tuberculosis survived, but the sensitive strains can be killed. According to the criterion of resistant strains by CLSI, the 105 cfu of strains with frequency shift less than 121 Hz were resistant to rifampin, isoniazid and ethambutol, 92 Hz to streptomycin. The sensitivity and specificity of 557 strains drug susceptibility test by proposed methods are 91% and 93%, respectively, compared with the mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) method. But the turnaround time of proposed method is no more than 35 h, far less than that of MGIT 960 methods. It will find application in clinical test.

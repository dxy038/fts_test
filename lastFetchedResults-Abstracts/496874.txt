Background and Objective: Discovery of leptin has led to numerous experiments for better understand of its function, and many of these studies have focused on leptinâ€™s response to both acute exercise and exercise training. The aim of this research was the investigation of acute effects of an aerobic exhaustive incremental exercise session on serum leptin and plasma lipids in trained men 19-26 years old.
Subjects and Methods: Voluntary twenty four trained divided into trained (12 subjects) and control (12 subjects) groups, randomly. Exercise session includes Astrand exhaustive incremental test on treadmill which have been done between 8-10 am. Blood sampling gathered pretest, post test and 9 hours after training. For data analysis we have employed two way repeated measures ANOVA, paired T-Test and Pearson correlation coefficient using SPSS software, version 15.
Results: Results demonstrated serum leptin immediately increase after training in control group but this change statistically was not significant (p  >  0.05). Plasma LDL-c and total cholesterol significantly increase immediately after training in pretest values (p  >  0.033). Significantly negative correlation was found between serum leptin immediately after test and pretest plasma LDL-c in trained group (r =-0.65, p > 0.022). In general, there are not any significant differences between two control and trained groups in any measured blood factors during three bouts measurement.
Conclusion: An aerobic exhaustive incremental exercise session statistically has not acute effect on serum leptin in trained men 19-26 years old.

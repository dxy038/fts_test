With exceptional features and a long life, the UltraC ap acitor (UC), can arguably sustain the battery (main source of energy). It also is a necessary complement in electric cars. This article discusses the management of energy between the various components of an electric vehicle based on a traction machine designed around a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM). The proposed design uses a DC/DC bidirectional Dual Active Bridge (DAB) with a High Frequency Transformer (HFT), except for the isolation. The HFT allows the adaptation of the voltage of the UC to the DC Bus. The number of UC cells in series will be limited what keeps a high value of equivalent capacity and low Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR). In addition, it facilitates the balancing of the voltages across the different cells. Continuous bus directly connected to the battery can provide continuous power to the PMSM. The UC temporarily stores energy recovered during braking or deceleration for any use covering peaks of power demand during acceleration and starts. Thus, it relieves the battery, extends its life and allows the improvement the overall performance of the electric vehicle.

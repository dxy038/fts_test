Different types of models have been introduced and utilized to analyze the AIDS dynamics. Combining the properties of previous basic models, in this paper, a new model of infection is proposed. It is assumed that HAART is available for treatment of AIDS. Amount of drug usage and the quality of treatment, are defined as two objectives of a bi-objective optimization problem, and NSGA-II is used to solve this problem. Pareto frontier, resulted from the optimization process, suggests a set of treatment strategies, which all are optimal from a perspective, and can be used in different medical and economical situations.

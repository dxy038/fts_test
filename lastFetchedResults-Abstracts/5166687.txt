The memory subsystem is a major contributor to the performance, power, and area of complex SoCs used in feature rich multimedia products. Hence, memory architecture of the embedded DSP is complex and usually custom designed with multiple banks of single-ported or dual ported on-chip scratch pad memory and multiple banks of off-chip memory. Building software for such large complex memories with many of the software components as individually optimized software IPs is a big challenge. In order to obtain good performance and a reduction in memory stalls, the data buffers of the application need to be placed carefully in different types of memory. In this paper we present a unified framework (MODLEX) that combines different data layout optimizations to address the complex DSP memory architectures. Our method models the data layout problem as multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) with performance and power being the objectives and presents a set of solution points which is attractive from a platform design viewpoint. While most of the work in the literature assumes that performance and power are non-conflicting objectives, our work demonstrates that there is significant trade-off (up to 70%) that is possible between power and performance.

A novel and reliable densitometric approach to the calculation of LVEDV and LVESV in 30/sup 0/-RAO single-plane digital ventriculography is presented implementing a correction algorithm from the analysis of regression. Densitometry (DENS) is compared with the area-length-method (ALM). Both methods correlated significantly with true values. Non-corrected DENS underestimated systematically true values but improved after algorithmic correction without systematic deviations, whereas ALM overestimated true values. Comparisons of DENS and ALM for left ventricular volumes in patients improved for corrected LV-volumes /spl les/200 ml without systematic densitometric underestimation. The presented data indicate that corrected densitometric estimation of left ventricular volumes offers the potential for an objective and reliable analysis in digital on-line left ventriculography.

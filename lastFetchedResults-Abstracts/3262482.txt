This paper discusses the impact of the bidirectional diode parameters on the read failures in 1ReRAM 1Diode (1D1R) crossbar array memory architectures. Our studies show that while a diode is integral for the successful read operation, the maximum achievable crossbar memory capacity is a strong function of the reverse saturation current of the diode. An acceptable reverse saturation current target for diodes should be 0.1 A/cm<sup>2</sup> for 10 nm &#215; 10 nm ReRAM cell for high density memory. For multi-level-cell (MLC) operation, read failure for multiple high resistance states is limited by the reverse saturation current of diode while the line resistance of crossbar arrays plays significant role for read failure of multiple low resistance states.

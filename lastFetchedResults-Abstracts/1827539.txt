Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, heterogeneous disorder of uncertain etiology with strong genetic background. Insulin resistance is present in the majority of PCOS cases with linkage and association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of insulin receptor (INSR) gene and PCOS.
Objective: To examine whether the exon 17 of INSR gene contributes to genetic susceptibility to PCOS in Iraqi women and its effects on glucose tolerance test and lipid profile.
Materials and Methods: Sixty-five healthy Iraqi women and eighty-four infertile women with PCOS, divided into two subgroups depending on the BMI were studied. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP-PCR) analysis was performed to determine the genotypes for the His 1058 C/T polymorphism at the tyrosine kinase domain in the INSR gene. Clinical, anthropometric and biochemical parameters were also estimated.
Results: The C/T polymorphism at His 1058 in exon 17 of INSR was associated with PCOS (obese and non-obese). CC genotype frequency was higher in PCOS patients whereas TT genotype was higher in control women. Those with CC genotype had higher BMI, GTT and lipid profile than those with TT genotype.
Conclusion: An association of C/T polymorphism at His1058 of INSR with PCOS in Iraqi women was observed. Its association with indices of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia were also noticed.

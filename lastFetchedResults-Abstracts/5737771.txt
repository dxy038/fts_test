In this paper, a new radius based clustering algorithm is proposed. Its main objective is to map the distributions of the data by utilising the premise that clusters are determined by a distance parameter, without any specification of the number of clusters. The proposed clustering algorithm is enhanced by a reliable validity index to choose the best clustering result for the given input parameter. Additionally, the proposed clustering algorithm is enhanced with a partial supervision strategy to act as a classifier.

The present paper presents the technological solution dedicated to the implementation of the K-complex detection algorithm, from the EEG medical signals, with the help of the TMS320C6211B signal processor, produced by Texas Instruments. This application is based on the host-target system architecture, where the target is the DSK (Digital Starter Kit), which performs realtime processing and is transmitted from the software host on the processing computer. The host software is written in G, Labview programming language, and has the objective of achieving an automated detector for the K complex, derived from the sleep electroencephalogram. The K complex detection automatization must establish a verification criterion and a prediction criterion.

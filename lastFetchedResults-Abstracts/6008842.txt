We consider the capacitated vehicle routing problem that determines the routes of vehicles in such a way that each customer can be visited exactly once by one vehicle, starting and terminating at the depot while the vehicle capacity and the travel time constraints must be satisfied. The objective is to minimize the total traveling cost. Due to the complexity of the problem, we suggest a tabu search algorithm that combines the features of the exiting local search heuristics. In particular, our tabu search algorithm incorporates the method to reduce the neighborhoods using the proximity information of the Voronoi diagram corresponding to each problem instance. Computational experiments are done on the benchmark problems and the test results are reported.

In order to overcome the disadvantages of conventional optimization methods, a real-time feedback optimization method combined with fuzzy logical control and adaptive numerical simulation was proposed. Using fuzzy logical controller and defect control rules, development trend of forming defect was discovered and fed back to simulation software program in real time during the numerical simulation process, then the process parameters were adjusted to avoid occurrence of forming defect, the optimized forming loading path was obtained ultimately. Study results indicated that the hydroforming quality of T-shaped tube was improved under fuzzy logical control optimized loading path, fuzzy logical controlled optimization achieved prospective objective, and the optimization process can lead to better forming quality.

We consider the Type-I assembly line balancing problem (ALBP-I), in which the objective is to minimize the number of workstations needed for a given cycle time. In practice, it is also important that the workload among workstations should be well balanced. The purpose of this study is to develop an optimal algorithm, based on the shortest route algorithm proposed by Gutjahr and Nemhauser in [Management Science 11 (2) (1964) 308-315], that not only minimizes the number of workstations needed, but also optimizes the workload balance among workstations.

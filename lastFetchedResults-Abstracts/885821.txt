A new iterative procedure for the numerical solution of constrained minimization problems within the framework of the sequential minimization method is presented. The method allows the construction of strictly convex objective functionals and provides the global convergence on a correctness set. The proposed procedure utilizes the contraction property of a map resulted from applying the sequential minimization method to an original inverse problem. The feasibility of the iterative procedure is demonstrated in computational experiments with a model inverse problem of magnetotelluric sounding of layered media.

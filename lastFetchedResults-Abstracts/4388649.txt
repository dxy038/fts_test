This paper presents a simple fault detection method and fault-tolerant strategy based on the model predictive control theory. The proposed fault detection method can detect and locate a failed switch with current error signals dedicated to each switch, based on the position of space vectors. Following the fault detection, the proposed fault-tolerant control strategies are developed to produce three-phase balanced sinusoidal output voltages/currents with only normally functioning bidirectional switches. Therefore, the developed control technique for the matrix converter can preserve continuous operation even after the failure of switches and improve reliability of the drives. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the applied detection and control strategy.

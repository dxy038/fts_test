This is a story of physician who was one of the world's greatest short story writers. Anton Pavlovich Chekhov successfully performed dual careers of writing and practicing medicine during a short but productive life. Many biographers overlook Dr Chekhov's role, although his medical training and practice flowed over into his writing, influencing both his subject matter and his style. His stories and plays reveal the insights that Dr Chekhov discovered about the human psyche at work, thus delving into psychosomatic medicine nearly 50 years before its time. Despite orders to stop practicing medicine because of his own deteriorating health, Chekhov devoted himself further to the study of medicine, publishing a landmark study in social medicine that advocated reform of the Russian penal system. Meanwhile, his fictional works earned him the coveted Pushkin prize for the best literary work of the year in 1888. Shortly after celebrating his third wedding anniversary to actress Olga Knipper, Anton Chekhov died at age 44, victim of a nearly lifelong battle with tuberculosis.

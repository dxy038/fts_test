Objective: Our purpose was to determine whether the same maternal glycemic control is necessary to achieve similar perinatal outcomes for type 1 as for type 2 diabetics. Study Design: The subjects were all women with pregestational diabetes mellitus delivered of live-born singletons. Glycemic control was achieved with diet and insulin. Self-monitoring of blood glucose was performed before meals and at bedtime. Target glucose values were 60 to 90 mg/dl fasting and 60 to 105 mg/dl at other times. Results: Of 60,628 deliveries, 46 type 1 and 113 type 2 diabetic women met inclusion criteria. Respective differences were found between type 1 and type 2 diabetics in average daily glucose levels (112 mg/dl vs 97 mg/dl, p< 0.001), percent of values within target ranges (35% vs 57%, p< 0.001), and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (48.1 mg/dl vs 24.9 mg/dl, p< 0.001). At least one daily glucose value was <50 mg/dl during 19% of observation days for type 1 vs 2% of observation days for type 2 pregnancies (p< 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetic pregnancies in neonatal macrosomia (30% vs 34%), proportion of cesarean deliveries during labor for arrest disorders (67% vs 69%), shoulder dystocia (2% vs 6%), and neonatal hypoglycemia (18% vs 26%). Conclusions: Less stringent maternal glycemic control may permit comparable maternal and neonatal outcomes for type 1 compared with type 2 diabetics. Higher target values for type 1 diabetics may decrease the frequency of maternal hypoglycemic episodes.

The motivation and objective for this paper is to demonstrate "personal high performance computing (PHPC)", which requires only a smaller number of computers, resources and space in the secure wireless home networking (WHN) environment. The PHPC is based on a cluster of the 64-bit AMD machines, which can achieve the following: (a) reducing CPU time by 10%-50% for a single task; (b) minimizing the memory and hard-disk workload by 50%; (c) running 64-bit software applications successfully; (d) receiving up to 60% better performance in multi-tasking performance; (e) executing fast, robust and accurate calculations, visualization and server-side applications on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and Linux; (f) ensuring a secure working environment (g) storing a massive amount of data (12 TB, or 12,000 GB) for database and server applications; and (h) successfully integrating with other emerging technologies such as LAN/wireless networks and entertainment systems

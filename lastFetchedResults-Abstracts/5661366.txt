The authors deal with a new channel access scheme for ring LANs, referred to as the self-token protocol. They describe the basic operation of the protocol, priority transmission and the packet error detection/recovery method. The performance of the protocol was evaluated by using computer simulation. It was shown to have superior characteristics by combining the merits of the multiple-token and the register insertion channel access methods. Asynchronous and synchronous communications and a bidirectional ring for realizing high-speed and multi-media-oriented LANs are discussed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

<div><div><p>Patients with malignancy are at higher risk of thrombotic complications due to the hypercoagulability state. Our objective in this study was to assess the serum concentrations of Homocysteine, anti phospholipid antibodies, and anti cardiolipin in patients with benign and malignant breast tumors and study the effect of chemotherapy on the serum levels of these markers. A case control study was carried out on 100 women with malignant breast tumor and 100 age matched control with benign breast tumors.Serum concentrations of heomocystein, anti cardiolipin antibody (IgG and IgMaCL) and anti-phospholipid antibody (IgG and IgMaPL) were measured in all cases. The malignant group was followed for six months, and serum levels of abovementioned markers were measured again after surgical removal of breast tumor and chemotherapy. Current results showed a significantly higher serum concentration of Homocysteine, IgG and IgMaPL, IgG and IgM aCL in patients with malignant tumor before chemotherapy compared with benign tumor patients. We found a significant decrease in these markers after chemotherapy (<em>P </em>Value&lt;0.05).We propose performing these tests (Homocysteine, IgG and IgM aPL, aCL) in patients with breast malignancy and starting prophylactic anti-thrombotic treatment in those with high serum levels of the markers. In addition, since the serum levels of the markers in patients with malignancy reduce after adjuvant therapies, we strongly recommend using adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients.</p></div></div>

Integrating the feature of the mission and mission region of the multiple robots, taking the total rewards of the group of robots, movement nonholonomic constraints and the survival probability of the threatening area and the collision avoidance between robots into account, a reasonable objective function and constrains are formulated. Cooperative Receding Horizon Control Strategy (CRH) and Genetic Algorithm are applied to solve the optimal control law to maximize the objective function and meet the needs of constraints. Numerical simulation illustrates every target in the mission region is visited by robots and proves the validity of the proposed CRH path planning methods.

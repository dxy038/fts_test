Resource allocation is used to allocate the available resources in an economical way in developing software system. Resource allocation problem occurs due to assigning available resources in inefficient manner. Before this in modular software resources are allocated on the basis of module priority. In this paper, we investigate an optimal resource algorithm to minimize the cost of software, time, personal etc. This investigated algorithm works on the duration of the module and its activities duration. The key objective of using this algorithm in the field of resource allocation is its capability to give optimal results and achieve the reliability and timeliness.

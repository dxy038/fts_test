Based on the technological evolution of data processing, mainly the capacity of processing and storage, a new research field has emerged, called Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD). Data mining (DM) is the essential and important step in the process of KDD with the goal of extracting high-level knowledge from low-level data. Unstructured DM or Text Mining is an essential part of discovering previously unknown patterns useful for particular purposes from textual data bases. The objective of this paper is to present a Labor- related Judicial application of Unstructured Data Mining techniques using probabilistic methodologies, linear regression and Rule Induction in Text Categorization, as well as an Expert System.

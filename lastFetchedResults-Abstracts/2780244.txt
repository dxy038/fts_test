This letter proposes a bandwidth extension (BWE) method using the cepstral envelope coding and duplication of quantized wideband (WB) signals by means of analysis -by-synthesis (AbS) for super-wideband (SWB) coders. In the proposed method, a high frequency band is generated by utilizing the quantized cepstral coefficients extracted from the envelope and the quantized modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) shape of the wideband signal. The proposed method is compared with the latest G.718 SWB codec and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline codec both in subjective listening tests and objective performance measures.

Conventional methods used for solving greenhouse environment multi-objective conflict control problems may be more reasonable by adopting interval or region control objectives instead of point control objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel compatible control algorithm, and employ Multi-Objective Compatible Control (MOCC) strategy and an extant greenhouse model to achieve greenhouse climate control based on feedback control architecture. A series of simulations through various comparative studies are presented to validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the algorithm has a good robust and stability performance for greenhouse environment control. It can achieve high control precision and low energy cost for real-world engineering application in greenhouse production.

The objective of scheduling algorithms in wireless networks is to provide quality of service (QoS) for mobile users in a shared environment and at the same time utilize the system resources efficiently. We have introduced a notion of income maximization to increase throughput for multimedia wireless systems and to maintain the QoS for each user above an agreed level. We have proposed greedy and dynamic programming approaches to solve the optimization problem. The simulation results reveal that our scheduling algorithms provide high network throughput, support QoS even under heavy network loads, and generate high income for service provider.

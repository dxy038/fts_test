The objective of this study is to determine how grinding conditions affect the breakage rate with respect to the sample mass, major elements, and minerals present in siliceous goethitic (SG) nickel laterite. This information is helpful in determining the optimal grinding conditions for selective comminution and nickel upgrade. The kinetics of batch wet grinding of nickel laterites with feed sizes of 2.38–1.68, 1.68–1.18, 1.18–0.85, 0.85–0.6, 0.6–0.42, 0.42–0.3, 0.3–0.21, and 0.21–0.15 mm were determined using a Netzsch LME4 stirred mill under the following conditions: 1000 rpm, 50% charge volume, 150.0 g of solid. The grinding behaviour of the majority of the feed samples was non-first-order due to the fast breakage rate of soft minerals and the low breakage rate of hard minerals in the feed. Therefore, an enrichment of the soft mineral was obtained in the underscreen product by selective grinding. The effect of selective grinding on Ni upgrade was evaluated by looking at grinding time, feed size, and product size. Optimum grinding time with respect to Ni upgrade was 0.25 min for SG nickel laterite samples. Generally, grinding larger particles and/or collecting finer product size yielded better Ni upgrade results. The effect of selective grinding was evaluated by the changes of the major soft and hard minerals for the selected samples. Selective grinding was also examined with respect to the major element weight ratio (e.g. Si/Ni for SG nickel laterite). With respect to Ni upgrade, the best result was achieved from the 1.18–0.85 mm feed on the −400 mesh product after grinding for 0.25 min. The Ni grade increased from 0.73% to 1.30% (upgrade 76.8%), with 14.4% Ni recovery; the Mg grade increased from 1.30% to 3.96% (upgrade 205.6%); the Si grade decreased from 28.7% to 16.2%.

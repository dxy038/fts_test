We investigate the behavior of two users and one jammer in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with and without fading when they participate in a noncooperative zero-sum game, with the channelÂ´s input/output mutual information as the objective function. We assume that the jammer can eavesdrop on the channel and can use the information obtained to perform correlated jamming. We also differentiate between the availability of perfect and noisy information about the user signals at the jammer. Under various assumptions on the channel characteristics, and the extent of information available at the users and the jammer, we show the existence, or otherwise nonexistence of a simultaneously optimal set of strategies for the users and the jammer, and characterize those strategies whenever they exist.

Over more than 20 years BAE Systems Integrated System Technologies Ltd. (Insyte) in the UK have been participating in the innovative Multi-function Electronically Scanned Adaptive Radar (MESAR) Programme. This has led to the Engineering Development and first of class production contract for the Sampson radar which is to be fitted for the UK T45 Destroyer as part of the PAAMS weapon system. The MESAR programme, which was jointly funded by UK MoD and Insyte, began in 1982 and has resulted in two radar equipments. MESAR1 was an S-band prototype active array multifunction radar which took part in three trials programmes in the period 1989-1995. The MESAR1 programme pioneered the development of Tx/Rx modules, digital adaptive beamforming and real time radar, radar control all of which were successfully demonstrated in trials. MESAR2 is an S-band pre-production active array multifunction radar which began development in 1995 and subsequently undertook a 2 year trials programme at a UK MoD trials range at Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. The objective of MESAR2 was to demonstrate the application of MESAR technology to Ballistic Missile Defence. The programme extended and evolved the technology developed in ME SARI and conclusively proved

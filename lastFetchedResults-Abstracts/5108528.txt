Multihop packet radio networks require routing algorithms which are distributed in nature and which have the ability to timely detect changes in the network topology. These changes are mostly changes in connectivity caused by link or node failures and by the relative motion of the nodes. The paper describes and analyzes an adaptive decentralized routing algorithm for frequency-hopping spread-spectrum packet radio networks. Unlike most of the algorithms found in the open literature the one proposed can be used in networks having both uni- and bidirectional radio links. A detailed software simulation model has been built to investigate the performance of the algorithm. Examples are shown to illustrate the methodology

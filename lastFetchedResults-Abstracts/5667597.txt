The objective of this paper is present the data requirements for modeling power electronic devices to aid in modeling power converters for transient simulation studies. The presentation targets applications of power semiconductor devices commonly used in medium to high power applications: insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), thyristors (SCR), and gate turn-off thyristors (GTOs) and power diodes. The intended audience is power engineers modeling converters for transient simulations rather more than power converter designers. Low power, single-phase loads are beyond the scope of the presentation

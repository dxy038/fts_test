Background: Consequence analysis of toxic chemicals releases has important influence on emergency
response planning and reduction of fatalities.
Objective: To determine consequences of toxic chemicals releases in petrochemical feed and product
pipelines network.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed in Mahshahr Petrochemical Special Economic Zone
(Petrone, Iran) during 2006-2007. Initially, a total number of 60 pipelines were evaluated using the chemieal
exposure index and the most hazardous chemicals selected for further analysis. Later, the lethal concentrations
of chemicals were calculated by probit equation and local meteorological data assessed. In the end. the toxic
release dispersion modeling was performed using of areal location of hazardous atmospheric program, and the
fatal length for emergency response planning offered.
Findings: Butadiene pipeline showed the highest chemical exposure index value however, the chlorine
pipeline was found to have the most hazard distance based on life-threatening health effects of emergency
response planning guideline (ERPG-3). The LCI, LC50 & LC99 in F condition were about 703m, 413m and
248m, respectively.
Conclusion: Determination of hazard distance and emergency response planning for chlorine pipeline based
on LCI and in F condition will supply the lowest level of fatality and highest margin of safety in areas
adjaeent to petrochemical feed and product pipelines network

This paper describes a calculation framework for the simulation of systems being affected by parameter deviations. These unpredictable factors are described with the help of affine arithmetic noise symbols in the modeling domain. Methods for a semi-symbolic output signal calculation containing linear and nonlinear operators must be provided. For a nonlinear composition of two affine arithmetic forms an appropriate approximation algorithm is required. This can be implemented and selected dependent on the objective of the simulation. Additional functionalities for debugging and tracing of noise symbols can improve analysis properties of simulation results. In the following work an extended framework structure for affine arithmetic system simulations containing an application specific selection of necessary approximated forms and advanced noise symbol management methods is introduced.

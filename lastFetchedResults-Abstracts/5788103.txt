In this paper, we propose a real-time video motion activity transmission over Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system. An interchange of information between the application and physical layers is realized. In the application layer, a Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) measurement is used to estimate the variance between consecutive frames in the video sequence, which defines a threshold for Unequal Error Protection (UEP). In the physical layer, an Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (OSTBC) MIMO system with redundant antennas is used to exploit diversity gain using Antenna Selection (AS) at the transmitter side. The simulation results presented in this paper show that the transmission of video based in the motion activity detection per frame using the diversity scheme with AS is capable of improving the objective and subjective video quality at the end user.

IPTV services are attracting attention as an influential application of the next-generation network (NGN). Managing in-service communication quality based on users´ quality of experience (QoE) is very important for improving customer satisfaction. For this, an accurate and efficient quality- assessment technology is desired. This is called objective quality assessment and has been studied for a long time. However, there are hardly any studies on methods that can be applied to quality monitoring at a user´s premise. In this paper, we first overview the quality management approaches discussed in International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Next, we review available technologies from the viewpoint of the applicability to quality monitoring. Then, we propose a new objective quality-assessment approach to solve the problem current technologies have. To verify the validity of the new approach, we show a preliminary evaluation result of the proposed approach.

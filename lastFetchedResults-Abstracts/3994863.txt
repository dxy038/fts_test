Two techniques are presented to balance the filter capacitor voltages of a multipulse rectifier with the active injection operating on a variable-frequency supply. The active injector consists of a low-rated bidirectional switch that modifies the behavior of a 12-pulse rectifier at either low or high frequency, resulting in 24-pulse or multilevel pulse width modulation operation, respectively. The operation of the rectifier and the injector, the practical issues that unbalance the capacitor voltages, and the methods to correct this imbalance are explained together with experimental results obtained with a 4-kW prototype.

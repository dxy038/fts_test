The parameter estimation or identification problem, which frequently arises, while developing the mathematical models, may be formulated as a nonlinear global optimization problem. Here the objective is to find the set of parameters to minimize the function quantifying the goodness of the fit subject to the system dynamics. The mathematical model of the problem is often multimodal in nature and requires a suitable global optimization method for its solution. In the present study we show the application of a Modified Differential Evolution (MDE) for solving parameter estimation problem. We have considered two test cases. A comparison of numerical results with other algorithms shows the competence of MDE over basic DE and other methods.

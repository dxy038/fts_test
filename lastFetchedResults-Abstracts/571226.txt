Background and Objective: Inappropriate changes of lipid profile are associated with obesity and overweight and can increase the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 19 male students aged 19-25 years were selected as volunteers. First they were divided into two groups: active fasting (n=9) and passive fasting (n=10). Active fasting group performed 14 sessions of exercise training. Three sessions per week with an intensity of 50 to 75 percent heart rate reserve (HRR) for 45-60 minutes was performed. Blood sampling was done at four stages. Data were analyzed by GLM-Repeated Measures (ANOVA) at a significance level of p < 0.05.

Results: The effect of fasting with and without physical activity on anthropometric measures was not significantly different, but one-month fasting with physical activity decreased weight, BMI, WHR and percentage body fat (PBF). During the fasting, TG/HDL and TC/HDL ratios decreased in the active group and these values returned to initial levels at the end of fasting. Levels of TG, LDL and TG/HDL in fasting group without exercise slightly increased. The effect of fasting, both with and without exercise on resting heart rate, blood pressure, diastolic, systolic, mean arterial and myocardial oxygen cost was not significantly different.

Conclusion:  One-month fasting with regular physical activity reduces the weight, percent body fat, WHR and BMI and could prevent inappropriate changes of lipid profile and reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome.

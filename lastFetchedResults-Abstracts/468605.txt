Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between placental and umbilical cord nucleated red blood cell counts. Study Design: Eighty placentas and their matched umbilical cord blood samples were collected prospectively immediately after delivery. In vitro fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens were used to obtain placental tissue samples. Nucleated red blood cells were counted by both manual microscopy and flow cytometry. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon signed rank test and Spearman correlation. Results: The median nucleated red blood cell counts/100 white blood cell counts for manual microscopy in umbilical cord blood; placental samples were 7.5 and 3.0, respectively (P< .0001). The median nucleated red blood cell counts for flow cytometric determination in umbilical cord blood and placental samples were 11.3 and 8.6, respectively (P< .0001). The Spearman correlation between manually counted umbilical cord blood samples and the placental tissue specimens was 0.66 (P< .0001). The Spearman correlation between flow cytometrically counted umbilical cord blood nucleated red blood cell and nucleated red blood cell counts that were obtained from the placenta was statistically significant (r = 0.74, P< .0001). The Spearman correlation between manual microscopy and flow cytometry for umbilical cord samples and their matched placental tissue specimens were 0.80 and 0.58, respectively, with all probability values at <.0001. Conclusion: Previous studies have reported an association between acute and chronic hypoxia and elevated nucleated red blood cells. Our results indicate that in vitro placental nucleated red blood cell counts correlate with umbilical cord nucleated red blood cell counts and suggest that antenatal evaluation of fetal nucleated red blood cells could be achieved by placental fine-needle aspiration biopsy.

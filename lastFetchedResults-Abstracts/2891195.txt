The Objective of the paper is to reduce the harmonic order such as 5<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup>, 13<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, 19<sup>th</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup>. The triplen harmonic like 3<sup>rd</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, 21<sup>st</sup> are eliminated naturally by three phase inverter. The proposed waveform is symmetric so that all even order harmonics will be eliminated. In order to reduce lower order harmonics, differential evolution optimization technique is used to find the optimized firing angles. Using the optimized firing angle, an inverter firing circuit is designed and the FFT analysis is carried out. The analysis and simulation of the three phase inverter is done in MATLAB, Using the optimized firing angles obtained from the differential evolution.

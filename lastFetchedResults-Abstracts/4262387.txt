An 80386 PC-based simulation of an improved high-frequency resonant DC link inverter induction motor drive is presented. The resonant circuit was systematically analyzed to establish the criteria for initial current selection, and a new circuit was proposed to establish the bidirectional initial current. The current initialization scheme was modeled and simulated using PC-SIMNON. A three-phase 3 kW insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor (IGBT)-based 50 kHz resonant link inverter was constructed and successfully tested with an induction motor drive. The speed control system was implemented using two microprocessors: the TMS320C25 for computation and the Intel 80386 for monitoring and user interface. The simulation and experimental results show the superior operation of the improved resonant DC link inverter drive

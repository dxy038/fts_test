Many wireless sensor network applications require information about the geographic location of each sensor node. So, localization is an important challenge in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm with the objective of achieving better localization accuracy. Our algorithm have two phase, DV-distance is used to complete the ranging phase and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is used to complete the localization phase that viewed as an optimization problem. Simulation results show that our proposed approach can achieve higher accurate position estimation compared with related scheme.

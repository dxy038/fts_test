This paper describes a new multi-objective multi-constraint routing approach integrated in LAYGEN II, an analog integrated circuit (IC) layout generator based on template descriptions and evolutionary computation techniques. The approach gives special emphasis to the reusability of expert design knowledge and to the efficiency on retargeting operations. In order to increase the quality of routing solution, first, the placer processes the floorplan, automatically merging devices. Then, for routing, an optimization kernel is used, which consists of a modified version of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), NSGA-II, and uses a built-in evaluation engine. The automatic routing generation is detailed, and LAYGEN II is demonstrated for the layout generation of a typical analog circuit structure, and the results are successfully validated using the industrial grade verification Calibre&#174; tool.

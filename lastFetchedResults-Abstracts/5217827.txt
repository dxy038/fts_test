Differential evolution (DE) has recently proven to be an efficient method for optimizing real-valued multi-modal objective functions. Besides its good convergence properties and suitability for parallelization, DE´s main assets are its conceptual simplicity and ease of use. This paper describes several variants of DE and elaborates on the choice of DE´s control parameters, which corresponds to the application of fuzzy rules. Finally, the design of a howling removal unit with DE is described to provide a real-world example for DE´s applicability

Medical, psychological and sociological factors were related to laboratory values in an 80-year-old population encompassing 211 persons. 21% of the men and 17% of the women had elevated ESR. 36% had elevated blood glucose (7% had diabetes). 13% of the men and 7% of the women had anaemia. Persons with anaemia generally had a lower quality of life compared with non-anaemic persons. Low haemoglobin, elevated ESR and low serum iron were all associated with impaired subjective and objective health. There were no significant correlations between the laboratory data and psychological and social parameters. The survival over 5 years was significantly decreased for those with anaemia, elevated ESR, high white blood count, high blood glucose, low serum iron or deviating serum potassium

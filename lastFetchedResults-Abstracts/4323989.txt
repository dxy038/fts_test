The field of adaptive dynamic programming and its applications to control engineering problems has undergone rapid progress over the past few years. A new theory called &#8220;Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming&#8221; (for short, RADP) is developed for the design of robust optimal controllers for linear and nonlinear systems subject to both parametric and dynamic uncertainties. A central objective of this paper is to give a brief overview of our recent contributions to the development of the theory of RADP and to outline its potential applications in engineering and biology.

A uniform routing architecture is presented, which offers CLB, IOB and IP Cores an identical routing resource. At the same time, some method is adopted to optimize routing performance. With all unidirectional segmented lines and long lines with inserted tap buffers, this architecture is up to 9.8% faster compared with long lines without inserted buffers and on average 14.9% over bidirectional lines. Simulation results demonstrate our idea.

Objective: The anatomic and functional success of suspension of the vaginal cuff to the proximal uterosacral ligaments is described. Study Design: Forty-six women underwent vaginal site-specific repair of endopelvic fascia defects with suspension of the vaginal cuff to the proximal uterosacral ligaments for pelvic organ prolapse. Outcome measures included operative complications, pelvic organ prolapse quantitation, and assessment of pelvic floor symptoms. Results: After a median follow-up of 15.5 months (range, 3.5 monthsâ€“3.4 years), 90% of patients had both resolution of vaginal bulging or prolapse symptoms and improvement of the stage of prolapse. There were improvements in all pelvic organ prolapse quantitation measurements except for total vaginal length, for which the median decrease was 0.75 cm. Intraoperatively, ureteral occlusion was noted in 11% (5/46) of patients with universal cystoscopy. In 3 patients the uterosacral suspension sutures were removed and replaced with resolution of the occlusion and in 2 patients ureteral reimplantation was required. Symptomatic prolapse (2 apical segment, 1 anterior, and 1 posterior) developed in 4 patients (10%), and 3 of them underwent reoperation. There were significant improvements in symptoms of bulging and pressure, voiding dysfunction, and vaginal and perineal splinting. Conclusion: Suspension of the vaginal vault to the proximal uterosacral ligaments combined with site-specific repair of endopelvic fascia defects provides excellent anatomic and functional correction of pelvic organ prolapse in most women. The risk of ureteral injury with this technique makes intraoperative cystoscopy essential. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:1402-11.)

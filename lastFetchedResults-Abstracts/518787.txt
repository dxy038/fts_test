Background: Marital relationship among some infertile women is subject to increased vulnerability affecting their quality of life.

Objective: Investigating the relationship between psychosocial factors and marital satisfaction in infertile women

Methods: In this cross-sectional study 125 women with primary infertility who entered an IUI program were selected using purposive sampling. All participants filled out a questionnaire containing personal information, diagnostic, and treatment history. They were also subjected to psychological tests including Spiel Berger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory test, Marital Satisfaction Scale test, Self-esteem Inventory t test, and Cassidy Social Support Inventory test. Descriptive statistical test and Pearson correlation were used for statistical analysis.

Findings: The mean score of state and trait anxiety, marital satisfaction, and self-esteem were 45.1±9.8, 45.6±9.1, 63.56±10.6, and 5.76±2.5, respectively. Factors such as age, education, job, income, length of marriage, duration of diagnosis, treatment period, infertility factor and also "state? anxiety showed no significant relationship with marital satisfaction. However, there was a reverse relationship between "trait? anxiety and marital satisfaction (r=0.248, p=0.003). Moreover, a significant direct relationship was found between the self-esteem (r=0.328, p=0.0001), social support (r=0.283, p=0.001) and marital satisfaction.

Conclusion: High trait anxiety, low self-esteem, and low social support, especially from spouse, can result in lower marital satisfaction which may be associated with specific dilemmas including disrupted sexual life and overall increased marital tensions.

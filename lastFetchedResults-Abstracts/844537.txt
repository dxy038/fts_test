In this paper, the Takagiâ€“Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model representation is extended to the stability
analysis for uncertain Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) neural networks with
time-varying delays using linear matrix inequality (LMI) theory. A novel LMI-based stability
criterion is obtained by LMI optimization algorithms to guarantee the exponential stability of
uncertain BAM neural networks with time-varying delays which are represented by TS fuzzy
models. Finally, the proposed stability conditions are demonstrated with numerical
examples.

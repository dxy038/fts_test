Gait disorders are a frequent symptom of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Twelve patients with CSM underwent gait analysis before and after decompressive surgery. They were assessed on a walkway and a treadmill and compared with a healthy matched control group. The following features were observed in the CSM group before surgery: significantly reduced gait velocity and step length (P<0.05), prolonged double support, increased step width, and reduced ankle joint extension during treadmill walking. Knee and hip kinematics did not differ from controls. Two months after surgery, spatio-temporal parameters had moved towards normal values, velocity, step length and cadence had increased significantly, and there was reduction of step width during treadmill walking, indicating improved equilibrium. Gait analysis is an objective tool to document functional recovery after decompressive surgery in CSM.

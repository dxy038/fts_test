Based on the experimented potential use of aperture synthesis (Le Vine, 1990), the European Space Agency has initiated the study of a spaceborne Microwave Interferometric Radiometer with Two-Dimensional Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) as well as the development of an airborne version of this instrument. The objective of this radiometer is to study and demonstrate the feasibility of two-dimensional interferometry for measuring EarthÂ´s soil moisture content and ocean salinity from space, through breadboard implementation and eventually aircraft campaigns

Recently a lot of papers showed that in Low Level Light Therapy (LLLT) the mitochondrial electron works as a photo-acceptor system being photosensitive to red and near-infrared (NIR) light. The objective of this study is to evaluate healing process of light-emitting diode (LED) Low Level Light Therapy with wavelength 850 nm and wavelength 660 nm with continuous wave (CW) with pulsed wave (PW) light applied on inflammatory lesions of the rats and mice. In this experiment where used 12 rats and 15 mice. They were divided in three groups. The result is that lesions, that where irradiated, healed faster than the control lesions. Also pulsed wave light therapy showed better results than the constant level one.

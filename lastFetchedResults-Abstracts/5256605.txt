The emergence of cardiac surgery and with it an imperative need for precise anatomical diagnosis have revived the technical advancement necessary for the amplification and recording of cardiovascular sounds. The study of phonocardiography has developed out of this confidence. The recordings of the sounds, produced by the mechanical activity of the human heart that contains vital information are called phonocardiogram and the device used to record is called phonocardiograph. The objective of this work is to find an efficient method to diagnose the heart diseases from their heart sounds. We have implemented various methods including neural network, fuzzy system and wavelets to recognize the heart diseases and their efficiencies were compared with each other.

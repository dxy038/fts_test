In this paper we present a model approach for a simulation and optimization of ray characteristics of autostereoscopic displays. Based on the assignment of view content to single subpixels, ray paths and intensity distributions are rendered as a function of construction parameters of the modeled display. We investigate models which use parallax barrier arrays as image separating optics. We are able to calculate and visualize an intensity distribution of different views in any chosen distance to the pixel plane. The bidirectional simulation is equally capable of generating rays at userÂ´s specific eye position. In our optical model the Lambertian radiator and Fresnel, respectively Fraunhofer diffraction approximation is used. The model assumptions are proved by comparing simulated and experimental data. The various visualization and analysis methods in the simulation can be used to estimate the quality of autostereoscopic imaging. Our aim is to provide a useful tool for optimization of 3D display design and image processing algorithms.

The Compact Ignition Tokamak (CIT) is planned as the next major step in the US fusion program. Its overall objective is to produce ignited plasma discharges. In order to realize this objective, plasma parameters which are consistent with recognized theoretical and operational limits and which constitute the most cost-effective path to ignition must be established. The key parameters include the plasma safety factor, elongation, plasma current, toroidal field and aspect ratio. Each of the parameters was considered in optimizing the present baseline wedged design. The CIT design team is presently developing a bucked design with enhanced plasma performance. A similar effort to optimize the bucked design is underway. The optimization procedure and optimization of the wedged and bucked designs are presented

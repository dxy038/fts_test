Social problems of any society may differ from others according to its socio-cultural differences. Therefore, identifying, importance and priority of these problems is different with respect to time and local conditions in each society. As a result, recognizing and precedence of social problems is not the same in all societies.
The current paper tries to present a sociological analysis on nature and priority of social problems in Iran. To do so, at first the identifying and prioritizing of social problems from different views are assessed and then based on constructionism perspective, the priority of social problems is dealt with from the public and governing elites' point of view.  The study measured Data from four national surveys in a ten year period with 36429 respondents through a secondary analysis. Results showed that economic problems are on the top in Iranian society and after that, social problems is located. Exploration on Iranians' conception on importance and priority of social problems shows that there is no big variation among different groups of people, specifically, ordinary people and governing elites. Prioritizing of social problems in different social areas follows a special pattern as well. At the end, an orthogonal pattern from subjective and objective conditions for recognizing the importance and priority of social problems in Iran is proposed.

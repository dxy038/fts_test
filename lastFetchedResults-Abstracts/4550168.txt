Ac-ac matrix converters and cycloconverters require bi-directional switches, which are typically formed by two antiparallel thyristors or a two-switch (IGBT/MOSFETs) two-diode configuration. As silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) devices become more available, it is possible to have higher voltage FETs with low conduction and switching losses and reverse conduction capability, which allows the elimination of the diodes in a bidirectional switch. This paper will investigate a bidirectional switch formation that is formed by using two normally-on SiC JFETs in anti-series with no anti-parallel diodes.

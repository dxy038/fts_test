The objective of this study was to characterize preliminarily immunogenic components characteristic of Stachybotrys chartarum to be used later for the development of a detection method for the fungus in environmental samples. The procedure for S.chartarum extract preparation was first optimized related to the age of the culture, culture type, and growth medium, and the antigenic composition of S. chartarum cultured in two different media was then characterized by the sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and immunoblotting method. Cross-reactivity of S. chartarum antigenic components with 10 other fungal species was identified by the inhibition immunoblotting method. The 10-day-old S. chartarum culture extract cultured in malt extract broth revealed a wider selection of proteins and antigenic components than the 30-day-old culture extract or the culture medium extracts. When cultured in cellulose broth, S. chartarum produced a higher number of proteins and antigenic components than in malt extract broth. The most dominant immunogenic components of S. chartarum cultured in cellulose broth were those of 65, 50, 37, and 27 kDa. The components of 65 and 50 kDa proved to be the most characteristic of this fungus according to the inhibition immunoblotting analyses. Several of the S. chartarum components were identified as glycoproteins. Carbohydrate moieties of the S. chartarum components also possessed an antibody binding activity.

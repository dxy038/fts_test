Data Vortex architecture is a unidirectional, highly scalable, all optical multistage interconnection packet switching network. In the present paper we propose Data Vortex architecture with bidirectional links in which the packets are routed both in the forward as well as in the reverse directions. The feasibility of data flow in both the directions is simulated in C environment. The performance analysis of bidirectional network is carried out and presented in terms of injection rate, latency and latency distribution. Finally, the comparison of the proposed bidirectional architecture with two Data Vortex networks connected in parallel for bidirectional operation is also presented.

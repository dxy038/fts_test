Objective: This study Biography EEG effect is to treat dyslexia. Sample study of 31 dyslexic boys center in the city of Ardabil, especially learning disabilities that were available for sampling were selected. Methods Experimental design and pretest posttest control group used. Tools used in this study includes Neurofeedback (NFT), ADHD Vanderbilt Assessment Scale (parent form), impairment tests in reading and Wechsler Intelligence Scale Revised children. Two-factor analysis of variance with repeated measurements for a significant improvement on scales measuring (reading errors) during the two-month follow-up training sessions and Neurofeedback, showed. Significant interaction between time and group as well as for reading errors that were fundamental improvement in Neurofeedback. But results for the scale measuring comprehension, showed no significant improvement in group denote the Neurofeedback. The result, a significant improvement for measured brain waves (delta and theta frequency range) in Neurofeedback training sessions and follow-up after two months, showed. The other hand, a significant interaction between time and group for both the delta and theta range showed significant improvement in group denote the Neurofeedback training. The results of this study suggest that efficiency and sustainability of Neurofeedback as a method of therapy in treating attention problems and modify brain waves to students with dyslexia is compared with Placebo.

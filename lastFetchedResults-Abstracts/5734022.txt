This paper contributes to theory development concerning the organizational design of information technology (IT). It critically discusses the question of "organizational impact of information technology (IT)" from a design perspective. In this paper, the research question is debated against the background of current dealings with the organizational impacts of e-business or the Internet, respectively. The inconsistent findings of an own corresponding empirical study with regard to e-business again support the need for a deeper theoretical investigation of the relationship between organization and (e-business) IT. Explicitly following a design perspective we turn away from the traditional subjective-objective-distinction in favor of a theoretical approach which distinguishes between the respective opportunities and risks of an "open position" and a "closed position" or design pattern, respectively. The theoretical need for a (trialectic) balance of the tensions between both positions becomes obvious. A "tension-balancing management" perspective for (e-business) IT and organizations is the result in terms of the new theoretical design approach.

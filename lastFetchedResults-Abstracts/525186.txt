Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the hematological effects of umbilical cord clamp timing and delivery type in term infants 48 hours after birth in Imam Hossein Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Method: From Oct 2007 â€“ March 2008, 100 mother-infant eligible pairs were selected and divided by cord clamp timing (_15 s and >15 s) for hematologic value determination between the two groups. Data analysis was performed with SPSS for Windows statistical package (version 13). Results: Maternal hematological status was assessed upon admission to the delivery room. A total of 100 mother-infant pairs were divided into two groups: delayed cord clamp time within 15 s (n=70) or early cord clamp time [15 s after delivery (n=30)]. The groups had similar demographic and biomedical characteristics at baseline. Forty-eight hours after delivery the mean infant hemoglobin (Hgb; 16.08 gm/dL vs. 14.5 gm/dL; P<0.001) and hematocrit (Hct 47.6 vs. 42.8; P<0.001) levels were signi_cantly higher in the delayed clamping group. There was no signi_cant difference in ferritin levels (214.7 vs. 173.6 ng/ dL; P=0.08). Fifty infants were born vaginally and 50 were delivered by cesarean section. Infants delivered vaginally had signi_cantly more delayed cord clamp times (>15 s; P<0.001). Conclusion: Delaying cord clamping increases the red cell mass in term infants. It is a safe, simple and low cost delivery procedure that should be incorporated in integrated programs that are aimed at reducing iron de_ciency anemia in infants in developing countries. Vaginal delivery facilitates this action.

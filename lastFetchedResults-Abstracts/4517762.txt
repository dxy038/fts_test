This work is the study of heatsinks in theoretical and technical aspects. The objective of this paper is to provide a more clear imagine of heatsinks function and technology for beginners, designers, and researcher in various featurers. This paper serves as a guide for them to compare novel heatsink technologies. Theoretical correlations and simple equations recommended to calculate the heat transfer rate include Nusselt number, heat transfer coefficient and associated variables for some types of heatsinks to a certain extent are involved. Common terms and phenomenon in the heatsinks are defined.

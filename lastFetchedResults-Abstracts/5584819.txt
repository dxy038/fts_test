Low bit-rate voice coders are a key component of modern digital communication systems. This work investigates an objective measure of speech intelligibility which can be applied to non-waveform codecs as well as waveform codecs. Speech intelligibility is defined as the percentage of speech that can be correctly understood. Two types of channel impairments are studied including random bit error and bursty bit error. A novel objective speech intelligibility assessment algorithm is proposed based on a speech recognizer. Evaluation of intelligibility is conducted at both word, phoneme, and phoneme group level

The energy debate is at the heart of any political or economic strategy, also the real risk of depletion of non-renewable energy sources in the long term make us look more and more renewable energy sources. This brings us inevitably to the question of scientific research and technological innovation, which today enables to find solutions to the socio-economic and socio-cultural context. Rural electrification or isolated sites may be the subject of these studies, and this paper presents one of the economic solutions of the electrification of remote sites. The system studied is a stationary hybrid system; the objective is to meet the limitations of centralized energy management of these systems through the decentralized management by using multi-agent systems.

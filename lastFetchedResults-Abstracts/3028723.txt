The interaction of a concentrated vortex and a shock wave may occur in many cases in the operational environment of supersonic aircraft and missiles. The interaction may be the result of vortices created by the forward components of a supersonic vehicle (for example canards, wings, etc) convecting downstream and interacting, for example, with shock waves present in front of air intakes or other wings. The objective of the present work is to conduct an experimental studies simulating the interaction of streamwise wing-tip vortices with shock waves in supersonic flows. Flow-field visualizations show the different behavior (for example: unsteady vortex breakdown). To elucidate the complex flow containing shock waves, backflow and large-scale fluctuations, measurements using a laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) were carried out.

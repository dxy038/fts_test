Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) strategies are an essential part of photovoltaic
(PV) power convertersâ€™ control. These algorithms maintain the operation of the PV panel at the
optimal point for maximum performance. In addition, the power converter must synchronise with
the electricity grid and inject the power extracted from the PV panel. These two tasks are executed
by the controller in the power conditioning unit. This, however, results in complicated control
loops. Moreover, the interaction with the grid may cause stability problems in the power converter
during voltage disturbances. The dynamic control of PV modules connected to the electricity
supply presented by the authors provides a substantial improvement in power converter stability
and ease of implementation. This strategy combines grid power injection control and PV MPPT
into a single control block. The first objective is achieved using current-mode control to shape the
current injection whereas the latter objective exploits the dynamic behaviour of the PV panel to
determine changes in the grid current magnitude. An implemented prototype system shows the
performance of the proposed strategy and the results are compared against commercially available
inverters.

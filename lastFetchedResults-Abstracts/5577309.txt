This paper deals with multiobjective linear programming problems involving fuzzy random variable coefficients and provides new solution concepts based on M-/spl alpha/-Pareto optimality and stochastic programming models. Fuzzy goals are introduced to consider the imprecise of the decision makerÂ´s judgment for objective functions. After the formulated problem is transformed into the deterministic one, an interactive algorithm based on the reference point method is constructed to solve the deterministic problem.

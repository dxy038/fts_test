Main objective of the paper is studying economic sanctions effects on Iranian foreign trade; especially three sections: energy, goods, and banking services. Studies show that the US always tries to weaken Iranian economy by applying different sanctions as a political tool against Iran from 1979 to 2008 that their effects are as follows: 
	1. Although different sanctions have been applied against Iranian economy, energy section has not so affected by them and it is being developed.
	2. By applying effective sanctions against Iranian economy from 2007, capital goods prices (equipment and machinery) have increased 7 to 10 percents by European sellers. 
	3. Nevertheless Iranian banking system has been affected by applying these financial sanctions frequently in a short time, Iranian banks could have undertaken their assigned duties successfully by optimum planning and management and Iran didn't lose international prestige.
	Consequently, good political recommendations have been taken on probable sanctions by using previous and recent experiences.

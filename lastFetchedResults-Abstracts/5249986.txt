CZT pixel detectors show interesting capabilities for SPECT imaging. They combine a high energy resolution, good detection efficiency and a very good intrinsic spatial resolution. As these performances are superior to those obtained with scintillation detectors, a resulting improvement of image quality is expected. However, SPECT imaging performances are mostly limited by the collimation geometry and CZT based imagers cannot bring a significant gain without a global system redesign. Recently, several innovating ideas have been introduced and new systems have been developed in order to overcome these limitations. We previously proposed an architecture named &#8220;HiSens&#8221; with the objective to use more completely the information given by the detector to improve image quality. We presented some encouraging simulation results showing that a good knowledge of the interaction location inside of the detector could help to improve image. We present here an experimental study using a dedicated test bench called &#8220;Minigami&#8221;. It includes a monolithic pixel detector associated with integrated charge preamplifiers and 16 fully digital processing channels. Wide images are obtained by scanning the object with a translation table. Signal processing circuits extract relevant parameters relative to each photon. These data are saved to a list mode file. Afterwards acquisition files are post-processed in order to build spectra and images. In this paper, we describe steps involved in the image construction and solutions used to compensate for various detector non-idealities. Finally, we will discuss image characterization and present some results. Results show that CZT intrinsic spatial resolution enables to retrieve additional information and allows to shift the traditional trade-off between efficiency and spatial resolution.

The auxiliary power unit maintenance aid (APU Maid) is designed to satisfy APU maintenance requirements for forward area maintenance onboard the aircraft, at the flight line, and in the shop. APU Maid is initially being demonstrated on flight line hardware. The maintenance environment includes among its components an artificial intelligence (AI) based diagnostic system, an automated technical information system, and a maintenance management system. The diagnostic system is built on a core of diagnostic knowledge sources that include an event-based system function model, a structural model, symptom/fault information, and a wide range of logistics data. This core diagnostic model is designed for generic application to any electromechanical system including engines, flight controls, landing gears, and transmissions. It can also be applied to electronic systems, including avionics. The project objective is described, and the APU Maid components are described in detail

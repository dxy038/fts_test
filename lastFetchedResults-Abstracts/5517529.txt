With the rapid development of social economic and the growing power demand, it brings the phenomenon that the capacity of power network is expanding gradually and the load feature has changed very much. The peak-valley difference is becoming larger and larger with an annual increasing trend and the problem of peak load shifting has been increasingly apparent. It can solve the problem by charging during valley period and discharging during peak period using of the storage technology of flow battery (FB). It helps to make the peak load shift to the valley, so that it can improve the load feature. Based the application of peak load shifting, this paper presents a methodology to optimal the capacity of flow battery, it builds the optimization model to determine the sizing capacity of flow battery while the objective function of this model is to maximize the benefits the power system. It´s based on the example network´s load feature and the security of the system network and charge-discharge characteristics of flow battery as its constraints. While the capacity of flow battery has been determined, an operating strategy of flow battery to dispatch power has been presented. The result is significant to demonstrate that the application of FB to implement the peak load shifting has great advantages.

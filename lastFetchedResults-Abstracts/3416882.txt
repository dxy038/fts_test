The authors report an analysis of the orthogonal-core type push-pull parametric transformer with nonlinear load. The oscillation voltage and input current of the parametric transformer are calculated when a bidirectional triode-thyristor is connected to the output of the transformer on the basis of the magnetic circuit model of the orthogonal-core. The analytical results show good agreement with the experimental ones, and the push-pull parametric transformer has almost sinusoidal input current and high input power factor when the transformer has a nonlinear load such as a bidirectional triode-thyristor.

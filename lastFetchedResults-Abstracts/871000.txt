This paper provides some results concerning sensitivity analysis in parametrized
convex vector optimization. We consider three types of perturbation maps  i.e.,
perturbation map, proper perturbation map, and weak perturbation map. accord-
ing to three kinds of solution concepts  i.e., minimality, proper minimality, and
weak minimality with respect to a fixed ordering cone. for a vector optimization
problem. As for general vector optimization, authors have already established the
behavior of the above three types of perturbation maps by using the concept of
contingent derivatives for set-valued maps in finite dimensional Euclidean spaces.
In this paper we concentrate on convex vector optimization and provide quantitative
properties of the perturbation maps under some convexity assumptions.
Namely, we investigate the relationships between the contingent derivatives of the
perturbation maps and those of the feasible set map in the objective space.

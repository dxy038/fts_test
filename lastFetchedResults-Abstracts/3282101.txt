Investigations of engineering-geological conditions near five-floor apartment house in a permafrost zone were carried out by methods of ground penetrating radar (GPR). The investigation objective consisted in revision of the engineering-geological conditions changed as a result of permafrost defrosting near building plus under one, and also in definition of piles depth in mark points of base. GPR researches are carried out for engineering-geological researches, and also for definition of piles step and length. The pile depth has been measured by GPR with frequency of the antenna block of 250 and 700 MHz. The profiling for definition of a geological structure of ground was carried out. As a result of experimental works the GPR method was practically approved for monitoring of subsurface environment for the purpose of revealing of the permafrost defrosting zones. Productivity of the subsurface GPR method has been shown for engineering-geological and observation purposes.

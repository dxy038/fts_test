Objective
ococcus mutans, known to be a major pathogen of dental caries, is also considered to cause infective endocarditis. Its 120-kDa Cnm protein binds to type I collagen, which may be a potential virulence factor. In this study, we characterized S. mutans clinical strains focusing on the cnm gene encoding Cnm.

l of 528 S. mutans strains isolated from Japanese, Finnish, and Thai subjects were investigated. Using molecular techniques, the distribution frequency of cnm-positive strains and location of the inserted cnm were analyzed. Furthermore, isogenic mutant strains were constructed by inactivation of the cnm gene, then their biological properties of collagen-binding and glucan-binding were evaluated. Southern hybridization of the genes encoding glucan-binding proteins was also performed.
s
stribution frequency of cnm-positive strains from Thai subjects was 12%, similar to that previously reported for Japanese and Finnish subjects. Furthermore, the location of insertion of cnm was the same in all cnm-positive clinical isolates. As for the cnm-inactivated mutant strains constructed from 28 clinical isolates, their collagen-binding activity was negligible. In addition, glucan-binding activity in the cnm-positive clinical isolates was significantly reduced and corresponded to a lack of gbpA encoding glucan-binding protein A.
sions
sults indicate that strains with cnm genes, the most crucial factor for the collagen-binding property of S. mutans, are detectable at similar frequencies over several different geographic locations. In addition, the common properties of these strains are a high level of collagen-binding activity and tendency for a low level of glucan-binding activity.

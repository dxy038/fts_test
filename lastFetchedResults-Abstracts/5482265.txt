Routing protocols will be a fundamental piece in the operation of ad-hoc networks. These protocols must fulfil the main objective of using valid routes among the different nodes that form the net in a correct and efficient way keeping in mind the possibility that malicious nodes may exist in the net, and protecting the communication of non-allowed accesses. This work presents a proposal of a secure routing protocol adapted to spontaneous ad-hoc networks.

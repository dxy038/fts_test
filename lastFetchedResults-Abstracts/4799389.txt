Lie group decompositions of a desired unitary evolution operator are employed to find simple control schemes to achieve population transfers for systems initially in the ground state as well as complete inversions of the ensemble populations for systems whose initial state is an ensemble of energy eigenstates. Both completely controllable and pure-state controllable systems are considered and it is shown that the control objective can be achieved using realistic square wave pulses

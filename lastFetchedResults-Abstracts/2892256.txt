The objective of this paper is to identify the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on household voltage profiles and propose possible mitigation approaches. The proposed method is based on a decentralized voltage control algorithm, aiming at maintaining nodal voltages at a distribution transformer and end-use customer meters within an acceptable limit. The objective is to prevent distribution transformer overloads and flattening transformer load profile as much as possible. Instead of solely relying on controlling EV charging profiles, the proposed approach controls all household power-intensive appliances including EVs to accomplish the desired objectives. The proposed algorithm can be embedded in an emerging smart distribution transformer technology to allow local voltage control at household levels.

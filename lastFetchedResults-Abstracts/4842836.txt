One Time Password (OTP) authentication mechanism has higher security by one time padding. It is implemented simply, cost less and needed no third-party notarization, and so it is more suitable for limited environment in mobile commerce. A mobile identity authentication mechanism (MIAM) is presented based on OTP. The procedures of user registration and bidirectional authentication are designed in MIAM. In order to verify its operation efficiency in the actual network environment, the simulation model of MIAM is set up through NS2. The mechanism performance is analyzed from the statistics variables, including flow, delay, packet loss and output. Finally simulation procedure is traced and analyzed through gawk, gnu plot and xgraph tools of NS2. The simulation results verify MIAM has better feasibility in mobile commerce identity authentication.

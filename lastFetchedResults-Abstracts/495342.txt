Background and objective: Toxoplasmosis is one of the most infectious zoonotic diseases in man and animals. The prevalence of this infection depends on geographic conditions, nutritional habits and contact with cats. There is no adequate research on epidemiology of this infection in the Kurdistan province. The aim of this study was investigation of toxoplasma antibodies in women during marriage consultation in Sanandaj city.

Materials and methods: This was done as Descriptive-Analytic study. Serum samples from 600 women who are going to get married and referred to the health center laboratory, were collected and tested for antibodies to T.gondii by an IgG-Elisa indirect antibody test (IFAT) method.

Results: The mean of age was 22.85 (Â±7.65) years. 424 women (70.7%) were urban and 433 (72.2%) rural. Among 600 serum samples tested, 169 (28.2%) were found to be antibody positive. There was a significant relationship between positive serology and keeping cat at home and contact with other animals (p<0.05). The age was higher in positive than negative women (p=0.01).

Conclusion: There are different prevalence rates in different areas of Iran. The reasons could be differences in climate, diet, contacts with cats, health conditions, etc. There is more chance of contamination with increase in age. More over 71.8% of women in Sanandaj were seronegative and were prone to acute toxoplasmosis during their pregnancy. The results of this study confirm that the determination of the diagnostic toxoplasmosis is a necessary test during pregnancy.

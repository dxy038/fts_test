To improve the clearness of images captured in the low illumination environment, a new enhancement algorithm was presented based on the popular histogram equalization method. It can transform the histogram to the ordered shape to highlight the contrast of selected interest gray level and fit for the human visual. The experiment has shown that the new algorithm has lower mean square error and higher peak signal to noise ratio. So it can get better performance in dealing with the illumination images both in subjective and objective.

This paper investigates PHEVs effect on a distributed network while they charge in charging stations. In this paper, voltage profile and power factor improvement are made in the presence of PHEV. PHEV Charge modeling parameters such as battery capacity, PHEV daily traveled distance and PHEV entrance time to charging stations all are probabilistic. Thus, a mathematical probabilistic model for PHEV charging seems to be necessary. In this paper PHEVs charging effect on substations at which PHEV charging stations are located, will be seen. To solve the increasing load demand issue, an objective function with a modified probabilistic PHEV modeling has been developed to acquire the suitable storage equipment to improve voltage profile and power factor of the system. All simulations have been conducted via GAMS software.

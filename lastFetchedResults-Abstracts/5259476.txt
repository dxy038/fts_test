This paper presents the ANR project IDROMel, which aims at developing reconfigurable SDR (software defined radio) and cognitive radio (CR) equipments. IDROMel is a 3 years project that started in 2005 and finishes in 2009. The main objective of IDROMel is to define, develop and validate a powerful SDR and CR platform combining very last technology progresses. The platform includes software parts (reconfigurable protocol stacks) and hardware parts (a base band board and a radio frequency front end, RF). Both parts are presented in this paper.

Unregulated PEV (Plug-in Electric Vehicle) charging will have a great impact on current power grid system, especially on the distribution transformer system. This paper studies the PEV charging control problem considering the residential distribution transformer life based utilizing a base load prediction algorithm. The objective of the control algorithm is to minimize the transformer loss of life while maintain quality of service. A novel control strategy was developed which calculates a near-optimal total charging load for all available PEVs and then distributes the charging load to available each PEV to maintain good quality of service. Quality of service is measured by the ability of the algorithm to consistently charge available PEVs to near full SOC prior to departure. The simulation results of the proposed smart charging strategy show the effectiveness of the methodology.

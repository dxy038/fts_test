Health is a multidimensional concept which, besides lack of illness, includes the feelings of happiness and well-being .The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the dimensions of psychological well- being and general health among university students. The present study is a correlation research. Hence a sample of 145 students from Islamic Azad university of Azadshahr was randomly chosen. The participants responded to a booklet which, in turn, included three different instruments: a Demographic Questionnaire developed by the researcher himself, a General Health Questionnaire, and scales of Psychological well-being. The collected data were analyzed by SPSS using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The results indicate that the mean of disorder subscale in the social function of General Health Questionnaire (CHQ) was higher than other factors (M= 7.3) and depression had the lowest mean (M= 4.08). The results of this research study showed that there is negative and significant relationship between psychological well-being (self-acceptance, positive relation with others, autonomy, purpose in life, personal growth, environmental mastery)
and general health (p< 0.01, r = - 0.589). 35 percent of variance changes in general health scores was anticipated with psychological well-being scores.

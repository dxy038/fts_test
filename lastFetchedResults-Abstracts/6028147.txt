To respond to the changing environment, the architecture of the supply chain management (SCM) system which is based on agent and ontology has been introduced, including four types of principal interconnected agents that are described in detail. In this architecture, ontology is used to define a common vocabulary for agents to communicate with one another. To illustrate the architecture, a simulation work has been done and the results imply that the architecture provides a very efficient method to design and implement architecture of the SCM system with the purposes of information sharing, mass customization, responsiveness, flexibility and agility of the SCM system. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the architecture of SCM system, and the approach of how SCM system support the responsiveness, flexibility, and direct contact with suppliers and customers.

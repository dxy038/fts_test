Abstract

Background and objective: Because of clinical importance of Mycoplasma hominis especially in gynecology and difficulties related to diagnosis of this organism in our laboratories, it is essential to more accurately evaluation of the mentioned bacteria frequency in Iran. In this study the technique of culture and formulation of media have been designed in order to increasing the probability of bacterial isolation from the patient’s clinical specimens favorably. Moreover, frequency of Mycoplasma hominis in the studied population and also relationship between presence of organism and clinical signs has been evaluated.     
Materials and methods: This research was a descriptive epidemiological study which was performed on 226 patients referred to women clinic of Qazvin Kowsar hospital in 2012-13. The specimen was endo-cervical mucosa which was collected by dacron swabs. The swabs were initially placed in broth culture media and then maximum after 24 hours were transferred on agar plates. In this study observation of fried egg shaped colonies on the surface of agar culture media was considered as a positive culture and color change of broth media alone was reported as negative. 
  Results: Among the 226 specimens obtained form patient’s cervical mucosa, 30 cases (13.2%) were positive for Mycoplasma hominis based on colony formation on agar media.  
Conclusion: Frequency of Mycoplasma hominis in Qazvin is considerable and more investigations are necessary. The technique of culture and formulation of medium used in this study can improve sensitivity of the culture method.

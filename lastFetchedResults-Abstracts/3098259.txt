This paper presents a risk assessment method which combines wavelet neural network (WNN) and entropy-grey correlation, creates a WNN model and has done simulation experiments by Matlab7.1. In addition, comparisons between WNN and other traditional estimation methods are made in terms of convergent speed, training precision and forecasting effect. The experiment results indicate that, with this method, subjective judgment in previous research is avoided effectively and the evaluation results are more scientific and reasonable. The study of the case shows that the method can be easily applied to the security risk assessment of e-government information system to produce objective results.

The purpose of this project is to explore the techniques in developing the low voltage CMOS analog building blocks such as operational amplifiers. The main objective of this project is to design the low voltage single supply CMOS operational amplifiers for zero cross detector application. Circuits were aimed to operate standard supply voltage (3V). Achievement of high gain around 80 dB and 45 degree phase margin for stable closed loop operations were the goal of primary concern for zero cross detector design. Designing, simulation and layout had been done. All the designs had been done using Tanner EDA with 0.25 &#181;m technology where simulation had been carried out using SPICE simulator and layout had been made using Tanner layout editor (L-edit).

Different ratio of evapotranspiration, base flow, surface runoff and infiltration should be correctly identified in the water resources management. The Objective of this research is to:  evaluate the efficiency of ArcSWAT model and ParaSol Software in the simulation of daily and monthly flow, investigate the various components of hydrological cycle and water balance of the Ghazaghli watershed, Golestan province. The runoff data of Ghazaghli hydrometric Station during 1987 to 1992 were used as base station. The sensitivity analysis of the parameters was performed based on t-stat and p-value indices. The model was calibrated in the both daily and monthly basis with a coefficient of determination (R2) eual to 0.76 and 0.86. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (ENS) were equal to 0.74, 0.84 and the root mean square error (RMSE) were 11.27 and 7.13, respectively. These coefficients for the validation period in daily time basis were 0.83, 0.78, 13.06, respectively, and for the monthly time basis were 0.59, 0.55 and 14.15. The assessment of model uncertainty based on the P-factor and R-factor showed that the simulation in monthly time basis rather than the daily time base was more accurate in both calibration and validation period. The overall results indicated that the evaporation and runoff are two main factors in the loss of water from the desired watershed.

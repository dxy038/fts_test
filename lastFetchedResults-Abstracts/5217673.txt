In order to allow the development of joint degrees through heterogeneous e-learning systems, we propose a federation services architecture whose implementation will be based on Web services. Our main objective is to allow e-learning systems to be able to work in a collaborative way; combining their data and functionality through the integration of their services. These services will be combined and federated, according to collaboration agreements between Universities. Joint degrees through e-learning systems will allow the development of new joint curricula and the participation in the convergence of higher education

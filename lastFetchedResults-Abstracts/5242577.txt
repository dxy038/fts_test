The main objective of this paper is to show an exact derivation of the probability of error for &#960;/4-shifted differentially encoded QPSK (&#960;/4-DQPSK) when demodulated using differential detectors (correlators), in both AWGN and Rayleigh fading. This modulation and its noncoherent demodulation schemes have been adopted for use in TDMA (time-division multiple access) cellular telephone systems in the United States (IS-54) and in Japan

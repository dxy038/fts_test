A new Canadian code, the Objective Based Industrial Electrical Code (OBIEC) is being developed by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA). Industry initiated the request to develop the OBIEC because the existing prescriptive Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) [1] was restrictive, was not keeping pace with advancing technologies and was slow to change. The Objective Based Industrial Electrical Code and the OBI EC Safety Management System - Requirements (OBIEC-SMS) will facilitate greater flexibility in engineering design, product selection, installation methodology and day-to-day operations and maintenance for Canadian owners/users of industrial facilities. Synergies between OBIEC and major global electrical standards will create a foundation for harmonizing global standards. Safety will be improved by mandating documented management processes and improved inspection requirements. The OBIEC and OBIEC SMS standards are being developed in a consensus process, as defined for Standards Development Organizations by the Standards Council of Canada. This development process has been underway over the last four years and will have input from all impacted stakeholders including the public.

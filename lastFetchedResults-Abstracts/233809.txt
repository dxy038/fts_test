The objective of this study is to evaluate surface characteristics of commercially manufactured particleboard and medium density fiberboard (MDF) panels in Thailand. The surface roughness of both type of panels were measured using a fine stylus technique. Average roughness (Ra), mean peak-to-valley height (Rz), and maximum roughness (Rmax) were used to evaluate quantitatively surface characteristics of the specimens. Roughness measurements were taken from both sides of the specimens along and across the sandmarks. It was found that no statistically (p<0.1) significant difference existed between the values of all three parameters taken in two directions. The results showed that panel types C and B had better roughness values that those of panel types A and B for MDF and particleboard, respectively. None of the panels considered within the same type in this study had superior surface quality over the other.

The implementation of large-scale information systems (IS) in hospitals has created much hype all over the globe. More governments have started to realize the necessity to improve its health systems through IS for the benefits of its people. This has, inevitably, placed implementers in a challenging position to unconditionally ensure successful implementation of IS. Hence, this study was initiated to assist in mitigating the problems and/or potential problems faced by implementers. It identifies and examines the influence of critical success factors (CSFs) on the successful implementation of hospital information systems (HIS) in Malaysian public hospitals. The objective of this study was to develop and test a HIS implementation model based on the CSFs and DeLone and McLean (D&amp;M) IS success model. The model comprises essential elements to guide HIS implementation. In the model, the D&amp;M IS success measures are presented as a reflective second order factor to capture the multifaceted success dimensions. In order to evaluate the extent of success of HIS implementation, the variance-based structural equation modelling (SEM) or partial least squares (PLS) approach is employed. The findings of the study reveal that the CSFs in Malaysia differ from studies in developed countries. Key implementation factors such as top management support, business planning, project management and change management were found to be insignificant. This study is among the few that attempts to empirically test an implementation model in the Malaysian settings. The results of this study could be instrumental in the advancement of future empirical HIS implementation research.

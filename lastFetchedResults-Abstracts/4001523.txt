This paper aims to calculate the optimal operation of offshore wind farms (OWF) working with wind turbines based on doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) technologies, and with a high-voltage dc transmission connection. The objective of the optimization problem is to maximize the active power output of the arrangement, while considering certain factors, i.e., the restrictions imposed by the available wind power, the capability curve of the DFIG, the dc-link model, and the operative conditions. The accomplishment of this aim implies setting, adjusting, and operating the system under study in order to produce a reliable and cost-efficient electric energy supply. A realistic simulation test case is performed to evaluate the proposed method, and the optimal operation analysis takes into account different wind speeds and high-voltage dc-link lengths. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the advantages of using the reactive control performed by the DFIG to manage the operational requirements of the dc link.

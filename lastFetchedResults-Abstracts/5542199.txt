The objective of this paper is to study the effect of Al2O3 nanoparticles on the absorption performance in NH3/H20 bubble absorption process. The Al2O3 nanofluids with good dispersion stability within the nanoparticle mass fraction range of 0.2%~1.0% are prepared. The result shows that, in the ammonia concentration range of 0%~20%, the effective absorption ratio in all case with Al2O3 nanoparticles is higher than 1.0 and rises with the initial ammonia concentration increasing. When the initial ammonia concentration is 20% and the Al2O3 nanoparticle mass fraction is 0.5%, the effective absorption ratio can reach the maximum 2.017, which indicates that the Al2O3 nanoparticles has a significant effect on the bubble absorption performance of ammonia with higher initial concentration, and its possible mechanism is briefly analysed.

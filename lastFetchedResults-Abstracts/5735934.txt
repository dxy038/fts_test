Traffic-responsive techniques make use of real-time measurements acquired with sensors to calculate in real-time suitable settings. Traffic signal systems that react to changing traffic conditions are an important component for improving transportation efficiency. The dynamic behavior of a group of traffic signals controlling a network of intersections is a complex discrete event system that can be modeled using Petri nets. In this paper, one purpose is to design a mechanism based on Petri nets with time interval associated to places to extend the green time to a main road depending on the demand of non-priority roads. Another objective is to try to allow green phases for a sequence of intersections in a small network in order to improve traffic flow for a platoon of vehicles. Modular characteristics of Petri nets are used to address complexity and design models in increasing levels of detail.

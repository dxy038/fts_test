A kind of restoration method of the clipped audio signal based on Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) is proposed in this paper. The front-end of the clipped audio are detected by the peak detection algorithm. The Clipped audio signal is restored by the soft-thresholding method and spectral weighting function method in the MDCT domain. Both the objective evaluation and subjective listening test indicate that the quality of the clipped signal is improved effectively by the proposed method and has a comparable performance with the method of cubic interpolation.

In this paper, the statistical properties of the wavelet transform coefficients of medical images are studied. According to the characteristics of medical images and exploring the region-based coding idea, a new wavelet-based medical image coding scheme is proposed. Experiments show that the scheme outperforms the JPEG standard in both subjective and objective qualities. Meanwhile, the scheme supports progressive transmission so it can meet the need of medical image storage, communication and archiving

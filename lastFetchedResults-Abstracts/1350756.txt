The objective of the present study is to investigate the impact of spraying boric acid on vegetative and reproductive growth of ‘Camarosa’ strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.). The strawberry plants were sprayed with Boric acid at 0 (control), 50 and 100 mg L-1 at 30 days after planting. In general, results indicated that spraying plants with boric acid had a significant effect on yield, fruit weight, chlorophyll, and leaf area. The superior treatment concerning vegetative and reproductive growth was spraying boric acid at 100 mg L-1 during experiment.

Pushbroom hyperspectral images (HSIs) suffer from many unwanted effects such as stripes, smile, random noise etc. Among these phenomena striping is often the first one to be processed in most existing HSI processing chains. An overview of well-known systems as well as recent algorithms for destripping is provided in this paper. A novel destripping technique is proposed. The method is based on the idea of equalizing detector responses. To this end, homogenous lines are detected. Visual examination of the results as well as objective criteria suggest that the proposed technique remove stripes and restore spectral information.

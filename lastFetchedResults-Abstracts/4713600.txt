In this article we introduce Inverted and Shrinkable Pareto Archived Evolutionary Strategies, IS-PAES, an evolutionary algorithm for multiple objective optimization with constraint handling. IS-PAES inherits from PAES the use of an adaptable grid to control diversity, but here this grid can grow and shrink dynamically until the constraints are met. We also propose a novel approach to remove unfeasible individuals from the population while keeping high population diversity. Several examples of the literature are used to show the potential of ISPAES.

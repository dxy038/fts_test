The objective of the research study presented in this paper is to verify the applicability of C60 fullerenes as inhibitors of aging processes in liquid dielectrics. For this purpose, a set of fullerene doped oil samples were prepared and then these samples were oxidized. Such prepared set of samples was examined for basic electrical and physicochemical properties. In particular, changes in water content, as well as breakdown voltage, electrical permittivity and loss factor were analyzed. During the research studies, it was stated that C60 fullerenes have positive influence on the quality of the mineral oil by reducing effects of the aging processes. However, resistivity value did not exceed the limit values defining the minimum level of oil resistivity.

A patient´s sleep/wake schedule is an important step underlying clinical evaluation of sleep-related complaints. Aspects related to timing of a person´s sleep routine provide important clues regarding diagnosis and treatments. Solutions for sleep complaints may sometimes rely solely on changes in habits and life style, based on what is learned from daily rest-activity patterns. This paper describes an approach for determining two states, in-bed and out-of-bed, using load cells under the bed. These states are important because they can help characterize rest-activity patterns at nighttime or detect bed exits in hospitals or nursing homes. The information derived from the load cells is valuable as an objective and continuous measure of daily patterns, and it is particularly valuable in sleep studies in populations who would not be able to remember specific hours to complete sleep diaries. The approach is evaluated on data collected in a laboratory experiment, in a sleep clinic, and also on data collected from residents of an assisted-living facility.

Contingency screening and ranking is one of the most important issues for security assessment in the field of power system operation. The objective of contingency screening and ranking is to quickly and accurately select a short list of critical contingencies from a large list of potential contingencies and rank them according to their severity. Then suitable preventive control actions can be implemented considering contingencies that are likely to affect the power system performance. In this paper a novel approach is presented for contingency ranking based on static security assessment (SSA). This method uses weighted performance index with the application of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in order to select appropriate weighting factors to be imposed. The proposed method is applied to IEEE 30 bus system and the results are presented.

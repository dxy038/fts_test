Recently, the mobile cloud computing received much attention since it can provide various and powerful services for the mobile user. The service discovery technology in mobile cloud computing is very important to efficiently provide the mobile services. In this paper, we proposed a novel preference-aware skyline service discovery system in the mobile cloud system. The objective of our system is to discover preferable services in the mobile cloud system. Our proposed mobile cloud system is composed of zone-based overlay network. In the overlay network, querying user generates the query with user preference extracted by a Singular Value Decomposition method from the userÂ´s service access history. The generated query is sent to the mobile cloud system, and then the query is handled by the distributed skyline query processing mechanism to discover user preferable services with low networking communication cost in the mobile cloud system. We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed system.

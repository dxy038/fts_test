The objective of the present investigation was to study the protective role of
aqueous extract of leaves of Moringa oleifera (MO) on nimesulide induced
hepatotoxicity model in adult male albino rats. Hepatotoxicity in rats was caused
by nimesulide at a dose of 10 mg /ml/kg body weight. Hepamerz, a drug used as
standard hepatoprotective agent, was administered orally as standard
hepatoprotective agent for 14 consecutive days prior to nimesulide treatment at a
dose of 10mg/ml/kg body weight. This drug has many side effects. These side
effects have prompted the scientific world for the search of alternative herbal
based remedies of liver damage. The aqueous leaf extract of MO was
administered orally to rats daily for 14 days before nimesulide treatment. The
biochemical parameters were investigated. The results indicated that biochemical
changes produced by nimesulide were restored to normal by aqueous extract of
leaves of MO. The aqueous leaf extract of MO showed significant
hepatoprotective effect through the modulation of antioxidant-mediated
mechanism by altering serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT),
serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and reduced
glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels against nimesulide
induced hepatotoxicity model in rats. The present study puts future research
agenda of whether to implement the results on albino rats upon
hepatoprotectivity in human body.

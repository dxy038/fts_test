A methodology for optimal sizing of stand-alone PV/WG systems is presented. The purpose of the proposed methodology
is to suggest, among a list of commercially available system devices, the optimal number and type of units ensuring
that the 20-year round total system cost is minimized subject to the constraint that the load energy requirements are completely
covered, resulting in zero load rejection. The 20-year round total system cost is equal to the sum of the respective
components capital and maintenance costs. The cost (objective) function minimization is implemented using genetic algorithms,
which, compared to conventional optimization methods such as dynamic programming and gradient techniques,
have the ability to attain the global optimum with relative computational simplicity. The proposed method has been
applied for the design of a power generation system which supplies a residential household. The simulation results verify
that hybrid PV/WG systems feature lower system cost compared to the cases where either exclusively WG or exclusively
PV sources are used.

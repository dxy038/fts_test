This paper presets an optimal current controller for shunt active power filter to compensate customer generated current harmonics and reactive power. The compensated source current maintains the same level of harmonic distortion as present in the source voltage. The particle swarm optimization technique is employed for minimizing the objective function to get the desired value of controller variables. The proposed controller is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment under sinusoidal and distorted supply conditions with varying loads.

Transmission congestion management in an open access environment is a new challenge to transmission operators nowadays. The objective of this paper is to develop a competitive market structure in transmission service to help facilitate the dispatch management and solve transmission congestion problems. Feasibility evaluation of potential contracts and optimum power dispatch of feasible contracts are two main parts of this paper. Feasibility evaluation is employed to screen out the infeasible contracts before the optimum dispatch is carried out. The feasibility evaluation uses a rule-based method based on rule inference techniques. Optimal dispatch model is formulated to manage the congestion for the feasible contracts. An illustrative example on a modified IEEE 14-bus system is used to show the implementation of the screening process and the optimal transmission dispatch process.

A study of liquid chromatography–triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC–MS–MS) with positive electrospray ionisation (ESI) for the determination of selected drugs in human tissues and body fluids such as blood, urine and hair is described. The possibility to screen for and quantify the 19 most commonly prescribed neuroleptics on the Swedish market and determine the presence of their major metabolites within a single LC–MS–MS analysis was evaluated on a PE Sciex API2000 instrument. Chromatographic conditions were optimised and the best separation, with individual retention times for most of the analytes, was obtained on a Zorbax SB-CN column within a 9-min gradient run. The MS–MS fragmentation conditions were optimised for each compound in order to obtain both specific fragments and high signal intensity. Since neuroleptics are a heterogeneous group of compounds, a markedly difference in collision energy needed to achieve fragments of the selected parent ions was seen and the number of fragments achieved varied as well. For sensitive quantification the transition of the most intense fragment of the protonated molecular ion (M+1)+ was selected for multiple reaction monitoring analysis. More than 70 transitions were finally included in the assay. Detection levels down to the lower ng/ml level were achieved for all analytes, but between analytes more than a 10-fold difference in signal response was seen. By evaluation of extracted ion chromatograms from the analysis of authentic human blood, urine and hair sample the proposed concept for rational drug analysis was found to be both selective and sensitive for the neuroleptics included. A great number of metabolites could be determined in blood, urine and hair as well. A full method validation was not performed since the objective was to evaluate the method design rather than to validate a final method set-up.

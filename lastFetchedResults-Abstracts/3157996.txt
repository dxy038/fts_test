This paper presents a Dynamic Programming (DP) methodology for finding optimum preventive maintenance schedule of generating units in a deregulated power system. One part of objective function is to maintain units as earlier as possible. The other part is income from selling electricity in the market. Various constraints such as spinning reserve, duration of maintenance and maintenance crew are being taken into account. In a case study, using a power system with six generating units, implying DP, and establishing three scenarios (without the effects of market, with low fluctuation market, and high fluctuation market) the optimum schedule for each scenario is obtained.

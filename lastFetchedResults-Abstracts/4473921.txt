A manufacturing system is typically a shared resource system whose components never have unlimited capacities. In manufacturing system design, a major objective is to achieve a system which is free from capacity overflow. In this paper, a method is proposed for analysing if a system possesses this property. The method is based on augmented marked graphs. By modelling a manufacturing system as an augmented marked graph, we can analyse the possibility of capacity overflow using the properties of bounded augmented marked graphs

Testbeds are projected to be the next generation of mechanisms for protocol verification and performance validation of wireless networks. One important objective of these testbeds is to depict the propagation mechanism accurately. This paper presents measurements and models of propagation between stationary transmitters and receivers in a dynamic environment. These measurements indicate that in some environments, the signal strength displays wide variations, while in other environments, there is less variation in the signal strength. A diffusion-based stochastic model is presented that can be used to increase the accuracy of testbed emulations

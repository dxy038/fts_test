In this paper designing of multi-objective PID controller for load frequency control (LFC) based on adaptive weighted particle swarm optimization (AWPSO) has been proposed. Conventional methods such as Ziegler-Nichols and Cohen-Coon are based on trial-and-error and their best performances are achieved for first-order process. Single-objective population based methods such as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have only one solution in a single run. Unlike single objective methods, multi-objective optimization can find different solutions in a single run. In the proposed method, overshoot/undershoot and settling time are used as objective functions for multi-objective optimization. The proposed method is used for designing of PID parameters for two area interconnected power system.

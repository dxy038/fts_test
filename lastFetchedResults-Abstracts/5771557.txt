A delay analysis program has been developed to compute the signal propagation delays attributed to RC interconnection nets in integrated circuits. To take into account the bidirectional nature of MOS transmission gates, the program simulates nets connected through transmission gates as single entities refered to as "supernets". In order to obtain a single set of realistic lumped delays for nets with transmission gates, a delay path analysis and reduction algorithm is used.

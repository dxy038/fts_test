Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the level of fetal mercury exposure by measuring mercury levels in newborn cord blood and to analyze the association with fish consumption during pregnancy.
Study design
A total of 308 women who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled in the study. Of these, 275 women completed a dietary survey; after delivery, cord blood was collected and analyzed for mercury levels.
Results
The mean mercury level in cord blood was 4.82 μg/L; 28.3% of the participants had measured mercury levels above the US Environmental Protection Agency's recommended reference dose (5.8 μg/L). A significant relationship was noted between the amount of fish consumed during pregnancy and rising mercury levels in cord blood.
Conclusion
In an island state with high levels of fish consumption, women were 3 times more likely to have elevated cord blood mercury levels, compared with the national average.

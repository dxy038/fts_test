The Göttingen transmission X-ray microscope at the low emittance electron storage ring BESSY II uses the concept of dynamical aperture synthesis (Reynolds, DeVelis, Parrent, Thomson (Eds.), The New Physical Optics Notebook, SPIE, 1990, pp. 536–548) for the object illumination. The concept is well suited as a condenser, as it can match any required numerical aperture of the TXM objective. Furthermore, a novel off-axis transmission zone-plate monochromator is included, which can generate a monochromaticity of several thousand in the object illumination.

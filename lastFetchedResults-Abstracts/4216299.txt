The objective of this paper is to propose a new path tracking method for a mobile robot, based on fuzzy techniques. After a discussion of the error correction mechanism of the robotÂ´s steering, a fuzzy controller is proposed. The inputs of the controller are the position and the orientation errors of the robot with respect to the reference path while the output is an orientation target expressed with respect to the current heading of the robot. In order to verify the validity of the proposed control method, simulation results are presented

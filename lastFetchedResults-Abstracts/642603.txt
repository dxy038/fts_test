Objective
The relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP), a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk, and dietary nutrients is not known. We investigated the relationship between serum CRP levels and dietary nutrients in young Asian Indians residing in a major metropolitan city in north India.
Methods

Dietary nutrient intake values (24-h dietary recall and monthly consumption data) and serum CRP levels were studied in 359 healthy adolescents and young adults (312 male and 47 female) (mean age, 18.0 ± 2.3 y; range, 14–25 y), after carefully excluding those with history of infections and smoking. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with CRP [raised (>3.0 mg/L)/normal] as the outcome variable and various dietary nutrients and anthropometric variables as covariates.
Results

Mean CRP level was 1.3 ± 2.3 mg/L (range, 0.02–17.5 mg/L). Raised CRP levels (>3 mg/L) were noted in 9% study subjects (8.6% males and 12.8% females). After adjustment for other covariates, saturated fat emerged as the single most important nutrient contributing to increase in serum CRP levels. The odds of having a raised CRP level in subjects consuming more than 10% energy as saturated dietary fat were twice as compared to subjects having a normal saturated fat intake [Adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) = 2.0 (0.94–4.1)]. For every one percent decrease in energy intake by saturated fat, CRP level was calculated to decrease by 0.14 mg/L. For decreasing CRP levels to <1.0 mg/L (low risk for cardiovascular disease), Asian Indian adolescents and young adults should ensure saturated fat intake <7% of caloric intake.
Conclusion

We suggest that daily saturated fat intake should be limited to <7% of caloric intake in urban adolescents and young adult Asian Indians to decrease their future cardiovascular risk.

In this study the periodic cracking of an elastic coating bonded to a homogeneous
substrate is considered. The problem is assumed to simulate the segmentation or "mud-flat" cracking
of ceramic layers used as thermal barrier coatings in stationary and aircraft gas turbine engines. By
expressing the displacements in terms of a combination of finite and infinite Fourier transforms, the
corresponding mixed boundary value problem is reduced to an integral equation with the crack
surface displacement as the unknown function. The main objective of the study is the examination
of the influence of the length parameters c/b and b/h and the stiffness ratio ~/2/~1 on the crack tip
stress intensity factors, the crack opening displacement, the strain energy released as a result of
periodic cracking, and the in-plane tensile stress on the coating surface, where c, b, h,/~ and #2,
respectively, are crack spacing, crack depth, coating thickness, shear modulus of the coating, and
shear modulus of the substrate. The case of a periodically cracked strip is investigated separately
and the stress intensity factors under fixed-load and fixed-grip conditions are compared. Also, the
validity of the assumption made in simple energy balance calculations to the effect that the entire
strain energy contained within the volume of the cell is released during periodic cracking is studied.
It is shown that such an assumption is valid only for very small values of relative crack spacing c/b.

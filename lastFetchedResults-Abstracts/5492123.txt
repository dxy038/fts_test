Machine architectural support for the high-speed execution of Lisp has been the subject of considerable research interest. This paper presents an update on the design of BIDDLE (Bidirectional Data-Driven Lisp Engine), a multiprocessor Lisp machine based on the dataflow architecture. Some issues previously not discussed in detail in earlier publications are emphasized, namely environment maintenance, storage management, and execution characteristics

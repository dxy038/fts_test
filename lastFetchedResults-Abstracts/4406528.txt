Retaining power system safety is one of the exciting tasks for the power structure engineers. The security valuation is a crucial task as it provides the information about the system state in the occurrence of a contingency. Contingency analysis procedure is being broadly used to calculate the effect of outages like failures of equipment, transmission line etc, and to take essential actions to retain the power structure safe and reliable. The objective of the work is assortment of power system contingencies by calculating the performance index for transmission line outages with the Newton Raphson load flow analysis and radial basis function (RBF) neural network.

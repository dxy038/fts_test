The objective of this research is to develop the jump shot and offensive/or defensive decision-making system for the billiard robot by using Extension theory. The purpose is to let billiard robot posses the imitation ability of how human beings make the jump shot and offensive/or defensive decision-making in the nine ball pool games. The billiard robot will make the straight shot if there is no block ball, otherwise execute jump shot, cushion offense shot or cushion defense shot automatically. The jump shot and offensive/or defensive decision-making system can choose the best strategy in the block ball game. If the ball game is not suitable for using jump shot attack, the offensive/or defensive decision-making system will be applied to make offense cushion shot or defense cushion shot.

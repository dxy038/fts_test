The primary objective of the Esprit project Europort2 is to increase awareness of and confidence in the use of parallel high-performance computing (HPC) in business and industry. To meet this objective, the program plans to port large serial third-party and in-house codes to parallel architectures within two years, so as to create a significant competitive impact. Europort is structured into two clusters, each having a management organization and several so-called porting consortia. Europort1 is concentrating on porting structural-mechanics and fluid-dynamics codes. Europort2 has 19 consortia working on porting 24 codes from a wide range of application areas: computational chemistry, databases, oil and gas industrial simulation, computational electromagnetics, radiotherapy, Earth observation, drug design, traffic flow simulation, structural mechanics simulation, functional languages and animation. Potential benefits include more consistent data management, enhanced visualization of trends, faster access to larger amounts of data, and the ability to integrate data

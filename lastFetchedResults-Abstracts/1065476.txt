Background and Objective: The aim of OSCE is to evaluate students' clinical skills in clinical courses. Using written scenarios are common in designing OSCE stations in our country. The objective of this study was to determine the correlation of OSCE and Pre-Internship for this type of station designing.
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was done on OSCE scores of 48 fifth-year medical students.Correlation of all station scores of the OSCE exam with the Pre-Internship exam scores were calculated. To determine the internal consistency within stations, we determined each station's correlation with the total score of a student's test for OSCE.
Results: In this study, there was no significant relationship within Pre-Internship exam scores and the OSCE scores. Negative correlations were found between the model and the procedures station scores with Pre-Internship scores. Correlation coefficient of Pre-internship scores with 3 practical stations mean scores were a -0.07 (p=0.65) and its correlation with 6 stations based on written scenario scores calculated was 0.32 (p=0.02). Internal medicine with a correlation coefficient of 0.81 was the highest and eye examination station with 0.17 had the lowest correlation coefficient of internal consistency. Correlation of the two stations of neurology and surgery scores with both Pre-Internship and OSCE was significant and approximately similar.
Conclusion:  We suggest avoiding the station design based on written scenarios (without presence model or standard patient). Otherwise, OSCE should be measured the same as clinical competencies are assessed with Pre-Internship exam.

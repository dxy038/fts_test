This paper presents the optimal load sharing control method of grid connected gas engine generation system. This micro-grid system consists of engine, generator, load, grid and power converters. These components can be connected in various ways to make a micro-grid system. Several kinds of system structures are suggested and their characteristics and annual running costs are compared to decide the optimal system structure. The annual running cost can be saved by sharing the load power with gas engine generator when the electricity rate is higher than the generation cost. The system control method is proposed to achieve this objective, to minimize the annual running cost. The validity and performance of the proposed system structure and its control algorithm are verified by experimental results. These experimental results reveal excellent load sharing capability and running cost reduction

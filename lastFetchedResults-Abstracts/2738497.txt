Integrating a battery energy storage system (BESS) with a wind farm can smooth power fluctuations from the wind farm. Battery storage capacity (<i>C</i>), maximum charge/discharge power of battery (<i>P</i>) and smoothing time constant (<i>T</i>) for the control system are three most important parameters that influence the level of smoothing (LOS) of output power transmitted to the grid. The economic cost (EC) of a BESS should also be taken into consideration when determining the characteristic parameters of BESS (<i>C</i>, <i>P</i>). In this study, an artificial neural network-based long-term model of evaluated BESS technical performance and EC is established to reflect the relationship between the three parameters (<i>C</i>, <i>P</i>, <i>T</i>) and LOS of output power transmitted to the grid, the EC of BESS. After that, genetic algorithm is used to find optimal parameter combination of <i>C</i>, <i>P</i> and <i>T</i> by optimising the objective function derived from the mathematical model constructed. The simulation results of the example indicate that the parameter combination of <i>C</i>, <i>P</i> and <i>T</i> obtained by the proposed method can better not only meet the technical demand but also achieve maximum economic profit.

A 1.2&#194;&#191;m mixed analog-digital BICMOS technology has been developed and characterized, The objective of this technology is to achieve simultaneously high density CMOS logic (5V) and high performance bipolar transistors for analog applications (12V). High speed NPN and vertical PNP have, been implemented for high voltage requirements, together with the need of high frequency performance. Finally the performance of the technology is demonstrated on a RGB decoder circuit, for IDTV applications.

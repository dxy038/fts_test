Aim
The objective was to analyse the impact of secondary cytoreductive surgery in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma.
Methods

Retrospective review of 572 consecutive patients with primary ovarian carcinoma. Thirty-eight patients with intraabdominal/pelvic recurrence consisted the study group. Clinical variables affecting tumour resectability and survival were evaluated.
Results

Complete tumour resection was obtained in 42% of patients. A solitary tumour recurrence was independently associated with complete tumour resection (p=0.009). Median survival for patients with complete and incomplete tumour resection was 51.8 and 19.9 months. The parameter, residual tumour, was found independently correlated with survival after the relapse surgical procedure (p=0.02). However, including also the parameter, number of relapse tumour sites, in the multivariate analysis, the parameter, residual tumour, was no longer significantly associated with survival.
Conclusions

Complete tumour resection following secondary cytoreductive surgery is associated with improved survival in selected groups of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. However, other clinical factors than surgical cytoreduction are of considerable significance in determining the outcome of the salvage treatment.

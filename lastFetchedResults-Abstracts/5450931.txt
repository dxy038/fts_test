A universal Programmable Deep Ocean Transceiver (PDOT) is described.The objective of the development was to provide a microprocessor based system capable of data acquisition, multi-receive command and control functions, digitally controlled operational parameters, and synthesized transmit frequencies. This recoverable system is designed for use in the deep ocean, which previously could not be easily or conveniently accessed by conventional data acquisition methods. One version of the transceiver is currently in use as a Velocity Profiling System. It collects sound velocity and pressure data during free-fall descent to depths exceeding 20,000 feet, and again during ascent. By simply changing the software and modular interface electronics, virtually any type of sensor can be accommodated and any control function performed.

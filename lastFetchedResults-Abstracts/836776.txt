A generalization of the cutting plane method from convex minimization is proposed applicable to a very broad class of nonconvex global optimization problems. Convergence results are described along with details of the initial numerical implementation of the algorithms. In particular, we study minimization problems in which the objective function is increasing and convex-along-rays.

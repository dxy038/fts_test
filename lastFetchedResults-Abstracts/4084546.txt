The primary objective was to develop a laboratory test to discriminate between insulators liable to puncture and shatter and those which satisfactorily discharge the stroke by flashover and continue to operate normally after the momentary ground has been cleared. It was established that insulator failure by puncture could be obtained by repeated applications of a steeply rising voltage surge to the test specimen

Background: GTS, PTSM and ATSM are bis-thiosemicarbazone ligands used in
the preparation of copper radiopharmaceuticals. Chemical structure of these materials
indicates that they should have radio-protective effects.
Objective: To study the radio-protective effects of GTS, PTSM and ATSM.
Methods: This study has focused on radio-protective effects of these compounds
at different doses (20, 40 and 80 ?g) and with time intervals of 1 and 4 h before the
whole-body gamma-irradiation. The survival curves were plotted for different groups
after one month post-irradiation. The effective doses of these compounds were also
calculated from the survival study. In the next step, biochemical markers of hepatic
function, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were
determined in a hepatotoxicity study.
Results: Administration of ATSM did not cause any serious side effects and
hepatotoxicity in a mice modelâ€”AST and ALT enzyme levels in a group of animals
that received 80 ?g of ATSM showed no significant difference with that in the control
group. However, AST and ALT enzymes rose significantly in those mice that received
40 ?g of GTS compared to the control group even 7 days post-injection.
Conclusion: It seems that ATSM is a better candidate on which to carry out further
research for protection against irradiation.

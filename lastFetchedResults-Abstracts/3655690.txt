Our main objective is to develop user-centric services to support better governance, democratic processes, and a sustainable and balanced development of rural and urban areas around the North Sea. A bike trip example offers a detailed look at the GeoShare NetworkÂ´s technologies, including ontologies for describing vocabularies and catalogs. We also discuss about the spatial data infrastructure consisting of a spatial reasoner, a Web catalog service, distributed Web map services, and a generic Web map client and about the ontology-based search for interactive digital maps.

The main objective of the study was to identify and to analyze the influential social factors on high school students' attitudes toward cigarette smoking. Hirschi's Social Bond, Sutherland's Differential Association, and Akers's Differential Reinforcement theories provided the theoretical framework for this study. A survey method was adopted.  400 students from high school third graders in Ghaemshahr city were randomly selected based on non-proportional classified random sampling technique. The students answered the questionnaire according to self- administration technique. Some independent variables such as attachment, commitment, differential association, belief, and reinforcement association explained the variations of dependent variable. The results of the regression analysis also showed that all of the eleven hypotheses were confirmed. Among five independent variables, belief with the highest coefficient (Beta=0.24), was the most important variable for determining the attitudes toward cigarette smoking. Furthermore, such variables as differential association, commitment, reinforcement association and attachment were identified as other determining variable, respectively.

Objective: The significant factor contributing to the distant invasion of cancer cells is the
ability of tumors to produce large numbers of new blood vessels, known as angiogenesis. Many natural products inhibit angiogenesis. Herein, ethanol extract of Salvia officinalis (SO) has been analyzed for its anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferation and anti-migration activi- ties.
Materials and Methods: The anti-angiogenic effect of the SO extract was evaluated on chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) neovascularisation model, microscopically. The inhibitory effect of the extract on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) migra- tion was tested on the wound-healing model with an inverted microscope. In addition, SO extract was screened for its possible anti-proliferative effects by separately counting HUVECs, Wehi and K562 cells with cell counter against their control wells.
Results: So extract exhibited a significant inhibitory activity in CAM assay in a dose de- pendent manner. CAM angiogenesis was gradually prevented to from at 100 ?g/ml of SO extract, but completely inhibited to form at 200 ?g/ml. After human umbilical vein endothe- lial cells (HUVECs) were suppressed by dose-dependent SO extract, their migrations were detected by wound healing model, yet they were unable to show a dose response effect on proliferation of the different cells (50-200 ?g/ml). As observing in this study, SOextract could inhibit proliferation of the different cells at the concentrations above 200 ?g/ml with- out toxic effect on the cells in doses ranged from 0-500 ?g/ml.
Conclusion: These findings indicated that SO extract might be a promising candidate for anti-angiogenic treatment.

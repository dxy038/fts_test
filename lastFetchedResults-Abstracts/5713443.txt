This paper presents a tool called sequential method of analytical potentials aiming to generate dynamic gaits for biped robots. The objective is to control the different accelerations governing the evolution of the robot by modifying precisely and directly its own dynamic effects. Taking into account the intrinsic dynamics of the robot as well as the capability of its joint actuators, this method is based on the use of the dynamic propulsion potential and is illustrated on the biped robot RABBIT.

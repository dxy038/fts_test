Background and Objective: Because of the importance of happiness in giving up substance abuse the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between coping styles, negative automatic thoughts, and hope with happiness in the addicts referred to Ahvaz drug abuse rehabilitation centers. 
Materials and Methods: The study population comprised of 100 addicts whom were referred to Ahvaz drug abuse rehabilitation clinics during the year 2011.  Participants were selected by convenience sampling method and response to the Parker and Andler coping styles, Miller hope scale, Oxford happiness inventory, and Kendall and Hollon negative automatic thought questionnaires.
Results: Our results indicate that there is a significant relationship between coping styles, negative automatic thoughts, and hope with happiness in the addicts.  Regression analysis showed that predictive variables were able to predict 60% of happiness, with problem-oriented coping style and hope being the best predictors of happiness.
Conclusion: Improving problem-oriented coping style and hope can play a great role in happiness and improving the rate of rehabilitation and recovery in addicts.

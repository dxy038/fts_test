In order to find the appropriate matching pairs between knowledge demanders and knowledge suppliers, this paper researches the matching problem in knowledge service. Based on the expectation level information of demanders and the actual level information of suppliers, it is an important research topic to match the two sides in multi-attribute trade. It gives the description of multi-attribute trade matching problem between demanders and suppliers. In order to solve the problem, a calculation method of multi-attribute matching degree based on axiomatic design is proposed to analyze the matching degree between demanders and suppliers. Then, a multi-objective optimization model is constructed. The model is transformed to a single objective model by the method of weighted sums based on membership function. By solving the model, the trade matching results can be obtained. Finally, an illustrating example is given to show the feasibility and practicability of the proposed approach.

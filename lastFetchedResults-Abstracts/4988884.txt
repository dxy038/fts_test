In this paper, we consider a power-aware multimedia communications over internet of things (IoT). Specifically, we consider a generic IoT scenario where a multimedia server provides heterogeneous applications without knowing the applicationÂ´s quality of experience (QoE) model and playout period. Our objective aims at dynamically adjusting the power allocation for each application over a uncertain period to maximize the system overall mean opinion score (MOS). Note that the practical QoE model can be observed over time, but the underlying functional relationship between the power and MOS is unknown. The highlight of this paper is to develop a dynamic powering algorithm, in which one learns the satisfaction function and optimizes power-aware user satisfaction with on-line operation. More precisely, the proposed algorithm performance is measured in terms of loss which denotes the MOS loss compared to the optimal one. Numerical simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

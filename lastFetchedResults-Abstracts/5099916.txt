In the blending process of raw slurry, raw materials including red slurry, blending ore, limestone and alkali powder are grinded and blended in mills to produce raw slurry. The objective of optimizing operation control is to make the quality indices of raw slurry extent within their target value ranges. For there exit synthesis complexity characteristics in the blending process, the quality indices of raw slurry is difficult to be effectively controlled by the existing control methods. Combining the technologic computation model and fuzzy reasoning approach, the optimizing operation control is proposed, which consists of setting layer and loop control layer. Base on the control approach, the optimizing control system is designed and developed. Application results of the control system show that the quality of raw slurry is improved.

Abstract
Kormanji dialect of Khorasan is a variant of northern Kurdish language branches which according to un-official census has an approximate speaker of 1.7 to 2 million people, and is spoken in different places in Khorasan for example: Ghoochan, Shirvan, Bojnord, Esfarayen, Chenaran, farooj, Bajgiran, Dargaz, Kalat, Looji, Raieen, Jovein, Mane & Samalghan, Raz & Jargalan, Jajrom’s Garme & Radakan and even limitedly in Mashhad. This dialect’s distinctive trait comparing to other branches of Kurdish language is that it still embodies most of the syntactic characteristics of Iranian ancient languages. Syntactic study of this dialects helps to preserve it from collapsing and reducing the range of changes which are due to neighboring un-Iranian languages like Turkish and Arabic. In the following syntactic study, first of all we explain the different syntactic conditions from Kibort’s point of view and then we give examples for each of them from Kormanji dialect of Khorasan and we demonstrate that despite having diverse and sporadic condition systems, it has the benefit of dominant mixture of subjective-objective and Ergative verb systems at the same time.

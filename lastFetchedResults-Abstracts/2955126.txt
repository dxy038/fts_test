This paper describes an operating principle and features of a parallel resonant DC link circuit with active voltage clamped PWM control strategy. In particular, a new conceptual design procedure of resonant DC link treated here is discussed including a practical design example under a zero voltage and zero current soft switching condition. In this paper, bidirectional power flow controlled three phase voltage-fed type PWM converter with a resonant DC link which is connected for utility-interfaced battery energy storage system is analyzed and evaluated for load leveling, battery charging, instantaneous reactive current compensation and active power filtering schemes, together with their digital control implementation. Finally, the system performances in space vector modulated active PWM converter mode or inverter mode as well as the effectiveness of this resonant DC link circuit topology and resonant DC link voltage-fed three-phase power converter as interactive conditioner are demonstrated on the basis of the system simulation results in case of operating at multi-functional operation modes

The objective of this paper is not only to monitor, configure and control the immediate situation, but also to continually collect and assess information-so inter-and intra-service communications must be available throughout the chain of command. Vital decision-based on the current status and location of every available resource-must be centrally coordinated. Military communications should be quickly reconfigured with optimum survivability potential regardless of the particular configuration. Not only the initial speed of response, but also the rate at which fresh intelligence reports can be assimilated is crucial. To apply this intelligence in the most effective manner requires a unique mix of communications technology, systems integration and software know-how. Without fail-safe communications, todayÂ´s command and control centers would be unable to monitor operations, assess developments, allocate resources, establish plans or execute actions. To meet these communication needs, systems engineers analyze the requisite traffic load and establish variable connections between a complex set of components ranging from sensors to voice and data transmission links, data processing centers and distribution networks

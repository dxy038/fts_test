The Single Pedestrian Light is an all-in-one pedestrian light, which is capable of simultaneously displaying a walk or stop sign and real time countdown information on the same screen of a pedestrian light. The main objective of the Single Pedestrian Light is to save energy, cut cost, protect the environment, reduce wastages and improve road safety. To examine the Single Pedestrian Light with different criteria such as law, safety, economization, energy saving, environmental regulations were carried out in this study. The results showed that the Single Pedestrian Light was complied with the Green Policy. Accordingly, the Single Pedestrian Light is able to replace the conventional pedestrian lights on the road. That means the era of unified standard traffic display has come.

A method for measuring bodies of rotation in the cylindrical coordinate system is considered. This method possesses many advantages such as high efficiency and high reliability. However cylindrical CMMs suffer from some specific problems due to their complexity in construction and long structural loops. Error compensation gains special importance in cylindrical CMMs. To limit these deficiencies, new techniques for compensating the parallelism errors between the measuring column axes and the rotary axis, and for compensating thermal errors utilizing reference object measurements and bidirectional measurements have been developed. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is proven by experiment and practice.

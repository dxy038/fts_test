Background. According to Prochaska's transtheorical model, the stage of action is a milestone in the long-term smoking cessation process. Describing smokers' variables preceding this stage is essential.

Methods. A retrospective case-study design using data from the FAMUS primary care register. The objective was to develop a predictive model for the smoker's action of quitting smoking. The quit-attempt rate (QAR) is defined as the proportion of patients who attempted to quit at least once during the follow-up period. Tree-based and logistic regression models were applied to 7,567 smokers with at least two recorded visits.

Results. The QAR is 25% and is higher for men (26.5%) than for women (24.5%). For men, the groups generated by the trees are light (≤3 cigarettes), moderate (4–15), or heavy smokers (>15). For women, the pattern observed involves four groups: very light (1 cigarette), moderate–low (2–10), moderate–high (11–20), and heavy smokers (>20). In both cases, the QAR decreases from light to heavy smokers, and the number of cigarettes, nicotine replacement therapy, and age remain relevant factors predicting the QAR.

Conclusions. Medical professionals should consider smoking an addiction and take specific approaches to smoking cessation based on age, gender, and cigarettes consumed.

The main objective of this paper is to develop and experimentally verify a method of identifying the faulty phase in a three-phase armature of an induction motor with concentric coil construction, when such an armature suffers from an inter-turn within one of its phases. This work leads to a new technique for identifying the faulty phase in concentric wound machines and estimating the associated fault severity without any requirement for additional sensors, wiring constrains, or knowledge of any other details of the machine design. The technique has been verified through several experimental test results

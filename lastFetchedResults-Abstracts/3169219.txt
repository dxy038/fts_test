Summary from only given. In this paper, a bidirectional Cuk converter with active clamp is introduced. The bidirectional Cuk converter has the advantage of low ripple in input and output currents in addition to the ability of reversing the direction of current flow. By applying a simple auxiliary circuit using only one auxiliary switch, soft switching condition is achieved for all semiconductors elements regardless of the power flow direction and without any significant additional voltage or current stresses. The proposed converter is fully analyzed and the presented simulation results justify the converter analysis.

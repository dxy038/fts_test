This study aims to explore the potential of ENVISAT ASAR satellite and Google Earth data for three-dimensional (3D) urban slum reconstruction in developed countries such as Egypt. The main objective of this work is to exploit 3-D automatic detection algorithm for urban slum in ENVISAT ASAR and Google Erath images using Fuzzy B-spline algorithm. The results show that the fuzzy algorithm is the best indicator for chaotic urban slum as it can discriminate between them from its surrounding environment. The combination of Fuzzy and B-spline then used to reconstruct 3-D of urban slum. The results show that urban slums, road network, and infrastructures are perfectly discriminated. It can therefore be concluded that the fuzzy algorithm is an appropriate algorithm for chaotic urban slum automatic detection in ENVSIAT ASAR and Google Earth data.

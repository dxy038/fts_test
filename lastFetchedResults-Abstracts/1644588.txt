An entire concrete waste reuse model for producing recycled aggregate class H concrete was established with the objective of recycling concrete waste generated during anticipated demolition of older buildings in urban areas. In a redevelopment project of Obayashi Technical Research Institute, a 24-year old building was demolished and concrete waste was used to produce high-quality recycled fine and coarse aggregate using a heat grinder system. Then the quality of concrete using these recycled materials was tested and applied to fair-faced concrete structures of a new building. Fine powder, a by-product in the recycling process, was also reused as a material for clay tiles to cover the floor of the new building. This model enabled all the concrete waste to be recycled.

Abstract

Background: Using Agrobacterium  rltizogenes due to create hairy roots, is a userul method to
increase secondary metabolites many plants.
Objective: Purpose of this research  is to transgenic  hairy  roots culture, in order to produce
secondary metabolites in Datura imwxia.
Methods: Explants leaf and cotyledon of Datura imwxia were inoculated for two months with A7. A4 and 15834 strains of Agrobacterium rlthogenes; Furthermore injection and Immersion methods were used in this scrutiny. The presence ofT-DNA in transgenic hairy roots were confirmed by PCR. Transgenic hairy roots in liquid medium or l/2MS were cultured. In order to induct elicitors, methyl jasmonate in tow densities or SO tM and IOOJ1M, and salicylic acid in three densities or lmM, O.lmVI and 0.01 mVI were used randomly three times. Atropine and scopolamine content of transgenic hairy roots were examined by HPLC.
Results: The highest and lowest rate of tr-dnsgenic hairy roots production was respectively related to the strains of A4 and 15834. Best explants for inoculation, lear with A4 strain and cotyledon with A7 strain, were reported. With highest production rate of hairy roots, Simple deposit using a syringes method was recognized as the best method of inoculation. The effect of salicylic acid at a density of 0.1 mM increases the content of atropine concentrations. Also the results showed that usage of Methyl jasmonate nt higher doses (100 tM) reduces the content or atropine and scopolamine.
Conclusion: A. rltizogenes as an appropriate method to produce hairy roots and elicitors the
best treatment for increase alkaloids.

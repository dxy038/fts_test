A method of indirect calorimetry is proposed that attempts to better quantify the energy expenditure associated with heavy/severe exercise and the recovery from that exertion. To accomplish this objective, the energy expenditure associated with rapid anaerobic glycolysis is separated from that of mitochondrial respiration both during and after heavy/severe exercise. This model contrasts with those hypotheses that employ oxygen uptake as the sole measure of energy expenditure (e.g. the oxygen debt) or that utilizing a measure of anaerobic energy expenditure while ignoring the recovery energy expenditure. Anaerobic metabolism and its energy promoting effect on oxidative recovery must be independently acknowledged regardless of the eventual fate of lactate.

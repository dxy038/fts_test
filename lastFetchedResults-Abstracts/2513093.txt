<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Objective:</strong> The aim of this study was to determine men’s knowledge, attitudes and practice towards family planning in a province of north-eastern Turkey. <br /><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> This descriptive research was carried on 801 volunteers amongst men of reproductive age living in a city with a total population of 80,000 men. Data were gathered using a self-administered questionnaire that addressed men’s roles, attitudes and behaviors towards family planning. <br /><strong>Results:</strong> The most commonly used contraceptives were condom (36.8%) and withdrawal (27.3%) methods in single men. Married men reported relying more on female methods and they were more satisfied with the method they used. The idea of shared responsibility in family planning was more appreciated by single men. The role of family as a source of knowledge about family planning was low in both groups. Married men were more against vasectomy and condom while single men had more negative attitudes towards using hormone pills for men if produced in the future.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Comprehensive projects are needed to improve male participation in family planning, especially in male dominant cultures. This must be seen as a golden key in the reproductive health programs.</p>

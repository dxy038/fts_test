In this paper, we focus on increasing the throughput and diversity of network coded MIMO transmissions in bidirectional multi-pair wireless relay networks. All nodes have multi-antenna capability. Pairs of nodes want to exchange messages via a relay having multi-antenna and encoding/decoding capability. Nodes transmit their messages to the relay in the first (MAC) phase. The relay decodes all the messages and XORs them and broadcasts the XORed message in the second (BC) phase. We develop a generalized framework for bidirectional multi-pair multi-antenna wireless network coding, which models different MIMO transmission schemes including spatial multiplexing (V-BLAST), orthogonal STBC (OSTBC), and non-orthogonal STBC (NO-STBC) in a unified way. Enhanced throughputs are achieved by allowing all nodes to simultaneously transmit at their full rate. High diversity orders are achieved through the use of NO-STBCs, characterized by full rate and full transmit diversity. We evaluate and compare the performance of VBLAST, OSTBC, and NO-STBC schemes in one-dimensional 1-pair linear network (one pair of nodes and a relay) and two-dimensional 2-pair `crossÂ´ network (two pairs of nodes and a relay).

A novel MTJ stack employing a bidirectional switching mechanism has been proposed. By using a pulsed bidirection current, an MTJ with a SAF free layer and AP fixed layers can be switched through a metastable ferromagnetic state. Numerical simulations suggest high readability (like single barrier structures) and writability (like double barrier structures) of the proposed device.

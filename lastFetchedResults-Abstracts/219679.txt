When conducting research in the area of bone health, accurate
measurement of calcium intake is crucial. The rapid assessment
method (RAM) is one technique that has frequently been used
for its measurement of calcium intake. However, the RAM and
other currently established questionnaires lack the assessment of
dietary supplement use, which is common for athletes. Our
objective was to evaluate the validity of a RAM questionnaire
designed to assess daily calcium consumption which was further
modified to meet the needs of athletes who frequently consume
dietary supplements. Usefulness of the modified RAM for athletes
and non-athletes was evaluated as well as utility among
those who do and do not use supplements. The 47 volunteers (n
= 31 women, 16 men) were between the ages of 18 and 25 including,
33 athletes and 14 controls. The population also contained
23 supplement users and 24 non-supplement users. Participants
completed the modified RAM and were instructed to
complete a three-day diet record (3DR), logging food intake for
2 weekdays and 1 weekend day. The data collected via the
modified RAM was compared with the 3DR. Mean calcium
intake was 935mg ± 420mg and 1085mg ± 573mg, for the modified
RAM and 3DR respectively. A strong positive correlation
(r) was found between calcium intake measured with the modified
RAM and 3DRs (r(45) = 0.854, p < 0.01). Intraclass correlation
coefficients (ICC) revealed that agreement between the
two instruments was good (ICC = 0.76, df = 45, p < 0.01) and
much improved when compared to agreements without consideration
of supplements (ICC = 0.05, df = 21, p > 0.05). We have
found the modified RAM to be a valid tool which can be used to
estimate calcium intake in the athletes and controls we strive to
study. The accuracy of this instrument improved by including
assessment of dietary supplement sources of calcium.

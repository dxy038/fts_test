Objective(s):Diabetes plays an important role in the induction of the liver injury. Grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) have a wide range of medicinal properties against oxidative stress. In this study we evaluated antioxidant effects of GSP on liver in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: Thirty male Spragueâ€“Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control, untreated diabetic and diabetic rats treated with GSP. Diabetes was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). GSP were administered via oral gavage (200 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Results: GSP produced significant hepatoprotective effects by decreasing activities of serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase, and decreasing liver malondialdehyde and bilirubin (P<0.05) levels. It increased liver superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities and albumin level (P<0.05). Administration of GSP significantly ameliorated structural changes induced in liver of diabetic rats. Conclusion: GSP have protective effects against hepatic tissue injury due to antioxidant properties.

Objective (s): The aim of this study was to compare empathy components and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in students with and without vulnerable and grandiose narcissistic traits.
Methods: In this cross sectional study, a sample of 90 students was selected using the Pathological Narcissistic Inventory. The Baron-Cohen Empathy Quotient Scale and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire were used to collect data. The data were analyzed using MANOVA.
Results: The results showed that both students with grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic traits were significantly different in using 'self-blame and catastrophizing' emotion regulation strategies, compared to non-narcissistic students. Non-narcissistic students significantly used 'positive appraisal' strategies more than vulnerable students. There was a significant difference in cognitive empathy and emotional reactivity, between grandiose and non-narcissistic students. Vulnerable and grandiose students were significantly different only in cognitive empathy. 
Conclusion: The findings provide support for the idea that grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are different expressions of the same pathology, and their expression depends on the individual defensive structure.

The rapidly increasing complexity of tasks robotic systems are expected to carry out underscores the need for the development of motion planners that can take into account discrete changes in the continuous motions of the system. Completion of tasks such as exploration of unknown or hazardous environments often requires discrete changes in the controls and motions of the robot in order to adapt to different terrains or maintain operability during partial failures or other mishaps. The contribution of this work toward this objective is the development of an efficient motion planner for a hybrid robotic system. The controls and motion equations of the robot could change discretely in order to enable the robot to operate in different terrains. The framework in this paper blends discrete searching with sampling-based motion planning for continuous state spaces and is well-suited for robotic systems modeled as hybrid systems with numerous discrete modes and transitions. This multi-layered approach offers considerable improvements over existing methods addressing similar problems, as indicated by the experimental results.

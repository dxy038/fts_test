The main objective of this paper is to put forward Granular Matrix (GrM). By the definition of GrM, all the fundamental algebraic definitions of Rough Set Theory (RST) are redefined by simple matrix operation. Furthermore, two different definitions (algebraic definition and rough membership function definition) for rough inclusion and rough equivalence are united by GrM. GrM help us understand the essence of RST and provide a simple method for boundary computation and knowledge reduction. Concrete computation examples are given to illustrate the new definition.

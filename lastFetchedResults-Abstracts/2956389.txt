First, we propose a DCT-based subband absolute moment block truncation coding (SAMBTC) method and compare its coding performance with that of QMF-based SAMBTC. Second, the characteristics of the human visual system based on the WeberÂ´s law model is incorporated into these schemes, independently. The objective is to further reduce the bit rate without incurring more noticeable degradation. By comparison with the JPEG standard, our image coders suffer much less blocking artifacts at low bit rates and obtain superior subjective image quality

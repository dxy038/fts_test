The objective of this paper is to enhance the Available Transfer Capability (ATC) from source area to sink area in deregulated power system using Continuous Power Flow (CPF) method during normal and contingency cases with optimal location and control parameter of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices such as Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) or Static VAR Compensator (SVC) on IEEE 24 bus reliability test systems. Real parameter Genetic Algorithm (RGA) is used to determine optimal location and control parameter of TCSC or SVC. ATC is dependent on many factors, such as the base case of system operation, system operation limits, network configuration, specification of contingencies, etc. FACTS technology has a severe impact to the transmission system utilization with regards to those constraints on ATC. Therefore, maximum use of existing transmission assets will be more profitable for Transmission System Operators (TSO), and customers will receive better services with reduced prices.

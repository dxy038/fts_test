The objective of the study was to determine if beef quality parameters differ between steaks in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP; 80% O2 and 20% CO2) and in vacuum packaging. Both M. longissimus dorsi (LD) from ten young bulls were cut in steaks day 3 postmortem and frozen either directly or after storage for 5 or 15 days in MAP and/or vacuum. The parameters studied were Warner Bratzler shear force, colour stability, α-tocopherol content, protein oxidation, water holding capacity and sensory attributes. Steaks stored in MAP had higher shear force than steaks stored in only vacuum at all ageing times. Tenderness and juiciness were negatively affected by storage in MAP. Ageing in MAP induced higher levels of metmyoglobin compared with vacuum ageing. In conclusion, high-oxygen MAP negatively influenced shear force, thawing loss, α-tocopherol content and colour stability, as well as the sensory attributes tenderness, juiciness and to some extent meat flavour.

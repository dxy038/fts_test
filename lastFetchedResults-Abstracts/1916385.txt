BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is a common problem that can be potential toxicity effects on the nervous system in infants, especially on the hearing ways. Regarding to hearing impairment leaves so negative effects on speech, language and cognitive development. The aim of this study was the assessment of the incidence of sensorineural hearing loss among icteric infants admitted to the hospitals of Gorgan, Iran in 2012. 
METHODS: In this longitudinal study, 223 infants were recruited by convenience sampling, that OAE screenings at the birth time was normal. Using Automated Auditory Brainstem Response (AABR) was performed for infants at the hospitalization and they were assessed after discharge, and with Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) were confirmed.
FINDINGS: The mean age of the infants on admission was 3.84±4.58 days and 55.6% of them were female. The mean birth weight was 3431±218 grams and the mean gestational age was 39±1.3 weeks. Serum total bilirubin levels in 61.4% of infants were between 12-20 mg/dL and of 38.6% were higher than 20 mg/dL. 13.0% received conventional phototherapy, 72.6% intensive phototherapy and 14.3% of patients had exchange transfusions. Totally, 8 (3.6%) of infants in admission had disturbance waves in AABR. Subsequent studies have shown improvement in 7 patients, but one patient problem still remains, and from other patients with normal admitted AABR in following 6 infants was impaired in ABR. Finally, 7 (3.1%) of hearing loss were remains. There was a statistically significant difference between the hearing loss, serum total bilirubin level and total AABR impairment result on admission and final result (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference with variable of gender and kind of delivery (p < 0.05). 
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period can cause sensorineural hearing loss. Hence, regular screening in icteric newborns seems to be necessary.

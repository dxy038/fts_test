This paper presents batteries charger methods using DSP control system. This technique is described that charge a serial string of cell during charging. In this paper, two charge modes have been activated. When a regenerative pulse charger mode starts, the charging current through the string is equal to that of the charging current 10A. If this charge mode ends, the string battery voltage reaches a threshold voltage V<inf>T</inf>. Then the equalization charge mode starts, thus maintaining the string cell at V<inf>T</inf>. This circuit topology is composed of two-stage converter, in which the first stage is a bidirectional converter and flyback converter. This charging characteristics (charging time, charging current, switching frequency, and pulse period) of different charging methods are analyzed and presented. The advantage of the hybrid converter CC/CV method is able to reduce the charging time, extend its life, reach 100% battery state of charge and avoid damage to the batteries.

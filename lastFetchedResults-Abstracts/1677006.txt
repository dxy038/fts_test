The objective of this study is to investigate the biomass gasification to produce the bio-hydrogen and syngas in a fluidized bed. α-cellulose and other agriculture waste were gasified at the temperature of 600–1000 °C with respect to different equivalent and steam to biomass ratios were studied. The yield of the bio-hydrogen, syngas, and the other products were analyzed to maximize the yield of bio-hydrogen or the syngas. A kinetic model to determine the order of the reaction and activation energy is also proposed.

t results suggested that at the equivalent ratio of 0.2 and 1000 °C without steam achieved the maximum yield of the bio-hydrogen (29.5%) and CO (23.6%). CO2 concentration at this condition is 10.9% only. The yield of the H2 and CO, which is called syngas in the industrial, can be further used for the liquid fuel production or gas cleanup to produce hydrogen.

Abstract 
The exploration of the form of the literary texts and the form-based analysis of the term 'yusof' in Hafiz poetry from a Quranic perspective is the major focus of this study. As no form-based investigation is carried out in this area, doing such a practical and native study seems to be necessary. To meet this objective, form-based entities in Hafiz poetry and the holy Quran are examined. Therefore, Hafiz terminology bases, explanation of Hafiz poetry elements, the Quranic terminology, degree and system of unity between these elements are taken into consideration. Moreover, different types of linguistic, esthetic, musical, grammatical interactions and explanation of the Quranic illusions in Hafiz poetry as the foundations of his poems, etc are investigated and approved.

In the international legal arena a legal entity means authorization of rights and
duties for non-human subject. In the Law sciences, a legal entity enjoys rights,
undertakes law obligations, does legal actions, files a lawsuit, gets under prosecution
and is also in charge of its own acts.
The Legal entity in each government depends on political, economic, social and
systematic variables of the legal system. By authorization which is in possession
of the government, law makers in internal regimes by considering social
demands adopt some institutes as legal entities and then impose them on its
ruling entities.
Therefore, the International Criminal Police Organization, INTERPOL, as an
inter-governmental organization may only have international rights if it enjoys
an international legal entity. By increasing trends of Interpol functions and activities
this article aims to clarify the issue of whether Interpol has an objective
and inherent law capacity to enforce its international actions. The Interpol rights
are limited to some goals, obligations and implied power included in its Constitution.
Moreover, it aims to investigate the Interpol legal entity.

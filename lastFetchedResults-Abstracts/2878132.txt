A new configuration of modular isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter is proposed in this paper. The proposed modular converter has interesting features such as low switching losses, bidirectional power flow, compatibility for high power applications and less number of switching devices. The simple modular structure, high frequency operation and zero voltage switching (ZVS) capability and less number of switching devices, make it suitable for high power applications. The design of the proposed converter, based on the connection of basic modules, is described and the steady state operation analysis is presented. The simulation and measurement results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed converter.

A fuel development and qualification program is in process with the objective of qualifying very high density monolithic low enriched uranium–molybdenum fuel for high-performance research reactors. The monolithic fuel foil creates differences in the mechanical and structural characteristics of the fuel plate because of the planar interface created by the fuel foil and cladding. An initial finite element analysis model has been developed to investigate worst-case scenarios for the basic monolithic fuel plate structure using typical mini-plate irradiation conditions in the Advanced Test Reactor. Initial analysis shows that the stress normal to the fuel–clad interface dominates during irradiation and that the presence of small, rounded delaminations at the interface is not of great concern. However, larger and/or fuel–clad delaminations with sharp corners can create areas of concern, as maximum principal cladding stress, strain, displacement, and peak fuel temperature are all significantly increased. Furthermore, stresses resulting from temperature gradients that cause the plate to bow or buckle in an unconstrained fuel plate configuration is greatly enhanced in a constrained fuel plate configuration. The sensitivities of the model and input parameters are discussed, along with some overlap of initial experimental observations using as-fabricated plate characterization and post-irradiation examination.

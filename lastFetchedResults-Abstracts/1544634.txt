In this paper, fault detection and isolation (FDI) in linear uncertain dynamic systems is addressed. The main contributions consist of the formulation of the FDI problem as a filter-based multi-objective optimization problem and the study of the tools used for the solution. The design objectives are formulated in terms of H ∞ , H - and generalized H 2 performance specifications as well as regional constraints on filter poles. The problem is solved using linear matrix inequality (LMI) and generalized structured singular value ( μ g ) techniques. Special design features are illustrated through a simulation example and experimental results from a controlled hydraulic process are provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed procedure.

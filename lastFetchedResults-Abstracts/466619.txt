Objective: Presentation of outcomes of pelvic arterial embolization for hemorrhage after spontaneous or induced abortion. Study Design: We collected case reports of embolization after spontaneous or induced abortion from oral presentations and from members of the National Abortion Federation. Results: Pelvic arterial embolization was performed for 11 women who had hemorrhage after spontaneous or induced abortion, and it was initially successful for all women. One woman ultimately required a hysterectomy after unsuccessful repeated embolization. Prophylactic embolization was done for 8 women who were at risk for hemorrhage from placenta accreta; 4 of these women had subsequent hysterectomies. Conclusions: Selective pelvic arterial embolization may be a successful treatment for hemorrhage associated with spontaneous and induced abortion. Embolization can be considered before hysterectomy is undertaken for control of hemorrhage. There may be a role for prophylactic catheterization or embolization when there is a risk of severe hemorrhage. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:530-6.)

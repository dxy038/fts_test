This paper deals with electromagnetic design and three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic field analysis of a novel configuration brushless DC (BLDC) field assisted machine based on a hybrid analytical and 3-D finite element method (FEM) analysis. Aid of this hybrid design method is improving the accuracy and computation time for complex magnetic structure like to presented machine structure. In this hybrid design methodology obtained primary magnetic and electric characteristics including magnetic flux density, flux linkage and induced Back-EMF profile for studied configuration are verified by 3-D FE computation. Comparison of the calculated magnetic field and terminal voltage characteristics by their requested values and obtained values form analytical analysis respectively illustrates the conformity of design parameters stage. In this study in order to determine the optimum operation, geometry parameter of proposed machine are optimized based on multi objective optimization design and genetic algorithm, and finally 3-D FEM verification coupled by boundary integral equation method (BIEM). Additionally the accuracy of 3-D FE analysis is verified by comparing the calculated results with the experimental measured values.

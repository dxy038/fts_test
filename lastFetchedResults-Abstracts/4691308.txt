Using Segmented Finite Difference in Time Domain (SFDTD) method, Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) induced inside a three layered spherical human head model exposed to a 100 W Base Station Antenna (BSA) at GSM900 band has been calculated. Maximum local 1-g SAR has been calculated at the frequency range of 650 MHz to 1350 MHz, keeping distance between head and BSA equal to 1.0 m. The human head is modelled as an inhomogeneous sphere of diameter 21.0 cm. The objective of this study is to estimate maximum local 1-g SAR induced in the human head model exposed to BSA using SFDTD method and compared that with proposed hybrid FDTD method.

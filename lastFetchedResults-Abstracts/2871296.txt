This paper designs a Characteristic Model-Based Controller for momentum management of the Space Station. The primary objective is to maximize the robustness of the controller to variations in the moment of the space station. Traditionally, it uses pole placement optimal quadratic to design control law for momentum management system. But this approach depends on the filter states and should weights combinations of attitude and momentum vectors to achieve a desired tradeoff by including entries in the same row. The characteristic model is modeling combined with the dynamic characteristics of the object modeling and control performance requirements. With the golden-section adaptive control method, the moment management of space station can be achieved easily and robustly. A numerical example is given to show the result of the golden-section adaptive controller with characteristic model over that of the classical model reference adaptive control law.

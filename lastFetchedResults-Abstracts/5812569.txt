In the recent years a lot of research effort is being spent in the areas of nanotechnology, quantum computation, and biologically inspired computing. In this miniaturized computing era, device sizes are in the range of several nanometers and hence amenable to high degree of failures. These computing designs must be evaluated from a circuit and system perspective, in terms of the four key metrics: power, performance, robustness and reliability. However, a matter of concern over here is that the technology of the small will be ridden with random faults and manufacturing defects. Hence, design strategies need to change to take into account of these hypothetical models of failures to build a robust design. The main objective of the paper is to propose two reliable solutions towards the possible faults in Molecule-based memories. One of the solutions encourages using redundant memories to sustain the defects. Another solution introduces the concept of sensing the stored data in the memory. There may be an overhead of redundancy and computation in these solutions. But it will ensure a fault tolerant system. Moreover, in this kind of miniscule technology those overheads can be tolerated and can be compensated from its high performance with low power utilization, reduced size and cost.

Retrieving information as precise and fast as possible is the great objective of all librarians. To achieve that, some tools have been developed of which indexes are an example. Indexes that have now found sophisticated forms thanks to computers, were developed in eastern library and bibliographic traditions influenced by Islam due to the high importance of Koran among Islamic societies. Concordances are examples of such indexes that have been utilized for so many years. This paper studies the concordance as well as some other tables said to belong to I'timad-Assaltanih in a copy of Koran published in 13 13 solar hegira. It also aims to show that where interest and importance have been the basis, as for Koran, sophisticated retrieving tools have been developed when nobody could even think of modern available sophisticated technologies.

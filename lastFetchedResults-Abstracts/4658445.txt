Wireless sensor networks have a wide range of applications including environmental monitoring, habitat monitoring and disaster recovery. Since sensor nodes are deployed in a large land region, the objective is to achieve complete coverage of the region. It is crucial to develop a sufficient transmission signal between the node in the region or cell to the leader node or in base station. In previous research, network coverage is the main issue in WSN. This study presents an approach for the design of wireless sensor network under the deployment of hexagonal shaped cell with sectorized antenna. The proposed approach should be regarded as part of any feasibility study during the planning stages for the deployment of a wireless sensor network, when decisions about its efficient network coverage and cost are considered. The main objective of this project is to improve the communication coverage in the network. By improving the coverage problem, it will also reduce the number of sensor nodes deployed, hence reducing the cost.

Background
Cycling is a safe and functionally effective exercise for patients with early post-stroke and poor balance. Such exercise is considered even more effective when functional electrical stimulation is added.

Our principal aim was to determine the biomechanically quantifiable parameters of cycling that can be improved in patients with subacute hemiparesis by incorporating functional electrical stimulation. These parameters were defined as objective goals that can be achieved in clinical applications. A secondary aim was to determine whether they could be used to identify subjects who would benefit from such therapy.
Methods

Using a tricycle testbed, we tested 39 subacute (mean 10.9 weeks post-stroke (SD 5.9)), hemiplegic subjects. During isometric measurements we recorded volitional and electrically evoked crank torques, the latter at maximal tolerable intensity. During ergometric measurements, volitional pedaling was alternated with combined pedaling (volitional supported by stimulation), performed at 30-s intervals. Power, smoothness, and symmetry of cycling were evaluated.
Findings

Twenty-six percent of the subjects significantly improved the smoothness of their cycling with functional electrical stimulation. Only 8% and 10% significantly increased their power and symmetry, respectively. The improvement in smoothness significantly correlated with the capability of the individual to generate electrical torque (Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient = 0.66 at P = 0.001).
Interpretation

The smoothness of cycling was the most sensitive parameter improved by functional electrical stimulation. This improvement depended on the amount of torque evoked, and the torque achieved, in turn, correlated with the tolerated intensity of stimulation.

A fiber-optic tactical local area network (FOTLAN), based on the fiber distributed data interface (FDDI), that supports data packet traffic simultaneously with synchronous traffic is described. The current US Army LAN implementation is examined, and its limitations are highlighted. An overview of a migration path from the current LAN to the ATCCS (Army tactical command and control system) objective system using FOTLAN is presented to demonstrate how such a network can evolve.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

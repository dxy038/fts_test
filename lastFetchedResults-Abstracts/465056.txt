OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the relevance of placental monoamine oxidase at the subcellular level in the etiology of the hyperserotonomic state in preeclampsia-eclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: The study was conducted on placentas from 20 normal pregnant women and 25 women with varied severity of preeclampsia-eclampsia. Placental serotonin and subcellular monoamine oxidase activity were determined. Histochemical localization of monoamine oxidase was done in placental sections and cell isolates. RESULTS: Placental serotonin increases with severity (rsystolic 0.84, rdiastolic 0.83) and monoamine oxidase decreases (rsystolic 0.86, rdiastolic 0.79). Placental monoamine oxidase showed marked changes in preeclampsia-eclampsia. Histochemical localization of monoamine oxidase showed diffused low activity evenly throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus of the syncytiotrophoblastic cells in preeclampsia-eclampsia; in contrast, normal placenta showed high activity in the cytoplasm without any activity in the nucleus of syncytiotrophoblastic cells. Detection of monoamine oxidase activity in nuclei of the placenta in preeclampsia-eclampsia is a novel finding. Monoamine oxidase activity at the subcellular level further strengthens this observation. A severity-dependent decrease was present in the nuclei of placentas with preeclampsia-eclampsia. The use of specific substrates and inhibitors revealed the presence of monoamine oxidase in mitochondria and nucleus. CONCLUSION: The study delineates an impaired catabolism of placental serotonin in preeclampsia-eclampsia. The novel appearance of monoamine oxidase in nuclei in proximity to its normal site and low activity resulting in a hyperserotonomic state may lead to preeclampsia-eclampsia.

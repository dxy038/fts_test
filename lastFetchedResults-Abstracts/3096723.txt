In this paper, a novel automatic approach for the concurrent topology and routing optimization that achieves a high quality network layout is proposed. This optimization is based on a specialized binary Integer Linear Program (ILP) in combination with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA). The ILP is formulated such that each solution represents a topology and routing that fulfills all requirements and demands of the network. Thus, in an iterative process, this ILP is solved to obtain feasible networks whereas the MOEA is used for the optimization of multiple even non-linear objectives and ensures a fast convergence towards the optimal solutions. Additionally, a domain specific preprocessing algorithm for the ILP is presented that decreases the problem complexity and, thus, allows to optimize large and complex networks efficiently. The experimental results validate the performance of this methodology on two state-of-the-art prototype automotive networks.

It was previously shown that multilevel coded modulation improves the channel performance where Ungerboeck partitioning is used. Other partitioning techniques (Block and Hybrid) were proposed by Morelos-Zaragoza et al. All partitioning techniques were used to design the codepsilas rate in AWGN. The objective is to design efficient multilevel coded modulation system with the partitioning technique that gives the best performance for multipath Rayleigh fading channel. The rate design rule is always used for AWGN channel. In this paper, the design rule is extended to multipath Rayleigh fading channel. Computer simulation technique is used to evaluate the channel performance and also to determine which partitioning technique gives the best performance. As a second step, we extend the design rule proposed by Seshadri and Sundburg to multipath Rayleigh fading channel then we compare between the two design rules by using computer simulation which was done by using Matlab(version 7).

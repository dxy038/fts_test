This work presents a novel approach to single objective optimization using the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), sometimes known as Slime Mold, as its basis. A short explanation of the biological background of Dd is presented. Inspirations taken from existing computational biology and educational simulation studies of Dd also are provided. Based upon previous works, an algorithm for optimization is constructed called the Slime Mold Optimization Algorithm.

DC Microgrid Performance Excellence in Electricity Renewal is a major stimulating result of the decade-long non-profit Galvin Electricity Initiative and its objective of demonstrating and promoting truly intelligent 21<sup>st</sup> Century &#8220;Perfect Power&#8221; electricity distribution systems. The resulting Performance Excellence in Electricity Renewal (PEER) program with DC Microgrid certification is now being formally administered by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI). The PEER program equips all electricity stakeholders with key performance capabilities, outcomes, metrics, and examples of DC Microgrid best practices. The PEER program at GBCI is also now providing a Webinar series to train PEER professionals and educate customers, stakeholders and policy makers to best universal advantage.

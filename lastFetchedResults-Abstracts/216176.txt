A new series of 3-aryl-5-(pyridin-3-yl)-1-thiocarbamoyl-2-pyrazoline derivatives (4a-j) were prepared by the reaction of
azachalcons 3a-j with thiosemicarbazide in ethanolic sodium hydroxide. The structure of synthesized compounds were
confirmed by 1H NMR and Mass spectral data. Their antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli (CTP 7624), Staphylococcus
aureus (ATCC 6538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12229), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Bacillus subtilis
(ATCC 1156) and Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 9341) were investigated. Antifungal activity of compounds against Candida
albicans and Candida globrata were found to be inactive. Compounds 4a-j were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity
against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294) in BACTEC 12B using a broth microdilution assay and Microplate
Alamar Blue Assay (MABA). The preliminary results showed that compounds 4e, 4d and 4g had 87%, 93% and 92% inhibitory
effect respectively.

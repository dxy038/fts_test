Objective
estigate changes in the bony microstructure of the upper and lower alveolar bone during masticatory loading induced by soft diet feeding in growing rats.

week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups. Rats were fed with either pellets [control group (n = 6)] or a soft diet [experimental group (n = 6)] for nine weeks. 3D-microstructure of the alveolar bone of the first molar region (M1) was examined by micro-CT analysis.
s
CT images showed increased marrow spaces of the inter-radicular alveolar bone around the rat mandibular M1 in the experimental group compared with that in the control group. The bone volume/tissue volume ratio, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, mean intercept length, trabecular width and trabecular star volume for the mandibular M1 inter-radicular alveolar bone were lower in the experimental group than in the control group. Marrow space star volume was increased in the experimental group compared with the control group.
sions
results suggest that alveolar osteopenia is more extensive in the mandible than the maxilla in rats that experience low masticatory loading during growth.

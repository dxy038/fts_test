A new method is presented for estimating the parameters of two different models of a joint. The two models are: (1) A rotational joint with a fixed axis of rotation, also referred to as a hinge joint and (2) a ball and socket model, corresponding to a spherical joint. Given the motion of a set of markers, it is shown how the parameters can be estimated, utilizing the whole data set. The parameters are estimated from motion data by minimizing two objective functions. The method does not assume a rigid body motion, but only that each marker rotates around the same fixed axis of rotation or center of rotation. Simulation results indicate that in situations where the rigid body assumption is valid and when measurement noise is present, the proposed method is inferior to methods that utilize the rigid body assumption. However, when there are large skin movement artefacts, simulation results show the proposed method to be more robust.

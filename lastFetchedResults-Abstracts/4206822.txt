This paper presents an implementation on modelling the database security using agent-based simulation (ABS). While ABS has been widely used for social simulations since the 1990s, not many previous studies have tried simulating scenarios in more technical domains and it is the main objective of this work to fill in the gap. We develop a database security simulation program that includes permission rules and immediate fixing of corrupted data. We show that when privileges are selectively granted based on certain rules and regulations, database security can be dramatically improved. We also demonstrate that if corrupted data are fixed immediately, the database will not collapse. In the concluding remarks, we present our observation on the advantages of ABS.

California has adopted a set of VOC reactivity factors for regulatory purposes that is based on a model of the ozone formation process. These incremental reactivity factors (derived by Carter) describe the amount of ozone each exhaust VOC will form under a certain set of conditions in an urban atmosphere. The main objective of this study is to measure reactivity factors using smog chamber experiments, and to compare the measurements to the Carter factors. A new facility was constructed explicitly for this study. The facility has four identical smog chambers and a temperature-controlled enclosure for the chambers. The chambers are irradiated using a set of filtered xenon arc lamps to approximate “sunlight”. The reactivities of 14 individual VOCs representative of those found in automobile exhaust and several mixtures of VOCs have been measured. The measured and Carter-reactivity factors were highly correlated, suggesting that the chemical model used by Carter accounts for the reactivities of a wide range of compounds with dramatically different uncertainties in their mechanisms. The measured results, in general, are consistent with the Carter-reactivity factors for comparing the relative reactivities of VOCs in the atmosphere. However, additional kinetic and mechanistic studies of many VOC species including aromatic isomers are needed to improve reactivity scales

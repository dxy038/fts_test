A well defined IC test setup and IC configuration is mandatory to provide EMC-related test reports of different vendors comparable and allows an objective product selection for end-users. Based on well-established international standards, the &#8220;BISS&#8221; (from &#8220;Bosch/Infineon/Siemens Specification&#8221;) working group maintains the &#8220;Generic IC EMC Test Specification&#8221;, which serves as a reference manual on how to setup repeatable electromagnetic, pulse and system-ESD tests, resulting in comparable test reports. Conducted and radiated emission and immunity tests are already well established; pulse immunity and ESD robustness measurements based on system-level tests are expected to be released in the second edition of the &#8220;Generic IC EMC Test Specification&#8221; during the first half of 2012. The paper provides an overview of this test specification and its practical application.

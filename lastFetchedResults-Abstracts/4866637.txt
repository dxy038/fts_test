A study of an alternative orthosis to prevent hand-to-knee gait is presented. The orthosis in contrast to the standard knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO) works on the principle of alignment stability by preventing an initial heel contact. Weight bearing on forefoot brings the trochanteric knee ankle (TKA) line anterior to the knee which stabilises the knee by pushing it backwards. The orthosis made of polypropylene is fairly rigid and resilient. An attempt has been made in this study to standardize fabrication technique of this orthosis. Weight &amp; cost evaluation of the orthosis has been done. Subjective analysis regarding cosmesis and acceptability or the orthosis along with objective analysis of time motion study is also presented. Results show its superiority over the conventional KAFO

In the past few years Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have proved to be a very powerful and reliable optimisation tool. They have also been successfully applied in the design optimisation of many electromagnetic devices. Therefore, in this paper the optimal design performed on the single phase permanent magnet brushless DC motor (SPBLDCM) is done by using a Genetic Algorithm. The objective function of the optimisation search is selected to be the efficiency of the motor and the design process is defined as a maximisation problem. Based on the values of some specific motor parameters, a comparative analysis of the improved motor and the initial motor design is performed. As an addition to the comparative analysis, a Finite Element Method modeling and analysis of both models is also performed.

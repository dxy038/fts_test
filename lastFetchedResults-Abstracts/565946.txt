Background and Objective: Germinated pinto bean flour (GPBF) has a high nutritional value. The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of using it instead of wheat flour in producing sausages.
Materials and Methods: Pinto beans were purchased from the local market, soaked in tap water for12 hours, and allowed to germinate at room temperature for 48 hours. The germinated beans were dried at
 50°C for 16 hours, followed by milling to prepare flour, which was stored at –18 °C. Sausages (an experimental sample) were produced according to a commercial formulation, only replacing wheat flour with germinated pinto bean flour (GPBF) at levels of 4, 8, and 12% W/W. A sample produced with wheat flour served as the control. Moisture, fat and protein contents, and color, texture, flavour, and microbiological properties of the experimental samples were determined and compared with those of the control sample.
Results: There were no statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the experimental and the control samples with regard to fat content, color, or texture. Samples produced with 12% GPBF had the highest contents of moisture (57%) and protein (12.32%) and the highest total bacterial counts (2800 cfu). The flavour of the control and the 4%-GPBF samples did not differ significantly (p < 0.05), but their flavour was better than that of the 8%- and 12%-GPBF samples (p < 0.01).
Conclusion: Using germinated pinto bean flour in preference to wheat flour in producing sausages, it would be possible to develop a product with a higher nutritional value and acceptable physical, chemical and sensory properties.

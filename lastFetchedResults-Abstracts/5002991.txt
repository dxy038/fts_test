This paper proposes a novel topology for Electrical Vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Electrical Vehicles with controllable power factor with 3-phase input and unity power factor with single phase input. The proposed on-board topology provides bidirectional power flow to/from the grid, low weight, low volume, and isolation. A control scheme is devised and a complete simulation of power control is performed over varying loads, varying input voltages, three phase or single phase input, and switching schemes. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the ability to control power flow and synthesize the grid currents to be sinusoidal.

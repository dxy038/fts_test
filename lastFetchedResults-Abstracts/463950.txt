Objective: The management of chronic vulvovaginal pain, not explicable on specific histologic grounds, presents a major problem in referral centers for lower genital tract diseases.
Study design: This article reports on a two-step protocol in a sample of 175 medical nonresponders, drawn from a 2-year cohort of 725 women with vulvovaginal pain. The first maneuver was the use of a flashlamp-excited dye laser to selectively photocoagulate symptomatic subepithelial blood vessels in 168 women; the second was the microsurgical removal of chronically painful Bartholin's glands in 52 women not responsive or not suited to flashlamp-excited dye laser photothermolysis.
Results: Dye laser response rates werer independent of whether patients manifested macroscopic focl of painful erythema (“vestibular adenitis”) or just colposcopically apparent hyperemia-ectasia of the individual blood vessels (“pruritic papillomatosis”) (55% vs 45% after a single surgical procedure; 76% vs 65% after serial retreatment; p not significant). Conversely, response rates were much lower among women in whom pressure on the Bartholin's glands produced sharp, lancinating pain (15% vs 66% after a single surgical procedure; 22% vs 93% after serial retreatment; p< 0.001). Forty-two (85%) of 50 patients with flashlamp-excited dye laser failure had deep pain; however, the impasse to progress was broken by gland removal. Final response rates were 92.5% (complete response 62%; partial response 30%) in the “surface-only” group and 80.3% in the “surface-plus-deep” group (χ2 = 14.9; p< 0.001). The major complication was acute bacterial cellulitis, occurring in the first postoperative week. Modification of the treatment protocol to include topical antibiotics with an occlusive dressing reduced the cellulitis rate from 17.2% to 2.5%. In four women (1.8%) Koebner-like exophytic condylomas also developed within 1 month of flashlamp-excited dye laser surgery.
Conclusion: The availability of a safe, efficacious, and relatively noninvasive treatment should reduce the need for resective surgery in most patients with idiopathic vulvodynia. 1995; 172; 1684–1701.)

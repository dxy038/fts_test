Abstract
Introduction: Due to dynamic of terms, their classification is challenging. The current research aims at
determining the usability of a model for automatic recognition of MeSH terms categories through
measuring their occurrence frequency within relevant and non-relevant document corpuses from PubMed.
Methods: This is a descriptive research that uses the document analysis method. MeSH and PubMed were
used to collect research data. The significancy of these resources confirms their validity. 18164 MeSHterm
and 163226 PubMed documents were selected. The both of these amounts are greater than what
Cocran function suggests. Eleven document corpuses were retrieved from PubMed. The relative ocurrence
frequencies of MeSH terms within each corpus were determined. The results were compared with the real
category of MeSH. In additions, the categories of 1 percent of MeSH terms were determined by experts in
medical domains. The frequency distribution method was used for statistical description of data. Data
were also analyzed through T and Chi-Squar tests in SPSS.
Results: Each document of PubMed on average belongs to three MeSH categoris and most of Mesh terms
occurred in all corpuses. The results confirm that the suggested method increases the probability of MeSH
category recognition. The performance of the method depends on the subject category of MeSH Term and
ranges between 3 to 67 percent. The findings also show that the medical expertises determination on the
subject category of MeSH Terms is compatible with the real categories of MeSH tree.
Conclusion: The compatibility of the subjective and objective methods for the subject category
recognition depends on the knowledge area. The subjective categorization is a quite cognitive task and
roots in human environmental experiences. This is why the machine depended models are not able to
simulate that process.

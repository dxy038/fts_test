The North American railroad industry, with the objective of improving safety and security of their operations, have been exploring the possibilities of real-time monitoring and control of trains and wayside equipment. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have emerged as the de-facto solution for most measurement and monitoring operations. However, widely used commercial WSN solutions, like ZigBee, exhibit significant delay and traffic congestion problems due to their limited range, throughput and overall capabilities. To overcome this problem we proposed a multi-tier multi-hop heterogeneous network technology, called Hybrid Technology Networking (HTN). HTN is comprised of sensors equipped with multiple complementary radio technologies in which the sensors form a cluster and communicate within their own cluster using low-power communication. Each clusterÂ´s gateway then utilizes WiFi or similar longer range technologies for inter-cluster communication. In this paper, we present the design of our HTN node representation in OPNET. Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework that accurately models the delay in the network and verify the model with simulation results. We also present relevant results that demonstrate its full functionality, and also explore the efficacy of such hybrid multi-tier multi-hop implementations.

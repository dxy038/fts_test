We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel bidirectional wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network architecture that fully utilizes the superior optical properties of an incoherent continuous-wave (CW) supercontinuum (SC) source. The proposed architecture, which incorporates low-cost Fabry-Perot laser diodes that have been wavelength locked by spectrum-sliced beams from a depolarized 130-nm-bandwidth CW SC source, is based on a unique wavelength band allocation scheme of the C-band for an optical line terminal (OLT), the L-band for optical network units (ONUs), and the U-band for channel monitoring. A cost-effective network that features a single broadband source at the OLT, and no additional wavelength- band-selective monitoring beam reflector at each ONU can be readily achieved. The experimental demonstration presented in this paper is carried out at a data rate of 622 Mb/s over a 25-km standard single-mode fiber.

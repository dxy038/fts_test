OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the effects of prolonged hypoxemia on fetal renal function and amniotic fluid volume and composition.
STUDY DESIGN: Twelve pregnant ewes underwent surgery at 115 ± 2 days after mating (term ~147 days) for the implantation of fetal vascular, bladder, and amniotic sac catheters. At 125 ± 1 days seven fetuses were studied during 6 days of hypoxemia and five control fetuses were studied over six days of normoxemia. Index values of fetal renal function and amniotic fluid volume were measured.
RESULTS: During hypoxemia fetal Sao2 and Pao2 were reduced from 60.9% ± 1.6% and 21.9 ± 0.6 mm Hg to 29.6% ± 3.8% and 14.9 ± 0.8 mm Hg, respectively. Fetal hypoxemia was associated with a transient acidemia (arterial pH 7.29 ± 0.02) at 4 hours. There were no sustained alterations in fetal urine production (9.5 ± 0.8 ml/hr/kg) or glomerular filtration rate (1.3 ± 0.1 ml/min/kg) during hypoxemia. In control fetuses the amniotic fluid volume increased over 7 days, from 717 ± 169 ml to 1031 ± 147 ml, whereas in the hypoxemic fetuses it did not change (741 ± 68 ml) over the same period.
CONCLUSION: During prolonged fetal hypoxemia in the absence of acidemia, fetal urine production is maintained, whereas the normal gestational increase in amniotic fluid volume is prevented, raising the possibility that intramembranous reabsorption of amniotic fluid is increased by hypoxemia.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:320-60.)

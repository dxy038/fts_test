The nonholonomic characteristic of space robot is used to plan the path of the manipulator, by whose motion the base attitude and the manipulator joints attain the desired states. Firstly, the functions of the joint angles are parameterized by sinusoidal functions. Secondly, the objective function is defined according to the accuracy requirement and the constraints of the system state. Finally, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search the global optimal solution of the parameters. Comparing with other methods, our approach has a number of advantages: 1) The kinematic and dynamic constraints of the manipulator are taken into consideration in the planning process; 2) The dynamic singular point doesnÂ´t affect the algorithm since only the direct kinematic equations are utilized; 3) The planned path is very smooth and more applicable in controlling the manipulator; 4) The state converges to the global optimal values. The simulation results verify the method.

Summary form only given, as follows. We are in the midst of a wireless and mobile revolution. In the near future, a typical computing environment - business, personal, scientific or educational - will provide wireless network connectivity between powerful data servers and mobile, sometimes disconnected, computers and devices. This has created exciting opportunities for developing a wide range of innovative database applications and systems. However, an open question remains: What kind of system will be capable of offering scalable data services and exhibit scalable performance? Besides advances in communications and hardware, does achieving pervasive mobile computing require innovative theories and paradigms in data management or new data engineering techniques? The objective of this tutorial is to provide an answer to the above questions by presenting the current state-of-the-research and contrasting it with the state-of-the-practice. Towards this, it will provide an overview of the commercial-state-of-the-art for supporting mobile database access and present a summary of the significant research advances in theories and techniques for mobile and wireless data access. It will also discuss some future directions in the context of pervasive and invisible computing applications.

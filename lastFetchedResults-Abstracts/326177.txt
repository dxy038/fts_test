Background: Current knowledge of the population’s sleep durations emanates primarily from questionnaires and laboratory studies. Using Actillumes, we investigated whether self-reported sleep durations were indicative of a population decline in sleep duration. We also explored illumination and activity patterns.
Methods: San Diego adults (n = 273, age range: 40–64) were recruited through random telephone calls and were monitored at home while engaging in usual daily routines.
Results: Volunteers slept an average of 6.22 hours and received an average of 554 lux (environmental illumination). The timing of sleep, illumination, and activity occurred at 2:44, 12:57, and 13:43, respectively. Irrespective of ethnicity, age, and time reference, men received greater illumination than did women, but this gender effect was not independent of work status. Women and men exhibited a similar circadian activity profile; however, women exhibited better sleep-wake patterns. Interactions between gender and ethnicity suggested worse sleep-wake patterns among minority men. An age-related decline in activity was found, but no age trend in sleep duration or illumination patterns was observed.
Conclusions: This study showed an objective population decline in sleep duration. Sociodemographic effects should be considered in analyses of sleep-wake patterns and illumination exposures.

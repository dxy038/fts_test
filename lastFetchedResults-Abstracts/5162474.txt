Fault detection capability tends to become an integral part of control system design procedures for practical engineering systems. It is thus desirable fault diagnosis/tolerance functions to also be included in the controller design. In this context, we develop a generic observer-based feedback controller where the observer-part can also generate a residual signal for fault detection purposes. The design objectives is a mixture of H<sub>infin</sub> control and H<sub>infin</sub> fault detection and isolation. This multi-objective optimization problem is then formulated using Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMI) and a sub-optimal solution is achieved via transformation to Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI). The developed approach and algorithm are verified in study of an application to a railway suspension system of ride quality maintenance.

The main objective of this research was to provide and implement Physical fitness and body type evaluation software suitable with Windows OS. This application was executed partially for Design and implementation of Physical fitness evaluation software, default norms and also the relevant formulas are applicable in calculations.

The research is of methodology type carried out in order to correct and complete the evaluation methods and also estimating the physical fitness factors and capabilities.

Through applying this research, we succeeded in designing the software capable of accurate, easy and fast measuring and evaluation of different views of physical fitness such as: maximum consuming oxygen, body fat per cent, and so BMI ( body mass index), and body type, via this software calculations, the athletes performances can be determined within complex of physical fitness maneuvers, qualitatively and quantitavely. Different and exclusive capabilities of this software provides accurate, easy and fast calculations on physical fitness, Hence this software is flexible and stable enough; therefore, it is recommended to the users and interested people to go through this software to run the related physical fitness calculations,

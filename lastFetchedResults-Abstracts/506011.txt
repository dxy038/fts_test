During the last decade, science of Forensic Genetics has provided better identification and surely information from remaining of propagators of crimes with the method of analyzing their DNA. However, collecting and unsuitable use of the DNA information may blemishes some of the ethical and legal principles such as informed consent, respect to privacy and confidence.

Some of the legislatures pass, using the information without the informed consent. The other states' statutes expressly prohibit the use of the DNA database to obtain information on investigations. The remaining states such as Iran neither expressly authorize nor prohibit such implications.

This method may violate freedom and privacy or exercise the social discrimination. To confirm ethical and legal principles of using such information, obtaining informed consent is a necessary step. On the other hand, perhaps catch of informed consent from convicted and accused persons considering to circumstances of commission of crimes is unnecessary and sometimes impossible.

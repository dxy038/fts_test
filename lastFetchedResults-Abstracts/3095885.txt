Visualization of Real-Time 3D Echocardiography (RT3DE) is currently limited by the bi-dimensional nature of conventional monitors. The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate an optimized image-processing algorithm to generate multi-view auto-stereoscopic images. Custom-made software rendered test images (n=5) on a 9-view auto-stereoscopic 3D LCD. We designed and compared two algorithms that used hardware acceleration of graphic adapters. The quality of the final 3D image with the two algorithms was comparable. This study showed that the new-generation algorithm is very efficient in processing complex rendering such as visualization of RT3DE data. This algorithm might be an enabling factor for realtime visualization of RT3DE on multi-view auto stereoscopic display, which might improve clinical imaging in a host of diseases and use of RT3DE in guidance of interventional procedures.

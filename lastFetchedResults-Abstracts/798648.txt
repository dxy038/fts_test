The main objective of this research is to investigate and assess entrepreneurship capabilities of university students in order to accredit and revise functions and missions of higher education curricula. Statistical population for this research was a group of 412 students of  Kashan University, selected by means of classified sampling method during the academic year 90-91(n=5502). Data was collected using a questionnaire, (Cronbach’s alpha questionnaire) with an estimated reliability of %89. Accordingly data were analyzed using appropriate descriptive and inferential statistics. Research findings showed that there is not a significant difference among students from different colleges in terms of entrepreneurship capabilities. However there is a significant difference between male and female students in the total score’ of entrepreneurship, risk–taking and creativity components. In addition, the findings indicated that there is no significant entrepreneurial capability difference between students of the first year and fourth year which in turn is proof of deficiency in developing students’ entrepreneurial capabilities and this is reminiscent of the importance and necessity of reform and revision of current curricula in universities and higher education centers.

OBJECTIVE: Recent technologic advances and societal acceptance have dramatically increased the use of donor eggs for infertile couples who require assisted reproductive technologies. Now many “older” couples can access assisted reproductive technologies to achieve pregnancies. We sought to evaluate the changing pattern of patients referred for multifetal pregnancy reduction as a result of donor eggs and age factors in aggressive infertility treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients undergoing multifetal pregnancy reduction from 1986 to 1996 were included and categorized by year groupings, age, and the use of donor eggs.
RESULTS: A total of 523 patients were referred for and underwent multifetal pregnancy reduction. Before 1994, only 4 of 226 (1.8%) had received donor eggs, whereas in 1994 to 1996, 29 of 297 (9.8%) had received donor eggs (χ2 =12.6, p< 0.001). Eight of 9 patients aged ≥45 years undergoing multifetal pregnancy reduction received donor eggs. There were no patients aged ≥45 years before 1994 but 9 in 1994 to 1996. Four of 9 patients aged ≥45 years with multifetal pregnancies chose reduction to singleton gestation. The proportions of patients aged ≥40 years have increased from 0% to 11% in the last 8 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The availability of donor eggs has dramatically increased the use of assisted reproductive technologies and subsequent use of multifetal pregnancy reduction in older patients. Older patients are more inclined to want reduction to singleton gestation; they cite parental demands, financial issues, and their ability to parent in their 60s and 70s as reasons for reduction to singleton gestation.

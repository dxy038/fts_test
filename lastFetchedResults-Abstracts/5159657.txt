This paper presents the implementation of distributed control in Power Systems. The structure of the Microgrid and the characteristics of the Multi-Agent Systems are outlined. The control system described will be implemented and tested in the pilot Microgrid of Kythnos island, Greece. The design and development of an Intelligent Load Controller is described. The structure of the control system, together with the algorithms developed, is presented. Primary objective of this project is to test under real-life conditions the distributed control approach for the power systems. Additionally, the ability of the agents to achieve efficient use of renewable energy sources and environmental friendly technologies, in general, is investigated.

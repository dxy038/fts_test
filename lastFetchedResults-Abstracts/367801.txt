The objective of these investigations was to develop an in vitro  test system for evaluating novel rapidly resorbable calcium phosphate ceramics of varying composition. Rat bone marrow cells were cultured on the disc-shaped test substrates for 14 days. Five calcium phosphates were examined: R1, CaNaPO4; R1/M2, composed of CaNaPO4 and MgNaPO4; R1/2, composed of CaNaPO4 and Mg2SiO4; R1 + 9% SiO2 consisting of CaNaPO4 and 9% SiO2 (wt%) and R17, Ca2KNa(PO4)2. Two studies were performed. In study I cultures were re-fed every two to three days. In study II the medium was changed daily, and calcium and phosphate concentrations of the medium were determined daily. Specimens were prepared for light microscopy and morphometric evaluation of the cell-covered substrate area, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. With all materials tested except for R1/2, an increase of cellular growth was observed after changing the medium daily. Of the different calcium phosphate ceramics tested, R17 and R1/M2 facilitated osteoblast growth and elaboration of extracellular matrix to the highest degree. The inhibition of cell growth encountered with R1 in study I and R1/2 in both studies seemed to be related to a high phosphate-ion release from these materials.

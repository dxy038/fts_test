A micromotor control integrated circuit (MCIC) which enables closed-loop control of an electrostatic micromotor is described. The MCIC consists of low-noise sense electronics designed to detect critical rotor angles to a resolution of 0.5&#176;(0.05 fF) at a 1 MHz sampling rate, and control logic which cycles the micromotor drive state during continuous rotation to maintain maximum torque, independent of the loading. The MCIC was fabricated using a 2-&#956;m, n-well CMOS process and all circuits, analog and digital, function as expected. Preliminary measurements indicate that the input-referred noise of the sense amplifier is very close to the design objective of 32 &#956;V RMS

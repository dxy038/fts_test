A mild method was developed to synthesize 6-amino-2-phenolic-9-alkyl and 9-arylpurines. The new compounds were screened for antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv. The 9-tolyl derivatives with a dimethylamino or a piperidine substituent in C6 and the 3-hydroxyphenyl or 4-hydroxyphenyl substituent in C2 were highly active against the bacilli.

This letter proposes a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based multiuser detection (MUD) for the receive-diversity aided space-time block coding (STBC) systems. Due to the receive-diversity, the signals received at the different antennas are faded independently, resulting in an independent log-likelihood function (LLF) for each antenna. To resolve the multi-objective dilemma when choosing one signal estimation for multiple receive antenna-branches, each particle updates its velocity in a Pareto optimal way. Simulations and comparisons with the genetic algorithm and the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) verified the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

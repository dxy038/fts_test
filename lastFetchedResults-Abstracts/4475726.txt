For solving service-oriented manufacturing system configuration problems, stackelberg model consist of objective functions which is based on game theory is put forward. The production costs of core enterprises serve as the leader´s goal while follower´s goal is supplier´s profit. To obtain solution of the stackelberg model effectively, double-layer GA algorithm is designed. Apart from that, a numerical case study demonstrates the validity and effectiveness of the presented game model and its related resolving algorithm.

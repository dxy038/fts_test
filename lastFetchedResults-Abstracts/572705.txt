Objective: DNA vaccinations using Her2 gene have shown some success in immunotherapy of Her2-expressing tumors, but the potency needs to be greatly enhanced. Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) have shown to be potent adjuvant in immunotherapy of tumors and affect different aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses. We utilized the adjuvant effect of gp96 and attempted to gain two aims, firstly, production of a construct containing fusion of Her2 and gp96, and secondly, investigation of gene expression in the construct using green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene.  
Materials and methods: C- terminus of gp96 gene was linked to extracellular and transmembrane (ECD+TM) domain of Her2/neu within pcDNA3, named as pGP/Her2.  GFP gene was cloned at the end of the two genes, named as pGP/Her2/GFP, for the analysis of in vitro gene expression.  Subsequently, HEK 293T cells were transfected with pGP/Her2/GFP using polyfect. 
Results: Restriction endonuclease digestion confirmed the fidelity of the constructs.  Microscopic view of the HEK 293T cells transfected with pGP/Her2/ GFP showed GFP protein production, while negative control cells transfected with pcDNA3 did not.
Conclusions: The constructs were successfully developed, as GFP production showed that the genes located before GFP gene in the construct can be expressed.  In addition, it was shown that in comparison with the currecnt methods (such as western blot and RT-PCT), investigation of gene expression using GFP gene is a simple method with lower cost. The construct could be used in immunotherapy of Her2-positive tumor animal models.

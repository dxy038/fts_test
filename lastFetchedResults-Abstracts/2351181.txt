Cone crushers are used in the aggregate and mining industries to crush blasted rock. In order to design the latest cone crushers, using equations of motion and population balance models, new designs of cone crusher chamber geometry are introduced to achieve chamber optimization. Several models are investigated by analyzing the internal relationships between the main machine parameters (including speed of eccentric shaft, eccentricity, length of parallel strip, base angle of cone) and the chamber, output and size reduction. Multi-objective models of the crushing chamber, output and size reduction based on new output calculation methods, population balance models and interparticle breakage is accomplished, which provide the theoretical basis for developing the latest cone crusher models. Optimization results are also applied to improve the existing PYB1750 cone crusher, and the validity and reliability of these models are verified by the manufacturerâ€™s full-scale prototype test.

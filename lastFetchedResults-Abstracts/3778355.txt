One of the most important problems of hybrid h-p adaption in finite element electromagnetics has been the accurate and efficient resolution of the singularities associated with sharp material edges and corners. One of the key obstacles has been the lack of objective standards by which to evaluate and compare adaptive control strategies. A set of optimal adaption benchmarks for the fundamental electromagnetic point and line singularity models is presented. The primary adaption procedures and control schemes are evaluated and compared. The absolute and relative performance of the competing approaches is discussed

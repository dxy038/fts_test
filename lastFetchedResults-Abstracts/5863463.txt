An ad-hoc network is formed by a collection of mobile nodes without any centralized access point or existing infrastructure. Communication between mobile nodes requires routing over the multiple-hop wireless path. Since the mobile nodes could be of high mobility, the effective and adaptive routing protocol must have on-going detail of the topology information. However, it wastes limited bandwidth to keep routing information up-to-date and reliable. Thus, a crucial algorithm design objective to achieve routing responsiveness and updating efficiency is the minimization of reaction to mobility. This paper proposes an efficiently repairable routing protocol, called as gravitational cluster routing (GCR) protocol. It is based on a stable cluster structure that covers dense areas to increase stability, and avoids articulate nodes in the cluster to connect strongly and adopts unicast to minimize reaction to mobility. The active routing paths of GCR can be maintained locally by individual stable clusters and globally by quantifying the corresponding repairable levels to satisfy the distinct demand parameters of QoS. These mechanisms improve the stability of active connections.

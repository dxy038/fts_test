Deterministic attitude estimation methods based on vector observations are used for the coarse-attitude calculation of the sun-pointing satellites. The objective of the deterministic attitude estimation is to get the direction cosine matrix without considering the stochastic noises. The existing deterministic attitude estimation methods require two complete (three-axis) vector observations corresponding to two known reference vectors. This letter suggests a new deterministic attitude estimation method using only geomagnetic-field measurements on two axes for sun-pointing satellites in the sun-acquisition mode.

We consider the optimal circuit routing problem. The problem consists of accommodating a given circuit demand in an existing circuit-switched network. The objective is to find a circuit accommodation providing the maximum residual capacity over the network under the total circuit cost constraints. Practical considerations require a solution which is robust to the variations in circuit demand and cost. The objective function for the circuit routing problem is not a smooth one. In order to overcome the difficulties of nonsmooth optimization, a sequence of smooth convex optimization problems is considered. The optimal algorithm for the circuit routing problem is obtained as a limiting case of the sequence of the optimal routing strategies for the corresponding smooth optimization problems. The proof of its convergence to the optimal solution is given. This optimization algorithm is capable of efficiently handling networks with a large number of commodities. It also satisfies the above-mentioned robustness requirements. Numerical results are discussed.

Focuses on approximating object part shapes by distinctive types of volumetric primitives. Shape approximation is accomplished by fitting volumetric models called `parametric geonsÂ´ to multiview range data of single-part objects and classifying the fitting residuals. Parametric geons are seven qualitative shape types defined by parameterized equations which control the size and degree of tapering and bending. Model fitting is performed by minimizing an objective function which measures the similarity in both size and shape between models and objects. Multiple view data, global shape constraints and global optimization are employed to obtain unique models and to compensate for noise and minor variations in object shape. This approach has been studied in experiments with both synthetic 3D data and actual rangefinder data of perfect and imperfect geon-like objects

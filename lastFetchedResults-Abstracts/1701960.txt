The main objective of the present paper is to study different theological perceptions in Attar’s mystical thought and its ethical and ritualistic requirements. First of all, in Attar’s theology, three perceptions of God are not provable: God beyond personification and lack of personification, personified and imprersonified God. Secondly, among the said perceptions, it is possible to establish ethical and ritualistic relationship only with personified God, for this relationship requires two conditions, i.e. personification and human-likeness, which only personified God can have. Since personified God in Attar’s approach, besides human-like attributes has non-human-like attributes too which are beyond rational and ethical rules, we face some sort of incompatibility in ethical and ritualistic relationship with God.

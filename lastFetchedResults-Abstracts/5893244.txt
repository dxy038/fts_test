This paper proposes an image interpolation algorithm exploiting sparse representation for natural images. It involves three steps: (a) obtaining an initial estimate of the high resolution image using linear methods like FIR filtering, (b) promoting sparsity in a selected dictionary through thresholding and (c) extracting high frequency information from the approximation and adding it to the initial estimate. For the sparse modeling, a shearlet dictionary is chosen to yield a multi-scale directional representation. The proposed algorithm is compared to several state-of-the-art methods to assess its objective as well as subjective performance. Compared to the cubic spline interpolation method, an average PSNR gain of around 0.7 dB is observed over a dataset of 200 images.

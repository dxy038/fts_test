In cognitive Ad Hoc networks (CAHN), because the contentions and mutual interferences among secondary nodes are inevitable as well as secondary nodes usually have limited power budget, spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency are critically important to the CAHN, especially for the medium access control (MAC) protocol design. Aiming at improving both spectrum and energy efficiencies, we in this paper propose a diversity technology called Channel-Aggregation Diversity (CAD), through which each node can utilize multiple channels simultaneously and efficiently allocate the upper-bounded power resource with only one data radio. Based on the proposed CAD technology, we further develop a CAD-based MAC (CAD-MAC) protocol, which enables the secondary nodes to sufficiently use available channel resources under the upper-bounded power and transmit multiple data packets in one transmission process subject to the transmission-time fairness constraint. In order to improve the performance of CAHNs, we propose two joint power-channel allocation schemes. In the first scheme, we aim at maximizing the data transmission rate. By converting the joint power-channel allocation to the Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem, we derive the optimal allocation policy through dynamic programming. In the second scheme, our objective is to optimize the energy efficiency and we obtain the corresponding allocation policy through fractional programming. Simulation results show that our proposed CAD-MAC protocol can efficiently increase the spectrum and energy efficiencies as well as the throughput of the CAHN compared with existing protocols. Moreover, the energy efficiency of the CAHN can be further improved by adopting the energy efficiency optimization based resource allocation scheme.

Objective: Our purpose was to describe the lymphocyte subpopulations in genital tract samples from human immunodeficiency virus-infected women and the clinical correlates associated with lymphocyte shedding.
Study Design: Genital tract samples of women infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 were processed for immunophenotyping analysis with a FACScan flow cytometer. Immunologic and virologic characteristics of women with and without lymphocyte shedding were compared with t test, Wilcoxon rank test, or Fisher's exact test.
Results: The rate of genital lymphocyte shedding among human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected women was 39%. Genital shedding was not related toage, race, use of antiretroviral therapy, or positive human immunodeficiency virus-1 culture. A negative rank correlation (r=âˆ’0.71, p=0.047) between CD3+CD4+ counts in peripheral blood and genital tract was observed. The majority of the lymphocyte cells were CD3+CD8+, and >80% of the CD3+CD4+ cells were memory cells.
Conclusion: The immune profile of the genital tract lymphocytes is suggestive of a local mucosal immune response.

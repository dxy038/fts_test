Setting the balance of working station at an assembly line and the minimum time of bottlenecks as the objective, and the number of procedures and the time at working station as constraints, we establishes a mathematical optimum model at clothing assembly line in this paper, So, it is of major immediate significance to set different weights in dual objective function and analyze a case using the software.

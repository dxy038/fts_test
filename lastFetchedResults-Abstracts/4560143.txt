In multi-objective engineering optimization, it is very rare that there exists a unique ideal solution that covers every aspect of the problem. Thus, it is very useful for the decision maker to have multiple options prior to the selection of the best solution. In this work, a novel evolutionary normal boundary intersection (ENBI) method is introduced to identify optimal solutions to the green sand mould system problem. The ENBI method provides a uniform spread of the Pareto frontier in which multiple solutions with gradual trade-offs in the objectives are obtained. Some comparative studies were then carried out with the previous work. Analysis on the performance of the algorithm as well as the solution spread was done.

A new piezoelectric friction damper is designed and fabricated in this paper in order to reduce the structural damage under the earthquake. The piezoelectric friction damper is regarded as the control device, self-tuning fuzzy control algorithm have been proposed for vibration control, the control objective is to minimize both the maximum displacement and acceleration responses of the structure, interactive relationships between structural responses and input voltages of piezoelectric friction dampers are established by using the self-tuning fuzzy controller. The equation of scaling factor is established, considered the influence of the absolute value of the ground acceleration through self-tuning fuzzy controller, the scaling factor of the basic fuzzy control are self-tuned online. Numerical simulations for multiple damper cases are given to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the self-tuning fuzzy control.

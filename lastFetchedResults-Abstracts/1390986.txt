The objective of this study was to compare forces and pressure profiles beneath a conventional dressage saddle with a beechwood spring tree and a treeless dressage saddle without a rigid internal support and incorporating large panels and a gullet. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference in the force and pressure variables for the two saddles. Six horses were ridden by the same rider using the conventional dressage saddle and the treeless dressage saddle in random order and pressure data were recorded using an electronic pressure mat as the horses trotted in a straight line. The data strings were divided into strides with ten strides analyzed per horseâ€“saddle combination. Variables describing the loaded area, total force, force distribution and pressure distribution were calculated and compared between saddles using a three-factor ANOVA (P &lt; 0.05).

t area and force variables did not differ between saddles but maximal pressure, mean pressure and area with pressure &gt;11 kPa were higher for the treeless dressage saddle. The panels of the treeless dressage saddle provided contact area and force distribution comparable to a conventional treed saddle but high pressure areas were a consequence of a narrow gullet and highly-sloped panels. It was concluded that, even with a treeless saddle, the size, shape, angulation, and position of the panels must fit the individual horse.

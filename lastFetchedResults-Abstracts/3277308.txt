In this paper we tackle the problem of virtual machine (VM) placement onto physical servers to jointly optimize two objective functions. The first objective is to minimize the total energy spent within a cloud due to the servers that are commissioned to satisfy the computational demands of VMs. The second objective is to minimize the total network overhead incurred due to: (a) communicational dependencies between VMs, and (b) the VM migrations performed for the transition from an old assignment scheme to a new one. We study different methodologies for solving the aforementioned problem. The first approach is based on VM packing algorithms that optimize the above objective functions separately, reaching a single solution. The other approach is to tackle simultaneously the two optimization targets and define a set of non-dominating solutions. Performance evaluation using simulation experiments reveals interesting trade-offs between energy consumption and network load.

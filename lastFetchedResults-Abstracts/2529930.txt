To measure the motor skills of the children, 3 gross and fine motor skills measurement scales and body balance skill measurement were used. Descriptive and analytical statistics such as mean, standard deviation and multivariable variance was mainly used   Results: there was a meaningful difference in the gross and fine motor skills and body balance skill, (p<0.0001), between the NC and ID, autism and children with LD. Also among children whit special needs, children with LD earned the maximum points in all of the skills and autism children earned the minimum points.   Conclusions: According to the findings of the study, motor skills and body balance of children with learning disorder, autism and Intellectual disability is weaker than normally children’s.

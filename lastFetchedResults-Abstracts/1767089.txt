The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that resorbable radio-opaque bioactive glass markers can be used in radiostereometric analysis (RSA). Cones made from (1) bioactive glass 1-06 with 2.5 wt.% BaSO4, (2) glass 1-06 with 10 wt.% BaSO4, (3) glass 1-06 without any additives and (4) nearly inert glass were created. The in vitro surface reactivity, as a surrogate of bioactivity, was analyzed using a simulated body fluid (SBF) immersion test. The in vivo performance was evaluated in the rat femur using biomechanical testing as well as histological and microcomputed tomography analysis of marker incorporation into bone. A phantom model RSA study using a porcine radius with a soft tissue envelope was carried out to determine the accuracy and precision of spherical markers for the measurement of fracture micromotion. SBF immersion studies and bone implantation studies showed that the addition of BaSO4 slightly reduced surface reactivity in vitro and the bone-bonding properties of the bioactive glass in vivo. In the simulated RSA study with the selected resorbable marker composition (bioactive glass with 10 wt.% BaSO4), the accuracy of translation and rotation measurements in the longitudinal axis was ±51 μm and ±0.87°, respectively. The precision of translation and rotation measurements in the longitudinal axis were 9 μm and 0.18°, respectively. Bioactive glass markers with BaSO4 additive appear to have adequate bone-bonding properties for marker stability and sufficient radio-opacity for RSA, but further preclinical comparison studies with tantalum markers are necessary.

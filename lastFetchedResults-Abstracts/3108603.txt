A control strategy is presented in which the calculation of the controllerÂ´s actions is based on a adaptive long-range prediction of the resulting process output. The forecast is made based on a black box mathematical model of the process dynamics. It is identified in real time. The technique of long-range predictive control seems to be quite robust with respect to modeling errors and the control objective function has a strong intuitive appeal to the operator.

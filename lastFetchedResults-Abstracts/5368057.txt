Nowadays technical excellence is not enough to inspire customers for a product. Absolute freedom from error is a basic requirement. But how can customers be rendered enthusiastic about future products? The answer to this question lies in the creation of optimal customer-specific products. Perceived quality of a product is constituted by all visual, tactile, acoustic, gustatory and olfactory impressions. Perceived quality adds customer group specific and subjective perceptible characteristics to the basic understanding of quality. Until now there is no comprehensive systematic approach to close the gap between subjective customer perception and objective product characteristics. To manage these challenges, it is necessary to change the way of thinking within the product development.

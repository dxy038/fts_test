Expansion of sprinkler irrigation system is one of the projects placed at top priority among the government programs, to partly overcome water limitation in agricultural sector. Extension and development of this system is faced with many economical, social and technical problems that diminish the demand for these systems. Non-adoption of sprinkler system by farmers is the result of one or more of these problems. There are many such different factors of individual, cultural, social and economical aspect among farmers that exert strong impact on adoption. Identifying these factors and targeting them through appropriate policies is one of the best solutions regarding adoption of water-saving technology among farmers. The main objective of this study is an evaluation and determination of effective factors that affect adoption, and extension of sprinkler systems in Isfahan province. Logit model was employed to describe farmer behavior regarding determinants of adoption. Based on the findings the number of family labor and land fragmentation have their negative effects on adoption of rainy simulated irrigation systems while the size of the farmland, literacy level and type of farmers' job, the farmland slope, soil heterogeneity, average of water limitation and seasonal limitation of water as well as possibility of loan taking have their positive effects. Moreover, such variables as age of farmer, the kind of exploitation of farmland, soil being clay or sandy in texture, high water limitation, as well as access to human labor have no significant effects on adoption.

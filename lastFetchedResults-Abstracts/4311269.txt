The objective of this paper is to develop a localization system for cooperative multiple mobile robots, in which each robot is assumed to observe a set of known landmarks and equipped with an omnidirectional camera. If only a limited number of landmarks are available, it suffers from law accuracy. In this paper, it is assumed that a robot can detect other robots by using the omnidirectional camera and know their positions estimated by themselves and utilize the positions for its localization. In other words each robot can be viewed as a new mobile landmark. However, since the position information estimated by the robot itself is inaccurate, the estimated position of the robot cannot be high enough. This paper presents an investigation of the self localization error of a robot using Extended Kalman Filter to solve the localization problem with the insufficient landmarks and inaccurate position information.

A cooperative and harmonized collective approach on Long Term Data Preservation (LTDP) is ongoing in Europe with the goal to coordinate and optimize European efforts in the LTDP area. The aim is to ultimately preserve the entire European EO space data set for the benefit of all European countries and users, while at the same time reducing the overall costs of data preservation. ESA is coordinating the LTDP initiative[1] in Europe and has an ongoing LTDP programme with the objective to guarantee the preservation of the data from all EO ESA missions and third party missions managed by ESA for the long term, ensuring their accessibility and usability, as part of a joint and cooperative approach in Europe.

This paper presents short-range signal propagation simulation at 1GHz for communication applications in an indoor environment. The objective of the paper is to study the effect on the signal propagation with the varying thickness of a wall in an indoor communication link. By placing the transmitter antenna and receiver antenna on either side of the wall, blockage effect of the dielectric slab has been estimated by varying the thickness of the wall. The wall is centrally placed between transmitter and receiver. The distance between the wall and the antennas are kept constant at 2&#955;. The thickness of the wall is varied from 1&#955; to 2&#955; respectively. The results are obtained through simulation by using Ansoft HFSS<sup>&#8482;</sup>.

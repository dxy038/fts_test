Background: Malnutrition is one of the most common hazards
which compromise children’s health. Previous studies have
reported high rates of malnutrition in Kohkilouyeh and Boyer
Ahmad.
Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the frequency
of child malnutrition in Yasuj and to explore the association
between family characteristics and malnutrition.
Methods: Data were collected from healthcare files of 285
infants aged 18 months and younger in Yasuj health care centers.
Data included demographic information and anthropometric
measurements at birth and at the last referral to health centers.
Results: Rates of underweight, stunting, wasting, and low
head circumference at birth were 17.9%, 13.4%, 27.8%, and
19%, and at the last referral they were 22.5%, 11.3%, 29%, and
15.5%, respectively. The frequency of underweight and wasting
had significantly increased and that of stunting and low head
circumference significantly decreased during the period between
birth and the last referral. Birth wasting was significantly more
common in younger mothers, families with fewer children,
and shorter birth interval. Birth underweight and small head
circumference was significantly associated with shorter birth
interval. Child stunting was related to father’s education level and
child wasting was associated with mother’s education. Parents’
education did not have any association with birth malnutrition.
Conclusion: Wasting appeared to be the major form of
malnutrition among infants in Yasuj. It was very high at birth,
and continued to elevate after birth. Elevating educational level
of parents (over Diploma), educating parents to keep sufficient
interval between pregnancies, and paying more attention to
young mothers and those who are delivering their first baby are
among strategies to ameliorate child wasting.

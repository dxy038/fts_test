Objective
Several metallopeptidases have been implicated in both term and preterm parturition. We hypothesize that endotoxin-induced preterm delivery can be prevented by the administration of a metallopeptidase inhibitor.
Study design
We used an animal model of endotoxin-induced preterm delivery in timed pregnancy C57Bl/6 mice. Test animals received lipopolysaccharide followed by phosphoramidon, either every 1.5 or every 3 hours. Control mice received lipopolysaccharide followed by buffer injections at the same intervals. The primary outcome was a preterm delivery rate.
Results
The rate of preterm delivery for the control animals was 88.0% compared with the treatment groups of 45.5% for the mice that received phosphoramidon every 3 hours and 30.8% for the group that received it every 1.5 hours (P<.01).
Conclusion
The administration of a metallopeptidase inhibitor resulted in a decreased rate of preterm delivery in this animal model.

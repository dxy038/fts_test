Objective
This study was undertaken to evaluate whether the proximity of infection of the chorion/amnion and fetal vessels affects neonatal outcomes.
Study design
We examined all (n = 2012) infants admitted to the British Columbia's Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, from January 1996 to October 1997. We included infants with a placental examination (n = 1296), and stratified those with histologic chorioamnionitis into cases displaying a maternal inflammatory response only and cases also displaying a fetal inflammatory response (funisitis and/or fetal surface vessel angiitis).
Results
Histologic evidence of chorioamnionitis was present in 31% of placentas. Of those, 38% exhibited maternal inflammation only, whereas 62% also exhibited fetal inflammation. Neonatal mortality (9.2% vs 7.2%), morbidity, and resource use were significantly (P< .05) higher when fetal inflammation was present compared with when only maternal inflammation was present.
Conclusion
Chorioamnionitis with a fetal inflammatory response is associated with higher neonatal mortality, morbidity, and resource use than when only a maternal inflammatory response is present.

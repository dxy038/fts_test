In April 2003 the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and a diverse group of interested parties
began funding a number of major projects looking at the impacts of climate change on the built environment, transport and utilities.
One of these projects, entitled AUDACIOUS, is concerned with the impact of climate change on all aspects of urban drainage
systems. The main objective of this project is to investigate key aspects of the effects of climate change on existing drainage in urban
areas, and hence provide tools for drainage managers and operators to adapt to uncertain future scenarios. A major element of this
work is the development of a set of numerical models to simulate the performance of urban drainage systems under the type of
extreme rainfall events associated with climate change. Once developed, it is intended to utilise such models in a diagnostic design
capacity, to assist in the formulation of strategies to improve the performance of new and existing urban drainage systems under
different climate change scenarios. This paper details the work that has been undertaken at Heriot-Watt University as part of the
AUDACIOUS project. To date, this has involved the development of a numerical model to simulate the performance of roof
drainage systems (both conventional and siphonic) under extreme rainfall events. The necessary experimental work is described, and
the development of the model is detailed. Comparisons between model output and laboratory data are illustrated. Finally,
conclusions are drawn regarding the progress to date, and plans for the next stage of the project are outlined.

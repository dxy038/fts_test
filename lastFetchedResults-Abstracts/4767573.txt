After about one decade of operation, improvements and evolutions, GSM cellular networks have reached a high level of maturity. Several techniques, originally considered as options in the GSM standard, are now currently implemented to help improve both quality and capacity of the networks. We focus on two basic mechanisms: frequency hopping and power control. The objective of this work is to evaluate the improvements obtained by combining each of three frequency hopping schemes with a power control mechanism. Evaluations are realized by means of realistic GSM network simulations

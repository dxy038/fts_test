Results showed that the surface water quality was influenced by water period. It was better in flood reason than others. The water environment conditions was better in 2009 than in 2008. We must control the discharge of COD, PPI, BOD, petroleum, fecal coliforms and NH3-N in order to improve the surface water environment quality. This research would significantly improve the understanding of the evolution of surface water environment in Tieling reach of Liaohe River main stream.

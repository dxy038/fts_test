The objective is to investigate uncertainties in the stages of earthquake hazard reduction. A systems approach is utilized for dealing with earthquake hazard reduction. The reduction of earthquake hazard can be modeled as a process that consists of the following stages: (1) earthquake reduction, (2) seismic design and earthquake-resistant construction, and (3) public response to earthquake hazard. Different types of uncertainty are present in these stages that include ambiguity and vagueness. Probability and fuzzy-based models are used to deal with these types of uncertainty. These models are introduced and their uses are illustrated with examples

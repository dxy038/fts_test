Objective:
To assess the discrepancies between LDL-cholesterol and apo B targets in patients at risk for vascular disease; namely, those with diabetes or hypertriglyceridemia and those with triglycerides <1.7 mmol/L and normal glucose homeostasis.
Methods:
Lipid clinic patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of 182 patients whose triglyceride levels were >1.7 mmol/L or who had impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes. In Group 2, there were 42 patients with triglycerides <1.7 mmol/L and normal glucose homeostasis. LDL-cholesterol and apo B were estimated during lipid clinic visits with patients on appropriate lipid lowering therapy.
Results:
46% of the patients in Group 1 who reached the high risk LDL-cholesterol target of <2.5 mmol/L did not reach apo B target of <0.9 g/L, while in Group 2, only 19% of those who reached the LDL-cholesterol target had apo B >0.9g/L.
Conclusion:
Our findings demonstrate that a large percentage of patients with hypertriglyceridemia or impaired glucose tolerance, treated with lipid lowering agents, reach the LDL-cholesterol but not the apo B treatment targets

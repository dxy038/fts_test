In the presented work, a hybrid planner is used to adjust the active suspension system of a novel railway vehicle to upcoming situations. The hybrid planner uses the results from a model based multi objective optimization as a basis for discrete planning in continuous domains. The optimization works on a hierarchically organized set of mechatronic function modules which are represented as a hierarchical model. A centralistic as well as a distributed optimization mode are presented along with a resulting Pareto set.

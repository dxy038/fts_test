Nowadays Finite-Control-Set Model Predictive Control (FCS-MPC) is being successfully used in static power converters. The algorithm requires defining a functional in order to optimize it and thus find the best switch combination. So far the functional optimizes either the steady state or the transient operation. In fact, for steady state operation, the minimization of the switching frequency as well as high quality waveforms are the basic objectives. Contrary, during transient conditions the settling time minimization is usually used as a basic objective. This work presents an algorithm that is able to detect if the system is either under steady state or transient operating mode and applies the appropriate control algorithm. Hence, both operating modes are controlled under optimum conditions. Simulated results show the performance of the proposed control scheme.

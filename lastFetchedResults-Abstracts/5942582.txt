This work presents the framework Cloud Testing, a solution to parallelize the execution of a test suite over a distributed cloud infrastructure. The use of a cloud as runtime environment for automated software testing provides a more efficient and effective solution when compared to traditional methods regarding the exploration of diversity and heterogeneity for testing coverage. The objective of this work is evaluate our solution regarding the performance gains achieved with the use of the framework showing that it is possible to improve the software testing process with very little configuration overhead and low costs.

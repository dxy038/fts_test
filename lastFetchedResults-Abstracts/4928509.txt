In this paper, we focused on the information hiding for H.264/AVC and proposed a new hiding method which embeds information only by changing the value of the Intra 4x4 Prediction Mode. This method has merits in real time information embedding and compatible with H.264/AVC decoding. These are caused by the simple algorithm. From experimental results based on subjective and objective evaluations, it is found that 21920bits to 94064bits are embedded in the 5 sequences of 300 frames with 0.35 degradation in MOS and 0.64dB degradation in PSNR.

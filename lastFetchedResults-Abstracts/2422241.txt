Wind power generation has indicated an exponential increase during last two decades and existing transmission network infrastructure is increasingly becoming inadequate to transmit remotely generated wind power to load centres in the network. The dynamic line rating (DLR) is one of the viable solutions to improve the transmission line ampacity during high wind penetration without investing on an additional transmission network. The main objective of this study is to identify the basic differences between two main line rating standards, since transmission network service providers (TNSPs) heavily depend on these two standards when developing their line rating models. Therefore, a parameter level comparison between two line rating models is a timely requirement, in particular for high wind conditions. Study has shown that roughness factor causes a significant difference between both standards. In particular, the IEEE model indicates more conservative approach due to this parameter. In addition, solar heat-gain calculation has also resulted in significant difference in ampacity ratings between two standards. A case study was developed considering a wind rich network and it has shown that by implementing DLR in wind rich regions, it can effectively reduce line overloading incidents and accommodate wind power flows in the network without any curtailment. Moreover, ability of DLR to reduce network energy losses is also demonstrated and emphasised the importance of selecting suitable DLR candidates to minimise energy losses in the network.

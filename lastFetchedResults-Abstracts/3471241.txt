Summary results of a worldwide study on engineering and technology management are presented. The year-long study was conducted under the sponsorship of IEEE Engineering Management Society as a follow-up to previous studies in 1977, 1981, and 1984. The objective was to determine the characteristics and strategic directions of the educational and research components of this field. Approximately 3000 individuals were contacted in more than 1000 academic institutions. The completed survey instruments were analyzed, and the responses were verified. The study results show three trends: (1) the growth of engineering management is continuing at an increasing rate; (2) engineering management is emerging as a multidisciplinary discipline to encompass the management of the entire technological system; and (3) this new discipline is developing a strong research identity to supplement its educational emphasis throughout the life cycle of technologies, products, and technical processes

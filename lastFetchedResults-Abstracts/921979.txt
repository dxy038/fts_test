Abstract

Objective

 The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of Na Valproate and Phenobarbital on changes in the weight of epileptic patients following treatment for their condition using the drugs mentioned.

Materials and methods

Sixty epileptics were assigned into two groups of 30 patients each, the case and controls. The diagnosis was made on the basis of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) characteristics. BMI was defined. In the case group, the patients received 20mg/kg/day of Na Valproate, while the 30 controls received 5mg/kg/day of Phenobarbital for 6 months. Using the Mc Nemar and Chi-2 tests, BMI changes were compared after 6 months between the groups. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the role of age, sex, and primary weight on the weight increase due to Na Valproate usage.

Results

There were no specific changes in age, sex, primary BMI and fatness between the 2 groups; in the case group, 20 patients(66.7%) and in the controls 4(13.3%) gained weight (P < 0.001). There were higher chances of weight gain in children who were older and fatter at the beginning of the study (P < 0.2).

Conclusion

The results indicate that epileptic children, aged over 10 years, and those who are overweight have more chances of gaining weight or becoming fatter, following treatment with Na Valproate. Further studies investigating the issue are warranted.

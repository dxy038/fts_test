Background and Objective: In this study, given the increasing importance of meat production such as burgers in the country, the quality of these products is of utmost importance. With the aim of producing better quality hamburgers , the effect of amaranth grain flour as a substitute for soy protein flour and breadcrumbs in a typical hamburger formulations were studied.

Materials and Methods: In this study, half (50%) of the flour with amaranth Replaced instead of soybean protein powder and toasted flour, and chemical properties (protein, ash, moisture, pH), sensory and weight loss of Amaranth containing samples and control sample were compared.

Results: Based on the results of chemical tests, with partial substitution of soybean protein and toasted flour, the pH, moisture and weight loss contains amaranth changed from 6/06, 56/16, 9/80 to 6/13, 57/33, 5/53 percent, respectively, without significant changes in protein and ash. The results of sensory evaluation showed that except for the odor and color samples, other sensory characteristics were not under the effect of reducing the amount of soy flour and toasted flour, in the burgers formulation.

Conclusion:&nbsp; The results of this study showed application of amaranth flour in production of typical meat hamburger lead to new product with good sensory properties that is acceptable for consumers.

In this paper, distributed detection of process failures is studied. Erroneous evolutions, corresponding to failure situations, are described by chronicles. Every chronicle is composed of a set of events, and of a set of time constraints between these events. A chronicle can be decomposed into sub-chronicles distributed into several monitoring sites (systems). The objective of a monitoring site is to recognize a sub-chronicle. A specific reasoning considering relative time between event occurrences is proposed to provide time consistency of the mechanisms set Combining t-time Petri nets and p-time Petri nets, p-t-time Petri nets are used to represent these chronicles. When the Petri net reaches a particular state, a sub-chronicle is recognized. A symptom is detected when all the sub-chronicles associated to the initial chronicle have been recognized.

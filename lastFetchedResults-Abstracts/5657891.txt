Matrix electric power conversion topologies and their switch functions are flexible, as can be used to derive other electric power conversion topologies and switch functions for specific applications. This paper presents the Single Phase Matrix Converter (SPMC) topology that will operate as rectifier, inverter, buck converter, boost converter, chopper and cycloconverter. The circuit composed from four ideal power switches and Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor in its common emitter configuration is used as the switching device. Due to the symmetrical and bidirectional capabilities the topology is made to operate in various power conversion modes. Commutation strategies are also implemented with reduction in spikes, a common phenomenon in matrix converter topologies. The converters exhibit unity power factor, very low total harmonic distortion at the utility supply interface, good controllability under soft switching condition for a wide range of power and high efficiencies, whilst still having simple structures. Simulations were carried out using MATLAB/simulink and results of simulations are presented to evaluate the behaviour and feasibility of the proposed topology.

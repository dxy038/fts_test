Traceability of time and frequency in Republic of Slovenia is described. At present traceability to UTC is established by multichannel GPS comparison to UTC (IEN). A study on establishing traceability to UTC via UTC (USNO) is taking place. Local distribution of time and frequency at lowest uncertainty is realized using bidirectional optical fiber links to customers with Cesium and Rubidium standards.

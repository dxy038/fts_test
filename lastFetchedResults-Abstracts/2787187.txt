The paper tackles to the finite-time average consensus problem of networked dynamic systems. A dynamic behavior is described by a controlled first order differential equation with and without drift term. The objective of the analysis is to cover a large variety of autonomous systems without restoring their explicit form. For high dimensional multi-system, protocols are proposed to solve the average consensus problem in finite-time. Like an interaction topology, the agreement achievement is analyzed through an undirect fixed graph.The theoretical results are supported by simulations based on multi-unicycle and multi-pendulum systems.

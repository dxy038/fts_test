Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have great potential for land use management provided the images can be efficiently segmented. Clustering is one segmentation technique being explored. This paper compares two different fuzzy clustering techniques on SAR images that minimize two different objective functions. Examples of both methods are presented and future efforts to improve both results discussed

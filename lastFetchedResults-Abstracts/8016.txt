In this paper we describe an application of designing products and processes for supply chain management at a large electronics products manufacturer. The objective of our research project was to reduce the costs of complexity resulting from a proliferation of parts and processes in the manufacturer's supply chain. In order to perform this analysis, we developed the Supply Chain Modeling and Analysis Tool (SCMAT). SCMAT models decentralized supply chains and is less data-intensive and yet more general than previous work in this area.

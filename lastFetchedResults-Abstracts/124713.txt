Subcutaneous tuberculous abscess in the chest wall is an unusual presentation of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and usually results from underlying bone disease with costal, lymphnodal or pleural origin without concomittant pulmonary involvement and rarely have cases without evident bone disease been described. We report two patients with subcutaneous tuberculous abscess in the chest wall who were admitted due to chest wall masses. After paraclinical studies including Radiography, Isotope scanning, Pathological and Microbiological investigations; the diagnosis of subcutaneous tuberculous abscess originating from the sternum was established. Both patients were cured completely after appropriate treatment for tuberculosis.

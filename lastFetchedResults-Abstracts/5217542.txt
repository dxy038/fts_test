This paper presents the technique of cancellation the parasitic capacitance of inductor using mutual capacitance. The inductor frequency can be changed to capacitor at high frequency, which makes the filter to low efficiently. The mutual capacitance can be emulated using two small extra capacitors, which is connected with circuit. The experiments using power supply to test the efficiency of parasitic capacitance cancellation technique is presented. The objective of paper is this technique can efficiently improve the inductorpsilas filtering performance in power supply.

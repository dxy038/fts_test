Objective: To compare the genetic risk assessment of the referring obstetrician to the risk assessment of the genetic counselor. Study Design: All patients evaluated between January 1, 1999, and March 31, 1999, and who required genetic counseling were retrospectively reviewed. The genetic risk assessment of the referring obstetrician was compared to the genetic risk assessment following counseling by a genetic counselor who used a questionnaire and a three-generation pedigree. The number of patients with additional genetic risk factors identified by the genetic counselor were recorded and compared by using the McNemar chi-square test. Group demographics and characteristics were evaluated. Results: Among the 145 patients evaluated, 38% (n = 55) had additional genetic risk factors detected by the genetic counselor (P = .01). The maternal demographics and characteristics did not differ between the two groups. Conclusion: The practice of referring high-risk obstetric patients for genetic counseling improves the detection of identifiable genetic risk factors. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:1032â€“4.)

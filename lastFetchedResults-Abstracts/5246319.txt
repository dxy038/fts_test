In this paper, we analyze spectrum occupancy of the 2.36-2.4 GHz band. Interest in this band has risen recently, as secondary allocation of this radio spectrum is being considered for body sensor network operation to offer wireless healthcare services. We present spectrum measurements conducted in the Eindhoven area, in the Netherlands, where the 2.36-2.4 GHz band is currently used for land mobile and amateur radio services. Our objective is to show the spectrum usage in this band, provide statistics for the received power of active transmissions and obtain their occupation time.

Objective: Primary orthostatic tremor (OT) is thought to be generated by a unique supraspinal tremor generator. Here we studied the effect of ipsi- and contralateral stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous system on OT.
Methods: In 7 patients with primary OT, surface EMG was recorded from both tibialis anterior muscles. We performed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the vertex, and lumbar magnetic stimulation (LMS) over the lumbar spine. Supramaximal electrical nerve stimuli were applied to the tibial or peroneal nerve at the knee. Proprioceptive input was evoked by rhythmical submaximal stimulation of the tibial, peroneal or sural nerve at the ankle.
Results: TMS reset OT significantly in the contralateral as well as the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle. The resetting in both muscles was identical. In contrast, peripheral input by means of LMS, supra- or submaximal nerve stimulation had no impact on OT.
Conclusions: Transcranial magnetic stimulation of one cortical leg area resets OT in both legs whereas OT is not modified by any peripheral stimuli applied in this study.
Significance: Our results support the hypothesis of n unique supraspinal OT generator. This generator receives a modulating input from the motor cortex.

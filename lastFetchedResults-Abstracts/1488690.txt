 Objective is application so spatial multi criteria evaluation (SMCE) for optimal spatial prioritization in building of concrete and gabion check dams. SMCE was selected because there are many criteria, factors and constraints affected in optimal spatial prioritization of these structures. Chenar Naz watershed in south of Yazd Province was selected on case study. Two tree type model including spatial factors and constraints in SMCE program in GIS environment were designed. One for concrete check dams allocation in 3rd order streams with and other for gabion dams' allocation in 2nd order streams. All factors and constraints were standardized by fuzzy and Boolean method respectively. Factors were weighted by ranking methods. Compositing of these layers were done by SMCE in GIS environment. Outputs were two composite index maps (CIM) with fuzzy values. By classification of CIMs, optimal spatial prioritization for building of these structures in two separate maps with three priorities, were determined. They were presented on satellite images and stream maps as two and three dimension were shown. This model with a little change can be use in other watersheds and was recommended for finding optimum location to build check dams quickly and accurately.

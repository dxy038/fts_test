Background and Objective: Toxoplasmosis is a widespread disease world wide. The infection may be serious if is transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy. Prophylactic measures, early detection of the infection and treatment can prevent congenital toxoplasmosis and many long-term effects. This study was corried out among single women referring to Kashan health center in (2007-2008.)

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study on 400 single women (age 14-35) was conducted by IFAT. Information related to age, job, diet, history of contact to cat and clinical findings were recorded. The results were analyzed descriptive methods. GMRT for total population and infected individuals was computed.

Results: The total prevalence of infection was 20.5% (C.I = 20.5Â±3.84) in single women.The highest percentage of the infection (41.5%) prevailed among 19-23 years old. Among positive antibody individuals 83% were  in titer  1/20 and 1.2% were in titer 1/800. 96.4% of them had positive IgG, while 3.6%  had positive IgM. There was a significant difference between the positive antibody and raw meat, unhealthy water and job (P<0.05). GMRT for infected females was 1/30. Moreover, RF reaction in seropositive  cases  was negative.

Conclusion: The findings, of this study pointed to the fact that antibody toxoplasma level was low in the investigated region. Therefore, attention should be paid  to the spread of disease, particularly espcially to  seronegative  females. Preventive and control measures especially basic hygienic educational programs are required in order to reduce the rate of disease.

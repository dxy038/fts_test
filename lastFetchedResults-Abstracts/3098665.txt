CSON-D is a novel overlay-based context dissemination system which aids in enabling network users and applications to be context-aware and supports all types of context information. The dissemination protocol is appropriate for autonomous systems in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. Developing and maintaining context-aware efficient systems in such environments, our overall objective, is a challenging issue. We deal with this challenge and propose a meliorated context dissemination system by designing and implementing a hierarchical semantic-based context-specific overlay architecture made up of multi-level overlay networks. More specifically, we deal with a dynamic and fair overlay structure to achieve dissemination with minimized casting functionality. This paper is complemented with a scenario-based case study and preliminary results of a simulation study.

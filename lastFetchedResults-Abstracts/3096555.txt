We propose an efficient layer extraction method for scalable stereo video coding in order to effectively allocate any given stereo bitrate budget among the views. A few heuristic inter-view rate allocation algorithms are investigated for the analysis of a specific SMVC encoding configuration. The objective of the proposed method is to maximize performance in rate-visual-distortion sense. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm helps that the shape of the R-D curve becomes concave.

This study investigates the speed control problem of separately excited DC motors via automatically regulating armature and field voltages. Three set of control algorithms are developed to achieve this objective. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are effective to achieve high performance control under varying operation conditions.

Methods: The antiemetic effect of V. officinalis extract (aqueous-ethanolic) against emesis induced by copper sulfate (60 mg/kg, orally) and ipecac (600 mg/kg, orally) was investigated.  
The number of emesis was counted for 50 and 20 minutes after copper sulfate and ipecac administration, respectively.
Results: The extract at doses of 0.28, 0.49 and 0.7 g/kg (ip) exhibited significant protection against copper sulfate and ipecac induced – emesis. The dose of 0.7 g/kg lowered the number of copper sulfate induced- and ipecac induced – emesis of negative control (saline), respectively 65.704% and 79.88%.

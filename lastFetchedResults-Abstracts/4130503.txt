A new approach to blind adaptive signal extraction using narrowband antenna arrays is presented. The approach has the capability to extract communication signals from cochannel interference environments using only known spectral correlation properties of those signals, i.e. without using knowledge of the content or direction of arrival of the transmitted signal, or the array manifold or background noise covariance of the receiver, to train the antenna array. The class of spectral self-coherence restoral (SCORE) objective functions is introduced, and algorithms for adapting antenna arrays to optimize these objective functions are developed. Using the theory of spectral correlation, it is shown by analysis and simulation that these algorithms maximize the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio at the output of the narrowband antenna array when a single communication signal with spectral self-coherence at a known value of frequency separation, along with an arbitrary number of interferers without spectral self-coherence at that frequency separation, are impinging on the array

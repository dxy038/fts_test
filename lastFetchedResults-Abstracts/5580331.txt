We present an approach for supporting the reengineering of legacy message passing parallel programs based on point-to-point communication primitives. The objective is to obtain structured portable, and possibly more efficient versions of the same programs through the use of collective communication constructs. The restructuring process relies on a technique capable of detecting typical interaction patterns within programs based on point-to-point communications. Successively, the code excerpts corresponding to the detected patterns are automatically replaced with suitable collective primitives

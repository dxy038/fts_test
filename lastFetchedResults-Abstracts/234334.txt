Quality Management Systems (QMS) are being operated in some sectors in Turkey but it is rare to meet these systems in construction industry. There are many hinderances that make it difficult to apply these systems effectively due to the nature of construction and therefore, no objective way of measuring the effectiveness of these systems exists in construction industry.
This study aims to light the way for the studies and further researches in finding a way to measure the effectiveness of QMS. Two matrix models are developed as a way to measure the effectiveness of QMS. Towards this goal, firstly a questionnaire survey has been conducted to a sample of construction firms that have or have not passed through these systems in all over the Turkey. Appraising some findings from the survey results; the number of QMS operating firms and their way of implementing QMS principles are determined by using the most common statistical software ‘SPSS 10.0 for Windows’. These principles are evaluated on a case study by means of developing quality measurement matrices for QMS operating firms and different results have been concluded.

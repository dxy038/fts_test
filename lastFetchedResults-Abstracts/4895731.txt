In traditional ways of managing data, the relationship between the data and the geographical location of the organization it represents, is usually ignored. In wireless computing this property of &#8220;location transparency&#8221; is in fact often replaced by a &#8220;location dependency&#8221; property. Furthermore, the mode of issuing queries (the geographical location where the queries originate, the way they are issued, etc.) on such data determines the outcome. Location dependent data is data whose value depends on its location. The objective of the paper is to introduce this topic and spawn further related research

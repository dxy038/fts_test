Metastases of internal tumors to the oral cavity are unusual and in most cases
involve maxilla and mandible. Metastases to the gingival soft tissue are extremely
rare.
Reporting a new clinical case of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastasis with an
unusual site. Metastatic involvement of gingival tissue with renal cell carcinoma is
an extremely rare clinical event. It is usually associated with involvement of an
internal organ. We present a case of 47-year-old male patient diagnosed with
RCC-associated gingival metastasis- who underwent radical nephrectomy.
The wide range of localizations and forms of metastatic presentation of renal
carcinoma should obligate physicians to be alert during the follow-ups.

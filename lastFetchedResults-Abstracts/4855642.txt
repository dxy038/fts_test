This paper provides an inside look at the C2RM and documents some of its more subtle aspects. More specifically, the taxonomy of the C2RM and its use with object-oriented benchmarks for modeling command and control are illustrated. In addition, the paper reviews known criticisms of the C2RM, attempts to dispel some of the apparent myths, and clarifies with specific examples possible areas of confusion. The objective of the C2RM is to provide a standard, object-oriented, open system architecture, and open system interconnection framework to be used in modeling and simulating C2ed objects. In developing technology and applications of managed objects for command and control (i.e., C2 objects) it is intended to promote standardization of key C2 protocols and interfaces for interactions among heterogeneous and distributed resources of C2 systems

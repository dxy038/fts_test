Knowledge sharing and re-using is the base of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) for pressure component design which are the key equipments in various industries. The objective of this study is to develop an ontology of pressure component design for sharing and re-using numerous concept knowledge among different domains in the pressure component design process. At first, an iterative ontology building process is presented in the paper according to special characteristics of pressure component design process. Protege-3.0, a knowledge base management system (KBMS), is employed to develop and maintain the ontology. Then, formal concept analysis (FCA) is adopted in the ontology building process to establish the taxonomic hierarchy correctly and properly, because it yields the mathematization of the doctrines of concepts. Finally, the compositions of pressure component ontology are explained briefly.

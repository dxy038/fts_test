Dietary intake of plant sterol esters (PSE) lowers plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), but can modestly increase plasma plant sterol concentrations. The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of increasing doses of dietary PSE on plasma and liver sterol concentrations as well as on aortic foam cell development as a marker of atherogenesis. One-hundred and twenty F1B hybrid Syrian golden hamsters (20 per group) were fed a basal atherogenic diet containing 30% of energy as fat and 0.12% (w/w) cholesterol and supplemented with 0, 0.24, 0.48, 0.96, 1.92 and 2.84% (w/w) PSE. After 12 weeks, plasma total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C were significantly lower in the groups fed PSE compared with control. Plasma plant sterol concentrations increased with increasing dietary PSE intake up to the dietary level of 1.92% and then reached a plateau. On the other hand, hepatic campesterol and sitosterol concentrations plateaued at 0.24% PSE. Foam cell presence in the aortic arch showed an inverse relationship with dietary PSE intake (P<0.0001). Lipid-filled foam cell areas of hamsters receiving 0.24, 0.48 or 2.84% PSE were approximately 70, 90 and 100% smaller than in control hamsters fed no PSE. In summary, dietary PSE lowered plasma TC and LDL-C. Despite an increase in plasma plant sterol concentrations they did not contribute to aortic foam cell development. In fact dietary PSE significantly inhibited aortic foam cell formation. This study supports the concept that PSE through their cholesterol-lowering action prevent development of atherogenesis in this animal model.

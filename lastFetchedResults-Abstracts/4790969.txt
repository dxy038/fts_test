In this paper, we study the isotropic design of a 6-6 cable-suspended parallel robot to achieve its best kinematic performance. Dexterity of robot corresponds to its kinematic performance, i.e., if the robot is working at high dexterity; it has the best kinematic performance. This goal can be accomplished using the following techniques: (a) A pure symbolic method to obtain the isotropic and cable tension conditions, (b) geometric workspace that is based on wrench-feasible workspace (WFW) and leads to the ranges of singularity-free motion of the moving platform (MP), (c) numerical workspace and global condition index (GCI) as objective functions to optimize the design parameters, and (d) a numerical approach for evaluation of isotropic configuration of a 6-6 cable-suspended parallel robot. In fact, we attempted to reach to the optimum ranges of motion of the MP in which the robot is in isotropic condition. Finally, the isotropic design of a 6-6 cable-suspended parallel robot is performed using the above-mentioned methods.

The matrix power converter permits direct AC-AC power conversion without an intermediate DC link and therefore represents an &#8220;all silicon&#8221; solution as the power converter for variable speed AC drives. Compared to conventional drives, there is potential for reduced cost of manufacture and maintenance, and increased power/weight and power/volume ratios. The circuit is inherently capable of bidirectional power flow and also offers virtually sinusoidal input current, without the harmonics usually associated with present commercial inverters. With the use of microcontrollers, the matrix power converter can be used to supply high-performance AC motor drives, with a minimum of reactive components. This paper considers the possible solutions to the various problems which have so far prevented the exploitation of this circuit. These include the problem of current commutation between switching devices, the effect of the reduced voltage transfer ratio and the application of closed loop motor control algorithms

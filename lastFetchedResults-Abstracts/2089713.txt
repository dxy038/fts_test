The economic situation in the air transportation industry claims for new business models supported by accurate management processes, which need constant feedback of the real status of the environment. The objective of this work is to achieve an updated/real decision support systems (DSS) to allocate resources in an airport even when disturbances occur by combining artificial intelligent techniques with visibility technologies. This work proposes the combined use of Multi-agent systems (MAS) along with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to provide the required information on the status of the resources and the environment. The MAS is based on a double layer of decision-taking levels and on a Markov reward function whereas the WSN is based on a Zigbee network of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers with active tags as end nodes, which are carried by the physical resources. The proposed distributed DSS has been tested at Ciudad Real Central Airport in Spain.

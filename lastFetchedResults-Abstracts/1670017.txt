A novel metric termed cluster resolution is presented. This metric compares the separation of clusters of data points while simultaneously considering the shapes of the clusters and their relative orientations. Using cluster resolution in conjunction with an objective variable ranking metric allows for fully automated feature selection for the construction of chemometric models. The metric is based upon considering the maximum size of confidence ellipses around clusters of points representing different classes of objects that can be constructed without any overlap of the ellipses. For demonstration purposes we utilized PCA to classify samples of gasoline based upon their octane rating. The entire GC–MS chromatogram of each sample comprising over 2 × 106 variables was considered. As an example, automated ranking by ANOVA was applied followed by a forward selection approach to choose variables for inclusion. This approach can be generally applied to feature selection for a variety of applications and represents a significant step towards the development of fully automated, objective construction of chemometric models.

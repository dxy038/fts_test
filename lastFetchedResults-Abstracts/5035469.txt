Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Areas in atrial tissue with complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) are among others responsible for the maintenance of AFib. Those areas are ideal target sites for ablation to eliminate AFib and restore sinus rhythm. As CFAEs are associated with high fibrillatory frequency, automated identification of CFAEs with spectral analysis helps developing objective strategies for AFib ablation. While the application of current techniques is restricted, this paper introduces a new approach to determine characteristic frequencies during AFib. By using TeagerÂ´s energy operator we calculate the signal envelope and study its spectrum after Fast Fourier Transformation. Harmonic analysis of distinctive peaks in the power spectrum is carried out to assess characteristic frequencies of a CFAE. While the currently available methods only find one dominant frequency in the spectrum of the signal, our method is capable to find multiple characteristic frequencies, if present. Since it is believed that during AFib the atrium is activated by one or multiple wavelets, our method opens new opportunities for investigation of multiple wavelets propagation.

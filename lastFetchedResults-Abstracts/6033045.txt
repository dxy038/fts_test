The objective of the Building In Reliability (SIR) discussion group this year was to work on an implementation road map for the BIR methodology. The idea was to develop a road map that would have the support and acceptance of the industry representatives in attendance at the Workshop. As it happened, we did not arrive at our intended destination, but we did have a very active and fruitful journey. We had the opportunity to engage in a lively dialogue between the IC suppliers and customers in the discussion about the implementation of SIR, and we received overwhelming support for the development of a BIR special interest group. The discussion groups on Monday and Tuesday nights chose to explore a wide range of topics and issues that were very germane to the implementation of SIR, and we believe that as a result of this discussion, many Workshop attendees offered their support and interest in a BIR Special Interest Group (SIG). What follows is a summary of several of the key points that were raised and critically discussed in the discussion groups of both nights. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it necessarily guaranteed to be completely accurate. It does, however, represent our best effort to capture the substance and spirit of the discussion. Attendance was very strong both nights with approximately 33 participants on Monday night, and approximately 25 on Tuesday night.

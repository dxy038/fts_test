The present paper describes the project of the network EVALU, developed in the framework of the European ALFA program. The main objective of the project is the formation of a Web-based, common environment joining the 13 universities in the network. The first step is to try and define a common methodology and software system enabling the members of the network to cross-evaluate the educational level of students in the member institutions. Another aim of the network is to produce and share interactive multimedia tools to teach fundamental technical disciplines through the Web. Physics for engineers is the field initially chosen to work on. Activities under way and intermediate results are described and discussed.

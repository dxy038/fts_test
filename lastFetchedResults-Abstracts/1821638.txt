Self-lubricating low friction MoS2/Ti composite coatings were deposited onto hard coated carbide inserts using a hybrid process and were tested for dry high-speed milling and turning of steel. Dry machining is an important objective in industry to reduce environmental and production costs. It was shown that dry machining using MoS2/Ti composite coatings is possible in some cases. Following an already good knowledge in low speed dry operations including drilling, tapping and threading, the coatings were tested under dry high-speed machining operations (milling and turning) where the temperatures involved are higher. Cutting tool parameters and tool grade and geometry were found to have an influence on the performance of the tools. Temperature and oxidation were investigated separately and correlated to the mechanical, chemical, oxidation and structural behaviour of the tools during machining tests.

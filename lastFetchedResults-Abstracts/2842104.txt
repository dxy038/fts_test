For wireless networks, coverage with different restrictions that can capture the practical requirements have received great research interests. We will study several restricted coverage problems. The first problem is about <i>K</i>-coverage, i.e., how to deploy wireless nodes such that each target is covered by at least <i>K</i> wireless nodes. We study the problem restricted to linear-<i>K</i>-coverage where there is a line, all targets lie in one side of this line and all wireless nodes lie in the other side. Assume each wireless node is associated with a weight, the objective is to select a minimum weighted subset of nodes such that each target is <i>K</i>-covered. We propose a 3-approximation for this problem by exploring geometric properties. The second problem is called <i>K</i>-road-coverage. Given a road map in a two-dimensional area which contains a set of paths and a set of wireless nodes, the locations of nodes can either be arbitrary or fixed, the objective is to select a minimum number of wireless nodes such that each path can be <i>K</i>-covered. We will reduce the problem to <i>K</i>-coverage and apply the algorithmic results for <i>K</i>-coverage to solve it. Another line of this work is to investigate a well-motivated problem called strongly dominating set, which is intrinsically related to coverage. Given a wireless networking system represented by a digraph G = (V, E&#8407;). Each wireless node u has a covering disk centering at u with its radius equal to the transmission range of u. We then draw a directed edge uv&#8407; in G if uÂ´s corresponding covering disk contains v. A subset U &#8838; V of wireless nodes is a strongly dominating set if every wireless node in V U has both an in-neighbor in U and an out-neighbor in U. The objective is to find a minimum size strongly dominating set. Our method can achieve an approximation factor of (2 + &#949;).

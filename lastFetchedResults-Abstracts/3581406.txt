For information storage purposes, BaTiO<inf>3</inf>single crystals were grown, and typical data of the product are presented. Storage condensers using multidomain and c-domain crystals as a dielectric were produced. Memory as well as switching properties were studied with particular reference to their application in a multicondenser memory matrix. A method for testing bistable storage condensers was developed; typical data are presented. A gated, bidirectional pulse transformer circuit was developed, providing pulses of opposite polarity for writing and reading on the matrix leads. This circuit permits increase of the absolute ratio of matrix switching pulses from 2 to 1 to 3 to 1. Sequential, random or simultaneous sequential- and random-scanning of a multicondenser matrix are equally practical.

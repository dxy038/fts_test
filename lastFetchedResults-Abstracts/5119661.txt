The objective of this work is to propose a membrane computing model for software requirement engineering activities during the inception phase of the software development. The bio-inspired approach is used in requirement engineering for the transformation of user requirements into system requirements using a probabilistic distributed computing model with abstraction coefficients, amalgamation factors and clarity factors. The software company rules and policies are considered in the model and rewritten over a period of time. This model considers the different phases of software requirement engineering as membranes and the various requirements are considered as objects and the requirement engineering process hierarchy is modeled as a membrane structure. The key process activities like requirement analysis and requirements change management are considered as primary membranes in the model. The communication between primary membranes through corresponding reaction rules are derived to determine the design objects. The results for the transformation of various requirement engineering processes are verified using a simulation in JDesigner tool.

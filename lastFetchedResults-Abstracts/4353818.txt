The overall objective of this work is to create and test a military application of a transportation safety assessment tool for industry. The industry tool, the Fleet Operations Safety Assessment Tool (FOSAT) is being refined and is scheduled for implementation by an insurance company. The same process for evaluating safety in industry can aid the military in assessing and improving safety practices in ground transportation operations. Data generated from testing the military application will be used to develop methods for forecasting improvements in safety performance metrics. The test results will also be used by the insurance industry to refine the FOSAT.

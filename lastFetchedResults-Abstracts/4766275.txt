This paper addresses energy-aware traffic offloading in stochastic heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). The objective is to minimize energy consumption of the HCN while maintaining Quality-of-Service experienced by the mobile users. For each cell, the energy consumption depends on its associated system load, which is coupled with system loads in other cells due to the sharing over a common spectrum band. Such a traffic offloading problem is modeled by a discrete-time Markov decision process (DTMDP). Based on the traffic observations and the traffic offloading operations, the network controller learns to solve the optimal traffic offloading strategy with no prior knowledge of the DTMDP statistics. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, we design a centralized Q-learning with compact state representation algorithm, which is named as QC-learning. Moreover, a decentralized QC-learning algorithm is developed such that the macro-cell base stations (BSs) can independently manage the operations of small-cell BSs by making use of the network information obtained from the network controller. Simulations validate the proposed studies.

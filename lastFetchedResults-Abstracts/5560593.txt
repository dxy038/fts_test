The current paper presents ImplanTDT, a novel research project carried out in Murcia (Spain) to study the degree of knowledge and usersÂ´ reaction to digital terrestrial television (DTT). Analogue terrestrial television (ATT) will definitely disappear in less than 3 years. The first stage of the project is centered on the design of two different and complementary test scenarios such as a usability laboratory and a real user bidirectional monitoring platform based on the development of advanced multimedia home platform (MHP) software applications. Results of this project stage, will serve to improve DTT information campaigns, develop more easy-to-use, useful and advanced interactive MHP services (T-Government, T-Learning, T-Commerce, etc.) and provide all involved parties with high quality information in order to achieve a balanced, interactive, educated and massive technological transition.

This paper considers the evaluation of transmission of compressed video over GSM data traffic channels. A need for such transmission has been identified in the operation of light rail transport systems in the UK and this paper addresses this application in particular. The results presented are based on a simulator which incorporates a GSM TCH/F 9.6 data channel model. The overall objective of the simulator is to calculate error statistics for known mobile scenarios and to produce a visual impression of image quality which would be obtained in a real transmission in which environmental conditions (rail vehicle speed, C/I etc.) are known. Use of the simulator will assist in the assessment of image transmission over a real GSM interface and will also allow optimisation of image reconstruction when multiple real channels are employed

This paper is in support of a recent small business innovative research (SBIR) phase II development effort. The objective of the effort was to design and develop a family of radio frequency (RF) and microwave (MW) down converter modules in a small form factor called PXI (PCI extension for instrumentation) for use in a synthetic instrument (SI) measurement context over a target frequency range of 100 KHz to 26.5 GHz. At the present time the current state of the art for RF/MW measurement instrumentation in a PXI form factor is limited to approximately 6 GHz. The paper opens with an overview of the subject and scope of this development initiative. The paper then goes on to describe the purpose and functionality of each of the down converter modules. The authors then describe how the modules can be configured into any number of seven (7) SI solution configurations, with particular emphasis on the 100 KHz - 26.5 GHz configuration. The paper then concludes with a summary overview and conclusions arrived at by the authors as a result of this developmental effort, as well as a future prognosis for this technology.

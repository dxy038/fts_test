Background and Objective: In the modern era, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a huge burden on the shoulders of health systems around the world. On the other hand, lack of a specific and effective therapeutic approach has persuaded scientists to look for new treatments, among which probiotics have recently raised interest. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotics in non alcoholic fatty liver disease treatment.

Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 90 patient were enrelled with NAFLD and divided into two groups: 45 patients in the diet and exercise group, and 45 patients received 500 mg/d Familacat capsules in addition to diet and exercise. Then the serum level changes of FBS, Triglycerides, Cholestrol, AST and ALT as well as weight and blood pressure were compared between the groups.

Results: In the FamiLact group, BMI, FBS, cholesterol, LDL, AST and ALT had improved significantly. In the control group, the only insignificantly changed variable was serum LDL. Comparison of the groups showed a significantly better improvement in the FamiLact group in terms of cholesterol and LDL changes. However in the control group, changes in blood pressure and HDL levels were significantly better.

Conclusion: FamiLact is a safe and effective probiotic in improving blood sugar, BMI and lipid profile values (except for HDL) in patients with NAFLD.

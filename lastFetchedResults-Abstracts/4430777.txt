In this paper, the immersion &amp; invariance control technique are used to drive three-phase power converters. The interest is in applications towards microgrids, where various subsystems interact forming a complex electrical system. In particular, the ac-dc power converter, which operates as an electrical interface between the main grid and the microgrid, drives a constant power load that presents a bidirectional power capacity. This particular load model is suitable to applications in microgrids because of its power flow characteristic.

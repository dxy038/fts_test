The principal objective of the power architectures described in this paper is to provide adequate electrical power and reserve power, as needed, to network-owned Video Dial Tone (VDT) electronics. This paper discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of important powering strategies and their life-cycle costs. Life-cycle costs show that locally provided power without an AC interface unit and battery backup, or customer-provided powering of VDT electronics are cost-effective powering strategies compared to network-provided power and backup. The paper also identifies potential road-blocks that need to be addressed in order to facilitate the timely and cost-effective deployment of VDT services

Background and Objectives: High plasma levels of lipoprotein (a) [LP (a)] are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).The effect of habit and nutritional factors on lipoprotein (a) levels still unknown. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to assess the serum levels of lipoprotein and its relation with life habits and nutritional status in group of reproductive-age women.
Method & Materials: The present research was a descriptive and cross-section study and constituted of 252 reproductive-age (15-49 years) women of Tabriz. They are randomly selected from general healthy population. For each individual a demographic questioner, food frequency questioner and two mid week 24 hour food recall questioner was filled. Weight and height was measured. Body mass index was calculated, 5 ml of venous blood was obtained and serum level of lipoprotein (a) was measured by immumotubidometry method. In each individual data were analyzed using statistical methods including T-test, and variance analysis. P<0.05 was considered significant.
Results: A mean serum level of lipoprotein (a) was 41.2 Â± 28.4 in women. Serum levels of lipoprotein (a) was in normal range (<30 mg/dl) in 44.6%. 55.4% of women had a higher levels (more than 30 mg/dl). There were no relationship between food habits, daily energy intake, fat, protein and other nutrient intake, age, weight, height, BMI, mid arm circumflex with serum levels of lipoprotein (a).Women with moderate regular exercise had a lower lipoprotein (a), level compared with those who hadn't such a regular exercise program (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Based on this study, it is speculated that serum levels of lipoprotein (a) is higher than normal range in a large percentage of reproductive age women. In addition, regular exercise reduces the serum level of lipoprotein (a). Therefore, regular exercise educations are recommended for women's health promotion.

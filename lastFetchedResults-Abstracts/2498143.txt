Background and Objective: In this study, WQI was estimated using an Iranian software called IWQIS to assess drinking water quality in Ray Township distribution systems.

Materials and Methods: The assessment of 73 samples of drinking water during 2013 and the comparison of 18 physicochemical parameters with the standard Code of 1053 (Iran National Standard) was done.

Results: The results showed that the concentration of 7 parameters is out of normal range in special percentage of the samples. Those parameters are as follow: total hardness (31.5%), Mg (46.6%), nitrate (50.68%), Na (45.2%), F (42.46%), Cl (2.7%), Sulfate (28.76%) of samples. The medium concentration of theses parameters was: total hardness (375 mg/L), Mg (32 mg/L), Nitrate (47.43 mg/L), Na (187 mg/L), F (0.5 mg/L), Cl (169 mg/L), and Sulfate (263 mg/L). It is estimated that 5.6% of the population of this township are highly exposed to nitrate, 79.1% to fluoride and 13.5% are exposed to sodium. The average WQI in Rey Township in a good spectrum is 71.22.

Conclusion: 17 samples (23.2%) were assessed in excellent spectrum, 54 samples (74%) in good and 1 sample (1.4%) in very poor spectrum and 1 sample in unsuitable condition were assessed. No sample was assessed in poor situation. The samples of the autumn showed the worst quality.

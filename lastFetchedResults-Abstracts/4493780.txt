We apply evolutionary computations to HopfieldÂ´s neural network model of associative memory. In the Hopfield model, an almost infinite number of combinations of synaptic weights gives a network an associative memory function. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between the storage capacity and the size of the basin of attraction. Therefore, the model can be thought of as a test suite of multi-modal and/or multi-objective function optimizations. As a preliminary stage, we investigate the basic behavior of an associative memory under simple evolutionary processes. In this paper, we present some experiments using an evolution strategy

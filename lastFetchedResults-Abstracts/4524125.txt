The working performance of the diaphragm spring clutch mainly depends on the structural parameters of the diaphragm spring. In this paper, we take the minimum stress of the dangerous point of the diaphragm spring as the objective function of optimal design, and use the complex method to solve the extreme value of the restraint problem. The calculation method and results may be referred by designer.

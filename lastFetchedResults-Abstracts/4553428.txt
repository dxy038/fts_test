Chord has been widely used as a routing protocol in structured peer-to-peer overlay networks, but there is a lot of redundant information in the node finger table. This paper proposes a strategy that using the nodeÂ´s counterclockwise node information to replace the redundant information, the strategy uses the space effectively which occupied by the redundant information. This paper also proposes a strategy to solve the problem that repeated search in p2p network by establishing an objective resource table. Then this paper designs an advanced chord routing algorithm based on redundant information replaced and objective resource table (AChord). Theoretical and experimental analysis show that AChord can improve search performance effectively, and it also proposes a new way of thinking for the structured P2P network search.

The objective of this paper is to describe the implementation and to perform tests realized with voice activity detection algorithms, in time and frequency domains, by using silence detection and suppression techniques to be applied on voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) applications. This work also intends to present the measurements realized and the results obtained in order to get a satisfactory performance as far as silence suppression in voice communications over the Internet is concerned. Finally, it is done some considerations, and conclusions, extracted from the properties that have been observed when measuring talk spurts and from the results that have been obtained, first of all, through simulation tools and after that through field tests that have been realized over a developed, and available, VoIP platform called Locutus.

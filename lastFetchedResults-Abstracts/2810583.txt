The health care is the decisive factor for peopleÂ´s health and life safety. The contradiction between the demand of integrated medical and disciplines subdivision becoming more and more obvious, many diseases relying on only a medical specialty is not enough. For realizing the patient-oriented medical service objective, it is necessary to design the chain of care involved in the integration of multidisciplinary disease diagnosis and treatment methods, which covered different stages of the whole process including Early Prevention, Pre-hospital emergency, In-hospital Treatment, Rehabilitation and so on. The decision quality of the key points of chain of care has a significant effect on the overall quality of health care services. Based on collecting and organizing literature, there are still many deficiencies in previous studies. This paper intends to discuss the optimization and improvement of disease decision on this: to further study on disease decision problem systematically and to explore the decisions optimization of key points of chain of care. In view of the present decision technology is low efficiency, lack of flexibility and adaptability, this paper focus on the disease decisions optimization with data mining method.

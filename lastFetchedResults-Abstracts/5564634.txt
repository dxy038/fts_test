A design procedure for synthesizing wideband conformal antenna arrays based on a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is presented. In this paper, raised power series (RPS) are employed as a simple yet effective way to introduce aperiodicity into a conformal semi-circular phased antenna array for achieving wideband performance. Unlike conventional linear array synthesis methods where, for example, the genetic algorithm (GA) has been utilized to meet a single design objective, the multi-objective optimization technique proposed in this paper employs the nondominated sorting GA version II (NSGA-II).

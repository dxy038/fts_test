This proposal presents a new error robust strategy for encoding redundant pictures for the H.264/AVC standard. The method is based on providing motion vectors as redundant data, i.e. providing extra protection to the motion information of the encoded stream. The proposed system is implemented based on the existing redundant coding algorithm of the scalable extension of H.264/AVC. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using various objective quality measurements under both error free and error prone Internet protocol (IP) packet network environments. The proposed algorithm increases the bandwidth utilization with slight degradation in the primary picture quality for error free conditions, compared to the existing redundant coding method of JSVM (joint scalable video model). Furthermore, the simulation results under packet loss environments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing redundant picture coding of JSVM.

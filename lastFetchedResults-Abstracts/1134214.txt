Abstract
Introduction: Low blood levels of vitamin D in different communities is common. In  this study , we evaluated the blood levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients presented with musculoskeletal pain.
Objective: Evaluation of 25- hydroxy Vitamin D Blood Levels in Patients with Musculoskeletal Pain
Materials and Methods: In a descriptive study, blood levels of vitamin D in 358 patients with musculoskeletal pain, that presented to the orthopedic clinic of Poorsina Hospital of Rasht during 2007-2008 years, were measured by serum levels of 25- hydroxy vitamin D using Radio Immunoassay (RIA).Normal range of vitamin D in this study, was 32 -100 ngr/milt. Amounts between 15 -32 ngr/milt, was introduced as mild vitamin D deficiency and amounts lower than 15 ngr/milt as severe vitamin D deficiency.
Results: Normal range of vitamin D was seen in 65 cases (16.68%), severe vitamin D deficiency in 182 cases (51. 96%) and mild vitamin D deficiency in 107 cases (29.89%). Average serum levels of vitamin D among all cases, was 20.1ngr/milt. Severe vitamin D deficiency belong to the patients with musculoskeletal pain in the ages younger than 20 years, compared to other ages and only 4% of them had normal range of this vitamin. 
Conclusion: Given vitamin D severe deficiency in (51.96%), i.e., majority of cases who were studied, there seems to be a significant association between vitamin D levels and risk of musculoskeletal disorders

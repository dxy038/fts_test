Hormonally active agents are widespread in the environment and exist in the human diet. There is
insufficient knowledge regarding the influence of phytochemicals on the pathophysiology of the male
reproductive system. Kiwi is a rich source of phytochemicals such as flavones (with estrogenic activity),
serotonin and vitamin C. These components can influence the hormones and interfere with reproductive
activities. Therefore, the objective of this project was to determine whether extract of kiwi could change the
structure of male reproductive tissues. So, 40 male rats were divided into four groups. Three experimental
groups were fed with 75, 100 and 150 mg/kg of kiwi extract and control groups with solvent for 50 days.
Then, rats were sacrificed and their testis, ductus deferens, seminal vesicle, prostate and epididymidis were
removed, fixed, processed and stained with H & E and Acridine Orange. The specimens were studied under
light and fluorescent microscopes. Histological observations revealed some changes in the structure of testes,
but not in the other parts of male reproductive tissues. Some spermatocytes have become fusiform and the
number of these cells has been increased, dose dependently. There were many spermatocyes at the metaphase
stage, among 100 and 150 mg/kg treated groups; Some of the mitotic figures, sperm, most of the
spermatogonia and spermatocytes stained red with Acridine Orange, which indicats denaturation of DNA
strands. A few fragmented nuclei were also observed in the 150mg/kg treated group. In conclusion, it seems
that extract of kiwi can change the spermatocyte cytoarchitecture and affects the spermatogonia and
spermatozoa. It may exert dual effects on the proliferating cells, such as spermatogenesis linage. In low
concentrations it could induce proliferation, and in high concentrations, it may lead to cell death and nucleus
fragmentation. The extract may elongate the period of the metaphase.

In the paper the distance methods of the diagnostics of the high voltage power equipment being under the voltage, with electron optical defectoscope (EOD) are presented. EOD was developed based on electron optical amplifier of the light brightness of the generation 2+. For protection from the background light-striking they are supplied with the quartz input objective, and light filters of different spectral characteristics. The methods presented are based on the characteristics of corona and surface partial discharges such as space-time distribution and components of the light radiation spectrum, as well as their dependences oil the voltage value and insulation pollution degree.

Due to large size of images involved in WMSN, its transmission is very demanding and energy consuming. One of the possible way to reduce size of the image to be transmitted is to aggregate the image before transmission. Image aggregation in WMSN transmits the overlapped region of the images only once by eliminating the redundant portion of image. Image aggregation scheme consumes only 46 percentage of the energy consumption compared to non aggregation schemes. The objective of this paper is to design efficient communication protocol for WMSNs by leveraging the correlation of visual information of camera sensors. To describe the degree of correlation of visual information observed by cameras with overlapped field of views a spatial correlation coefficient is derived.

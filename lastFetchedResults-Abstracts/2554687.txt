Graphic design has always had a social nature, so that its formative process has had an implied and clear correlation with miscellaneous social factors. These factors are considered as preconditions for the modern formation stage of this art. The key question of this paper is regarding the dominant social factors in graphic design formation in Iran. Theoretically this paper is related to sociology and is underscoring the formation stage of modern graphics in Iran. This paper enjoys analytical method and is based on library data bases. The approach of this paper is according to Jonnet Wolfs theory on the effect of art. According to Wolfs theory, the effective factors in production of art include technic, social institution, art career, raising of artists and supporting organizations.
The objective of this paper is to recognize Iranian modern graphics formation not in a vacuum condition but instead created on a basis of different social, political, cultured and industrial factors and some other related events. The conclusion is that although in the aftermath of some changes in social conditions, apparently the graphic designers were relieved of social production of art, never they were relieved of direct and indirect social effects. Accordingly, the fact is that graphic design has always been a public product effected by social structures of its own society; the structures which have a great role in this art production and have been an essential prerequisite in producing and developing it.

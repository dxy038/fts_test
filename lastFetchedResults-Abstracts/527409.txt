Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate graft survival among the recipients of second renal transplant in Imam Khomeini centre hospital in Urmia. Methods: The study population consisted of 50 patients receiving renal grafts for the second time between 1988 and 2008 in Imam Khomeini centre hospital in Urmia. Two survival outcomes, first and second graft survival, were analyzed. Graft survival was defined from date of transplant until its rejection. For the purpose of graft survival analysis, graft failure was defined as return to dialysis, and death due to the functioning graft. Data were collected through individual patient questionnaires. Demographic and clinical factors, transfusion history, type of immunosuppressive drugs, levels of serum creatinine, triglyceride, cholesterol, and LDL at 3 and 6 months after transplantation were collected. Cox-proportional hazard model and Kaplan-Meier were used to data analysis. Results: First graft survival at 1,2, 3, and 5 years was 74%, 66%, 53%, and 41%, respectively. Second graft survival at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years was 81%, 74%, 70%, and 61%, respectively. Causes of graft loss in first renal transplantation were 6% sever acute graft rejection, 12% acute graft rejection and 82% chronic graft rejection. In the multivariate analysis, only serum creatinine, blood pressure, and immunosuppressive drugs predicted first graft loss and serum creatinine, immunosuppressive drugs, and related donor family predicted second graft rejection. Conclusion: The serum creatinine and immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporine, cellcept, and prednisolone are the most influential factors on graft survival.

The climate of a conurbation is of great importance, in particular for public health and to provide good environment. Town planning should take into account how it can influence microclimate, especially in view of pollutant emissions by internal combustion engines. The objective of this study was to know the role and behaviour of green spaces in major cities on climate and air pollution. This article provides case studies of the effect of urban parklands on temperature, humidity and pollution, based on a series of formal measurements. Analysis of climatic data has found that gardens and parklands are responsible for significant precipitation. In this study, the present examples, which represent the most frequent cases found during the campaign measures, conform to this pattern. The influence of different types of gardens on temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation and the distribution of air pollution are presented. The results clearly showed the important role of parklands in urban areas. The parklands decreasing temperatures promote the reduction of urban heat island. Such green spaces, gardens and even squares are the least polluted places in a town. Breezes generated by the parklands repel and disperse pollutants, generally issue from traffic cars. Green spaces and gardens contribute significantly to improving the microclimate and reducing the rate of pollution in the city. Therefore, the parklands are the lungs of the city. The parkland should be the most important developments in the city of tomorrow.

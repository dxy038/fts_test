Background and objective: Several studies have indicated that vertex type androgenetic alopecia have a higher-than-normal risk for coronary heart disease but few studies focused on lipid profiles which are important in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease. This study was designed to investigate the relation between vertex type androgenetic alopecia (grade III and higher according to Hamilton-Norwood) and hyperlipidemia.
Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, lipid parameters (total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio) of 50 men with vertex type androgenetic alopecia (study group) were compared with 50 men with normal hair status (control group). Study group matched according to the age, BMI and habit of smoking with control group.
Results: Study group had a higher triglyceride and lower HDL cholesterol levels than control group. Total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio was significantly higher in study group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Vertex type androgenetic alopecia could be a clinical marker of hyperlipidemia and dermatologists should investigate lipid profile in these patients.

The Air Force Research LaboratoryÂ´s Satellite Threat Warning and Attack Reporting (STW/AR) program will provide technologies for advanced threat warning and reporting of radio frequency (RF) and laser threats. The STW/AR program objectives are: (1) Develop cost-effective technologies to detect, identify, locate, characterize, and report attacks or interference against U.S. and Allied satellites. (2) Demonstrate innovative, lightweight, low-power, RF and laser sensors. The program focuses on the demonstration of RF and laser sensors. The RF sensor effort includes the investigation of interferometric antenna arrays, multi-arm spiral and Butler matrix antennas, wideband receivers, adaptive processors, and improved processing algorithms. The laser sensor effort includes the investigation of alternative detectors, broadband grating, and optical designs, active pixel sensing, and improved processing algorithms. An objective for both sensors is to miniaturize the sensor packages to reduce the weight and power requirements

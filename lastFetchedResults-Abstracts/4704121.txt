Subjective audio quality is currently obtained using expensive and time consuming listening tests that provide limited information. In this paper we show the different behaviors of several objective metrics designed to match subjective results over different audio sequences for several audio distortions. In particular we extend these metrics to the case where distortions vary temporally and evaluate performance over two common time-varying distortions.

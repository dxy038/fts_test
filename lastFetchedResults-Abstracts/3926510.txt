In this paper, we propose a method designed to allow creatures to actively respond to a fluid environment. We explore various objective functions in order to determine ways to direct the behavior of our creatures. Our proposed method works in conjunction with generalized body forces as well as both one-way and two-way coupled fluid forces. As one might imagine, interesting behaviors can be derived from minimizing and maximizing both drag and lift as well as minimizing the effort that a creatureÂ´s internal actuators exert. A major application for our work is the automatic specification of secondary motions, for example, certain joints can be animated, while others are automatically solved for in order to satisfy the objective function.

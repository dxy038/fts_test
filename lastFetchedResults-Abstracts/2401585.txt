The improved grey correlative method was put forward in order to improve the objectivity of grey synthetic evaluation method. Because balanced adjacent degree, which is derived from weighted grey correlative degree and balanced degree, was adopted as evaluation criteria in this model, the evaluation result is more adjacent to reality. This method was applied in the safety evaluation of underground transportation systems in 6st mine of Pingdingshan Coal Group Co. Ltd. The safety order preference and safety differences of all fully mechanized mining faces are gained. At the same time, safety problems existing in man, machine and environment of fully mechanized mining faces are pointed out. The corresponding countermeasures to improve safety are put forward. The evaluation results indicate that the improved method be more reasonable and objective than general grey correlative method.

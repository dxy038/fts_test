The objective of this study was to investigate the use of whole-tree eastern redcedar furnish (Juniperus virginiana L.) in
manufacturing three-layer particleboard panels. Static bending properties, internal bond strength, screw holding strength, and
thickness swelling of the panels were determined according to the procedure of ASTM D-1037. Surface roughness and overlaying
properties of the samples were also evaluated. No significant difference was found among the specimens prepared from 20
experimental panels at a 95% confidence level. Average physical and mechanical properties of the panels were found to be
comparable to those of commercial particleboard manufactured from other species. Static bending and internal bond strength of the
three-layer panels were, however, 18â€“20% lower than those of single-layer boards made from the same type of furnish in a previous
study. Based on the findings of this study, it appears that three-layer particleboard can be manufactured from whole-tree furnish of
low quality of eastern redcedar without having any adverse influence on properties of the panels

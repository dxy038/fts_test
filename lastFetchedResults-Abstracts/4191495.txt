In this paper, it is tried to introduce, implement and control the voltage of one of the most important fuel cells, i.e. PEMFC, during load variations. Output voltage of fuel cell should be constant during load variation. To achieve this goal, a controller should be designed. Here, the PID controller is used which its coefficients are optimized based on genetic algorithms. In order to use this algorithm, first this problem has to be formulated as an optimization problem including objective function and constraints, and then to obtain the most desirable controller, GA method is used to solve the problem. Simulation results for various loads in time domain are performed and the results show the capability of the proposed controller. Simulations show accuracy of the proposed controller performance to achieve this goal.

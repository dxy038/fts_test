Novel automotive radar of 76 GHz band has been manufactured and the field tests have been successfully carried out. The radar features by applying SAGE algorithm to the multi-beam dielectric lens. For simple structure and small size, we used a patch array antenna as feed. Under severe constraints of the size, the lens shape has been designed by multi-objective genetic algorithm. Through the field test, it is confirmed that 2 targets separated by 3.5m can be resolved over the range from 20m to 80m.

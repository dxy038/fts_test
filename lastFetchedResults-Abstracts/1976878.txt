The article reviewing both viewpoints tries to sum up them somehow acceptable and useful to information systems and with critical approach analyses subjective paradigm dominant in relevance literature. Methodology: The present study is based on the descriptive-analysis methodology using the library sources.
 Findings: Necessity of more moderate and realistic viewpoints which recognize the role of experts and systems in addition to users in the literature of relevance. Also introducing the “Facet Relevance”, it has been proposed objectivism and subjectivism be recognized not only to design information systems but also to defining relevance. The effects of technology on the approaches of information system design free from theoretical viewpoints were investigated too.

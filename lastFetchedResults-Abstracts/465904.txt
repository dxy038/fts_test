Objective: This study was undertaken to examine the effect of obstetric resident physician gender on the forceps delivery rate. Study Design: Analysis was based on >350,000 deliveries performed by >800 residents in obstetrics and gynecology throughout the United States from 1994 to 1998. A Ï‡2 analysis was performed on resident statistics from residency review committee report forms. Results: The percentage of total deliveries performed with forceps during residency was significantly higher among male residents (P< .0001), as was the percentage of vaginal deliveries performed with forceps during residency (P< .0001). The percentage of overall operative vaginal deliveries (vacuum plus forceps) was significantly higher for male residents (P< .0001); however, the percentage of vacuum deliveries did not vary according to gender of the resident when considered independently. Conclusion: These results strongly suggest that resident gender affects performance of forceps delivery. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:1050-1.)

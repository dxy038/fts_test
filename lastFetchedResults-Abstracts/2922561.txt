Apart from loss in gain, one other outcome of surface errors on the performance of reflector antennas is to introduce cross-polarization along the boresight. It is the objective of the author investigates the effect of surface aberrations on the performance of axisymmetric reflector antennas employing circular and linear polarizations. Furthermore, the effect of regional variations in the surface tolerance on the cross polarization characteristics are also studied

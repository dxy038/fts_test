The literature on engineering models of the human Thermoregulatory system is reviewed and classified. The present review is a sequel to "A Review on Mathematical Models of the Human Thermal System." Emphasis in this review is the incorporation of physiological thermoregulation into engineering models. The objective is to present major mathematical models of human thermoregulatory systems which can be used in simulation and design for practicing engineers.

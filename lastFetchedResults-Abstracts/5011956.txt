In this paper, an efficient method is proposed for Economic Load Dispatching (ELD) in consideration of the environmental preservation. The proposed method is based on Multi-objective meta-heuristics (MOMH) that evaluates a set of the Pareto solutions systematically. From a standpoint of sustainable energy or environmental protection, the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission is one of main concern in generation scheduling. As a result, ELD is required to minimize the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emission while minimizing the operational cost. To solve such a problem, this paper proposes efficient MOMH that evaluates a set of the Pareto solutions efficiently. As MOMH, MOEPSO (Multiple objective Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization) that corresponds to an extension of MOPSO (Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization) is used to evaluate better solutions. The EPSO strategy in MOEPSO contributes to adaptive parameter adjustments significantly. In addition, the strategy of density information in SPEA2 is employed to enhance the solution quality for a set of the Pareto solutions. The proposed method is successfully applied to the 39-node 10-unit sample system.

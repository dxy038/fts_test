The connection of distributed generation (DG) has a great impact on the operation and planning of distribution net work, which has a relation to the selection of installation site and optimal capacity of DG. The DG cost is much higher than conventional power, therefore calculation of siting and sizing of DG only considering the transmission losses cannot achieve economic optimum. This paper established transmission loss cost calculation model based on power dependency trace methods and cost flow conservation principle, under the uncertain number, location and individual capacity of DG, the minimal transmission losses cost of distribution network is taken as the objective function, and the site and the capacity of DG are optimized using the improved adaptive genetic algorithm. Its purpose is to make transmission losses cost minimum. Through the analysis of an example, the results using this algorithm is compared with optimization results taking the minimal transmission losses as the objective function, it is verified that the fairly rational selection scheme for installation site and optimal capacity of DG can be obtained with the proposed method.

Introduction & Objective: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been effective in reducing postoperative pain (70-90%).The mechanism of TENS is not clear but Gate - Control theory may explain it. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effect of TENS on post cesarean section pain and on analgesic intake during the first 24hr postoperative period.
Materials & Methods: In a double-blind randomized clinical trial, sixty four primiparous women, each having undergone an elective cesarean delivery, participated in the study and were assigned randomly to two groups. For 32 of them (TENS group) TENS was applied in the recovery room every 6hr during the first 24hr after operation for a period of 30 minutes. Narcotic drugs were also injected intravenously if more analgesia was required. For control group (32 patients), analgesia was introduced only by narcotic drugs, when needed. VAS (visual analogue scale) was used to estimate the intensity of pain. The frequency of pain attacks and analgesic intake were also obtained from their hospital charts.
Results: The mean scores of pain for TENS group and control group were 5.9 ± 0.8 and 7.9±0.5, respectively. The mean scores of pain attack frequency were 1.78± 1.3 and 6.03± 1.15 for TENS group and control group in order. The mean of frequency of narcotic use was 0.94 ± 0.93 in TENS group and
4.09 ± 1.03 in control group. The mean	of the amount of
narcotic use was 47.4 ± 46.9 mg in TENS group and 204.7 ± 51.4 mg in control group. Results showed significant differences between the two groups (p<0.05).
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that well-structured interdisciplinary program of postoperative TENS management can reduce the intensity and frequency of pain attacks after CIS. It can also decrease the patients need for pain medication.

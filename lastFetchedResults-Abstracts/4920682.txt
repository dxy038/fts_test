In this paper we study the lengths of the routes in ad hoc networks. We propose a simplified theoretical model having as objective to estimate the path length for the routing protocols that are using flooding during their path discovery phase. We show how to evaluate the average gain in the hop number that one can obtain by using a simple reduction strategy. We prove the gain to be linear under very general conditions and show how it can be computed practically.

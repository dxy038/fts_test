Objective: We investigated the correlation of residency abortion training and other variables with abortion provision. Study Design: We surveyed obstetrician-gynecologists who graduated from five residency programs. Subjects were asked about demographic characteristics, residency abortion training, and abortion provision. We used a logistic regression model that included all variables that were correlated significantly with abortion provision in univariate analyses. Results: Of 161 physicians (61%) who responded, 131 physicians (83%) participated in abortion training. Seventy-six physicians (47%) provided abortions currently, and 95 physicians (58%) had provided abortions at some time since residency. Three variables were independently, positively correlated with abortion provision: the number of abortions that were performed during residency, the gestational age limit of abortion training, and urban practice. Negatively correlated with provision were membership in a restrictive practice and training outside the teaching hospital. Conclusion: Variables that were indicative of more extensive residency abortion training were associated positively with the current provision of abortion. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1161-3.)

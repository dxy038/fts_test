Watershed, as it comprehensively represents any part of water resource on our land, is considered the most appropriate units not only for the assessment of water environment, analysis and usage of water resources, but also for the management of water quality. Therefore, many scholars use watershed management to deal with the arising water problems and maintain sustainable development at watershed scale. Considering the complication and uncertainty of watershed system, previous scholars began to use various newly-built models to fulfill the task of watershed management, that is, the multi-objective optimization watershed management models. These models enable us to view watershed management from environmental, economical and social aspects. Base on the study of these models, this paper comprehensively concludes the mechanics, feature and methods of the models. Especially, we analysis four applications of multi-objective optimization models in watershed management. Finally, we analysis the problems of the existing models and express our expectation of the development of multi-objective optimization watershed management models in the future.

Being based on the controlling theory in nonlinear system, we apply the controller which is designed by ourselves to successfully move the Hopf bifurcation point (0,0,0) to a specify point. At the same time, with the help of the other controller which is also designed by ourselves, we achieve the objective that move the parametric Hopf bifurcation point (0,1 + b/a, - 1 - b/a) to a specify point. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the feasibility and effectiveness, so the result of the control is mutually verified with the theoretical analyses and numerical simulations.

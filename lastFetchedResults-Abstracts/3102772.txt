Secure routing is the key to assure wireless sensor networks working in order, and the classical security mechanisms, such as encryption and authentication can only prevent the outside attacks. In order to defeat the attacks of the inside malicious or captured nodes, in this paper, the trust technology and node&#194;&#191;s location information are employed in the process of routing. At the same time, for prolonging the life of the network, the residual energy is still regarded as an important factor to make routing decision. Based on the method of weighted sum of square in the multi-objective optimization technology, a secure routing scheme is put forward, in which the routing decision is made by the residual energy, trust value and the hops to destination sink. And this routing scheme can achieve secure routing and prolong the life of the network simultaneously.

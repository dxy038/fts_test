W. S. Murray: It is certainly a great pleasure and honor to stand up before such an excellent gathering of my brother engineers. I do not think that we are here today to discuss the technical features of power generation, transmission, traction, and all such problems of electrical engineering with which we are so familiar. If I could accomplish the real objective of my standing before you today, it would be to infuse in you something which I believe to be right and something that we should do.

Aims: To assess the prevalence of the use of supplements (sip feeds) in district general, psychiatric and community hospitals in the former Wessex health region.
Method: Cross sectional study of prevalence and determinants of supplement use in 10 district general hospitals (covering medical, surgical, orthopaedic, and elderly specialities), 4 psychiatric hospitals and 3 community hospitals.
Results: Overall 14% of patients were being supplemented although the variation across hospitals and specialities was wide (0%–35%); elderly care patients within district hospitals were most likely to be supplemented (20%; range 12–35%). In 34% of patients there was no documented reason as to why supplements were given. 60% of patients were not weighed on admission; 70% did not have a weight history recorded and 83% did not have a current weight recorded. Documentation regarding supplement use appeared to be recorded in an unsystematic manner.
Conclusions: Many patients were not being weighed on admission and appeared to have no documentation as to why supplements were given. Given the importance of malnutrition in hospital patients a more evidence based, objective approach to assessing nutritional requirements, intake and support may be beneficial.

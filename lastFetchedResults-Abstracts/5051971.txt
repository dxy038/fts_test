A superheterodyne receiver intended for TDMA multi-standard operation is presented. The receiver achieves image rejection, by employing a very high first intermediate frequency, common for the three standards involved. The second IF stage positions the signal at a lower frequency, suitable for analog channel selection and bandpass sub-sampling, making the conversion to baseband a trivial digital task, The main objective is the determination of the feasibility of the architecture by extracting the building block parameters in order to operate for all the GSM-like standards

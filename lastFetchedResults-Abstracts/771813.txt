Using a historical reconstruction, we discovered a potential trophic cascade involving cougar (Puma concolor), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) in the Yosemite Valley of Yosemite National Park in California. Our objective was to determine whether large deer populations in the absence of a top-level carnivore were suppressing tree regeneration. As human visitation increased in the early 1900s and cougar became increasingly scarce, the mule deer population irrupted in the 1920s. In August 2006, we undertook a retrospective study of black oak recruitment (i.e., growth of seedling/sprouts into tall saplings and trees) by inventorying all black oaks in stands accessible to deer and greater than 0.5 ha in size (18 stands, 2921 trees). We similarly inventoried oaks within sites representing refugia from deer browsing (4 stands, 481 trees). While significantly diminished oak recruitment has occurred since the 1920s in stands accessible to deer (p < 0.01), continuous recruitment of oaks was found in refugia sites. We also found less oak recruitment in areas of high human activity near the parkâ€™s visitor center (p < 0.01), possibly due to behaviorally-mediated effects of lower cougar and higher deer densities. Overall our results are consistent with trophic cascade theory involving large predators, herbivores, and plants. The long-term lack of oak recruitment is also an indicator of a probable loss of biodiversity.

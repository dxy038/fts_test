This paper describes how coarse wavelength-division multiplexing can realize a multiplexed multichannel video and Internet protocol (IP) system. In the proposed configuration, each signal is optically amplified separately to extend the service area. The IP signals are boosted by cost-effective erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, which have a simple configuration optimized for single-channel use. Two multiplexer/demultiplexer configurations are described. The proposed configurations yield a contents distribution network that offers bidirectional IP service in addition to the multichannel video service, which is transmitted as an analog signal. This paper presents an experiment that confirms the feasibility of this proposed system.

The limitations relative to the potential for creating cable TV system-based metropolitan area networks (MANs) are discussed. The topology and terminology of a cable TV system, the signals transmitted over the cable, and the problems of external noise on the system and noise created by the system are reviewed. A collection of services that can be provided on a cable TV-based network and problems associated with doing so are discussed. Solutions to the obstacles caused by attempting to graft a bidirectional network onto a unidirectional broadcast medium are presented. The ways in which the resulting MAN will relate to the IEEE 802.6 and the ISDN standard are outlined.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

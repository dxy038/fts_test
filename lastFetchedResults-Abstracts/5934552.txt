The synthesis of a valid and optimized deployment model from functional and platform models is a crucial issue in the development of distributed real-time systems. The synthesis consists in the allocation of functions/signals to execution nodes/communication buses, the mapping of functions/signals into tasks/messages and the priority assignment to tasks/messages. Current approaches provide partial solutions for the synthesis of a deployment model on distributed platforms, as either the allocation or the mapping is fixed a-priori. In order to tackle this problem we propose an optimization technique, based on two different mathematical programming formulations, to handle optimization of both allocation and mapping. The optimization is multi-objective and considers extensibility maximization, latency minimization and minimization of the number of tasks. The obtained solutions satisfy timing and platform resources requirements. An automotive case study shows the effectiveness of our approach.

Objective
We have evaluated T-cell reconstitution and reactivity in patients receiving nonmyeloablative haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) protocols involving an anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody (MEDI 507) to treat chemorefractory hematopoietic malignancies.
Methods

Three cohorts of four patients each and one cohort of six patients received one of four Medi-507–based regimens, all of which included cyclophosphamide, thymic irradiation, and a short posttransplantation course of cyclosporine.
Results

Following marked T-cell depletion, initially recovering CD4 and CD8 T cells were mainly memory-type cells. A high percentage of CD4 T cells expressed high levels of CD25 in recipients of all protocols, except the only protocol to include fludarabine, early post-HCT. CD25 expression varied inversely with T-cell concentrations in blood. CD25high CD4 T cells expressed Foxp3 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4, indicating that they were regulatory T cells (Treg).
Conclusions

Fludarabine treatment prevents Treg enrichment after haploidentical nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation, presumably by depleting recipient Tregs. In vitro analyses of allorecognition were consistent with a cytokine-mediated rejection process in one case and in another provided proof of principle that mixed chimerism achieved without graft-vs-host disease induces donor- and recipient-specific tolerance. More reliable achievement of this outcome could provide a promising strategy for organ allograft tolerance induction.

Cellular system design for the next generation must allow for far greater numbers of terminals than todayÂ´s systems do and yet provide speech quality at least as good as today. Digital techniques will not alone achieve this objective. The falling cost of terminals must not be offset by a disproportionate rise in system cost. The integration of microcellular structures within a conventionally-sized cellular system together with fast and imperceptible handover will enable operators to tailor the system economically to the diverse needs of dense city and sparse rural areas while users get good performance. Improved fading performance will open up the market for a range of new services.

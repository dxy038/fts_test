Objective
The number of bedridden elderly patients who need a liquid diet has been increasing. We evaluated the usefulness of a tube-fed liquid diet containing cellulose and oligosaccharide for elderly bedridden patients.
Methods

Twenty-two elderly bedridden patients were given a liquid diet containing cellulose and lafinose for 4 wk. Parameters associated with blood and stool weight were measured during this period.
Results

Stool weight increased by 32.0 g in men and 8.8 g in women at 2 wk and remained at these weights up to 4 wk (P < 0.05 before and after 2 wk, 3 wk, and 4 wk in men, and P < 0.05 before and after 3 wk in women). Body weight increased in men (0.5 kg) and women (0.7 kg) 15 d after starting the diet and then remained at these values up to 29 d thereafter, and statistically significant differences were not seen. There were no changes in nutritional parameters such as total protein.
Conclusion

No significant changes were observed in the general condition of elderly patients, with the exception of a positive increase in fecal weight, by 30-d supplementation of a liquid diet containing cellulose and lafinose.

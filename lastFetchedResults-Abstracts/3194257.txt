Optimization of multimodal should be considered the selection of optimum parameters in electromagnetic design. This is because optimal construction about the one objective function has bad performance about the other one caused by nonlinear and interaction among parameters. In this paper, the new algorithm using contour concept in conjunction with Simplex method on the Kriging interpolation model can find all the peaks in the problem region with few function calls. Through applying test function, the performance of proposed algorithm is proved. The results about the IPM (Interior Permanent Magnet Motor) optimization show the availability of this new algorithm.

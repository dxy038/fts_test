A novel frequency and pattern reconfigurable slot antenna is proposed. Slot antenna produces a bidirectional radiation pattern, thus a reflector is positioned behind of the antenna to generate a directional radiation pattern. Two switches are placed in the slot to produce three reconfigurable frequency bands: at 1.82 GHz, 1.93 GHz and 2.10 GHz. The introduction of four slits at the edge of the ground plane offers pattern reconfigurability. To tune the beam angles, three switches are inserted into each slit. By manipulating the phase of upper and lower slits in the ground plane, the proposed antenna is capable of reconfiguring its beam to three different angles at 0&#176;, -15&#176; and +15&#176;. The simulated and measured results of reflection coefficient and radiation patterns are presented and compared.

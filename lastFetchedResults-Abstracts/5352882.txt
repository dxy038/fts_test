For the arrays of high frequency ground wave radar, a method with a signal to estimate the mutual coupling coefficient of arrays was brought out, which was based on principle of signal subspace and utilizing the parallel genetic algorithm. After estimating the impedance matrix C precisely with an assistant source, mutual coupling can be counteracted effectively for any types of array. Computer simulation results show that the proposed method successfully counteracts mutual coupling and direction of arrival (DOA) of sources can be estimated precisely. Furthermore, as output voltage vector and objective function are obtained, this method can be adopted to solve the problems of channel mismatch and elementsÂ´ position errors

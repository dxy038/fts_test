international system and the reform of the UN in relation to the concepts of
legitimate defense are analyzed.

with the UN charter in 1945. So the charter has tried to regulate fundamental
aspects of relations between states, such as maintaining international peace
and security, recognizing the equal rights of nations, respecting human rights,
ruling of law, regulations and restriction on the use of force to protect civilians
in time of war. Article 2 (4) on the UN Chater says: “All members shall
refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against
the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other
manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations.”
Results: To expand legitimate defense to potential treats utterly destroys the
international peace and security and procedures of the UN repeatedly denies
this doctrine.

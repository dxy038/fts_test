The Indiana Cyclotron control system consists of several hundred cyclotron devices and two operator stations linked to a small digital computer via a bidirectional, multiplexed digital bus. All communication between operators and the cyclotron is by means of 64 displays. Provision is made for readout, control, data logging and retrieval, alarm warning, and initiation and termination of automatic control programs. Special features of the system are the modular and dynamic master table which uniformly describes the cyclotron devices to all the programs which drive them, and the dynamically reconfigurable cyclotron control displays.

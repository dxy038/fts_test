A priori concepts, according to Kant, are used just for the objective or the experienced phenomenon, and applying them for the others (non-empirical or as Kant calls it the “noumena”, the “things-in-themselves,” or (elsewhere) the “transcendental objects”) are not valid.  Unlike Kant, in Newtonian physics, they can be used both for experienced and non- experienced phenomenon. Comparing with what was developed by Nicolas Copernicus in Cosmology in the 16th century, Kant calls his viewpoint as a “Copernican Revolution” that happened in the philosophy. In the framework of Critical philosophy, Kant tries to explain and defend from his epistemological revolution. Here, firstly, I will argue that, Kant's premises of judgment (assuming their correctness) do not entail the transcendental Idealism, and secondly, Kant's Copernican revolution is not a perspective in the frame of critical philosophy but it is a kind of transcendental metaphysics.

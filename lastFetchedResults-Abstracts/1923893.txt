Individuals aged &gt;85 years are the world's most rapidly growing age group and have a high incidence of cardiovascular mortality. The objective of this study was to prospectively determine the prognosis of abnormal cardiac structure and function in an age-homogenous, community-dwelling population of subjects born in 1920 and 1921. Subjects were recruited from the Jerusalem Longitudinal Cohort Study. Echocardiography was performed with a portable echocardiograph at the subjects' places of residence. Standard echocardiographic assessment of cardiac structure and function was performed. Five-year mortality was assessed through a centralized government database. Five hundred two subjects (235 men, 267 women) were enrolled in the study, of whom 107 (21%) had died at the time of 5-year follow-up. Subjects who died had significantly higher left atrial volume indexes (42.3 ± 16.5 vs 36.6 ± 12.5 ml/m2, p &lt;0.01) and left ventricular mass indexes (133.1 ± 47.6 vs 119.8 ± 30.6 g/m2, p &lt;0.05). Ejection fractions were significantly lower in subjects who died (52.5 ± 11.5% vs 56.4 ± 9.4%, p &lt;0.003), but indexes of left ventricular diastolic function were not significantly different between the 2 groups (E/e′ ratio 13.0 ± 5.3 vs 12.2 ± 4.9, p = 0.18). In conclusion, elevated left atrial volume index and left ventricular mass index and decreased LV systolic function predicted 5-year mortality in a community-dwelling population of subjects aged 85 years, even after correction for possible confounders. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction did not predict 5-year mortality in this cohort.

Objective To implement the optimization of beam weight in IMRT planning optimization. Methods The treatment planning system of IMRT has been developed with SCG algorithm for determining the intensity-modulated beams and pencil beam model for dose distribution. Results A example of a lung case has been optimized by the IMRT system. The DVH shows that 97%PTV is irradiated by 95%~105% of the described dose. OAR and normal tissue are irradiated by no more than 15% and 40% respectively. Conclusion SCG algorithm implemented as an inverse planning algorithm for determining the intensity-modulated beams that will most closely generate a desired dose distribution is presented as well as a method for dose calculation in IMRT using pencil beam model.

Abstract
Background & Objectives: Environmental pollution to toxic heavy metals is one of global 
environmental problems. Microorganisms perform several mechanisms to reduce the intracellular concentration of toxic pollutants. The objective of this study was to identify zinc resistance 
determinant (czcC gene) in zinc resistant Pseudomonas stutzeri SEE-1 isolated from soil.
Materials & Methods: The strain was performed on a P. stutzeri strain isolated previously from soil by culture on MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether). The maximum tolerable concentrations of zinc ions and zinc oxide nanoparticles were determined. PCR amplification was used to 
investigate the czcC gene. The nucleotide sequence was translated into protein sequence and its sequence was compared with other similar sequences in other zinc resistant bacteria.
Results: The highest tolerable concentrations of zinc ion and zinc nanooxide was measured at 4mM and 600 Âµg ml-1, respectively. The primers used for the amplification of the Zn-resistance gene (czcC) yielded a approximately 250 bp band. The comparison of czcC with other sequences in the gene bank database demonstrated 100% similarities with czcC gene in P. stutzeri 1501.          
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that soils contaminated with heavy metals are 
potential sources for the isolation of resistant strains to heavy metals and metal oxide 
nanoparticles. Understanding the genetic basis of bacterial resistance to heavy metals can improve application of these natural mechanisms to provide a safer environment for all living things.

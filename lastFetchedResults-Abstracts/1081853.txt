Environmental effects are one of the main concerns of massive desalination facilities. To reach the objective of no brine discharge the salt from seawater must be completely separated and obtained as a secondary and valuable product. If no CO2 emission increase is desired, the power source must be a combination of renewable energy systems (RES). This paper presents an analysis of an integrated desalination scheme consisting of two sequential systems: a multi-effect distillation (MED) plant and a mechanical vapour compression (MVC) system based on evaporator equipment. The energy is obtained by several wind turbines (WT) and a thermal solar collector (TSC) field. Separation of salt and water is achieved in a coupled multi-effect distillation-mechanical vapour compression (MED+MVC) two step process. The MED stage is driven by thermal solar collectors, whereas the energy consuming mechanical compression of the vapour (MVC) is fuelled by wind-powered turbines. Interestingly, the final products of this process are dry salt and fresh water. Such a system has been designed and dimensioned for a throughput of 100 m3/h of desalted water A preliminary study of the investment, amortization and exploitation costs of a combined MED+MVC+WT+TSC installation with these dimensions has been done. The price of desalted water, after considering the profits due to the sale of salt and electricity has been estimated at 0.59 Є/m3. If the initial investment has a 35% subsidy, a final price of 0.41 Є/m3 could be ensured, which is near the price associated to conventional energy sources. An outline of the solar collector system and the technical requirements of the wind turbines in needed to meet the energy demand of the MED+MVC system are also included.

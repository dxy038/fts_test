Increasing importance of sustainable development has lead eco-efficiency to find a specific position in literature. Eco-efficiency means producing goods and delivering services by using lower energy and raw material which together result in lower amount of wastes, pollution and cost. Eco-efficiency considers two aspects: economical and environmental. The purpose of this article is to design reverse logistics network whose eco-efficiency satisfies the opinion of decision maker. So a bi-objective linear programming model (minimizing cost and environmental effects) is developed and efficient points of model are found. In the following, using interactive method of STEM that considers trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives in interaction to decision maker, an efficient recovery network is presented.

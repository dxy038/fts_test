First, the subjective evidence was calculated considering the expert group´s advice. And the conflict experts were excluded before integration. Through defining the evidences´ sufficiency, we could determine the algorithm whether to close or to combine the objective evidence which was fused the two weights calculate by the entropy method and the principal component analysis method. Meanwhile, the Spearman method was used to testify and ensure the consistent of the subjective and objective evidence. The eventual weight that could meet the requirement of objective and subjective was calculated based on the above results. Thus, the conclusive result of simulation example demonstrated the effectiveness of the method and indicator system.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate the recurrence of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy with regard to the type of disorder, the onset of hypertension, and the modulating effect of overweight and weight gain between pregnancies.
Study design
Maternity records from 896 parous women with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy in the first pregnancy were reviewed to reclassify disease status and calculate odds ratios for recurrence.
Results
Recurrence of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy occurred in 58% to 94% of second pregnancies, depending on first pregnancy disorder. Overweight (odds ratio, 1.82) and weight gain (odds ratio, 2.20) were related to recurrence among women with gestational hypertension. Early hypertension (â‰¤34 weeks of gestation) increased the recurrence risk for women with gestational hypertension (odds ratio, 1.85) and preeclampsia (odds ratio, 3.42).
Conclusion
Recurrence of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy is common, but not specified by type of disorder in first pregnancy. Overweight and weight gain between pregnancies are associated with recurrent hypertensive disorders in pregnancy in women with gestational hypertension. Early onset of hypertension is a risk factor, independent of body weight.

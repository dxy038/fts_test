Abstract
The main objective of this paper is to investigate the asymmetric effects of oil prices on output growth in Iran during the 1968-2009 period using the Markov Switching model. After establishing the positive and negative oil price shocks, we estimate an MSIH(3)-ARX(2) model for real GDP growth .
The results show that positive price shocks have a positive and significant effect on GDP growth; on the other hand, negative shocks have a negative and significant effect on GDP growth. Also the oil price fluctuations have an asymmetric effect on real GDP growth and the impact of negative shocks on the growth rate is higher than that of the positive shocks.

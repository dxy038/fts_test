Ethno-archaeology is one of the main approaches that could help archaeologists to reconstruct the past behaviors, including social, cultural, economical and political behaviors. It is interesting to state that the most important aim of ethno-archaeology is to understand the past through observation of modern conservative societies. On the other hand, based on this framework, archaeologists attempt to make a bridge between the past (static) and the present (dynamic). In fact, via this approach, archaeologists are able to clarify background of traditional arts of modern societies. Better understanding of background of these arts enables scholars to represent worthy scientific methods to protect the traditions. Handmade carpet, which has two distinguished characteristics, namely genuineness and innovation, has developed in the Persian cultural region and has its roots in the ancient arts of this vast region. The objective of this paper is two folded, firstly to present a worthy scientific method to detect process of derivation of designs and patterns on the handmade carpets, and secondly to understand “how” and “why” of human past behaviors. In fact, the present paper will present suggestions to exploit past human behaviors of this vast region. Consequently, scholars who are studying handmade carpets will be able not only to derivate designs and patterns of carpets, but they will also be able to support this deep rooted art.

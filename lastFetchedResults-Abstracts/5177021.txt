The real advantage of dynamic cellular manufacturing system is the ability to operate under dynamic conditions required by todaypsilas production characters of short product life cycle, high production variety, unpredictable demand, and short delivery time, where the product mix and demand in each period is different. This paper addresses dynamic cell formation problem, and presents three major objectives for obtaining successful dynamic cell formation. Meanwhile, a nonlinear multi-objective mathematical model of dynamic cell formation is proposed, and the model comprises utilization rate of machines capacity, number of exceptional parts and other practical problems. The proposed model is verified by the commercial solver CPLEX software under a modest instance and computational results are reported.

IPTV services will become main services in the next-generation network. Good video quality is crucial for IPTV operation. In the paper, we give an overview of the state of the art of video quality assessment. Firstly, the impairment factors in IPTV system, including packet loss, jitter and bandwidth, are analyzed about their relationship with subjective perceived quality. Secondly, we discuss the application scenarios and characteristics of different objective video quality assessment categories.

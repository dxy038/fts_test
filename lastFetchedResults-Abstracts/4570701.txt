The main objective of the research is to propose an execution framework for workflow systems under threat. When the threat (intrusion) is detected, the workflow system needs to be stopped immediately to avoid any possible loss of enterprise data. The system becomes active again, once it is completely recovered from the threat. This proposed framework overcomes the problem of discontinuity of services as a result of threat detection by enabling the execution of the workflow on an alternate path, keeping the security and integrity of the asset information intact. Hence the system remains available all the time in a secured fashion making it possible for the end user to access the services and data even in the vulnerable state. To achieve the specified goals, the special authentication mechanism has been adopted to authorize the users after threat is detected. Then the data is hibernated that is transferred to the designed dimensions and the connectivity and access to the hibernated data is provided by the chameleon agent. These three core components enable the workflow to execute in a secured and robust manner during systemÂ´s unsafe state.

Multi-objective programming techniques have been applied in a number of ways to minimise more than one objective simultaneously. Some research work has been reported on multiobjective power flow studies. In this paper, surrogate worth trade-off technique (SWT) is attempted to achieve the best compromise between cost of generation and system transmission losses and the results have been compared with the existing method. It is found that the SWT technique gives encouraging results

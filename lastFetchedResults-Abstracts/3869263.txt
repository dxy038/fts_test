Polarimetric radar data collected by AIRSAR and SIR-C over agricultural fields, forests, and olive groves of the Italian Montespertoli site are analyzed. The objective is to investigate the radar capability in discriminating among various vegetation species and its sensitivity to agricultural and arboreous biomass. Results indicate that a combined use of P(0.45 GHz) and L- (1.2 GHz) bands allows one to discriminate between agricultural fields and other targets, while a combined use of L- and C- (5.3 GHz) bands allows the authors to discriminate within agricultural areas. To monitor biomass, P-band gives the best results for forests and olive groves, L-band appears to be good for crops with low plant density (m<sup>-2</sup>), while for crops with high plant density, both L- and C-bands are useful. The availability of crosspolarized data is important for both classification and biomass retrieval

150 elderly men living in Kahrizak center who had 
participated voluntary and had the including criteria were 
selected. From these number, 32 people were selected

Results:Analysis of covariance indicated that the efficacy of 
religious based training on life meaning and its sections in 
intervention group rather than before and after intervention is 
significantly meaningful (p < 0.001), but this efficacy is not 
meaningful in comparison with control group(p > 0.005).

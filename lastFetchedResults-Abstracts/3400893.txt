With multisatellite radar systems, several additional features are achieved: multistatic observation, interferometry, ground moving target indication (GMTI). In this letter, a new reduced-dimensional method based on joint pixels sum-difference (Sigma-Delta) data for clutter rejection and GMTI is proposed. The reduced-dimensional joint pixels Sigma-Delta data are obtained by the orthogonal projection of the joint pixels data of different synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images generated by a multisatellite radar system. In the sense of statistic expectation, the joint pixels Sigma-Delta data contain the common and different information among SAR images. Then, the objective of clutter cancellation and GMTI can be achieved by adaptive processing. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method even with clutter fluctuation and image coregistration errors

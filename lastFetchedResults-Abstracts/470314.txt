This editorial critically examines the definition of “cervical insufficiency.” The definition, the clinical ascertainment, efforts to develop an objective method of diagnosis, as well as the nature of cervical disease leading to spontaneous mid-trimester spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery are reviewed. The value and limitations of cervical sonography as a risk assessment tool for spontaneous preterm delivery are appraised. The main focus is on the role of cervical cerclage to prevent an adverse pregnancy outcome. The value of assessing the presence or absence of endocervical inflammation in the outcome of cerclage placement is discussed.

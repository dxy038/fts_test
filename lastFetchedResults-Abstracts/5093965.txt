Human beings have a remarkable ability to determine the direction of arrival of a sound and to separate sounds of interest. Replicating this ability is a challenging problem in audio signal processing. In this paper we present a model for the head related transfer function (HRTF) developed with the localisation objective in mind. This is achieved by splitting the 3D localisation cues in terms of two functions which can be independently evaluated. We illustrate the theory for calculating these functions and validate the results against actual HRTF data. We find the model to be a close match for a significant number of potential source locations.

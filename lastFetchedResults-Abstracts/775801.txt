Storage tanks with different cold water inlet devices for small Solar Domestic Hot Water (SDHW) systems are compared.
The objective of the investigation is to reveal the impact of the cold water inlet device on the thermal stratification
in two marketed tanks and to evaluate the possible enhancement in the annual system performance of small solar
heating systems. Two different marketed inlet designs are compared, one connected to a small curved plate placed above
the inlet tube, the other one connected to a much larger flat plate. The cold domestic water enters the stores in vertical
direction from the bottom of the tanks. Temperature measurements were carried out for different operating conditions.
It was shown that the thermal stratification inside the two tanks depends differently on the flow rate, the draw-off volume,
as well as the initial temperature in the storage tank. To carry out system simulations, a multi-node storage model
was used and expanded by an additional input variable to model the mixing behaviour depending on the operating conditions.
The inlet device with a comparatively large plate compared to the less favourable design results in an increase of
the solar fraction of about 1–3%-points in annual system simulations with a solar fraction of about 60% and fairly large
domestic hot water flow rates. This corresponds to a reduction of the auxiliary energy supply of the solar heating system
of about 3–7% (58–155MJ/year) for the investigated solar domestic hot water system.

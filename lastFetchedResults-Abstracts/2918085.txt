The Microcomputer Centre at Dundee University, with over twenty researchers, has the largest academic group in the UK investigating the design of computer systems for the disabled. The research team is multidisciplinary, including computer scientists and engineers as well as psychologists, linguists and therapists. This paper describes some of the research projects into communication aids for the speech and language impaired which is currently being carried out in the Centre. In order to describe the inter-relationship between the various projects, a communication aid is defined as comprising an input system, a communication system running on a computer and an output system. A major objective in the development of these systems is communication rate enhancement

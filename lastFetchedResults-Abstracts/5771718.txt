Be able to distinguish and characterize abnormal auscultation sounds is important for an accurate medical diagnosis. Even though several researches have been done on the analysis of auscultation sounds, today auscultation remains subjective and difficult to share. In the context of the MERCURE telemedicine platform, we started a project called ASAP. It deals in developing objective tools for the analysis of auscultation sounds and creating an auscultation sounds´ database in order to compare and identify the acoustical and visual signatures of the pathologies. Communication and network technologies are fundamental elements to be able to collect, document, share and transmit, in real time or not, auscultation sounds. Finally, the project aims at capitalizing of these new auscultation techniques around the creation of a teaching unit: the Auscultation´s School.

Objective: Occupational noise is one of the major causes of hearing loss and tinnitus. In the present study, the effect of occupational noise-induced tinnitus on auditory attention was investigated.
Method: Our study was done on 42 male workers aged 40 to 56 years in three groups of workers with hearing loss, hearing loss and tinnitus and normal hearing. Workers in two first groups had a long history of working in environments with excessive noise, and third group was matched control workers with normal hearing. For all subjects, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Bergen dichotic listening test was performed in identical conditions. 
Results: In all three conditions of attention including non-forced, forced right and forced left attentions, right ear advantage (REA) was lower in tinnitus and hearing loss group than two other groups, and difference between tinnitus and hearing loss and control group was significant in non-forced attention (p < 0.047). Both groups had poorer result in the MSSE test than control group too (p < 0.025). 
Conclusion: Our study revealed effect of noise-induced tinnitus on selective and divided auditory attention. It

The objective of the present study was to demonstrate an antioxidant function for Zn in vivo by comparing the efficacy of Zn or Vitamin E without additional energy intake for protection of Zn-deficient (ZnDF) or energy-restricted (ER) rats from hyperoxia-induced lung damage. Zn (200 μmol ZnCl2/kg b.wt.) or Vitamin E (100 mg α-tocopherol/kg b.wt.) was injected IP before exposure to 85% oxygen or air for 5 d. During the exposure period, all injected ZnDF or ER rats were restricted to 5 g Zn-deficient or Zn-adequate diet/day, respectively, the amount of diet consumed by the untreated ZnDF or ER rats. We clearly demonstrated that injection of Zn without additional energy intake can protect ZnDF and ER rats from hyperoxia-induced lung damage assessed by the histopathological scoring system and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Vitamin E was not as effective as Zn in either ZnDF or ER rats for preventing hyperoxia-induced lung damage. Zn injection did not exert its antioxidant effect through increased lung CuZn-superoxide dismutase activity or metallothionein. This difference in the effectiveness of Vitamin E and Zn for hyperoxic protection in lung injury may be due to the specificity of antioxidant function, i.e., vitamin E inhibits oxidation of membrane lipids and Zn protects sulfhydryl groups of proteins.

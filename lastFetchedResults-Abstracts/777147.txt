The objective of the project is an all-year secure supply of alternating current based on a solar energy island grid consisting of serial
components and seasonal energy storage. Photovoltaic modules, inverters, electrolysers, batteries, hydrogen stores and fuel cells form the
basis of the independent power supply system. For this, selected load profiles were analysed and evaluated in theory and practice.
The analysis is based on the results of the test runs of the system and the simulations, in which the combined hydrogen-battery-system
is compared to the battery system.
It was revealed that it is sensible to complement an island grid operating on lead batteries for shortterm energy supply with hydrogen
as a long-term store. This ensures a year-round supply security based on solar energy and the extension of the life span of the batteries
required for hydrogen-based power stores. The systems based purely on batteries can not provide perfect supply security during long
periods of low solar radiation since they do not possess energy stores which allow long-term energy storage.
Hence a seasonal energy store, such as hydrogen, is required to guarantee reliable power supply for every day of the year.
Autonomous power supply systems with long-term energy stores operate independently from the public grid system and can be implemented
without elaborate intelligent energy management. For this, however, the costs of the serial components must be reduced and the
efficiency of the system must be improved.

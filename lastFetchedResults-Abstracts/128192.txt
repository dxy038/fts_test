Background and Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of walnut on the lipid profile of normal and hyperlipidemic men.
Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty one male subjects (aged 28-65 years) were randomly assigned into two groups of normal and hyperlipidemic men. Each group was then divided into five subgroups, and fed 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 grams of walnut per day for the period of 30 days. In the second period of feeding, only half of the subjects in each subgroup were asked to consume the different levels of walnut for another 30 days as the second phase of study. Blood samples were taken from subjects at the beginning and the end of each feeding period and were analyzed for cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, VLDL and triglyceride.
Results: At the beginning of the study, the mean values of cholesterol, LDL-C, triglyceride, VLDL and LDL/HDL were 218, 133, 213, 28, mg/dl and 4.5 respectively. They significantly reduced to 185, 105, 178, 32 mg/dl and 2.3, respectively at the end of the study. The highest reduction was observed in subjects consuming 75g/day of walnut. There was an increase in triglyceride level in some subjects consumed more than 100 glday of walnuts.
Conclusion: It is concluded that adding some amounts of walnuts into the normal daily diet may favorably modify the lipoprotein profile, and decrease the serum cholesterol in normal and hyperlipidmic men.

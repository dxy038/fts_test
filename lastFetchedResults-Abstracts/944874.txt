The polycyclic synthetic musks (PCMs) such as galaxolide (HHCB), tonalide (AHTN) and celestolide (ABDI) are important ingredients in fragrances for consumer products because of their typical musky scent. In EU, PCMs are classified as HPVC (High Production Volume Chemicals). Furthermore, it has been recognized that these substances are only partially degraded in domestic sewers. For both reasons these chemicals are considered ubiquitous contaminants of aquatic systems. Monitoring data are available for the Northern region of the EU, but it is not known whether they are also representative for the Southern EU countries. The lack of data upon the environmental exposure in Southern EU can be significant, since use patterns and volumes differ from country to country. This is particularly true for Italy that has the largest detergent consumption per capita in EU. Due to this, the objective of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of selected PCMs in the Molgora River (Lombardia region, Italy). To our knowledge it represents the first overview of PCM occurrence in the Italian water bodies. Water samples were collected seasonally in seven sampling stations located before and after the 3 sewage treatment plants present along the river, which serve about 300,000 inhabitants. The spatial and temporal profiles of contamination are described. A comparison of the results with existing monitoring data of other European regions indicated a significant higher level of PCM pollution of the Molgora River and the need to extend the monitoring campaigns to other Italian water bodies, in order to achieve a better knowledge of the levels of PCM contamination in this country.

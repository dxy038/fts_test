Introduction & Objective: Hearing loss is a common disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Hearing loss can be caused due to genetic or environmental factors or even both. The genetic of hearing defect is highly heterogeneous and more than 100 genes are predicted to cause this disorder in humans. A newly identified gene (DFNB59) has been shown to cause deafness in some populations. Here we report mutation analysis for DFNB59 gene in 88 genetic non-syndromic hearing loss subjects.

Materials & Methods: In this descriptive-lab based study which was conducted at the Cellular and Molecular Research Center of Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood samples using standard phenol chloroform procedure. Mutation analysis for DFNB59 gene was performed using PCR-SSCP/HA protocol. The suspected DFNB59 which was detected as shifted bands on PAGE were then confirmed by direct sequencing strategy.

Results: Two DFNB59 polymorphisms including c.793C>G and c.793C>T were detected in 8 and 1 deaf subjects respectively.

Conclusion: We conclude that there is no association between DFNB59 mutations and deafness in the studied patients in the region.

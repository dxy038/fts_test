The objective of this paper is to present a centrifugal pump control system driven by a single-phase induction motor (SPIM) that is supplied by a photovoltaic generator. The study system consists of a PV array, a DC/DC converter, a DC/AC converter and a single-phase AC motor. The DC/DC converter is controlled in order to ensure the maximum power of the PV array. For the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) it is used the classical perturb and observe. In order to control the flow of the centrifugal pump a controller based on a diametrical inversion (DI) of the stator voltage is proposed. All the components of the system are implemented, modeled and simulated using the program Matlab/Simulink. The obtained results show the effectiveness and validity of the proposed control system.

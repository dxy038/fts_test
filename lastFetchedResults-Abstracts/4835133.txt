FCA is a mathematical framework that depicts knowledge derived from the data represented as formal context. The objective of this paper is to apply Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to analyze the key performance areas (KPA) of faculty of an institute. While constructing the formal context we have considered the faculties as objects and their KPA as attributes. This context is processed using FCA and the knowledge derived is analyzed to measure the performance of the faculty.

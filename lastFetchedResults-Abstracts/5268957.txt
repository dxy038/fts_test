This paper deals with the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with the parameters drifts and external disturbances. The objective is to develop a robust nonlinear state feedback law which will simultaneously solve the speed tracking control problem of the PMSM. The systematic strategy involves a novel nonlinear transformation of the PMSM model and the application of backstepping technique. The simulation results show that the control approach can overcome the parametric variations and external disturbances, have nice robust and efficiency.

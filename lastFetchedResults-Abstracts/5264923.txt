This paper reports a new built-in self-test scheme for analog and mixed-signal devices based on die-level process monitoring. The objective of this test is not to replace traditional specification-based tests, but to provide a reliable method for early identification of excessive process parameter variations in production tests that allows quickly discarding of the faulty circuits. Additionally, the possibility of on-chip process deviation monitoring provides valuable information, which is used to guide the test and to allow the estimation of selected performance figures. The information obtained through guiding and monitoring process variations is re-used and supplement the circuit calibration

The project "comparison between existing technologies of biomass gasification in brazil and abroad and formation of human resources in the Amazon Region-GASEIFAMAZ", accord FINEP/CT-ENERG, is a partnership between CENBIO-The Brazilian Reference Center on biomass, biomass users network, Amazon University and Technological Research Institute. For this project\´s accomplishment, the biomass gasification technology was imported from India, with the objective of testing this technology and providing sustainable electric energy for isolated communities at the Amazon Region, in order to replace the fossil fuel use. The operational and maintenance system tested was adjusted to the local implantation conditions and later installed in Aquidabam Village, at Amazon state. They have Cupuacu production, considered the community\´s leading agricultural resource. Despite of not having electric energy to keep the pulp frozen, Cupuacu is sold in natural by very low cost prices. With the electricity generated from the gasification system, this financial nuisance is solved

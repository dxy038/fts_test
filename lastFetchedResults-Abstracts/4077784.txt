Given a project network with a set of tasks to be completed according to some precedence relationship, the objective is to determine efficient project schedules for a range of project realization times. This problem is referred to as the time-resource tradeoff problem. Associated with each task are its normal duration, maximum allowable crash range, and resource cost per time unit for each resource. A multiple objective linear programming (MOLP) model is presented. The time-cost tradeoff technique is extended to solve the time-resource tradeoff problem. The methodology assumes that the project manager´s (the decision maker) utility function over the resource consumption costs is linear with unknown weights for each resource. Enumerative and interactive algorithms utilizing Geoffrion´s P(&#955;) approach, are presented as solution techniques. It is demonstrated that both versions have desirable computational times

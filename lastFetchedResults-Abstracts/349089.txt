Objective
There are only a few studies correlating diverse radiological and EEG features of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The objective of the study was to (a) describe EEG profile and (b) correlate it with the clinical and imaging data of patients with confirmed SSPE.
Methods
This study was conducted at a University teaching hospital in south India and involved 58 patients (M:F = 37:21, age: 12.3, SD 4.8 years) of SSPE. Diagnosis of SSPE was based on the characteristic clinical manifestations, and raised IgG ( 1:625) anti-measles antibody in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by ELISA in all the patients. Scalp EEGs were recorded on 16 channel machines using standard parameters and procedures. The EEG, clinical and imaging data were reviewed.
Results
EEGs were frequently abnormal: typical (37) and atypical (21). Diffuse slowing of background activity (BGA) was noted in 46 records being asymmetrical in six. Periodic complexes were periodic (32), quasi-periodic (21) or a-periodic (4). Periodic complexes (PC) (amplitude: 370.7, SD 171.2 μV; duration – 1.7, SD 2.0 s; inter-complex interval: 8.4, SD 9.2 s) were symmetrical in 39 and asymmetrical in 19. CT (32) and MRI (23) scans were normal in 16 patients while others had white matter (15), cerebral edema (8), cerebral atrophy (8), basal ganglia (2), and thalamic (2) changes. There was an independent association of frontally dominant slowing of BGA (p = 0.04) and typical PCs (p = 0.03) with the diffuse cerebral edema on imaging. White matter changes correlated with slowing of BGA (p = 0.04), but not with typical PC (p = 0.16).
Conclusions
This study provides valuable insight into the structural and clinical correlates of EEG changes in SSPE.
Significance
Irrespective of the incidence of occurrence of SSPE in a community, a clinician should be aware of the wide spectra of EEG findings. This study also discusses the possible underlying structural and clinical correlates.

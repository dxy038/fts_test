An implicit objective stress update algorithm is proposed for a hypoelastic–viscoplastic model. A
thermal/dynamic yield function, which is derived based on the thermal activation analysis and dislocation
interaction mechanisms, is used, along with the Consistency approach and the framework of
additive viscoplasticity, in deriving the proposed model for fcc metals. The corotational formulation
approach is utilized in developing the proposed model in the finite deformation field. For the case of
the Newton–Raphson iteration method, a new expression for the consistent (algorithmic) tangent stiffness
matrix of rate-dependent metals is derived by direct linearization of the stress update algorithm.
Finite element simulations are performed by implementing the proposed viscoplasticity constitutive
models in the commercial finite element program ABAQUS. Numerical implementation for a simple
tensile problem is used for validating the material parameters of the OFHC Copper under low and
high strain rates and temperatures. The numerical results of the adiabatic true stress–true strain curves
compare very well with the experimental data. The effectiveness of the present approach is tested by
studying strain localization in a simple plane strain problem. Results indicate excellent performance of
the present framework in describing the strain localization problem and in obtaining mesh-independent
results.

The position of a dielectric material inside the applicator of a microwave installation is analyzed and optimized using the Box Behnken type of experiment; this type of experiment can be found inside the optimization software known as &#8220;Minitab&#8221;. An experiment having three factors and three levels was carried out. ANOVA - Analysis of Variance was used to study the influence that the factors have on responses. The objective of optimization was to process corn seeds in microwave field for obtaining a humidity that is well-suited for good storage; another objective was to meet the quality requirements for the treated material. The numerical modeling software called Comsol Multiphysics was used for studying the influence that the factors have on the optimization response.

According to basic connotation of the indexes for expressing reservoir water-supply risk during drought: reliability, resilience and vulnerability of reservoir water supply, and mathematical programming principles, the multi-objective mixed integer programming model was set up, which was able to consider the priority of urban water-supply and agricultural water-supply, and operation rule of reservoir-group system for successive drought periods. The model-solving procedures and lattice work-search method was proposed based on characteristics of the model structure. The concept of technique is clear to understand and convenient to write computer program, therefore, the large-scale and complicated mixed programming model become easy to solve. The application example verifies rationality of the model technique and it has the practical value for multi-reservoir water-supply system operation policy analysis during drought.

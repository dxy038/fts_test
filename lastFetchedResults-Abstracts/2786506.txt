In this note we consider the closed-loop control of an aeroelastic torsion model where the control objective is to track a desired shape. A Lyapunov approach is utilized and an adaptive control algorithm using e-modification is proposed. The entire analysis is confined to the underlying infinite dimensional space and uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is proved. Numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the performance.

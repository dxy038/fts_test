This letter proposes a novel and complexity minimal random vehicle selection (RVS) scheme for drive-thru Internet systems. A mathematical framework is established with the objective of modeling a vehicle´s onboard unit´s buffer and evaluating its performance under RVS in terms of several quality-of-service metrics. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the proposed model´s validity and accuracy.

Background and Objective: In evaluation of genu varum and genu valgum which are common in growth period of children, tibiofemoral (TF), intercondylar (IC) and intermaleolar (IM) distances are commonly measured. Normally, the legs of most newborns are slightly curved or have moderate curves medially when they are in standing position. During their growth, the extension of the lower limb changes. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between normal intercondylar and intermaleoar distances and physiolgical factors among these subject groups.

Subjects and Methods: In this cross-sectional study a group of 850 children (452 females, 398 males) aged between 3 to 16 years old were studied. The samples were collected randomly from kindergartens, preschool care centers and schools in all 4 districts of Ahvaz, plus a few patients in Shafa hospital. The intercondylar and intermaleolar distance were examined in standing position, while the knee and hip joints were fully extended and the two medial maleolus or two medial condye of knees were in contact. In this study, descriptive statistics as well as t- and ANOVA tests were used for comparison. Pearson correlation for the survey were used data analysis by SPSS version 15. Results: The mean of intercondylar distance among studied groups was 1.65Â±0.86: 1.5 in boys and 1.71 cm in girls respectively. The mean of intermaleolar distances was 2.3 lcm: in males 2.05 cm and in females 2.53 cm, the difference was significant (P<0.05). Conclusion: There was a direct ralationship between intermaleolar distance and weight, height and length of leg, but relationship between Intercondylar distance and these factors is in reverse order.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of high and moderate summer ambient
temperature on thyroid structures and endocrine profile in developing ram lambs. Twenty fall
born ram lambs were randomly divided into 2 groups. Animals were kept outdoor (n=10) under
ambient temperature (31-50?C) or maintained indoor (26-32?C). Daily maximum ambient
temperature was recorded for both environments. Monthly serum T3 and T4 concentration were
compared between 2 groups throughout the experiment. The animals were slaughtered at the
end of the study and their thyroids subjected to histopathological examination. The results
showed that maximum outdoor ambient temperature was significantly higher than indoor. There
was significant difference between 2 groups on T3 concentration so that in high temperature
serum T3 was significantly lower than low ambient temperature. Although there was no
significant difference in serum T4 between 2 groups, the concentration of this hormone grossly
showed elevation in the group kept indoor. Histopathological examinations of the thyroid
revealed the same present of structural changes in both groups. In conclusion, direct exposure
of developing lambs to ambient temperature decreases T3 secretion by the thyroid which could
have many detrimental effects on lamb performance.

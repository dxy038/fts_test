For the purpose of solving the problems of unbalanced international goods flow and high transaction cost in the container shipping service supply chain, an approach of combinatorial auction was proposed in this article for the purchase strategy of multimodal transportation service. According to the various factors of freight rate, service quality, reputation, and network of transportation, the criteria of the winner (or winner mix) in the combinatorial auction of multimodal transportation service was established, as well as the single objective programming model. The simulation process was carried out via a case, which proved that the establishing model is rather feasible for the purchase strategy of multimodal transportation service.

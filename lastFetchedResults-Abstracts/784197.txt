Objective We sought to compare the efficacy of the ‘‘512
Psychological Intervention Model’’ (that is, ‘‘512 PIM’’, a
new psychological intervention) with debriefing on symptoms
of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and
depression of Chinese military rescuers in relation to a
control group that had no intervention.
Method We conducted a randomized controlled trial with
2,368 military rescuers 1 month after this event and then at
follow-up 1, 2 and 4 months later to evaluate changes in
symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression based on
DSM-IV criteria, respectively.
Results Baseline analysis suggested no significant differences
between the study groups. Severity of PTSD,
anxiety and depression decreased over time in all three
groups, with significant differences between the groups in
symptoms of PTSD (P\0.01). Compared with the
debriefing and control group, significant lower scores of
PTSD and positive efficacy in improving symptoms of reexperiencing,
avoidance and hyperarousal were found in
the ‘‘512 PIM’’ group.
Conclusion ‘‘512 PIM’’ was an effective psychological
intervention for military rescuers in reducing symptoms of
PTSD, anxiety and depression after a crisis

Gestures are important for communicating information among the human. Nowadays new technologies of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) are being developed to deliver userÂ´s command to the robots. Users can interact with machines through hand, head, facial expressions, voice and touch. The objective of this paper is to use one of the important modes of interaction i.e. hand gestures to control the robot or for offices and household applications. Hand gesture detection algorithms are based on various machine learning methods such as neural networks, support vector machine, and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost). Among these methods, AdaBoost based hand-pose detectors are trained with a reduced Haar-like feature set to make the detector robust. The corresponding context-free grammar based proposed method gives effective real time performance with great accuracy and robustness for more than four hand gestures. Rectangles are creating some problem due to that we have also implement the alternate representation method for same gestures i.e. fingertip detection using convex hull algorithm.

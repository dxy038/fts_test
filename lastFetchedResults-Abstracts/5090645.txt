Increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) is one of the characteristics of smart grids. The conventional distribution grid was not designed for the integration of DGs. Hence the integration of DGs into the distribution grid presents a few challenges to the operation of distribution network. This paper addresses some of these challenges and uses the concept of reconfiguration as a solution to meet these challenges. By reconfiguration, the maximum voltage at each node of the test network was kept within limits, thus mitigating the over voltage problem due to increased DG penetration. Since the reduction in number of switchings due to reconfiguration will help reduce the operation cost, this paper incorporates the objective of minimizing switching as well. The number of switchings could be reduced from six to two for the test network under consideration. Also it has been shown in this paper that reconfiguration can help in deferring the investment required in a transformer like adding on load tap changer.

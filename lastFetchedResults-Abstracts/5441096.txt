We present a realtime implementation of the time-critical core functions for 12 times 12 MIMO-OFDM (12 data streams) with LTE parameters on a cell broadband engine processor. An MMSE equalizer matrix update interval of 1 ms (high mobility) is achieved with less than 50% CPU utilization. Concurrent bidirectional processing (precoding and postprocessing) is shown to be feasible with this update rate.

This paper continues the authorsÂ´ attempt to address the need for objective comparative evaluation of layout analysis methods in realistic circumstances. It describes the Page Segmentation Competition (modus operandi, dataset and evaluation criteria) held in the context of ICDAR2007 and presents the results of the evaluation of three candidate methods. The main objective of the competition was to compare the performance of such methods using scanned documents from commonly-occurring publications. The results indicate that although methods continue to mature, there is still a considerable need to develop robust methods that deal with everyday documents.

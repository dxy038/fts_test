Anthropogenic urban soils, including brownfield soils, are currently characterised and
evaluated using mainly physico-chemical properties. Our objective was to determine if
biological indicators could provide a more comprehensive soil quality assessment relative to
sustainability, identifying contamination issues, and effectiveness of remediation
strategies. Plant, invertebrate and microbial assays and functional processes were
evaluated at 10 brownfield/anthropogenic urban locations at different stages of
remediation in northwest England. Extreme sites were discriminated on the basis of
earthworm counts and a small number of indicators likely to be related to their activity. It
was concluded that identifying a universally-applicable benchmark suite of biological
indicators is very unlikely without considerable advancement of knowledge and technology.

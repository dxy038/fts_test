In this paper, we propose a strategy to control the in-cylinder air and burned gas masses inside the combustion chambers of turbocharged VVT SI engines. We coordinate existing low-level controllers acting separately on the throttle, the waste gate and on the VVT actuators. Coordination is obtained by updating the set points based on real-time measurements. The objective is to improve transients response. The effect of the implicit feedback loop is analyzed by the small-gain theorem.

In this paper a new fuzzy dynamic Multi Criteria Decision Making model is introduced for decision making in scheduling problems, where the dynamical behavior (the time dependency) of the system is taken to account. After generating fuzzy dynamic decision matrix, the sets of fuzzy decision values of alternatives are determined. Different alternatives are prioritized based on a set of fuzzy decision values at different periods of times. Also the Fuzzy Inference System is used for generating the priority list of alternatives. The introduced method is applied to a decision making problem in scheduling of electrical power dispatching system as a case study. The main objective of this paper is to introduce intelligent decision support system to find the priorities and to increase the performance of decision making process in scheduling problems when critical/disasters events occurs.

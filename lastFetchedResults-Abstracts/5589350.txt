This paper considers work in the context of the CRUX project, which aims at the conception of a complete environment for parallel programming, in the development of a postgraduate course in Computer Science of Santa Catarina Federal University. This paper discusses a performance evaluation of several scheduling algorithms of real time systems found in the bibliography, about a simulation model that represents the processing as the communication of this multicomputer. The objective was to quantify the effect of the scheduling algorithm and other factors about some metrics of selected performance, in order to verify the applicability of CRUX in real time systems.

A new control approach based on discrete-time sliding modes is presented. The ideal known parameters case is first analyzed, obtaining a new definition of the so-called equivalent control as the continuous control which reduces to zero, in finite time, the distance of the system state from the sliding manifold in correspondence with the sampling interval. Then, under the assumption of bounded parametric uncertainties, an adaptive control scheme that guarantees the asymptotic satisfaction of the same control objective is designed and coupled with the variable structure control strategy

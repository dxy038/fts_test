Objective
Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause of acute 
neuromuscular paralysis in children, its pathogenesis most probably involving 
an autoimmune response to Schwann cell or peripheral nerve myelin antigens. 
Steroid regimes improve demyelinating diseases such as chronic GBS. We 
assessed the benefit of high dose methylprednisolone (MP) combined with 
Intravenous immunoglobulin (MP-IVIG) and compared the effects with those of 
IVIG per se in children with GBS. 
Materials& Methods 
Thirty-six children, aged between 1-12 years were randomized to receive IV MP 
20mg/kg/day combined with IVIG 400 mg/kg/day (MP-IVIG) or IVIG  per se at 
same dose for 5 days. All patients were diagnosed by standard clinical criteria 
and entered the trial within less than 2 weeks of the onset of neurological 
symptoms. All patients were too weak to walk. Functional grade (FG) was at 3
or more (able to walk with support).
Results
In the MP-IVIG  group, FG improved at least one grade after 5 days of treatment 
(P < 0.05), while those who received only IVIG  had no significant improvement 
in their FGs after 5 days of treatment (P < 0.2). The main outcome result remained 
significantly in favor of the MP-IVIG  treatment group. 
There was no significant difference in improvement of one or more FG between 
the groups, after 4 weeks of treatment (secondary outcome). 
The median time required to improve one FG was 12 days in MP-IVIG  as 
compared with 21 days in IVIG  per se (P < 0.5), and the median time required 
to reach the stage of walking independently (FG=2) was 36 days in MP-IVIG  as 
compared to 43 days in IVIG  per se (P < 0.03). 
Conclusion 
This study suggests that combined treatment with MP-IVIG  in children with 
GBS does cause rapid improvement in the acute phase, but does not result in 
any significant difference in the long term outcome.

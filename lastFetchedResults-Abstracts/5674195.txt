This paper discusses the results of a large and continuing study of objectively computable speech quality measures. The paper specifically addresses four topics. The first topic is the design of a general testing procedure for estimating the performance of objective speech quality measures. The second topic is a comparative study of 1500 parametric variations of commonly used objective speech quality measures. The third topic is the design of new complex objective speech quality measures based on the data available in the subjective quality data base. The final topic is the development of techniques for the design of improved speech coders based on the minimization of complex speech distortion measures.

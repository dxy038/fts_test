This paper addresses the problem of exploring tradeoffs between program memory, data memory and execution time requirements (3D) for DSP algorithms specified by data flow graphs. Such an exploration is of utmost importance for being able to analyse the feasibility and range of possible software solutions as part of a hardware/software codesign methodology where the target processor and the code generation style may lead to complete different solutions of the same specification. For solving this multi-objective optimization problem, an Evolutionary Algorithm approach is applied. In particular, a new Pareto-optimization algorithm is introduced. For different well-known target DSP processors, the Pareto-fronts are analyzed and compared

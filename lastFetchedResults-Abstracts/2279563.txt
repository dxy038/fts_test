Some water and wastewater pollutants cannot be eliminated by traditional treatment methods. This has encouraged workers to focus on high performance and environmentally friendly methods for their removal. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the modified mobile crystalline matter (MCM-41) including Ti-MCM-41, Fe-MCM-41, MCM-SiC3H6NH2, Mo- MCM-41, and unmodified MCM-41 in phenol removal from water. For the purposes of this study, MCM-41 was synthesized by hydrothermal methods. SEM, XRD, and FTIR analyses were used to determine phenol adsorption. Adsorption was measured in a batch reactor and the parameters affecting the adsorption process such as sorbent quantity, sorbent particle size, and pH were studied using the Statistix statistical software. The results showed that the unmodified MCM-14 has a great potential as a phenol adsorbent from water. The optimum amount of adsorbent for a phenol removal efficiency of about 95% was found to be 1 g of MCM-41 with a pore diameter of below 0.018 mm in 50 ml of phenol and a pH range of 7-9.

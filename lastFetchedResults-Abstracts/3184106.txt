This paper presents the implementation of Feedback Linearization Control (FBLC) for the stand-alone Wound Rotor Induction Generator (WRIG). The primary objective of the control scheme is to maintain a constant voltage and frequency at the generator output even under varying rotor speed and load conditions. Further, the control scheme is adaptable to ensure good quality power when feeding non-linear loads. This is achieved by incorporating active filter concept to cancel significant harmonics. The system performance with the FBLC and PI controllers is analyzed using Matlab/Simulink simulations. Simulation results for the test set up establish the effectiveness of the proposed control approach for the generator supplying linear and non linear loads.

A method of extracting bipolar junction transistor model parameters is presented which utilized the SPICE 2G-6 approach. The parameter-extraction technique is based on minimizing a nonlinear objective function, producing a least-squares fit of the model equations to a set of measured device characteristics. A strategic combination of the direct search optimization method and the variable metric algorithm is employed. A special strategy improving the speed of calculating the objective function during optimization is proposed. A model modification is also presented that gives high accuracy of the fit

An objective of the work has been to create a band pass square mesh-patch array Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) wall paper. Modifying the indoor wireless physical propagation environment to increase the coverage of certain communication systems was investigated and demonstrated in this research. General analysis approach for rectangular waveguide with square section is presented. The FSS is analysed by Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio (MWS) and Equivalent Circuit (EC) modelling. Remcom `Wireless InSite´ is used to simulate indoor propagation and to predict the performance. The concept has been tested inside `Wireless InSite´ and compared with VisiWave site survey data. Significant improvements are shown using an FSS based surface.

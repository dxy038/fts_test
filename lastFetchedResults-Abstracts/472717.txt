The objective of this study was to assess the influence of left ventricular (LV) geometric pattern on coronary vasomotion in patients with essential hypertension. We studied 34 hypertensive patients, who had never been treated, with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Patients were classified into four LV geometric patterns by echocardiography: normal, concentric remodeling, eccentric hypertrophy, and concentric hypertrophy. The responses of coronary vasomotion in left anterior descending artery to vasoactive agents (acetylcholine, isosorbide dinitrate, adenosine triphosphate) were examined using a Doppler guidewire and quantitative coronary angiography. The percent increase in coronary blood flow evoked with acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent vasomotion) showed lowest in concentric hypertrophy, followed by eccentric hypertrophy, concentric remodeling, and normal geometry. The significant linear relationship between acetylcholine-induced coronary blood flow and LV mass was noted. There was no difference in the percent increase in coronary blood flow evoked with isosorbide dinitrate (endothelium-independent vasomotion of conduit vessel) among the four groups. The percent increase in coronary blood flow evoked with adenosine triphosphate (endothelium-independent vasomotion of resistant vessel) was significantly lower in patients with concentric hypertrophy than in the other three groups. The results in this study suggest that coronary vasomotion may be associated with LV geometry in patients with hypertension. The endothelium-dependent vasodilation is impaired progressively as LV hypertrophy advances. The endothelium-independent vasodilation of microvessels is impaired only in concentric hypertrophy. This advanced abnormality of coronary vasomotion may contribute to the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with concentric hypertrophy.

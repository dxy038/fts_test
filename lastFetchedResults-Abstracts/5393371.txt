The main objective of the present study is to improve the bandwidth of the dielectric resonator antenna (DRA). A new four-element multilayer cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (MCDRA) array above the ground plane is proposed here. MCDRA is easy to design and excited with HE<sub>11&#948;</sub> mode excited in each MCDRA by centrally placed dielectric resonator in which TM<sub>01&#948;</sub> mode excited. The effect of design parameters such as permittivity of materials, probe height and arrangement of dielectric layers are investigated and the excited modes (i.e. TM<sub>01&#948;</sub> and HE<sub>11&#948;</sub>) are also been confirmed by simulations. The simulation is performed on AnsoftÂ´s HFSS package. The proposed multilayer cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (MCDRA) can offer an impedance bandwidth of ~47% for the return loss below -10dB where frequency range is from 4.06 to 6.07 GHz and resonance frequency is 4.3 GHz with monopole like radiation pattern and it is stable in the passband with 4.73 dB gain.

Network Virtualization is claimed to be a key component of the Future Internet, providing the dynamic support of different networks with different paradigms and mechanisms in the same physical infrastructure. A major challenge in the dynamic provision of virtual networks is the efficient embedding of virtual resources into physical ones. Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, previous research focused on designing heuristic-based algorithms; most of them either do not consider a simultaneous embedding of virtual nodes and virtual links, or apply link-path formulation, leading to non-optimal solutions. This paper proposes an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to solve the online virtual network embedding problem as a result of an objective function striving for the minimization of resource consumption and load balancing. To this end 3 different objective functions are proposed and evaluated. This approach applies multi-commodity flow constraint to accomplish a node-link formulation that optimizes the allocation of physical network resources. This proposal is evaluated against state of the art heuristics. The performance of the heuristics related to Virtual Network (VN) request acceptance ratio is, at least, 30% below the one of the Virtual Network Embedding Node-Link Formulation (VNE-NLF) method. From the three cost functions evaluated, the Weighted Shortest Distance Path (WSDP) is the one which embeds more VNs and also requires, on average, less physical resources per embedding.

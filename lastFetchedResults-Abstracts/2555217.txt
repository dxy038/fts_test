Pulse irrigation is consisted of an irrigation phase and a resting or nonoperative irrigation phase. Water intermittent use causes that advance front with less volume water over continuous irrigation is completed, which it effect on the pattern of soil moisture. Another important subject in trickle irrigation is water distribution in non operative irrigation that called redistribution. Amount of Redistribution is notable so it should have been considered in designing. The main objective of this present study is to evaluate pulsed and continuous redistribution of water in drip irrigation. For this purpose, both pulse and continuous surface drip irrigation by specified discharge (2.4 and 8 L/hr.) on three soil textures was tested in a physical model. The results showed that the vertical moisture redistribution in clay for less discharge (2.4 L/hr) is considerable and reached to 23 percent. The conclusion in continues showed horizontal redistribution in sandy for less discharge is 7 percent more than clay and this is 5 percent for pulse. Also for continues the vertical redistribution value in clay with q1 is about 6 percent and for pulse is about 4 percent more than clay.

The important phases of the engineering work that produced the new color transmitters are described. The subjects include intermediate frequency (IF) modulation, visual and aural exciter design, active group-delay compensation, power tube development, and solid-state control logic. They reflect the advanced technology employed in the transmitters. The resulting engineering work has one ultimate objective: unsurpassed color transmission.

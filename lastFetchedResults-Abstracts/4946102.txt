Summary Form only given, as follows. The author is studying the electron-impact dissociation of NF/sub 3/, CF/sub 4/, SF/sub 6/, BCl/sub 3/ and CCl/sub 2/F/sub 2/, which are among the most commonly employed reactive constituents of etchant gas plasmas. The objective is to determine absolute cross sections and appearance potentials for the formation of the various radiating, metastable, and neutral ground-state fragments that are produced by controlled electron-impact dissociation of these molecules. Experimental techniques include electron and optical emission spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy time-of-flight (TOF), and laser-induced fluorescence techniques. Results on molecular emissions in the near ultraviolet region of the optical spectrum are reported. These include the emission of the BCl A to X band system from BCl/sub 3/, the CCl A to X and CCl/sup +/ A to X band systems from CCl/sub 2/F/sub 2/, and continuous UV emissions following dissociative electron impact on SF/sub 6/ and NF/sub 3/.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

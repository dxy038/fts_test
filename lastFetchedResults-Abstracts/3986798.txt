We present a new method for the enhancement of speech. The method is designed for scenarios in which targeted speaker enrollment as well as system training within the typical noise environment are feasible. The proposed procedure is fundamentally different from most conventional and state-of-the-art denoising approaches. Instead of filtering a distorted signal we are resynthesizing a new &#8220;clean&#8221; signal based on its likely characteristics. These characteristics are estimated from the distorted signal. A successful implementation of the proposed method is presented. Experiments were performed in a scenario with roughly one hour of clean speech training data. Our results show that the proposed method compares very favorably to other state-of-the-art systems in both objective and subjective speech quality assessments. Potential applications for the proposed method include jet cockpit communication systems and offline methods for the restoration of audio recordings.

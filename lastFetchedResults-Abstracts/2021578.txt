 This research deals with the differences in the writings of male and female authors in the contemporary Persian novels, and employs Lakoff's (1975) linguistic approach to reach this objective. The main aim of this work is to make sure if the factor of gender may lead to differences in methods of writings between men and women in terms of vocabulary choices and syntactic variations. In this research, three novels Cheragh ha ra man khamush mikonam (I Turn off the Lights), Koliye Kenare Atash (Gypsy by the Fire), and Baziye Akhare Banu (The Final Game of the Lady) by three female authors, and the novels Kafe Piyano (Cafe Piano), Sanfoniye Mordegan (Symphony of the Dead), and Sorayya dar Eghma (Sorayya in Coma) from the male authors have been analyzed with respect to their vocabulary, and then the statistical analyses of these novels are presented. The results show differences in the writings of men and women in Persian novels.

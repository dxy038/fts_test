The objective of the CLAIR-DB (Cross Linked Advanced Integrated Research Database) project is to create one single, controlled research database for our department (Cardiology) from which all clinical research will be developed. The ProMISe system is used as the underlying database system. The approach: definition of a limited set of database tables; definition of common variables; all variables unambiguously defined (based on international standards and guidelines). All clinical data are automatically imported from our Cardiology Information System (EPD-Vision) into CLAIR-DB. Therefore, all clinical data are directly available from the source, there is no need for retyping data, data are always up-to-date. Research-specific data are entered directly in the CLAIR-DB web interface.

Non-wave shaping parallel bidirectional heuristic search algorithms have been reported to suffer of the bidirectional search anomaly. Although wave-shaping is considered as the most natural approach, parallel bidirectional wave-shaping algorithms are extremely scarce. We introduce a wave-shaping algorithm for parallel bidirectional heuristic search in distributed memory environments. The method is inspired by the celebrated uniprocessor bidirectional wave-shaping algorithm of DeChampeaux-Sint (1977). Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed method scales well, maintains good performance for increasing problem sizes, and attains close to linear speedup over the sequential DeChampeaux-Sint algorithm

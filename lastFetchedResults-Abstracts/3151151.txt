In the literature, team culture has been suggested as one of the factors contributing to the success of a project. In essence, a project manager should create a culture emphasizing teamwork, communication, and knowledge sharing. Such a culture will lead to team effectiveness, which will eventually contribute to the project success. A question arises whether or not this notion is relevant in practices, especially in a multiple-project management setting where one project manager leads multiple, simultaneous projects. To answer this question, the main objective of this study is to empirically explore the relevance of team culture in multiple project management. The result of this study reveals a surprising finding that team culture does not contribute to the success of a project in multiple-project management settings. Other factors provide more significant contribution to project success.

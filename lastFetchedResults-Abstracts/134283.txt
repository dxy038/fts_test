Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of group therapy with cognitive behavior approach for anger management on institution adolescents. Methods: The study was a controlled clinical trial on orphan children who lived at institutions of the Welfare Organization. The subjects were assessed prior to the intervention as well as one week after the eighth session of therapy using the Adolescents Anger Rating Scale (AARS). Of 40 subjects, 16 were placed in the case group and 24 were the controls. Cases and controls matched in regard with age, gender, education, and pre- intervention AARS scores. Results: In the' case groups anger management group therapy was associated with lower reactive anger (with' borderline significance) and insignificant lower overall anger score and instrumental anger. - The overall, instrumental, and reactive anger and anger management scores did not differ in cases and controls. In the case group, reactive anger was reduced significantly in girls as compared to boys. Conclusion: Most of the study variables showed improvement, although not statistically significant probably due to the small sample size. Since this study was the first of the kind, the researchers recommend that-the results can be used for future studies.

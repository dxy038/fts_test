The main objective here is an engineering optimization of the truss-type structures using the generalized perturbation-based Stochastic Finite Element Method. This procedure is based on triple reliability analysis consisting of the limit states for the admissible eigenfrequencies, horizontal displacements and the reduced stresses; it obeys an application of the stainless steel as well as the aluminum as the structural materials. Such a reliability-based optimization follows strictly engineering practice, demands of the Eurocodes, cost minimization of the structures and future installations of the new transmission equipment. The reliability analysis is based on the FORM approach, while computational realization of the generalized SFEM guarantees reliable determination of the first four probabilistic moments of the structural response for any random dispersion in the design parameters. Numerical implementation has hybrid character and is based on interoperability of the FEM design system ROBOT and the computer algebra system MAPLE, where all probabilistic functions are programmed.

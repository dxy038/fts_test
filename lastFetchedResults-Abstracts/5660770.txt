In any communication system, the emphasis is on estimating the channel response so as to retrieve the transmitted input signal accurately at the receiverÂ´s end. Channel Equalisation at the transmitter refers to pre-distorting the input signal so that the effect of the channel is nullified during transmission. This approach works out for slow fading channels where the channel response remains almost constant for a considerable amount of time (coherence time). Our prime objective in this work is to adapt a filter with impulse response (F) to the channel impulse response (H) at the transmitter end. By evaluating the inverse of the filter F and passing the symbols through a filter designed with frequency response F<sup>-1</sup>, we can equalise the distortions on the input due to channel.

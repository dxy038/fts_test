Distributed connected dominating tree (CDT) algorithm with multiple objective constraints is proposed for the construction of connected dominating set (CDS) in wireless sensor network. Many algorithms have been presented to guarantee connectivity and coverage of CDS. However, no previous research work considers energy consumption and transmission delays for CDS simultaneously. Based on an (alpha, beta)-tree concept, we define a new connected dominating tree with bounded transmission delay problem (CDTT) and design the connected dominating algorithm to construct a CDT-tree with limited total power while moderating the constraint that the transmission delays between the sink and the other nodes are also bounded. We also present the distributed the CDT algorithm with O(n<sup>2</sup>) time and message complexity. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the CDT algorithm gives an effective solution to the CDTT problem.

This research focuses on RFID-based 3-D positioning schemes, aiming to locate an object in a 3-dimensional space, with reference to a predetermined arbitrary coordinates system, by using RFID tags and readers. More specifically, we consider a hexahedron which may be a shipping container, a storage room, or other hexahedral shape spaces. A number of RFID tags and/or readers with known locations are deployed as reference nodes. We propose two positioning schemes, namely, the active scheme and the passive scheme. The former scheme locates an RFID reader. For example, it may be employed to locate a mobile person who is equipped with an RFID reader or an object that is approached by an RFID reader. The passive scheme locates an RFID tag, which is attached to the target object. Both approaches are based on a Nelder-Mead nonlinear optimization method that minimizes the error objective functions. We have carried out analyses and extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed schemes. Our results show that both schemes can locate the targets with acceptable accuracy. The active scheme usually results in smaller errors and has a lower hardware cost compared to its passive counterpart. On the other hand, the passive scheme is more efficient when locating multiple targets simultaneously. The effectiveness of our proposed approaches is verified experimentally using the IDENTEC RFID kits.

The objective of this paper is to present a voice activated roving robot with a stand-alone 8031 microcontroller system using two DC motors. In order to secure the robot, four types of sensors are interfaced. They are four compressive wire sensors, two current sensors, an ultrasonic sensor, and two temperature sensors. The compressive wire sensors detect touching obstacles, the ultrasonic sensor provides the robot the range information of long-distance objects, the current sensors are used to protect the motors from surge current, and the temperature transducers are used to detect overheating. A voice activated synthesizer is employed to translate verbal commands to control signals for the robot. The experiment results indicate that the robot works as we expected. This device could be used as a tool for education, or modified as a robotic mail cart system in an office building. Features of this system are flexibility, high reliability, and simplicity

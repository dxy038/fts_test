This paper describes the initial proposal of a cleaner technologies network in the state of Bahia, in the northeast section of Brazil. This network intends to bring together industry, universities, and government to discuss the relationship between production and the environment. Its main objective is to support a change in the way this relationship is nowadays perceived, in order to make preventive practices a priority and improve eco-efficiency. Implementation of the network was preceded by a diploma course on environmental technologies and management directed at professionals in the workforce. The results of the course are helping to create an atmosphere that is beneficial for the start-up of the network.

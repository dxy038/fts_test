The objective of this study was to determine the rolling moment for hemispherical nose cylinder configuration caused by the two asymmetric strips on the cylinder. The rolling moment for this configuration was initially predicted using Finite volume based CFD code. The study was carried out at different angles of attack and side slip angles to measure the rolling moment coefficient of the Configuration. For the validation of the problem, numerically predicted data was compared with low speed wind tunnel experimental data. A reasonable agreement was found between the numerically computed and experimentally determined results.

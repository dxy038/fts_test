We study the evolution of three identical, resistively coupled with ring connection, nonlinear and nonautonomous electric circuits from nonsynchronized oscillations to synchronized ones, when they exhibit chaotic behavior. Phase-locked states are also observed, as the coupling parameter is varied. The systemâ€™s dynamics depends on the way of coupling (unidirectional or bidirectional).

Bovine tuberculosis (TB) causes severe economic losses in livestock due to low production, animal deaths and condemnation of carcasses. It is also an important constraint in international trade of animals and animal products. A scientific committee in Great Britain in 1997 concluded that the development of a cattle vaccine would be the best option for long-term control of TB. However, vaccination of cattle currently is not accepted because the vaccine interferes with the skin reaction to the tuberculin test in the field. Efficacy of M. bovis BCG in protecting bovine and other animal species against tuberculous infection has received much study. Vaccination of cattle prevents the spread of the disease in populations by reducing the number and size of the lesions, and the load of bacteria (rather than by preventing infection). We review the literature about the efficacy of BCG in protecting cattle and other animal species against infection with field strains of M. bovis and discusses its potential use in programs of TB control in high-prevalence populations.

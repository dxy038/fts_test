Most of the current digital cameras feature a single sensor de sign which limits the number of channels recorded at each pixel location to one. However, a color image is represented with three channels for each pixel. Color Filter Array (CFA) interpolation is the process of generating a full three channel color image from a single channel mosaicked input. We pro pose a simple edge strength filter to interpolate the missing color values adaptively. While the filter is readily applicable to the Bayer mosaic pattern, we argue that the same idea could be extended to other mosaic patterns and describe its application to the Lukac mosaic pattern. The proposed solution outperforms other available algorithms for the Lukac pattern in terms of both objective and subjective comparison.

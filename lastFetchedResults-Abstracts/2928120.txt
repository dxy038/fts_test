This paper reports on work originally initiated as part of the SERC/DTI supported Recoup project (IED4/1/2152) whose objective was to enable the recovery of the abstract design, expressed using a mathematical notation, of a program from its representation as FORTRAN code. This process involves an intermediate stage, at which the code is re-engineered so as to remove the more pathological features commonly found in FORTRAN programs. It is to the achievement of this restructuring that the work at University of Westminster has been directed

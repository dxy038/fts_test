In this paper, we analyze the network survivability in CDMA networks considering that base stations may fail. A survivable network is modeled as mathematical optimization problem. The objective is to minimize the total blocking traffic. We apply Lagrangean relaxation as a solution approach and analyze results on call blocking rate, service rate, as well as CPU time. Experiments illustrate that the recovery of base stations is a key factor to reducing call blocking rate for the smaller base station number and for the system in the heavy loading. Time consumed for increasing the base station number is more significant than it for increasing the mobile user number.

The problem of achieving a prescribed bound on the induced L <sub>2</sub>-norm of the operator relating the exogenous disturbances with the objective signal is considered for linear time-varying systems with delayed measurements and a norm-bounded parameter uncertainty. A robust controller is derived which satisfies the required &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> level over the whole uncertainty range

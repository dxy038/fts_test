The objective of the present study was to estimate genetic trends for body weight traits at
different ages in Kermani lambs. Data collected from 1993 to 2006 by the Kermani Breeding
Station were analyzed. Genetic trends were estimated for birth weight (BW), weaning
weight (WW), 6-month weight (6MW), 9-month weight (9MW) and yearling weight (YW).
Maximum number of data was 2654 at birth, but only 1124 at yearling. Different appropriate
models for investigation of each trait using multivariate analysis were applied. Variance
component were estimated using Simplex procedure and breeding values of animals were
predicted with Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) methodology under multi-trait animal
models. Genetic trends of studied traits were estimated by regressing mean of breeding
values on birth year. Direct genetic trends were positive and significant for BW (p < 0.05)
WW, 6MW, 9MW and YW (p < 0.01) and were 2, 125, 91, 81 and 156 g/year, respectively.
Also, maternal trend for BW was positive and highly significant (p < 0.01) and was 3 g/year.

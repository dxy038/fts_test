As new challenges emerge in power distribution systems reliability and electrical workplace safety, it is the responsibility of the systems designer to seek out new approaches and solutions to address them. Stepping back and looking at the big picture, the systems designer has an onerous responsibility in specifying or selecting the best designs. Design decisions made today will impact cost, safety, and serviceability of the installed systems for 40 or 50 years during the useful life for the owner. Studies have shown that this cost is an order of magnitude of seven to ten times the installed cost of the power distribution equipment. The work by the project design team in this effort is considered a significant step forward in innovation in unit substation design. In the current environment of emerging codes and standards such as NFPA 70E focused on improved electrical workplace safety, the obvious first choice for any power systems designer is to design the hazard out. Industry must continue to focus on safety by design as the most effective approach in minimizing electrical hazards while improving system reliability. Developments such as those described in this article and efforts by a recently formed working group within the IEEE and discussed are considered driving forces in accomplishing this important objective.

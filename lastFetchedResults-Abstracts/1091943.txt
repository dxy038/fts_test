
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The evidence confirms the link between personality traits and psychosomatic diseases including irrational bowl syndrome. In recent years, a psychophysiological approach of personality has focused on behavioral activation system and behavioral inhibition system. The purpose of this study was to compare these behavioral systems between normal people and the patients with Irrational Bowl Syndrome.
METHODS: In a case-control study, 80 consecutive patients with established IBS referred to two gastroenterology clinics in city of Esfahan, Iran; and 80 healthy people matched regarding demographic variables were selected. They filled out brain/behavioral questionnaires of Carver and White. Then two groups were compared regarding brain/behavioral systems activities.
FINDINGS: The results of ANCOVA showed that the scores of behavioral inhibition system in patients (22.34±0.329) were significantly higher than normal people (20.98±0.329) (F=8.419, p=0.004). However, there was no significant difference between two groups in behavioral activation scores (F=0.234, p=0.63).
CONCLUSION: The finding support increased activity of inhibition system in patients with irritable bowel disease. It means increased sensitivity of IBS patients to punishment and threatening events. This condition may cause decreased pleasure experience and increased negative affects in IBS patients.

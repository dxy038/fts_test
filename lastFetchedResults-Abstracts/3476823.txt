A deductive design approach is proposed to develop an optimal feedback control, while preserving quantitative robustness and noise rejection properties. The design procedure involves the minimization of a suitably selected performance index to reflect a required model matching (following) objective. Gradient projection schemes, applied to the performance index and feasible constraints, are used to accomplish the design tradeoff. A mechanical manipulator control system example is employed as a vehicle to illustrate the overall design selection and optimization. Uncertainty of the system description is included as a feature of the example.

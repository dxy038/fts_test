Background. The “elephant trunk” technique, using a free-floating vascular prosthesis, was originally described to facilitate a subsequent operation on the downstream aorta. We developed an additional refinement of this technique, called the “bidirectional elephant trunk.” This option may represent an interesting tool in more complex aortic operations, especially when the descending aorta has to be replaced first in patients with concomitant pathology of the ascending aorta or of the aortic arch.

Methods. The initial operation is performed through a left thoracotomy. The proximal elephant trunk is created by invaginating the future aortic arch graft into the descending aortic graft. The proximal anastomosis between the doubled graft and the proximal descending aorta is performed first. During construction of the distal anastomosis, a distal elephant trunk may be inserted likewise. If the aortic arch and ascending aorta have to be replaced later, this second step is performed through a median sternotomy. The free-floating arch graft is pulled out of the proximal descending aorta with a nerve hook, unfolded, and used for total arch replacement.

Results. This technique was used successfully in 3 patients without mortality. No major complications were observed excepted persistent hoarseness in a patient with preoperative paresis of the recurrent nerve. No perfusion problems due to the unfolding of the free-floating graft occured during the second operation.

Conclusions. The bidirectional elephant trunk technique is an interesting option that may be suitable for patients presenting with a complex pathology of the whole thoracic aorta when the descending segment has to be replaced first.

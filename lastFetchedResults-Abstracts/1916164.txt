BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Thalassemia determined by reducing alpha or beta globin chains is the most common genetic disorder of hemoglobin synthesis. The main symptoms of the disease include bone deformities especially in the skull, maxilla and zygoma, dental caries and periodontal disease. Given the higher prevalence of oral-dental complications in these patients, the complications of thalassemia patients can be prevented or treated by early diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between gingivitis and periodontitis with B-thalassemia disease.
METHODS: In this case-control study, 50 of 15-35-year-old patients with major thalassemia referred to thalassemia center of Amirkola and 50 healthy individuals as a control group were examined. The questionnaires included general information (such as gender, age, etc.) and clinical examination  information such as gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PPD) and attachment loss (AL) and the oral hygeine index-simplified (OHI-S) were completed by them.
FINDINGS: The mean age of the patients and healthy persons was 23/92±5/591 and 23/98±6/554, respectively. Average of Indexed Hygeine was 2/18±0/77 and 2/1±0/81 in patient group and control group, respectively and there was no significant difference (p=0/635). Average of GI in patient group was significantly more than in control group (1/28±0/73, 0/94±0/59, respectively and p=0/014). Pocket depth for patient and the control groups were 0/4±0/53 and 0/12±0/33, respectively. In addition, the average of attachment loss in patients was 0/4±0/53 and in the control group was 0/08 ± 0/27 (p=0/003 and p < 0/001, respectively)
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the gingival and periodontal diseases in thalassemia patients were significantly higher than in control group. Therefore, the prevention and early treatment of thalassemia complications and problems were performed by continuous track and periodic monitoring.

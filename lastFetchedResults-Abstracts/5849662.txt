The objective of this article is to propose a new method for moving objects detection in a video based on the background subtraction approach. Background subtraction is, in general, a challenging moving object detection problem. Resolve this problem is very important for many applications: statistical analysis of attendance, access securing, monitoring epileptic patients in hospitals, and so on. In this paper, we propose a method to detect the changing regions of an image sequence using the background subtraction approach. This approach is based on the estimation of similarity between the values that a pixel assumes in two consecutive frames using the radiometric similarity with a dynamic threshold.

The objective of this study is to make clear the effect of neutron irradiation on mechanical properties of laser weldments using irradiated material. This estimation is necessary for the application to joining coolant piping of the ITER blanket. Irradiation testing was performed at Japan Material Testing Reactor (JMTR). On the irradiation condition for weldments using irradiated material, fast neutron fluence was 1.4 × 1024 n/m2, which corresponds to a displacement damage rate of 0.26 displacement per atom (dpa) and irradiation temperature 200 °C. The results of this study show that tensile properties of all weldments changed into that of base material by the effect of neutron irradiation. The results of hardness tests show that irradiation hardening at an irradiation damage dose of 0.3 dpa is almost same as that at irradiation damage 0.6 dpa. It is concluded that irradiated weldments using irradiated material were moved toward irradiated base material on tensile and hardness properties up to 0.6 dpa. On the other hand, tensile properties of base material were changed by the effect of neutron irradiation up to about 0.3 dpa, and with much less change from 0.3 dpa to 0.6 dpa. It is inferred that the effect of neutron irradiation of SS316LN-IG almost saturated up to 0.3 dpa.

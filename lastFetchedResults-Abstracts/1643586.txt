Objective: The main aim of the described research programme focused on self-compacting concrete (SCC) modified by steel and polymer fibre was to denominate the maximum dosage of fibre composition allowing to achieve self-compacting effect.

: The tests were conducted according to an orthogonal design of experiment. There were used different types of commercially available and widely used types of steel and polymer fibre to modify the fresh mix. The volumes of added fibre ranged from 0% to 1.5% in case of steel fibre and from 0% to 0.9% in case of polymer fibre. A slump-flow test and an L-box test were used to assess the consistency of the fresh mix. The tested properties of fresh mix included the self-compacting effect.

s: The maximum possible dosage of fibre composition and optimum dosage of fibre composition were defined. The L-box test gave valuable information about filling and passing ability of SCC mixes modified by fibre compositions, and to a lesser extent their segregation resistance.

Objective: The present. study designed to indistigated the antimutagenic activity of different lactobacilli isolated from yogurt.
Materials and Method: Samples of 14 commercial yogurts were hernogenized with Ringer solution and cultured on the surface of MRS agar.hhe antimutagenic activities of several lactobacilli isolated from yogurt against the potent mutagen, 2-nitrotluorene and examined by the modified Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA100.
Results:The results showed that the supernatants, heat killed cells and. viable cells of L. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus preincubated with mutagenic factors such as 2-nitroflorene displayed characteristic antimutagenic activities. L. bulgaricus and L. acidphilus cells showed 98% and 64% antimutagenic activities against 2-nitroflourene respectively. Antimutagenic activities of viable cells of Lactobacilli were higher than heat treated cells and supernatants.
Conclusion: Further studies will give us more in depth knowledge concerning the total deactivating capacities of these important and beneficial bacteria.

In this paper, a modified model predictive control method has been proposed for voltage control of an inverter in an islanded microgrid. The main objective of this method is to reduce voltage THD and the reference tracking error. In the proposed scheme, some vectors are added to existing vectors, available in FCS-MPC method to reduce the error between the reference voltage and the output voltage. In this control scheme, the model of the system is used to predict the behavior of the output voltage. Then based on a quadratic cost function, the predictions are evaluated to select the optimized control signal which should be applied to the system in the next sampling interval. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated using MATLAB/Simulink environment.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight approach for online detection of faulty measurements by analyzing the data collected from medical wireless body area networks. The proposed framework performs sequential data analysis using a smart phone as a base station, and takes into account the constrained resources of the smart phone, such as processing power and storage capacity. The main objective is to raise alarms only when patients enter in an emergency situation, and to discard false alarms triggered by faulty measurements or ill-behaved sensors. The proposed approach is based on the Haar wavelet decomposition, nonseasonal Holt-Winters forecasting, and the Hampel filter for spatial analysis, and on for temporal analysis. Our objective is to reduce false alarms resulting from unreliable measurements and to reduce unnecessary healthcare intervention. We apply our proposed approach on real physiological dataset. Our experimental results prove the effectiveness of our approach in achieving good detection accuracy with a low false alarm rate. The simplicity and the processing speed of our proposed framework make it useful and efficient for real time diagnosis.

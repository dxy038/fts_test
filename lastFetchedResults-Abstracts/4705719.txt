As the hazard of the raw materials and products, the complexity of the production process, the seriousness of the accident consequences in chemical enterprises, the reasonable and objective safety evaluation is particularly necessary on the production conditions of chemical enterprises. First, the evaluation hierarchy model is constructed by analyzing the key factors influencing safety production. Then, the index weight of all levels is determined by using the analytic hierarchy process methodology. The multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is proposed. Finally an application of the method in an ethylene project verifies its feasibility and rationality.

Data preparation is an important part of the mining process. This paper describes MIDAS, an agent framework for intelligent data processing. The objective framework is to provide end users automated data processing services such as subsetting and data format translation by coupling Earth science markup language (ESML) interchange technology and ontologies. These ontology driven agents guide the user through the process of data processing and are able to make decisions for them based on their output requirements. This paper describes the design approach used to extend the ESML schema to incorporate semantics using ontologies. It explains the overall architecture including the infrastructure layer, organization and the agent design used in this framework. The subset of performatives derived from the knowledge query and manipulation language (KQML) used by the agents to interact will also be described

In the present work, a component-based optimization and a system-based optimization design are carried out based on the main heat exchanger which works as a component of a regenerative Brayton cycle system. In the component-based optimization, the revised entropy generation number of main heat exchanger is taken as the objective function. The heat exchanger effectiveness increases as revised entropy generation number grows, but the net output work of the system does not change monotonously. The system-based optimization which takes the net work output as the objective function, sometimes weakens the performance of heat exchanger as an individual, but improves the performance of the Brayton cycle system significantly. The system-based optimization has more advantages over the component-based optimization in the coordination and cooperation of main heat exchanger with other parts in a whole system.

The objective of this research was to investigate the fatigue strength of Ti–6Al–4V using an ultrasonic fatigue system. Fatigue testing up to 109 cycles under fully reversed loading was performed to determine the ultra-high cycle fatigue behavior of Ti–6Al–4V. Endurance limit results were compared to similar data generated on conventional servohydraulic test systems and electromagnetic shaker systems to determine if there are any frequency effects. Fatigue specimens were tested with and without cooling air to determine the effects of increased specimen temperature caused by internal damping due to cycling at a very high frequency. An infrared camera was also used to record specimen temperatures at various load levels. Results indicate that the effects of frequency, including internal heating, on the very high cycle fatigue behavior of Ti–6Al–4V are negligible under fully reversed loading conditions.

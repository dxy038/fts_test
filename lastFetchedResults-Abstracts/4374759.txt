This paper presents Android-based SoD (System on-Demand) client for remote presentation in virtual desktop environment. SoD is framework for on-demand computing in virtual computing environment. SoD enables to build cooperative device collaboration by orchestrating virtualized peripheral resources such as monitors, keyboarders, mice and so on. The objective of this paper is providing an Android-based phone with SoD client function, especially, remote presentation including functions of a mouse, a keyboard and a monitor. Implemented SoD client is tested on virtual desktop environment consisting of a Xen hypervisor, Windows-based guest virtual machines. The challenge point of this paper is separating and virtualizing traditional peripherals of desktop. After this, we can redirect each virtualized I/O to any SoD client device on demand.

A new prototype parabolic-trough collector system was erected at the Plataforma Solar de Almer ıa (PSA) (1996–
1998) to investigate direct steam generation (DSG) in a solar thermal power plant under real solar conditions. The
system has been under evaluation for efficiency, cost, control and other parameters since 1999. The main objective of
the control system is to obtain steam at constant temperature and pressure at the solar field outlet, so that changes in
inlet water conditions and/or in solar radiation affect the amount of steam, but not its quality or the nominal plant
efficiency. This paper presents control schemes designed and tested for two operating modes, ‘‘Recirculation’’, for which
a proportional-integral-derivative (PI/PID) control functions scheme has been implemented, and ‘‘Once-through’’,
requiring more complex control strategies, for which the scheme is based on proportional-integral (PI), feedforward and
cascade control. Experimental results of both operation modes are discussed.

The objective of the study was to further develop a novel cleaning technique for reverse osmosis in reclamation of municipal secondary effluent. This technique is a new backwash method via direct osmosis (DO) by intermittent injection of the high salinity (HS) solution without stopping of high pressure pump and it is environment and membrane friendly technique. In the study, DO-HS trials were carried out with a UF-RO pilot system which was operated on site with the secondary treated effluent as the raw feed. Different operating conditions for DO-HS treatment in the actual process were investigated. It was found that the operation for implementation of the DO-HS cleaning technique developed was easy. For the first time, the actual profiles of HS concentration, DO backwash flow rate, brine flow rate and permeate pressure during DO-HS treatment have been demonstrated. It was observed that turbidity of the brine stream during DO-HS treatment at 3 NTU was 5 times higher than that before DO-HS treatment. The results from this study have confirmed the previous hypothesis with DO-HS treatment that there would be a strong driving force for DO backwash to lift and sweep the foulants from the membrane surface which would be carried over to the brine. The optimal plant operating conditions in terms of RO feed flow rate, HS concentration and HS injection time are ready for the DO-HS method to be adopted and validated in a long-term continuous plant operation.

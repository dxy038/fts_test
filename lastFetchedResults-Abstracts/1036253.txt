This paper reports the development of an epoxy-based nanocomposite toughened by the combination of thermoplastic, layered and particulate nano-fillers. The main objective of this work is to incorporate poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene-co-styrene) (ABS), clay (layered nano-filler) and nano-TiO2 (particulate nano-filler) into epoxy matrix with the aim of obtaining the quaternary nanocomposite with higher impact strength and lower cost without attenuating the other desired mechanical properties such as tensile strength. Taguchi methodology was applied for the optimization and statistical determination of the significant factors influencing the mechanical properties of the quaternary nanocomposite. Impact and tensile strengths of the quaternary nanocomposite with optimum composition increased by 168% and 64% compared to neat epoxy, respectively. Furthermore, synergistic effect was observed with the addition of three type modifiers. It was found that ABS content has the most significant effect on mechanical properties of the obtained quaternary nanocomposite. Also correlation between morphological and mechanical properties of the nanocomposite was investigated. A dispersion of nano-size ABS and TiO2 particles along with exfoliated clay nano-platelets in epoxy matrix was achieved as main morphological property of the quaternary nanocomposite. A new morphology was obtained for ABS phase in epoxy rich matrix.

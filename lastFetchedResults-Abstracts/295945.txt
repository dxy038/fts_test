This study's objective was to identify variables that affect the mortality of elderly burn patients and to assess their changes over time. A retrospective review was conducted on all patients 75 or older (n = 201) admitted to a university-based burn center between 1972 and 2000. Variables examined were age, sex, TBSA, ABSI, inhalation injury, timing from burn to operative intervention, the number of surgical procedures, the number of pre-morbid conditions, and mortality. There were 95 fatalities. TBSA strongly correlated with mortality (p < 0.0001). Adjusting for TBSA and inhalation injury, mortality significantly decreased (p = 0.04, odds ratio = 0.58). Mortality significantly increased with inhalation injury (p < 0.01). Fatality risk increased by 400% with inhalation injury. Absence of inhalation injury was not significant with respect to mortality in the 1970s, however there was a significant decrease (p = 0.02) in mortality without an inhalation injury in the 1980s and 1990s. ABSI was strongly predictive of mortality (p < 0.0001). On average there was a 200% increase in mortality per unit increase of ABSI. The elderly are 58% less likely to die from burns now as compared to the 1970s. Although mortality rose with increasing TBSA equally in each decade, the absolute risk of mortality decreased over time. This data suggests major strides have been made in burn care, however similar success has not been achieved with inhalation injuries.

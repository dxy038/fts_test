In this paper, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is studied by applying it to two complex multi-objective electromagnetic problems: a 16-element array antenna synthesized for a tradeoff between the beam efficiency and the half-power beam width, and a single shaped reflector antenna optimized for higher gains of multiple feeds. In both cases, the Pareto fronts are successfully detected by the algorithm. It is concluded that the MOPSO is another powerful optimizing tool for electromagnetics designers

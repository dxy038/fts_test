Objective
We report the case of a 42-y-old morbidly obese woman who presented persistent anemia as result of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
Methods

The surgical procedure conducted in 1999 consisted of horizontal gastroplasty with truncular vagotomy, Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal anastomosis with an alimentary limb of 60 cm, and cholecystectomy. In 2000 a second surgery (subtotal gastrectomy, i.e., 90%, with a 50-mL gastric pouch) was performed because of failed gastroplasty. Anemia was detected approximately 1 y after the second surgery. This condition worsened significantly after an abdominal lipectomy performed in 2001. Since then, different oral iron compounds were used for treatment, but with unsatisfactory results. The subject was anemic for 4 y.
Results

The condition was corrected only after intravenous iron administration. Iron absorptions from 3 mg of iron as ferrous ascorbate and from a standardized diet that also contained 3 mg of iron were 48.4% and 39.9%, respectively.
Conclusion

Iron absorption tests provided evidence that the reduction of intestinal iron absorption capacity was the most probable cause of the persistent anemia.

Objective. To assess the socioeconomic-demographic, environmental health and hygiene conditions associated with intestinal parasites and diarrhoea in Nuseirat Refugee Camp of Gaza Strip.

s. A cross-section of 1625 households were surveyed. A stratified sample was used and drawn from the eight Blocks. Face-to-face Interviews were administered for data collection. Piloted and validated questionnaires along with specific checklists were used as instruments.

s. A total of 485 women interviewed (29.8%) reported intestinal parasites among their household members; 223 (13.7%) admitted cases of diarrhoea. The highest prevalence of intestinal parasites (24.1%) was found among children aged 1â€“4 years; the highest prevalence of diarrhoea (10.6%) was found among children younger than 1 year. Intestinal parasites were strongly associated with crowding, source of drinking water and the cleaning of water tanks, and were significantly higher among families with unclean homes. Diarrhoea was strongly associated with source of drinking water, a full-day water supply and cleaning of water tanks, and was significantly higher among families with a presence of mosquitoes and garbage around their homes.

sions. Poor socioeconomic-demographic, environmental health and hygiene conditions play a major role in the occurrence of intestinal parasites and diarrhoea. Children younger than 5 years are at high risk. Real interventions, such as health education, environmental awareness, community involvement and raising funds for infrastructural development are urgently needed.

An integration and operation of single phase bidirectional inverter with two buck/boost maximum power point trackers (MMPTs) is provided for dc distribution system. In a dc distribution system a bidirectional inverter is required to control the power flow between dc bus and ac grid, and to regulate the dc bus to the certain range of voltage. A droop regulation mechanism is followed to reduce the capacitor size and to balance the power flow between the dc bus and ac grid. The photovoltaic (PV) array voltage can be vary from 0 to 600V, especially with thin-film PV panels, the MPPT topology is formed with buck and boost converters to operate at the dc-bus voltage around 380V, reducing the voltage stress of its followed inverter. In this paper the fuzzy logic technique is used to control the bidirectional inverter for improve overall efficiency of the system and it is designed by using MATLAB/SIMULINK software.

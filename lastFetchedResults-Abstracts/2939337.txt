The objective of atmospheric correction is to retrieve the surface reflectance from remotely sensed imagery by removing the atmospheric effects. We introduce an efficient algorithm to estimate the optical characteristics of the TM imagery and to remove the atmospheric effects from it. Our algorithm introduces a set of techniques to significantly improve the quality of the retrieved images. We pay a particular attention to the computational efficiency of the algorithm thereby allowing us to correct large TM images quite fast. We also provide a parallel implementation of our algorithm and show its portability and scalability on several parallel machines

A new structure of metal/i-SiC/c-Si(n<sup>+</sup>-P) (MISS) bidirectional switching device is successfully developed for the first time. A thick sputtered SiC layer is used, instead of the thin insulating layer in the conventional MISS structure. Due to the wide band gap of the silicon carbide (2.3 eV for &#946;-SiC), this bidirectional switching device possesses a high switching voltage, e.g. 134 V for the 3000 &#197; silicon carbide thickness. The corresponding switching currents and holding current are 0.16 mA and 1.1 mA, respectively. Experimental results show the switching voltage V<sub>s </sub> increases with increasing intrinsic silicon carbide thickness. This study indicates that the silicon carbide bidirectional switching device is a promising element for high-voltage switching applications

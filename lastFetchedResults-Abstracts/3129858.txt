This paper summarily introduces principles of basic ant colony algorithm and explains the mathematical model of basic ant algorithm through the traveling salesman problem, and then the applications of the ant colony algorithm in discrete job-shop scheduling are expounded , and the mathematical model of discrete job-shop scheduling are mainly established through the method of the formation of one-to-one relationship by the path of utilizing the way which ants traverse the processes of the workpieces and discrete job-shop scheduling. So the objective function of the scheduling is optimized and the efficiency of the scheduling is improved. Lastly, the prospects of applying the ant colony algorithm to the discrete job-shop scheduling and future work for this problem are discussed.

Given the religious commonalities between the Ottoman government and some Iranian Kurds – both were Shafi’I Sunnis – religion was always an excuse for the Ottoman government to attract the support of the Kurds. In fact, religious differences were the most important weapon of the Ottomans to undermine cordial relations of this community with the Shia government of Iran. The main objective of the present study is to study the PanIslamist policies of Abdul Hamid II (18761909) and their impacts on the relations of the Kurds with the Ottoman government. The findings of the result indicate that the Ottoman Sultan, through making instrumental use of PanIslamist policy and his attempts to promote it among the Kurds, tried to attract their participation in the suppression of the Armenian autonomous movement on the one hand and pitting them against the Shia government of Iran on the other. By organizing the Hamidiyeh Division among the Kurds and coating it with religion, Abdul Hamid II tried to achieve his goals. However, the Friendship Treaty between Sherif Pasha and representative of the Armenians on the one hand and the love and sense of belongingness of the Kurds to their ancestral motherland on the other hand, defeated Abdul Hamid II’s policies. The present research is a documental study.

Design of a robust controller via single objective constrained optimization using differential evolution (DE) is
presented in this paper. A set robust feedback controller gain is optimized based on plantâ€™s linear model having
structured parametric uncertainty such that the closed-loop system would have the maximum stability radius. A wedge
region is assigned as the optimization constraint to specify the desired closed-loop poles location which is directly
related to the desired time-domain response. The proposed controller design is applied to a two-mass system which is
known as the benchmark problem for robust controller design. The simulation results show that the robustness
performance is achieved in the presence of parameter variations of the plant. The proposed controller performs than
the conventional LQR (linear quadratic regulator) controller.

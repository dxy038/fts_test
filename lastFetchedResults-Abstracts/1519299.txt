Objective (s): Due to the urgent nature of emergency situations and the need for timely access to the required information for providing services outside of health care institutions, pre-hospital emergency information system was developed to meet information needs and support the delivery of emergency services. Given the similarity of pre-hospital emergency information system in other countries to one of the America and England’s systems, the current study aimed to compare the pre-hospital emergency information system in America and England to identify the structural and operational features.  
Methods: A literature search was carried out using Science Direct, Scirus and PubMed database. The search strategy included keywords on EMS, Pre-hospital Emergency Services, Ambulance Services, Information System, and Information. The retrieved articles were then assessed for relevance and then were examined. 
Results: In all 172 articles were identified. Of these 65 articles were found relevant. Minimum dataset of pre-hospital emergency information system included 51 elements in America and 28 elements in England. More comprehensive and analytical reports were being created in the America’s pre-hospital emergency care than those of in England. In addition, information management and communication systems were mainly electronic-based in America compared to England. In terms of people, software and hardware equipments involved in the management of information both systems were similar.
Conclusion: The effectiveness of pre-hospital emergency information system depends on the capabilities of the system, as well as its interoperability with other information systems. The pre-hospital emergency information system benefited from more capabilities in America compared to those in England, and this might be due to more robust information and communication technology infrastructures in America.

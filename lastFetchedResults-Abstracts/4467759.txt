The objective of this study was to determine the effect of stimulus pulsewidth (PW) on selective activation of peripheral nerve fibers. Computer simulations using a cable model of a mammalian myelinated nerve fiber indicated that shorter PWs increased the difference between the threshold currents of fibers lying at different distances from an electrode. Experiments conducted in a cat model revealed that shorter PWs generated larger torques before spillover, and created a larger range of currents over which the torque was a monotonically increasing function of the stimulus current amplitude. Thus, shorter PWs allowed more spatially selective stimulation of nerve fibers

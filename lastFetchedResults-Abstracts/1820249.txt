Objective
ng evidence indicates that boron (B) plays a role in bone formation and maintenance. Thus, a study was performed to determine whether dietary B-deficiency affects periodontal alveolar bone modelling and remodelling.

ng Swiss mice (n = 30) were divided into three groups: control diet (GI, 3 mg B/kg); B-deficient diet (GII, 0.07 mg B/kg); and pair-fed with GII (GIII). The animals were maintained on their respective diets for 9 weeks and then sacrificed. The guidelines of the NIH for the care and use of laboratory animals were observed. The mandibles were resected, fixed, decalcified in 10% EDTA and embedded in paraffin. Buccolingually oriented sections were obtained at the level of the mesial root of the first lower molar and stained with Hâ€“E. Histomorphometric studies were performed separately on the buccal and lingual sides of the periodontal alveolar bone. Percentages of osteoblast surfaces (ObSs), eroded surfaces (ESs), and quiescent surfaces (QSs) were determined.
s
tistically significant differences in food intake and body weight were observed between the groups. When compared with GI and GIII mice, GII mice (B-deficient) had 63% and 48% reductions in ObS and 58% and 73% increases in QS in buccal and lingual plates, respectively. ES were not affected by B nutriture.
sion
sults are evidence that dietary boron deprivation in mice alters periodontal alveolar bone modelling and remodelling by inhibiting bone formation.

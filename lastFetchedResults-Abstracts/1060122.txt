With the objective of experimentally correlating several wear-process parameters, accurately and continuously over the duration of a sliding test, this paper presents a novel test rig as well as experimental results obtained by it. The developed test rig is a rotational one with axes supported on aerostatic bearings. It enables online measurement of normal load, friction force, angular position and normal displacement with high accuracy. These measurements are supplemented by ante- and postmortem optical and tactile inspection of the wear samples to determine their geometrical evolution. A set of ball-on-disc experiments is performed, with ball materials being nylon, steel and ceramic, on hard steel disc material. The performed experiments correlate three process variables and parameters: normal load, wear volume and dissipated energy. The basic trends observed show that the relationship between those three variable are quasi linear, but generally with nonzero intercepts, corresponding to energy thresholds; except that of wear of alumina on steel.

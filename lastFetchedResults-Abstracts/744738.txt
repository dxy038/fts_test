Introduction & Objective: The consumption of chemical compounds and medicinal herbs are different ways to control pain. On the other hand, the complications of chemical drugs and their expensiveness cause people to use herbal medicines The aim of this study was to inves-tigate the antinociceptive effect of hydroalcoholic leaf extract of Hedera helix in male rats.
Materials & Methods: In this experimental study, 36 adult male rats were divided into 6 groups: control, morphine (1mg/kg), Hedera helix extract (100, 200, 300mg/kg, i.p.) and naloxone (1mg/kg) with Hedera helix extract (200 mg/kg). The analgesic effects of Hedera helix ex-tract were assessed with writhing and tail flick tests.
Results: The results of this study showed that doses of 200 and 300mg/kg of Hedera helix ex-tract decreased pain significantly. However, dose of 300mg/kg of Hedera helix extract showed more antinociceptive effect of Hedera helix extract. The naloxone and Hedera helix extract combination increased the number of writhing compared with the Hedera helix ex-tract group.
Conclusion: In this study analgesic effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of Hedera helix was observed. The antinociceptive effect of extract was probably occurred by activation of opioid system.

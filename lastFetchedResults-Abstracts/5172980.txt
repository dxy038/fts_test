The Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) problem with multiple, conflicting objectives was hardly resolved by tradition individual disciplinary optimization design method. It is combined the MDO method with multi-objective optimization method to formulate the integration of multi-objective MDO method. This integration method could handle hierarchically optimization problems meanwhile trade off multiple objectives in the problems, based on optimization concurrently to attain consistence design. Through a mathematical example, it is verified that this method is acceptably and efficiently.

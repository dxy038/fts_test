This paper presents an efficient SVD based image Steganography approach. This approach aims at increasing the fidelity of the images after data embedding. Rather than embedding data in the singular values of the images, the image Left singular vectors are used for this purpose. The objective of this approach is to reduce the embedding errors as well as to maintain the image fidelity. Several solutions to the image fidelity problem are presented in the paper. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed Steganography approach to the existing approaches.

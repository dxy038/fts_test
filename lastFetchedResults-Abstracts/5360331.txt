A design automation system, called SAWCOM, has been developed for the noninteractive design and analysis of SAW (surface acoustic wave) filters using bidirectional transducers. Such a system increases productivity by reducing filter design time while increasing design accuracy. The SAWCOM system takes as input a high-level performance specification of the SAW filter to be designed, as well as parameters pertaining to substrate availability and fabrication capabilities, and then begins a synthesis-analysis-verification cycle which continues until all design alternatives that meet the specifications are found, within the constraints of the SAWCOM system. To determine the filterÂ´s design parameters, the system uses a set of design rules implemented in the PROLOG language

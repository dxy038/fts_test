This paper reports on the results achieved in an experimental test conducted with the Selex ES RAT (Radar Avvistamento Terrestre) 31DL long range radar in December 2014 - January 2015. The objective of the test was to determine the capability of the radar of detecting and tracking Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites with an external cue command derived by the NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) Two Line Elements (TLE). The test has been prepared and conducted together with the Italian Air Force (ITAF) in the framework of the Italian support to European Space Situational Awareness (SSA) program and in particular for the development of a dual-use function for the detection and tracking of space or orbital debris. In fact, the previous experimental activities that the ITAF had conducted with the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI) and the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) lead the Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri to appoint ITAF as the national representative for the &#8220;Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) Framework Programme&#8221;. Because of the partnership between ITAF and Selex ES, the RAT 31DL system selected for the aforementioned activity is the one installed at Borgo Sabotino, an ITAF site.

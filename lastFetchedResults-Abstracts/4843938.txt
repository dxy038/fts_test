A very concise comparison technique for objective image quality assessment is described. The method is based on a angular edge coeherence measure defined by local image expansion into a set of harmonic angular functions. Using the angular edge coherence it is possible to estimate the relative quality of a reproduced image with respect to the original one comparing only the values of a single statistical index disjointly extracted from each image. The present contribution briefly illustrates the mathematical support of this technique and provides some significant experimental examples.

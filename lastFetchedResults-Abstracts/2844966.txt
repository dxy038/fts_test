Schizophrenia, autism, or social phobia are typically accompanied by social interaction deficits. The objective of the AlterEgo European project is the creation of an interactive cognitive architecture, implementable in various artificial agents, allowing a continuous interaction with patients suffering from social disorders by virtue of changes in behavioral (robot-based) as well as morphological (avatar-based) properties of that agent. Here we present the scientific foundations of the project and its four main experimental steps. The results of the first similarity experiments are reported, which show that healthy participants functionally adapt their social motor interaction when they interact with agents (real or artificial) morphologically and behaviorally similar to, or different from, them. These results obtained with healthy participants have consequences for the rehabilitation of socially deficient patients.

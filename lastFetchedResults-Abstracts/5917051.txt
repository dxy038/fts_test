An imaging scheme to generate B-scan ultrasound images using frequency modulated (FM) pulses, is utilized. A prototype experimental setup is used to perform single imaging tasks in attenuating and nonattenuating medium. The post processing of the acquired data was carried out digitally. The objective is to study the two-dimensional point spread function as a function of the FM pulse parameters

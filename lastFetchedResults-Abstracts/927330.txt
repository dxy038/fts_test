Objective: Local bone augmentation in the posterior maxilla (sinus lift) before the placement of dental implants has become an acceptable treatment technique in implant dentistry. However, limited documented data are available on the results of this technique and relevant issues in Iran. The present study aimed at evaluating the surgical outcome of sinus lift and implant placement in warfare victims presenting to Ghazi Tabatabai Clinic during 2001-2008.
Methods: In this retrospective study, 50 patients that had undergone sinus lift surgery were evaluated. All warfare victims presenting to the clinic who had a medical record and undergone sinus lift treatment were enrolled.  Those with incomplete medical files were excluded from the study. The required data were extracted from patients’ medical records and entered into a questionnaire. The mean duration of follow up was 53.32±23.05 months. The surgical success criterion was presence of osseointegrated implants in the oral cavity during the follow up period. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test and Fisher’s exact test.
Results: failed out of which 5 were in the sinus-lift area. Thus, the total success rate, the success rate of implants placed in the sinus lift area and the success rate of those out of the sinus lift area were 96.6%, 93.9% and 98%, respectively. 
Conclusion: The study results demonstrated high success rates for implants placed in sinus lift and non-sinus lift areas in warfare victims.

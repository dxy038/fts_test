A dual-wavelength spaceborne weather radar is expected to be one of the primary instruments on the proposed Global Precipitation Mission, GPM, satellite. In addition, airborne dual-wavelength weather radar data at (13.6, 35 GHz), (10, 35 GHz), (10, 94 GHz) have been or will be acquired within the next several years. The objective of the paper is to outline some of the techniques for analyzing such data with a focus on an approach that uses integral equations that describe the change in the DSD parameters with radar range.

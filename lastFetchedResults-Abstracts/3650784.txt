The introduction of 0201 components is another step taken in the world of electronics to aid the miniaturization of electronic products. Capacitors and resistors are now being produced in a 0201 package size; in dimensions, it means a length of 0.02 in and a width of 0.01 in. The assembly of miniature components on printed circuit boards (PCBs) poses numerous process challenges. Legislative measures to eliminate the usage of lead from electronics products compel electronics manufacturers to implement lead-free assembly. This mandates the use of lead-free 0201 components and a lead-free soldering process. The current research focuses on high-density lead-free memory module assemblies using a 1.27-mm-thick organic solderability preservative (OSP)-coated boards. The spacing between components is as low as 0.25 mm. The objective of this research is to develop a robust assembly process for lead-free 0201 components used in memory modules. The stencil, PCB land pattern designs, solder paste printing, component placement, and reflow soldering processes were studied. The process and design changes required for achieving a robust manufacturing process for assembling lead-free 0201 components on high-density assemblies have been identified and reported.

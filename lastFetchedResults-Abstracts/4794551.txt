Frequency allocation is defined as the problem of assigning a set of compatible channels to each cell in a cellular network in an efficient manner. So an efficient frequency assignment is very important in cellular mobile network planning because it gives an efficient use of the available spectrum. The problem is closely related to computation of maximal independent set of graph and graph coloring with the objective function to minimize the total number of colors used. The paper presents an experimental analysis of simple distributed algorithm for optimized vertex coloring problem. It considers coloring of a cellular graph in a distributed setting, where each vertex in the graph is represented by an independent agent.

The authors report the experimental demonstration of a new passive optical subscriber loop architecture employing 20 channel WDM with 2 nm channel spacings. The experiment includes the demonstration of LED transmission in a dense, multi-wavelength single-mode fibre network. The experiment also features simultaneous, bidirectional transmission with both LEDs (384 kb/s) and DFB lasers (up to 1.2 Gb/s)

Technology enhancement makes the computing available everywhere and provides access to widely distributed resources which is known as Mobile Computing. Mobile computing enables innovative applications through the sharing of computing resources among mobile devices such as notebook, smart phones and Personal Digital Assistant (PDAs) without any pre-existing infrastructure. Mobile computing includes a number of technologies and devices. The state of the user, static or mobile, does not affect the information management capability of the mobile platform. A user can continue to access and perform data manipulation during the state of mobility by using mobile computing devices. Delivering data packets between pair of processors is a primary responsibility of any mobile computing network. This activity is performed using a routing strategy. Maximize reliability of the data packets always a major concern while transmitting the data from one point to another point. In mobile computing it is the process of determining the data path through the network that data packets will move from the one computing device to another computing device. Routing strategy for data transmission is an important factor for achieving high degree of reliability. Multiple data packets are move within a network from source to destination in order to execute on available processing units with the objective of getting maximum reliability of data packets. This research paper present a routing strategy to achieve maximum data packets transmission reliability in mobile computing network during the data transmission.

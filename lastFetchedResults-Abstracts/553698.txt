During recent decade it has been repeatedly declared by Iranian top managements that in the case of producing gas more than domestic consumption how it might be converted to more value added. Actually there are following five possible options in front of them for this additional natural gas:
- Transmission via natural gas trunk-lines up to the border of Turkey in order to inject to the Nabucco pipeline for consumption in Europe.
- LNG production in Assaluyeh (Tornbak) and selling in the LNG market all around the world.
- Gasoline and petrol production via Gas to liquid (GTL) process.
- Methanol production
- Ethylene production via Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM).
Up to now, amongst the abovementioned options only the methanol production projects have been executed in industrial scale inside Iran while regarding the OCM and GTL processes some pilot plant projects in the Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI) are on stream. It is noteworthy that the OCM and GTL processes are economically feasible provided that oil prices are high. About the first and second abovementioned options, namely pipeline and LNG, it is remarkable that for a long period of time Iranian top managements in the filed of energy were doubtful to select one of them in a manner that one must be selected and the other ought to be forgotten. During recent years both two options were pursued by Iranian top managements hence some projects were defined and now are on stream. The objective of this study was to investigate the technical and economical aspects of these two options in order to make the issue more clear.
Spray dryers are one of the most important dryers and have many applications in the food, drug and chemical industries. In this investigation, a model Is suggested to predict the product temperature, drying time and the dryer height In order to evaluate the dryer performance in different operational conditions. To achieve this, knowledge of the drying kinetics and the transfer phenomenon are necessary. The main aim in this project is, modeling of the spray drying of Alumina Slurry in a co current dryer.
In this modeling Mass, heat and momentum transfer equations on droplets and hot air have been written. By writing a computer program for the simultaneous solution of mass, energy and momentum balances, a mathematical model is introduced. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the model, the experimental data were used and results showed good agreement between the theory and the experiments. By using the results of the model, the change in the dryer input parameters and their effect on final product characterizations have been studied.

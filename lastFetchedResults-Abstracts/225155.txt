This paper presents a dynamic programming
method for solving reactive power/voltage control problem in a
distribution system. The objective of this paper is properly to
dispatch main transformer under load tap changer, substation
capacitor and feeder capacitors based forecast hourly loads of
each feeder section and primary bus voltage such that the total
feeder loss can be minimized, voltage profile can be improved, and
the reactive power flow into main transformer can be restrained.
The constraints that must be considered include maximum
allowable number of switching operations in a day for under
load tap changer and each capacitor, and the voltage limit on
the feeder, and secondary bus voltage is limited. To demonstrate
the usefulness of the proposed approach, reactive power/voltage
control in a distribution system within the service area of Yunlin
District Office of Taiwan Power Company is performed. It is
found that a proper dispatching schedule for each capacitor and
under load tap changer can be reached by the presented method.

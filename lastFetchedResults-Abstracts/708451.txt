Objective
The aim of this study was to determine whether hyperbilirubinemia affects the association between a positive urine nitrite test and a positive urine culture.
Methods
We conducted an institutional review board–approved, retrospective review of 12 months of patient data, compiling information for patients having urinalysis, urine culture, and total serum bilirubin. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to total serum bilirubin: less than 1.5 mg/dL, 1.5 to 3.0 mg/dL, and greater than 3.0 mg/dL. The point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the sensitivity, specificity, false-positive proportion (proportion of false positive to all positive tests), and other test characteristics of urine nitrite as an indicator of urinary tract infection were calculated and tested for trend as a function of the 3 total serum bilirubin ranges.
Results
Three thousand one hundred seventy-four patients met our study criteria. Specificity of the nitrite test decreased as a function of increasing total serum bilirubin (0.974, 0.966, and 0.855 for the 3 total bilirubin levels, respectively) with a significant trend (P < .0001). There was no significant trend in comparable sensitivity values (0.380, 0.417, and 0.241, respectively) with P = .55. The false-positive proportion also increased as a function of total serum bilirubin (17.5%, 17.3%, and 72.0%) with P < .0001. Thus, if a patient's total serum bilirubin was elevated to the point of jaundice (>3.0 mg/dL), it was approximately 4 times more likely that a positive urine nitrite test would be a “false positive” (ie, nitrite-positive/culture-negative) compared with those with normal serum bilirubin levels.
Conclusions
Specificity of the urine nitrite test for urinary tract infection decreases as a function of increasing serum bilirubin. Most patients with hyperbilirubinemia and a positive nitrite test in our sample did not have an associated urinary tract infection

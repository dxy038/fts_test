A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm keeping diversity of the population is proposed. The algorithm makes use of a metric based on entropy to measure the diversity of the population. The evolving state of the current population is associated with the running mechanism of the algorithm by the diversity metric, and several strategies are designed to enhance the extent of exploration of the algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm has good performance of convergence and distribution.

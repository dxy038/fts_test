Objective.  In plastic surgery, clinicians are interested in replacing conventional expansion by rapid expansion, because the expansion period could be shortened greatly. Also people are concerned that skin properties after rapid expansion might not approach those after conventional expansion.

Design. Biomechanical testing of skin for different expansion methods.

Background. It would be useful to know how much the mechanical properties of skin have been altered during rapid and conventional expansion and during different maintaining times.

Methods. Tensile strength, stressâ€“strain relationship, stress relaxation, and creep were measured by a material testing machine.

Result. The biomechanical properties of experimental specimens differ significantly from those of their controls immediately after expansion, however, the difference is reduced with time. With the same maintaining period, the biomechanical properties of rapidly expanded skin are similar to conventionally expanded skin.

Conclusion. Rapid skin expansion did not demonstrate any deleterious effect when compared with the conventional expansion. Extension of the maintaining period can improve the biomechanical properties of expanded skin. Therefore, rapid expansion with an extended maintaining period is acceptable in clinical practice.

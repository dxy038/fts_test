Abstract
Soil sensitivity to structure destruction trends is an important criterion to
determine the agronomic ability of a soil. This sensitivity is characterized by the
concept of physical structure stability which in spite of structure destruction factors
effect, shows the ability of structural component stability. The objective of this
research were to investigate the factors affecting soil aggregate stability in an
extensive area of Shastkalateh forest in soils originated from three different
geological parent materials and also to determine the aggregate stability in order to
study erosion Soil. Using the Geology and Topographic maps therefore 20 points
were selected as mixture and completely random design and sampling was carried
out from 0-20 cm depth. Mean weight diameter was determined by wet sieving
method. Physical properties such as soil texture and chemical properties including
organic matter, calcium carbonates and Iron oxides were measured and linear and
multiple regressions with stepwise method was performed to analyse the results.
The results showed that Zhorasic parent material has the highest aggregate
stability. Carbonate calcium Content (R2=0.67), iron (R2=0.78) and soil CEC of are
the most effective factors on soil structure stability in Zhorasic parent material.
Carbonate calcium content (R2=0.78), iron (R2=0.72) in Loess structure aggregate
and organic matter content and iron (R2=0.5) in alluvial pareat material play the
most important roles in stability.

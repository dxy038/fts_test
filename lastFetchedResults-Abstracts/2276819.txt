Sloshing absorbers work on a similar principle to that of tuned vibration absorbers. A sloshing absorber consists of a tank, partially filled with liquid. The absorber is attached to the structure to be controlled, and relies on the structure's motion to excite the liquid. Consequently, a sloshing wave is produced at the liquid free surface possessing energy dissipative qualities. The primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of employing liquid sloshing as a structural control mechanism. To this end, simple experimental observations are presented first. Then, numerical predictions obtained using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) are compared with experimental observations. The objective of this comparison is to demonstrate the modelling technique's ability to approximate the characteristics of such flows.

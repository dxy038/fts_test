This paper is a study of; software framework designs, context awareness computing, and Mobile Patient Monitoring Systems (MPMS) using wireless sensors, to find out the lacks and the gaps in the literature. To achieve this, a set of success factors are used to characterize and analyze these frameworks. These success factors are introduced in this paper as a set of designs and domain requirements that must be addressed to design extensible and reusable context-aware application frameworks to develop MPMS using wireless sensors. To enhance the existing frameworks design, a research agenda is presented as the primary objective of this paper. This research agenda is expected to help researchers fill the gaps in the designed frameworks.

Most objective speech quality measures studied in the past have attempted to measure overall acceptability or naturalness. It is intrinsically difficult to design such measures because many perceptually dissimilar distortions may be judged to have equal acceptability. This paper describes objective measures which estimate the perceptually specific (parametric) subjective qualities of the Diagnostic Acceptability Measure. The narrower scope of these subjective qualities promotes a closer coupling between physical quantities and perceptual qualities in a given quality category, resulting in a more accurate objective measures.

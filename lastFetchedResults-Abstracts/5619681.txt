This paper is concerned with the design problem of robust H<sub>infin</sub> reliable controller for nonlinear singular stochastic systems with actuator failures via a fuzzy-control approach. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to represent a nonlinear singular stochastic system with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. The objective is to design a state feedback fuzzy controller such that, for all admissible uncertainties as well as normal and different actuator failure cases, the resulting closed-loop system is robustly stochastically stable while satisfying a prescribed performance constraint. Based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, stochastic Lyapunov function method is adopted to establish sufficient conditions of existence and design method of robust H<sub>infin</sub> reliable fuzzy controller in terms of stability theory for stochastic differential equations. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract
Introduction: Obesity is one of the most common nutritional disorders in the world, clearly associated with metabolic disorder. Prevalence of children and adolescents obesity has increased due to increasing the prevalence of type two diabetes in the last decades.
Objective: To determine the impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance of obese children and adolescents. Materials and Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted on obese children and adolescents who were referred to endocrine clinic of children hospital in Tabriz, from April 2007 till March 2008. One hundred ten obese children and adolescents were studied with BMI over than 95 percentile base on age and sex. OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) was performed immediately 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose (1.75gr/kg). Insulin resistance was examined by HOMA index.
Results: Among 110 obese children and adolescent, prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance was 9.1% and insulin resistance was 28.2% and Type2 diabetes didn't observe. There was a significant difference in glucose 120min (p=0.003) and insulin 120min (p<0.001) in patients with IGT (Impaired Glucose Tolerance) as compared with other obese children and adolescents. Insulin resistance in IGT was more than other and there was a significant difference between them (p=0.03).
Conclusion: Obesity in children and adolescents is associated with increasing the risk of IGT and insulin resistance. OGTT versus fasting glucose can be a useful predictor for them.

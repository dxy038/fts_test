In this paper, components of wind power generation including the wind turbine, wind generators, the gear box, pitch control, and yaw control are discussed with emphasis on grid connected systems. Also, real life implementation issues are discussed to realize a viable wind power system. The objective of the paper is to develop end user understanding by utilizing analogies and simple language.

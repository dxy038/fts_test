The exponential growth in IT made possible through MooreÂ´s law for several decades has been surpassed by the demand for computing. Future high performance computing (HPC) systems are considered an area also relevant for traditional safety-critical embedded systems like automotive and aerospace. HPC could also benefit from experiences in embedded computing in terms of fault-tolerant run-time environment (RTE) architectures with high degree of reliability and dependability. The panel objective is to explore interdisciplinary technologies cutting across multi-core computing systems, dependable computing and high performance computing. The panel brings together industry and academia from so far fragmented domains such as real-time embedded system engineering and HPC architectures.

Objective
m of this study was to determine if an information sheet containing photographs and explanations of the training level of medical providers could enhance a parent's ability to identify their child's providers and whether this would impact parental attitudes toward trainee involvement and patient satisfaction.
s
as a prospective, mixed methods study of parent-child dyads admitted to an academic general pediatric inpatient service. The intervention group received a photo information sheet (Photographs of Academic Clinicians and Their Educational Status [PHACES] tool) consisting of passport-sized photos of the medical team along with information regarding their training. Parents were asked to name their child's providers, were surveyed about their attitudes toward trainees, participated in a brief, semistructured interview and completed the patient satisfaction questionnaire (ABIM-PSQ).
s
ing intervention with control parents, 40 of 49 (82%) versus 19 of 51 (37%) were able to name at least one provider (adjusted odds ratio 8.0; P &lt; .01). Parents who received the intervention were more likely to correctly match the face with the name of the medical student (67% vs 14%; P &lt; .01) and attending (80% vs 24%; P &lt; .01). Parents who received the intervention were more likely to report acceptance of the involvement of medical students and house staff as well as an improved understanding of their roles. Parents who received the intervention scored higher on the ABIM-PSQ (mean 48.3 vs 45.4; P = .008).
sions
ormation sheet containing the photographs of health care providers along with an explanation of their training improves recognition of the health care team members, improves acceptance of trainee involvement, and improves satisfaction with care delivered by physicians in training.

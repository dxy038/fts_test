So far, the problem of global illumination calculation
has almost exclusively been approached from an algorithmic
point of view. In this paper we propose an architectural approach
to global illumination. The proposed rendering architecture
Vision is derived from a model of the physical rendering process,
which is subsequently mapped onto an object-oriented hierarchy
of classes. This design is powerful and flexible enough to support
and exploit a large body of existing illumination algorithms for
the simulation of various aspects of the underlying physical
model. Additionally, the Vision architecture offers a platform for
developing new algorithms and for combining them to create new
rendering solutions.
We discuss both abstract design as well as implementation issues.
In particular, we give a detailed description of the global
Lighting subsystem and show how algorithms for path tracing,
bidirectional estimators, irradiance caching, hierarchical radiosity,
wavelet radiosity, and wavelet radiance have been implemented
within Vision.

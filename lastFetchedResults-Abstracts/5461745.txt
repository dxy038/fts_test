The objective of this study was to develop an approximate method for predicting, with acceptable accuracy, the electromagnetic field scattered by perfectly conducting bodies of complex shape immersed in a lossy medium, i.e. the ocean, when subjected to the field of an oscillating magnetic dipole source.

The concept of cost function (CF) in the context of image filtering is put under investigation in this work. Optimal behaviour of the resulting filters in respect with noise attenuation and edge preservation is sought through the minimization of these functions. This behaviour can be controlled by proper adjustment of certain parameters in some cases. Function combinations are also considered. Finally, the proposed schemes are tested on real images and objective as well as subjective results are reported.

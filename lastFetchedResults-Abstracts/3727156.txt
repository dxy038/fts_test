Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) internal interaction analysis is complicated by the presence of many random parameters which preclude the deterministic solution for induced excitations at particular load points. The objective of this communication is to discuss a fundamental technique for the statistical analysis of load excitations induced on an N-wire random cable via use of the reciprocity theorem in conjuction with subset representation of a statistical ensemble.

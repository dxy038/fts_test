In this paper we study the stability for a class of stochastic jumping bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with time-varying and distributed delays. To the best of our knowledge, this class of stochastic jumping BAM neural networks with time-varying and distributed delays has never been investigated in the literature. The main aim of this paper tries to fill the gap. By using the stochastic stability theory, the properties of a Brownian motion, the generalized Itoâ€™s formula and linear matrix inequalities technique, some novel sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the stochastically exponential stability of the trivial solution or zero solution. In particular, the activation functions considered in this paper are fairly general since they may depend on Markovian jump parameters and they are more general than those usual Lipschitz conditions. Also, the derivative of time delays is not necessarily zero or small than 1. In summary, the results obtained in this paper extend and improve those not only with/without noise disturbances, but also with/without Markovian jump parameters. Finally, two interesting examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.

In an effort to reduce different culture-cognitive, regulation, and social needs of intraregional logistics and supply chain, the Government of GMS countries have initiated to adopt a holistic multimodal transportation routing. The objective of research, therefore, is to develop a DSS that can accommodate evaluation models and criteria including various factors to optimize multimodal transportation routing with maximum satisfaction in transporting goods within GMS countries. The DSS model is the combination of a number of models beginning with the AHP model to achieve priorities in quantitative and qualitative point of view from customers and multimodal transporters of the alternatives, following by the ZOGP which can integrate priorities from AHP with quantitative data to achieve an optimal multimodal transportation routing base upon limitation of time and budget. The collaborating firms are multimodal transportation companies which have destination from/to Bangkok and Vietnam. The results analysis, recommendations and limitation are also presented.

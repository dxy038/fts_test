Blood gasses are one of the vital signs monitored by medical practitioners for critically ill patients and as preventive health care measures for potential heart disease patients. Measurement of blood gasses in a quick, effective way, without compromising on accuracy is one of the fundamental topics for research today and is in tune with the demands of the medical fraternity. The objective of this paper is to review the theory of blood gas measurement and the current technological solutions used to measure blood gasses non-invasively and continuously. This paper finally presents proposed research that will foresee portable, noninvasive blood gas monitoring solutions.

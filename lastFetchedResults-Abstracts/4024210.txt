Stability-constrained optimal power flow (SOPF) models for reactive power reinforcement and HVDC control tuning are formulated, several derivative-free solution algorithms are presented and implemented in a prototype, and the behavior of the objective function value as injection space parameters vary is studied using a qualitative approach. Results of the East China 3296-bus system are provided.

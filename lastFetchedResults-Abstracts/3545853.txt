This brief compares the performances of different operation strategies based on optimal scheduling and heuristic scheduling for heavy haul trains equipped with electronically controlled pneumatic braking systems. Train scheduling here refers to an open-loop control design that brings the train to a desired (steady-state) motion trajectory. A (closed-loop) cruise control is used to maintain a steady-state motion of a train. In train handling, energy consumption, speed tracking, and in-train force are concerns for transportation corporations. The last is particularly important for safe train running. An optimal train scheduling as well as an optimal cruise control can take these factors into consideration. A speed profile is assumed first. The objective of the study is to find optimal driving methodologies for an implementation of a desired speed profile with energy consumption and in-train forces considered. Simulation results show that optimal scheduling can improve the performance of the closed-loop controller, and that the 2-2 strategy, the electronically controlled pneumatic/independent distributed power mode, is the best of all strategies.

In this paper, a fusion of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Brain Limbic System (BLS) control strategy is suggested to achieve mobile robot navigation in unknown environments. As a multi-objective decision making method, AHP is employed to obtain the optimal gap among the obstacles that the robot encounters. To implement the suggested method, the weighting among objectives are defined and the relative importance matrix of each objective is generated. The robot is thus enabled to move to the desired position via a brain limbic system based controller. The simulation results demonstrate the performance of fused method.

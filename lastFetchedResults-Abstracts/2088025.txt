Background: MicroRNA (miRNA) is small endogenous, single strand RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level through several mechanisms to affect key cellular event including male germ cells differentiation, proliferation, development and apoptosis. Mutation and/or aberrant expression of miRNAs have been associated with progression of various disorders, including infertility.
Objective: The purpose of this research was to study the estrogen receptor beta
(ERB), hsa-mir-21 and, hsa-mir-22 expression level in oligospermic infertile and
control fertile men and correlation between them.
Materials and Methods: In this study, the change in mir-21, mir-22 expression and their common target gene (ERB) expression levels were evaluated in oligospermic infertile men (n= 43) compared with 43 age matched healthy control by Real-Time PCR methods.
Results: Expression analysis by qRT-PCR test on miRNA have identified that mir-21, mir-22 levels were significantly higher than those in normal controls (p < 0.0001) and ERB expression level significantly decreased in comparison with the normal group (p < 0.0001).
Conclusion: Our study showed that mir-21 and mir-22 are indirectly involved in spermatogenesis by regulating of the estrogen receptor and might have a diagnostic and prognostic value in men infertility.

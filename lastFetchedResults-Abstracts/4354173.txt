The objective of this paper is to demonstrate in which case asymmetric coupled structures can be analyzed as symmetric line models in order to use the quasi-symmetric approach. For this aim, a rigorous formulation was used; trial functions of even and odd modes were obtained from the symmetric case, and thus proposed for the asymmetric case. A comparative study of dispersion parameters shows the limits of the quasi-symmetric model validity with respect to asymmetries due to influence of shielding and metal strips/or slots widths difference.

Self-pierce riveting (SPR) is a high-speed mechanical fastening technique for point joining of sheet materials. It is used heavily in the automotive sector due to the growing use of alternative materials such as aluminium and magnesium alloys and the difficulty in welding these. Published works relating to SPR is reviewed in this paper. The mechanics of joint formation and the types of defects that may occur are introduced. The main mechanical properties of SPR joints such as strength, corrosion properties and free vibration properties are discussed. The prediction of joint distortion when SPR is used to create structures and the cost effects of the technique are also introduced. The objective of this paper is to review recent progress in SPR usage and to provide a basis for further research.

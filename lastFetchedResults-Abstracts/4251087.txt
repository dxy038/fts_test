The resource-based view of the firm is used to study the role of organizational knowledge in establishing sustained competitive advantage. The concept of t Riege he organisational knowledge capabilities development analyzes the organisational capabilities in three principal dimensions: Knowledge Management (KM) infrastructures, KM processes and KM competences. However to better determine this concept; it is important to know what the impact of each dimension in organizational transformation is. In this work, we are interested in the impact of KM competences as an organisational capability in the context of organizational transformation and learning for business performance. Indeed, the literature in knowledge management, management and information technology shows that the development of the organisational capabilities is strongly related to the use of a maturity model. However, there is very little work on the literature which develops a specific maturity model for KM competences as organizational capability. For this reason, the objective of this paper is to propose a KM Competences maturity model (KMCMM) for KM competences that shows an organisational transformation.

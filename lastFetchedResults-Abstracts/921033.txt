A series of quinoline coupled 1,2,3-triazoles compounds have been synthesized by ‘click chemistry’ from azidomethyl quinoline with different alkynes. The efficiency and fidelity of the Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne reaction are substantiated by good yields and exclusive formation of the expected 1,4-disubstituted triazole product. All the synthesized compounds were screened for anti-tubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv by luciferase reporter phage (LRP) assay. Quinoline coupled triazole sugar hybrid, 20 is the most potent compound in the series with 76.41% and 78.37% reduction calculated based on percentage reduction in Relative Light Units at 5 and 25 μg/mL, respectively.

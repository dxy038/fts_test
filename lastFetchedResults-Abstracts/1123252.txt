This paper breaks new ground by modelling lot sizing and scheduling in a flexible flow line
(FFL) simultaneously instead of separately. This problem, called the ‘General Lot sizing and
Scheduling Problem in a Flexible Flow Line’ (GLSP-FFL), optimizes the lot sizing and
scheduling of multiple products at multiple stages, each stage having multiple machines in
parallel. The objective is to satisfy varying demand over a finite planning horizon with minimal
inventory, backorder and production setup costs. The problem is complex as any product can be
processed on any machine but with different process rates and sequence-dependent setup times
& costs. The efficiency of two alternative models is assessed and evaluated using numerical
tests.

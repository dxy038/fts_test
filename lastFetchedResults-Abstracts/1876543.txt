Objective
jective is to identify and describe critical care nurses’ perception of arrhythmia knowledge. In addition, this study is the first step in developing levels of arrhythmia competency.

itative research design was used. Focus group technique using a semistructured group session, with a moderator, was used to gather data. Data were analyzed by the constant comparative method.
ts
bjects were critical care nurses who work in acute care settings where they read electrocardiographic data and make treatment decisions.
ures
ocus groups were conducted over a period of 12 months. Group size ranged from four to eight participants. Participants were asked to describe their perceptions of arrhythmia knowledge and to assign a rating score related to the level of knowledge needed to identify specific arrhythmias.
s
 intermediate, and advanced levels of arrhythmia knowledge were identified. This study revealed a deficit in nurses’ ability to recognize and identify specific arrhythmias including heart block, aberrant conduction, and tachyarrhythmias. Understanding of lead placement concepts varied greatly among participants.
sions
sight and perspective of critical care nurses related to the level of arrhythmia knowledge are needed for the development of competency measures and evidence-based teaching strategies.

Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) assessment of myocardial perfusion is based on visualization of 2D slices. To overcome the subjective nature of this analysis, we developed a new technique for quantification of myocardial perfusion from MDCT 3D datasets and tested it against nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). MDCT datasets of 44 patients were analyzed to generate bull´s eye display of myocardial perfusion and calculate segmental quantitative indices of extent and severity of perfusion defect. Visual interpretation of MDCT-derived bull´s eyes was in agreement with rest MPI scores (&#194;&#191;=0.79). Quantitative MDCT perfusion data were in good agreement with MPI summed scores: r=0.84; objective detection of perfusion defects using MDCT index resulted in: area under ROC curve=0.87, sensitivity 0.92, specificity 0.91, and accuracy 0.89. Our technique for volumetric analysis of MDCT data allows accurate and objective detection of perfusion defects.

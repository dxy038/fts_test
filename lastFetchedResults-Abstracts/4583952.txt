A new idea of 2.5 dimensional cellular automaton models is provided. It discloses that the environmental altitude is an important factor which has an active function on the crowd evacuation model related to stadium. The research uses the agent technology in virtual agent´s movement-decision-making for their evacuating action. It suggests using the attraction weighing value of cellular-automaton-grid as an important parameter, which considers the objective factor, for selecting agent´s suitable evacuation path. Meanwhile, the agent´s subjective factor, which would influence their evacuation, has also been considered. The agent´s evacuating movement regulation is established by these two factors. And finally, a practical and well-visibility system for crowd evacuation has been developed; a related instance is used to prove that the 2.5D-CA-model is practicable and reasonable for crowd evacuating simulation.

The Pareto ant colony algorithm (PACA) for multi-objective power network planning is presented according to the current situation of resolve multi-objective power network planning by translate multi-objective problem to single-objective problem. The weights are determined randomly for each objective, make all the objective have the same status and avoid the difficulty of determine weights. It can greatly reduce the quantity of calculation by solve the multiple objective optimization problems directly. Get the Pareto-front, and then the relation of the objectives is present by a map. The correctness of the proposed method is verified by the example of the 18-bus system.

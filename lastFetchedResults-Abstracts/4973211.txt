The increase in the number of requests from Independent Power Producers - IPPs to access the distribution network close to load centers, as Distributed Generation, requires the development of new methodologies to quantify the impact of these units in the system. The connection of these generators, which may be associated with renewable energy sources of intermittent nature, such as wind energy, causes positive and negative impacts to the network. The objective of this paper is to present a risk assessment model for planning the access of IPPs to distribution systems, according to the rules of the Brazilian electric sector, which is extendable to other countries. The model aims to indicate, from the point of view of the distribution network benefit, the best alternatives for the connection of these units by means of probabilistic assessment of the costs of generation and the supply risk. The model is based on composite system reliability evaluation by non-sequential Monte Carlo Simulation and uses a nonlinear Optimal Power Flow for adequacy assessment of the system states.

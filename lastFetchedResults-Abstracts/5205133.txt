End-to-end quality of service in todayÂ´s mobile networks is essential to end users since most of the services are non-real-time data services (primarily based on IP) which have time-varying quality over time, end-user position and other-end location. It is possible to have different quality for the same service under same mobile network conditions in the core and wireless part. Therefore, mobile operators need systems for testing and measurements of end-to-end quality of service. In this paper we present our developed system for service quality testing, which is created for testing the user perceived quality of services in mobile cellular networks. The system is consisted of distributed testing stations over the mobile network coverage area and centralized management and processing nodes, which provide collection, storage and statistical processing of data regarding the quality of service parameters for mobile data services. The system provides objective end-to-end quality of service information in real-time, which is essential to provide services with desired quality to the end users.

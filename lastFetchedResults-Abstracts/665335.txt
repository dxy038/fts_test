The hydrochemistry in the largest polder of the Oder River, named Oderbruch, is affected by long-term infiltration of water from the Oder into the aquifer below an alluvial loamy top layer of the polder. These exceptional hydraulic conditions are a result of dyke constructions which were built more than 250 a ago. The objective of this investigation is a better understanding and a characterisation of the contact zone between the anaerobic groundwater and the surface water of a vast drainage system. Induced by changing water levels, different hydraulic conditions occur, which strongly influence the hydrochemistry of the shallow aquifer and therefore the natural sink function of the polder area.

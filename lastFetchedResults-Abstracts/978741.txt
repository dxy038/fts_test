A five-year (2008 â€“ 2012) retrospective study was carried out in 10 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Adamawa State to determine the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB). Slaughter Slab records of tuberculosis suspected granulomatous lesions of slaughtered cattle from each LGA were thoroughly collated, examined and analyzed using descriptive statistic (per cent). The result indicated that a total of 122, 050 cattle were slaughtered within the period under review, out of which 8, 149 had BTB gross lesions. An overall prevalence of 6.7% was obtained of which 4 LGAs, Mubi South, Yola, Mubi North and Michika had higher prevalence of 12.7%, 8.9%, 8.0% and 7.2%, respectively. The rest had prevalence between 0.6-3.4 per cent with Fufore LGA having the least (0.6%).This study established that bovine tuberculosis is still a problem in Adamawa State.This finding is of public health significance as cattle slaughtered at slaughter slabs remains the major source of beef for the populace in Adamawa State. We therefore, recommend that Adamawa State government should lunch a full field and laboratory research in to BTB so as to preserve and maintain a healthy herd and a healthy beef for the public thereby reducing zoonoses.

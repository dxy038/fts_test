The open wireless architecture networks are targeted for the support of various applications such as voice, data, video conferencing, and video streaming. Providing Quality of Service guarantees for these systems is an important objective in the design of the fourth generation (4G). In this paper, we propose a Medium Access Control protocol that maximizes the bandwidth utilization while successfully integrating different classes of traffic. In addition, we propose a generic scheduling scheme, named Channel State-EDF.

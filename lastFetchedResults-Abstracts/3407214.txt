An optimal transposition design of transformer windings using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is presented. The objective is to provide the best transposition positions to obtain the lowest circulating current losses in the parallel conductors. The GAs procedure for solving multiparameter and constrained problems is described in detail. In the optimization process, the losses are calculated by a combined method of Magnetic field and Electric circuit. The proper value ranges of GAs operators (mutation and recombination) are examined in performance experiments. The improved transposition data are achieved by applying the approach to a large transformer

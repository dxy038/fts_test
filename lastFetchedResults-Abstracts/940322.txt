The objective of this work is to facilitate a sustainable regional planning of water resources in karst areas by providing a conceptual framework for an integrative vulnerability assessment. A combined mapping and modeling approach is proposed, taking into account both spatial and temporal aspects of karst groundwater vulnerability. The conceptual framework comprises the delineation of recharge areas, vulnerability mapping, numerical flow and transport modeling and the integration of information into a combined vulnerability map and time series. The approach is illustrated at a field site in northwest Switzerland (Gempen plateau). The results show that the combination of vulnerability mapping and numerical modeling allows the vulnerability distribution, both in the recharge and discharge areas, to be identified, and at the same time, the time dependence of karst groundwater vulnerability to be assessed. The combined vulnerability map and time series provide a quantitative basis for drinking water management and for regional planning.

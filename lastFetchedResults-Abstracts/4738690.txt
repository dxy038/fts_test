In this paper the authors compare two approximate models for frequency domain analysis of TM plane wave coupling to horizontal thin-wire conductor above homogenous lossy soil. The first approach is based on quasi-static image theory and the second one is based on transmission line theory. The main objective is to determine the accuracy of the approximate models by analyzing the current distribution with respect to rigorous electromagnetic approach. Detailed parametric analysis indicates the applicability domain of the analyzed approximate models in practical EMC studies.

Objective methods to asses listening effort are still missing in clinical settings. Thus, the focus of our ongoing research is the extraction of possible substrates of listening effort. This paper focuses on the non-effort related factor reaction time (RT) on the different components of auditory late responses (ALRs). It makes sense to consider this factor in the context of age related changes of the RT. For the comparison of the ALR components and the RT, two syllable oddball paradigms with different degree of difficulty were created. The paradigms were embedded in multitalker babble noise to create a realistic listening situation. The data was collected from 13 normal hearing healthy subjects, who had to detect a deviant. Furthermore, the wavelet phase synchronization stability (WPSS) was calculated for different scales. A filter bank was designed in order to separate the components by their frequency content. Finally, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was calculated to clarify if there is a possible linkage between the RT and the ALR components. The results show, that only the P<sub>3</sub> latency is correlated with the RT. A relation between the RT and the other ALR components could not be observed. It is concluded, that the focus of our further research, will be on the N<sub>1</sub> and the P<sub>2</sub> wave due to the fact that those components are independent from the non- effort related factor reaction time.

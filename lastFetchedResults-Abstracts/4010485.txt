This paper proposes a frequency adaptive phase-locked loop (PLL) for use in single-phase systems. The main objective is to obtain a reliable synchronization signal even in polluted grids, where the fundamental frequency is contaminated with harmonics, or present variations in phase, amplitude, and/or frequency. The proposed PLL is based on the concept of a variable sampling period technique, already implemented in a three-phase digital synchronization method proposed by the authors. This single-phase method allows us to automatically adjust the sampling frequency to be an integer multiple of the line frequency. In this case, the phase error is calculated just by one multiplication, thereby reducing implementation. A sliding Goertzel transform-based filter is also used in the loop to reject the undesired effects of this phase error detector and line disturbances, such as harmonics. To stabilize the loop, a controller that maximizes the bandwidth with an acceptable transient is introduced. The characteristics of the proposed single-phase PLL are described and the experimental results obtained from a DSP implementation are presented. A set of comparative simulations between the proposed PLL and some single-phase PLL described in the literature are conducted to validate the method. The advantages of the proposed system over other methods analyzed are also dealt with. The robustness of the system is verified by the experimental tests conducted as well as by the harmonic filtering properties. The system is also characterized by its simple architecture, which allows us to provide a high dynamic response with a very much reduced number of calculations.

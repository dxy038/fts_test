In this paper, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 13 schizophrenic patients and 18 age-matched control participants are analyzed with the objective of classifying the two groups. For each case, multi-channels (22 electrodes) scalp EEG is recorded. Several features including autoregressive (AR) model parameters, band power and fractal dimension are extracted from the recorded signals. Leave-one (participant)-out cross validation is used to have an accurate estimation for the separability of the two groups. Boosted version of Direct Linear Discriminant Analysis (BDLDA) is selected as an efficient classifier which applied on the extracted features. To have comparison, classifiers such as standard LDA, Adaboost, support vector machine (SVM), and fuzzy SVM (FSVM) are applied on the features. Results show that the BDLDA is more discriminative than others such that their classification rates are reported 87.51%, 85.36% and 85.41% for the BDLDA, LDA, Adaboost, respectively. Results of SVM and FSVM classifiers were lower than 50% accuracy because they are more sensitive to outlier instances. In order to determine robustness of the suggested classifier, noises with different amplitudes are added to the test feature vectors and robustness of the BDLDA was higher than the other compared classifiers.

Objective: Evaluation of the effects of Toxoplasma gondii infection on spermatogenesis in male rats. 
Materials and Methods: The RH strain of T. gondii tachyzoites were injected interaperitoneally in an infected group of 35 rats, while 21 rats were used as controls. Each ten days from 10- 70 days of post-infection (PI), 5 rats from infected group and 3 rats from control group were scarified. The percentage of body weight to testis weight ratio (BTR) as well as sperm parameters and fructose levels in seminal vesicles and coagulating glands (SVCG) were investigated. An IgG ELISA kit was designed for serologic diagnosis of infection in the rats.
Results: All rats injected with T. gondii tachyzoites were infected from 10-70 PI. Sperm motility from 10-70 PI, sperm viability from 10-60 PI and sperm concentration from 20-60 PI were significantly decreased in the infected group (P < 0.05); sperm abnormality was significantly increased in the infected group on days 30, 40 and 50 PI (P  <  0.05). BTR in the infected group was not significantly changed compared to control group (P > 0.05). Fructose level in SVCG in the infected group was significantly decreased on days 10-50 PI (P  <  0.05) compared to control.
Conclusion: According to the results, toxoplasmosis can cause impermanent impairment on the spermatogenesis in the male rats.

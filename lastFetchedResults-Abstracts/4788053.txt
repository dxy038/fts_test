The objective of multiple description coding (MDC) is to solve the problem of unreliable channels by means of independent descriptions. This paper proposes an efficient two-description image coding scheme in the wavelet domain. Here, the two-layered MDC method is adopted. First, we partition the low-frequency wavelet coefficients into two groups, and pairwise correlating transform (PCT) was applied on the two groups to generate two new correlated groups as two basic descriptions, which are coded and transmitted through two separate channels. Second, we can get two enhanced descriptions from the high-frequency wavelet subbands by adaptive down-sampling. And finally we use the wavelet domain interpolation for tree reconstruction (WDIR) to conceal coefficients loss in spatial orientation tree of wavelet when one enhanced description lost during transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MDC scheme can achieve good coding performance.

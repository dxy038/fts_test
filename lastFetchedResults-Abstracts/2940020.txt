In order to specify, implement and validate management interfaces between telecom operators, a Eurescom project was launched, P408, titled &#8220;Pan-European TMN-Experiments and Field Trial Support&#8221;. Several types of management interfaces are used between telecom operators: Xcoop for a pan-European SDH transport network, and Xcoop and Xuser for a pan-European ATM network. The article describes the experience of defining test specifications for the validation phase of the project. The objective, the approach taken and the scope of the test specification task are introduced. This, and the test configuration permitted by the numerous national implementations, implied the choice of a methodology based on ISO 9646 (Tree and Tabular Combined Notation, TTCN). The test suite structure is then presented

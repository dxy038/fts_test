This paper presents a quick and reliable methodology for machine design. The methodology is based on Magnetic Equivalent Circuit (MEC) and multi-level, multi-objective optimization. It is applied to design three phase axial flux actuator. The MEC is solved by computing meshesÂ´ magnetic flux. It allows taking into account nonlinear operating conditions and its network topology is generated automatically for each rotor position. Multilevel optimization is achieved by means of Space Mapping (SM) method in order to couple linear and non-linear models. Multi-objective optimization problem is solved by means of NSGA-II. This methodology combines final solution accuracy and fast computation/simulation time.

With the purpose of reducing the crosstalk caused by Rayleigh scattering in bidirectional centralized light systems, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical frequency modulation to broaden the optical spectrum effectively. Analytic expressions for the Q-parameter of the signal affected by Rayleigh backscattering are also given and experimentally checked, both for optical frequency stable and dithered sources

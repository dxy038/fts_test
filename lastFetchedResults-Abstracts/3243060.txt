Recent research results manifest that mental activity, as well as social interaction are key prerequisites for preventing or delaying the progression of dementia. The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of a novel computer-based cognitive training and social activation program on the cognition, the affection and the functional abilities of cognitively intact elderly, patients with MCI and patients with mild AlzheimerÂ´s disease (AD). We performed a randomized, controlled trail of a computer-based cognitive training on 348 elderly subject distributed in three target groups, who attended a training program of 24 sessions of 60 minutes of duration (individual or in group), twice per week for 12 weeks. Outcome measures showed that the treatment group, who performed exercises specifically designed to enhance the cognitive functions, compared to the not intervention control group, improved the cognitive status with significant evidence mainly on memory and executive functions.

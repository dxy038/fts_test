Objective(s): PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) produces symptoms in approximately 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age (12–45 years old). It is thought to be one of the leading causes of female subfertility. This study aimed to confirm the role of nutrition containing omega-3 (polyunsaturated fatty acid) on control of experimental PCO induced by estradiol-valerat in rats. Materials and Methods: Wistar female rats (n=40) were allocated into control (n=10) and test groups (n= 30), test group was subdivided into 3 groups: G1, received omega-3 (240 mg/kg/orally/daily); G2 and G3 groups were induced PCO by single injection of estradiol-valerate (16 mg/kg/IM). Group 3 received omega-3 (240 mg/kg/orally/daily) and low carbohydrate feeding for 60 subsequent days; on sixtieth day 5 ml blood samples and ovarian tissues of all rats in the group were removed and prepared for biochemical and hormonal analysis. Results: Catalase, GPX (Glutathione peroxidase), SOD (Superoxide dismutase) in groups that received omega-3showed higher levels, but MDA (malondialdehyde) level was significantly decreased (P<0.05) in comparison with other experimental groups. Ovarian weights in both experimental and control groups were similar (P<0.05). Level of serum FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) was decreased, but level of testosterone was significantly increased (P<0.05) in PCO group in comparison with control and omega-3 groups. Conclusion: Results revealed that administration of omega-3 plus lower carbohydrate food significantly controlled   PCO syndrome and balanced FSH and testosterone.

The distribution system is part of the electric power system that links the bulk transmission system and the individual customers. This Distributed Generation (DG) is a promising solution to many power system problems such as voltage regulation, power loss, etc. The location in the power system for DG placement is found to be very important. Allocation of distributed generation at non-optimal places leads to increased power loss and reduced bus voltage profiles. By proper placement of DG at optimal bus location the economic cost and active power losses can be minimized then the corresponding bus voltages will be improved. Three different objective functions are considered in this study: (1) minimization of interruption cost (2) minimization of active power loss (3) maximization of reliability level. The goal is to optimize each objective function. The results can be summarized by focusing on the reliability of traditional distribution system without DG and the case that DG is connected to the distribution system.

A 32 ?? 32 winner-take-all (WTA) matrix with single winner selection is introduced. A high-resolution gain-boosted regulated-cascode WTA circuit is used in a first competition stage. Because of the large number of competing cells the possibility of a multiple winners situation arises. A single winner is obtained by means of a digital inhibitory circuit following each WTA analogue amplifier. Simulations show that this mixed analogue-digital circuit achieves its objective with a current resolution of approximately 10 nA (0.8% of the maximum input current in the simulated case). A time response of ??s can be achieved.

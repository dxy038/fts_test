Soils comprise a critical interface between the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere, and play a major role in the cycling of nitrogen (N), an element crucial to plant growth. Isotope techniques constitute a powerful tool to study the origin and fate of N compounds (e.g. NO3−) within the environment including soils. The objective of our study was to test the usefulness of the isotope composition of soil NO3− extracted with 2 M KCl (soil NO3) as a tool to investigate the origin and fate of NO3− in the environment. Specifically issues related to repeat extractions, crop type, length of fertilization, and soil depth were addressed. Soils from four contrasting agricultural management regimes were sampled. Within the relatively confined study area (4 ha), the isotopic compositions of soil NO3 differed markedly due to management treatments (up to 6 and 17‰ for δ15N and δ18O, respectively), but were repeatable among replicate plots (±1‰). Differences in both δ15N and δ18O values were observed between legume and non-legume treatments, as well as fertilized versus non-fertilized treatments, which were larger than the variability observed between replicate plots. Differences in the isotopic composition of extractable soil nitrate were not limited to the surface layer, but also occurred within deeper soil layers. This study indicates that the analysis of the natural abundance stable isotope composition of soil NO3 may provide a promising additional tool for tracing the origin and fate of NO3− in the soil zone.

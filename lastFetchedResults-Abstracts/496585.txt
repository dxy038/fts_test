The objective of the study was to determine genetic parameters for growth and carcass traits in Mukota pigs, maintained on a
fibrous diet. Records (nÂ¼ 1961) were obtained from a population housed at the University of Zimbabwe Farm (Harare,
Zimbabwe) between January 1998 and August 2003. Backfat thickness was measured at 50 and 75mm (K5 and K7.5),
respectively. Carcass length (CL) was measured from the anterior edge of the first rib to the pubic bone using a measuring tape.
Variance components were estimated using a model that accounted for direct, common environmental litter and maternal genetic
effects, using average information restricted maximum likelihood. Heritability estimates for average daily gain from birth to
weaning (ADGW) and average daily gain from weaning to 12 weeks (ADG1) were 0.15 and 0.27, respectively. Maternal genetic
effects accounted for 2.6% of variation for ADG1. Heritability for average daily gain from 12 weeks to slaughter (ADG2) was 0.20.
Common environmental litter effects accounted for 18% of phenotypic variance for cold dressed mass (CDM). Heritability
estimates for CDM and CL were 0.32 and 0.62, respectively. Maternal genetic effects accounted for 10.5% of variance in CL.
Heritability estimates for K5 and K7.5 were 0.64 and 0.40, respectively. The CDM was positively genetically correlated to K5, but
negative to K7.5. The K5 and K7.5 had a high genetic correlation (0.88). Genetic correlations between ADGW and K5, K7.5 and
CL were 0.30, 0.05 and 0.35, respectively. The existence of sufficient genetic variation makes genetic improvement for many
growth and carcass traits in the Mukota breed possible through effective selection methods

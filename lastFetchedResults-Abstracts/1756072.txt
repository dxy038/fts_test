Objective
ive behavior therapy (CBT) leads to a significant reduction in fatigue severity and impairment in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the effect of CBT for CFS on fatigue and impairment is mediated by a decrease in avoidance behavior and focusing on fatigue.
s
is purpose, we reanalyzed a randomized controlled trial which was previously conducted to test the efficacy of CBT for CFS. Two hundred nineteen patients completed assessment prior and subsequent to treatment or a control group period.
s
ion analysis revealed that a decrease in focusing on fatigue mediated the effect of CBT for CFS on fatigue and impairment. Avoidance of activity and avoidance of aversive stimuli were not significantly changed by treatment and were therefore excluded from mediation analysis.
sion
ease in the focus on fatigue seems to contribute to the treatment effect of CBT for CFS.

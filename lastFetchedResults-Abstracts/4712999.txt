This paper presents the results of a small-scale research project carried out in an English Higher Education institution which aimed to identify teachers´ understanding of ´accessible designs´ in relation to pedagogical situations where electronic resources play a significant role. Initial research suggests that, whilst programmes of learning tend to be ´constructively aligned´, ´accessibility´ will be designed into educational resources, with a focus on learners with specific needs, rather than creating truly ´inclusive´ learning opportunities. This is not a surprise since supporting learners with disabilities has become a socio-political issue, after having been essentially a medical one. Thus, guidance to teachers was found to be mainly targeted towards technical accessibility, with little support provided on ´inclusive ´pedagogy. The research advocates a paradigm shift in relation to the way accessibility is conceptualised. A simple model is proposed, which emphasises effective learning as the primary objective of any design algorithm. The needs of learners and the resources selected to support learning are important, but so are the teachers´ approaches when attempting to implement non-discriminatory practices; as well as their support needs, which are discussed in this paper, leading to a suggested educational framework for reframing teachers´ conceptions of accessible e- learning design.

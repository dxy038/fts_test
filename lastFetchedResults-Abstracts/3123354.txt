Quality evaluation becomes more and more important in Web service life cycle on service selection, real-time monitoring, management, accounting and other stages. And fuzzy theory has been applied to this field. In this paper, the algorithm of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is ameliorated on differentiating redundancy membership degree. It eliminates redundant data in membership degrees of index which are useless for objective classification. Then it realizes the conversion of membership degrees without redundant data. It can be used in the evaluation on the QoS of Web service.

In allusion to the diaphragm spring of a certain type of freight car, based on multi-objective genetic algorithm, the design variables are selected optimally with design of experiment, and a multi-objective optimization model of diaphragm spring is built. On the basis of multidisciplinary optimization software iSIGHT, non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) based on Pareto optimal theory is employed to seek the optimal construction design scheme with the targets of the minimum difference of the diaphragm-spring press force between new and old work conditions of friction disk, the minimum average value of diaphragm-spring press force during the course of friction disks wearing out and the minimum manipulation power, and the optimal solution set of the problem is gained.

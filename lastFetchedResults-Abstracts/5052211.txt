Electrocutions can occur in low and medium voltage systems, when a person comes in direct contact with a conductor at a high voltage or when there is a conductive contaminant which creates an electrically conductive path across an insulating member. Electrocutions can also be caused by an electrically conductive path from the top of a power pole to close proximity to ground where people and vehicles are present. This may be caused by an energized power line that breaks and falls towards the ground or may be due to a utility guy wire that makes accidental contact with the primary voltage conductors. The electrical industry has adopted various codes and standards in an attempt to improve and enhance equipment safety, and decrease the possibility of the occurrence of arcing faults and electrocutions due to guy wires. The NESC and other standards provide requirements for installation and safety of utility guy wires. Incidents of guy wire arcing faults and electrocutions that we have worked on were reviewed to determine the possible reasons for the guy wires creating a hazardous condition and the damaging effects of that hazard, the degree of destruction, and specifically identify the root cause of that particular incident. The objective of this paper is to review and investigate the hazard conditions created by guy wires, in low and medium voltage electrical systems and further to determine the effectiveness of existing safety measures and any additional safety measures that would possibly reduce the hazardous condition.

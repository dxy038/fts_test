The objective is to create new Rhizopus sp inoculum product in order to provide market need for Tempe industries. The benefit is to utilize the appropriate traditional biotechnology for the development of a high quality inoculum product. The methods used is research and development to create new products. Technology transfer to industry of traditional biotechnology on Rhizopus sp inoculum was done by using technoware (T), humanware (H), infoware (I), and organoware (O), respectively followed by a mathematical model equation as the following d(TCC)/TCC = &#946;<sub>t</sub> dT/T + &#946;<sub>H</sub> dH/H + B<sub>i</sub> dI/I + &#946;<sub>O</sub> dO/O and TCC = T(&#946;<sub>t</sub>) &#215; H(&#946;<sub>h</sub>) &#215; I(&#946;<sub>i</sub>) &#215; O(&#946;<sub>o</sub>) where TCC is technology contribution coefficient and &#946;<sub>t,</sub> &#946;<sub>H</sub>, &#946;<sub>i</sub>, &#946;<sub>o</sub> are coefficient for each component of techno metric. The results can be shown that the technology transfer to industry of traditional biotechnology can be done by using a mathematical model of technometric approaches. This Rhizopus sp inoculum product can be accepted by a particular market need in terms of socially desirable and economically justified for small and medium scale tempe industries in Indonesia.

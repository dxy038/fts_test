Hypertext is a widely used form of information presentation which has gained wide popularity in the last few years due to the ease with which information can be portrayed and accessed. However, the very flexibility of hypertext creates problems of user disorientation and cognitive overhead. Designers in the past have tried to combat these problems by providing users with a myriad of navigational tools, with the most widely employed tools being a map and an index. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the above mentioned navigational tools in alleviating the problems associated with using a hypertext system. For the purpose of this study, a hypertext package was developed using Hypercard on “Ancient Civilizations.” The experiment explored three variables: types of navigational tool available to the user (Map, Index and Combination of map and index); hypertext size (Small stack, Large stack) and trials (Before, After). The results of the study indicate significant differences in the use and effect of the navigational tools.

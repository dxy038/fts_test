Herein a multi-objective linear programming model to mitigate carbon emission through efficiency improvement for power plants is presented from a view of cost effectiveness. Regarding the alternative of mitigating carbon emissions, the model composes of factors relevant with the current identification of power plant in terms of technical alternatives, costs of capital and operation conditions, economic and their interactions. The model explores the techniques of multiple goals on the scheme for power generation to achieve the objective of cost minimization, while complying with the environmental regulation of aggregate emission control from a long-term perspective. The research results obtained herein provide utility planners with further insight into the systematic analysis and potentials for the cost effectiveness of mathematical applications for assessing carbon mitigation alternatives.

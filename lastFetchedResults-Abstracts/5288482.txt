The objective of this study is to determine and troubleshoot the problems of using handheld optical power meter and optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) for monitoring and troubleshooting a conventional passive optical network (PON) equipped with optical splitter/coupler that used to broadcast optical signals from one fiber to many fibers. This paper proposes an appreciate approach to overcome these testing challenges. In this enhancement, a commercially available OTDR is located at central office (CO) and a tapper circuit is designed to allow the OTDR testing signal to bypass the optical splitter/coupler in a conventional PON when emitted from CO towards customer sites for centralized monitoring in downstream direction. This provides a faster, simpler, and less complex way for installation testing, service activation testing, and network performance monitoring and in-service troubleshooting a PON.

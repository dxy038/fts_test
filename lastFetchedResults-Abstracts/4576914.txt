The objective of the paper is to study Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) produced by AC Power lines and its effect on communication/networking cables. Causes of EMI and techniques used for reduction of EMI are pointed out. The aim of the paper is to investigate and analyze the research works, standards, and studies on effect of AC Power line on UTP cable. UTP cable (CAT5e, CAT6) is the most popular copper based networking cable from the points of cost, installation and high speed data transmission. But the main disadvantage of UTP cable is that it is the mostly effected cable by EMI compared to other types of cables. Transmission of data through UTP cable cannot get rid of EMI effect from an AC power line if the separation gap between the two types of cable is not properly maintained during installation of UTP cabling.

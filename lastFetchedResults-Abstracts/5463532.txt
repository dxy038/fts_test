In order to reduce the time and cost of reconfiguration of manufacturing system, a new manufacturing resources organization model based virtual manufacturing cell (VMC) is introduced, So that the procedure of part task distribution and scheduling is simplified and the quality of the scheduling is improved. Then, the procedure of VMC formation is divided into two phases: resource selection and resource cluster. Finally, to solve the resource selection problem, a multi-objective cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (MOCCEA) is employed and a multi-objective optimization problem model is constructed, An instance has shown that the algorithm possessed good prospects of application in resource selection for VMC formation.

De Bruijn graphs are considered as a class of logical and physical topologies for multi-hop WDM networks. They are suitable to connect a large number of nodes, using simple addressing and routing techniques. In addition, bidirectional de Bruijn graphs take advantage of the availability of bidirectional links to improve the overall network performance. Here, three algorithms of different complexity are applied as routing techniques in bidirectional de Bruijn graphs, and then compared in terms of number of hops, queueing delay and throughput

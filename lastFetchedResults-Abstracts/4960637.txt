Technology evolution have made possible to connect all kind of devices to IP network. This becomes an evident objective for sensors networks research. The IETF 6LoWPAN RFC proposal was developed in that sense to use the benefit of IPV6 over wirelessly connected sensors (WSN). The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer stack being popular in the domain of wireless sensors within constrained resources, a few 6LoWPAN adaptations already exist. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using IPv6 for sensor networks connected through powerline communication (PLC) non-wireless mediums and demonstrate possible interoperability. This document propose the first adaptation of the IEEE 802.15.4 commons standard on PLC medium. Following this standard interface, we demonstrate the possibility to carry out data on PLC with great reliability, and low power energy requirement using our WPC&#8482; physical layer (called Watt Pulse Communication (WPC)). This allows to benefit from the development of WSN research for PLC communication networks. Moreover, such a IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN communication stack provides a generic communication standard for heterogeneous sensors networks. Thus, we finally demonstrate interoperability with tests between powerline and wireless sensor networks running IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN stacks.

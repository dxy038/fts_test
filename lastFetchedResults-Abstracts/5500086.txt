The objective of the paper is to propose a measurement model for trustworthiness of a document to ensure information security. The definition of trustworthiness in this context refers to the reliability value of the information in the document. the document here refers to an article or a web document. The proposed model relates to an approach for assessing trust of data for use of the information consumer. The model helps to capture multiple factors couple with risk profiles in the determination of the trustworthiness of content. It allows consideration of level of confidence and aggregation of attitude towards risk for normalization of a trust index. We use a fuzzy representation to allow the information consumer to decide their confidence level towards the importance of each criterion. the model enables an automated computation method for a straight forward computation for a unique and personalized trustworthiness. The paper also presents an implementation example for practicality of the proposed model.

we need to design to optimal cropping pattern as respects to important and preemptive goals of managers. Therefore it is important that we can choose through different models. This model could be get multiple objective of managers (howbeit these objectives are conflict) and managers conduct to optimal goals. The goal programming model is a suitable and flexible model among different other planning models for these objectives. In this paper we are using goal programming model for designing optimum cropping pattern in the Dasht-E-Naz Sari. We applied 3 structures preemptive of goals basely important of goals and for choose best structure, we using Euclidean Distance Function for optimum cropping pattern. Results show that in area of Dasht-E-Naz Sari exist potential of resources that could be improving reach to goals of agricultural sector managers, as optimum cropping pattern for exist products including wheat, rice, seed corn, forage corn, grain corn, canola, spring soybean, summer soybean we can increase gross margin about 336100 rials for one hectare.

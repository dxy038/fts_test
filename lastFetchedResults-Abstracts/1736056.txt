This study focuses on the determination of iodine content in healthy thyroid samples on male population from Caracas, Venezuela. Contribution to establish a baseline of iodine content in thyroid glands and hence to compare the iodine thyroid concentration of the Venezuelan population with other countries is also our objective. Male post-mortem individual samples were analyzed using a spectrophotometric flow injection method, based on the Sandell–Kolthoff reaction. The median intrathyroidal iodine concentration was 1443±677 μg/g (wet weight), ranging from 419 to 3430 μg/g, which corresponds to a median of total iodine content of 15±8 mg (ranging from 4 to 37). These results were higher than those values reported in the literature. No correlation of iodine content with age or weight of the healthy gland was found.

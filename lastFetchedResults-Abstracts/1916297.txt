BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL=Acule Lymphoblastic Leukemia) is the most common type of hematological malignancies in Iranian children. Pterostilbene (PT) is a natural stilbenoid in blueberries. Since the effect of PT on lymphoblastic leukemia cell line has not been investigated, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of PT on apoptosis induction and cellular proliferation inhibition on this cell line. 
METHODS: In this experimental study, Jurkat cell line was cultured in standard conditions with different concentrations of PT (0, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 and 100 µm) for 24, 48 and 72 hours and compared with the cell of control group. Then, the effect of PT on cell viability and induction of apoptosis was measured using MTS assay and Annexin V-FITC kit. 
FINDINGS: Inhibition of cellular proliferation was 44%, 47% and 57% at 60 µm concentration and 71%, 78% and 89% at 100 µm concentration after 24, 48 and 72 hours of PT incubation, respectively (p < 0.05). Cell apoptosis was 60% at 80 µm, 50% at 60 µm and 27% at 40 µm compared to 4.63% in control. There was significant difference at 80 µm concentration. 
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the PT was effective on the proliferation inhibition and induction of apoptosis in Jurkat lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. The study of the mechanism of apoptosis induction by using this combination can be a progressive step into target therapy.

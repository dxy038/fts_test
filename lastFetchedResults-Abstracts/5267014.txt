The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effects of different types of parking availability information on system performance using a simulation model. The model consists of three sub-models; demand, performance and information service models. The model is designed to describe the dynamic interaction between demand and system performance and it is possible to examine the time to time fluctuation of driver´s parking choice decisions and resulting congestion in car parks. The model can distinguish the difference of a driver´s parking choice behavior between with and without availability information, and compare the effects of the different types of availability information. Numerical examples are calculated and it is found that the difference of effects among information types depends on the congestion level of the system

The objective of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of N-tap and D-tap cyclically shifted filter banks (CSFB) adaptive schemes for interference suppression in an asynchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) system employing Gold code signature sequences. The LMS and NLMS algorithms are employed for the adaptation of tap coefficients. In addition, post convergence error probability and signal to distortion ratio are computed in order to make a comparison between the performance of N-tap structure and D-tap CSFB structure

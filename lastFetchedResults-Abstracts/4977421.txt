SiC (silicon carbide) is a material with outstanding properties for power semiconductor application. Beside research activities including different power semiconductor switch types, unipolar JFET devices for blocking voltage of more than 1200 V are applicable as samples promising switching loss reduction above all. In this paper the switching behaviour of these SiC-JFETs is compared to this of a similar conventional Si-IGBT regarding the conditions of the bidirectional matrix converter switch topology. Statements concerning the on-state losses is also discussed focusing the necessary reverse conducting capability of the JFET devices in the matrix converter switch topology

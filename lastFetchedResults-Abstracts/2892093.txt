This article studies the influence of PMUÂ´s accuracy in voltage stability assessment, considering the specific case of The&#769;venin equivalent based methods that include wide-area information in its calculations. The objective was achieved by producing a set of synthesized PMU measurements from a time domain simulation and using the Monte Carlo method to reflect the accuracy for the PMUs. This is given by the maximum value for the Total Vector Error defined in the IEEE standard C37.118. Those measurements allowed to estimate the distribution parameters (mean and standard deviation) of the studied voltage stability indices and grid transformation coefficients which have applications in voltage stability assessment. The obtained distributions have a direct impact in the number of samples needed for estimating system parameters and compromise between time-scale and uncertainty in those estimations is shown.

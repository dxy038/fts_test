Using a cross-correlation frequency-resolved optical gating apparatus, the phases and amplitudes of ultrabroad-band optical pulses from a taper fiber have been measured for various input pulse peak powers. The measured waveforms have been compared with calculated waveforms using a finite-difference in the frequency domain method, in which no envelope approximations were used and the variation of the taper shape was taken into account. Excellent agreement between the measured and the calculated waveforms was obtained when the additional dispersion of a normal fiber and an objective was considered.

Statement of Problem: Because dental restorations are time consuming, dental material manufacturers make an attempt to discover new methods for rapidity and increasing the quality of restorations. With this objective in mind,  plasma arc curing devices have been manufactured.  
Purpose: This study was done to compare the effect of plasma arc and halogen light curing on the microleakage of class V resin composite. 
Methods and Material: In this experimental study, on 80 extracted maxillary central teeth, standard class V cavities were prepared with incisal and gingival margins in the enamel and dentin. After etching and bonding, the teeth were randomly divided into two subgroups of 40 and restored with Amelogen composite. In the first group, halogen light curing for 40 seconds was used and in the second one plasma arc curing was used for four seconds. After thermocycling and sealing, the samples were immersed into the 0.5% fuchsine solution for 24 hours and then washed with water and cut.  The microleakage was scored by stereomicroscope with 40X magnification. The data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests.
Results: The mean of incisal wall microleakage in the plasma arc group was 1.42±0.98 and in the halogen group it was 0.67±0.02. The gingival margin in the plasma are group showed a mean of 1.75±1.48 and in the halogen group it was found to be 1.67±1.54. There were significant differences in the incisal wall ( p =0.0001), but not in the gingival wall (p =0.744). The average rate of microleakage in the gingival and incisal walls in the plasma arc group was 3.17±1.79 and in the halogen group it was 2.76±1.92; there were not any significant differences between the groups ( p =0.32).
Conclusion: In the restorations with enamel margins halogen light curing and in all composite restorations plasma arc curing are preferred due to the short time of curing.

The present paper tries to substantiate the claim that users of EFL (English as a Foreign Language) will gain considerable language awareness, in terms of both semantics and grammar, while checking on the accuracy of their edited texts, if an integrated software material - which we intend to develop - is used. The following set of concrete proposals for developing such a software for the active study of EFL is based on our previous researches on error-analysis. The main objective of the paper is to find the experts in the field of software making who are willing and able to make the actual software for the use of the language database described.

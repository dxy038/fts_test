In this paper, we propose a multi-focus image fusion approach based on Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and extended the Spatial Frequency Measurements (SFM). Our proposed approach, two fused images are firstly decomposed into four subbands, which are one approximation subband (LL) and three details subbands (HL, LH and HH). Next, each subband is partitioned into blocks and each block is identified the clearer regions by computing the focus measure using the extended spatial frequency measurement (SFM). Finally, the recovered fused image is reconstructed by performing the inverse stationary wavelet transform. From the experimental results, we found that the proposed method outperforms the traditional wavelet transform and SFM based methods in terms of objective and subjective assessments.

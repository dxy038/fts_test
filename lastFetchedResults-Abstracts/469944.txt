Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare success rates of 643 patients who had ectopic pregnancy from the same database who were treated with multidose or single-dose methotrexate protocols.
Study design
We compared demographics, gestational age, serum human chorionic gonadotropin, progesterone levels, ectopic sac size and volume, overall ectopic mass size and volume, ectopic cardiac activity, history of ectopic pregnancy, number of treatment days, methotrexate doses, and outcome in consecutive patients with ectopic pregnancy who were treated with methotrexate.
Results
Success rates were comparable between patients with multidose and single-dose therapy (95% vs 90%, respectively) as were human chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone levels, history of ectopic pregnancy (21.4% vs 21.7%, respectively), number of treatment days, gestational age, ectopic size, ectopic volume, and ectopic mass volume. Patients who received single-dose therapy were significantly heavier (146 vs 159 pounds), had greater ectopic cardiac activity (3.1% vs 10.3%), and received fewer methotrexate doses.
Conclusion
This study suggests single-dose methotrexate therapy is as effective as multidose methotrexate therapy for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy.

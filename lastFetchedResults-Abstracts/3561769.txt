In this paper, a novel four-level inverter will be presented and analyzed. The proposed inverter topology, which is composed of a conventional two-level and a three-level neutral-point clamped (NPC) inverter, is suitable for high-voltage and high-power applications. The proposed inverter, when it is compared with the conventional four-level NPC pulsewidth modulation inverter, exhibits the following advantages: a) ability of changing the power losses distribution profile among the devices by selecting a suitable switching strategy; b) reduction of total inverter power semiconductor device losses; c) ability of bidirectional operation for all power semiconductor switches; and d) easy implementation using existing power semiconductor modules. The effect of conduction and switching losses profiles of the proposed inverter for different switching strategies is examined under different loads, power factors, and modulation indices. The dc-link capacitors voltages are effectively balanced via a proposed self-voltage balancing topology, without the need of isolated dc voltage sources or additional voltage stabilizing circuits. Finally, the theoretical results are confirmed by simulation and experimental results

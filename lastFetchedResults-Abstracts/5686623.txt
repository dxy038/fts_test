The partner selection problem with a due date constraint in virtual enterprises is proved to be NPcompleteness problem. So it cannot have any polynomial time solution algorithm at present. Nonlinear integer programming model for the problem is established. The objective function and constraint function of the model have monotonicity properties. Based on the above observations, a Branch-and-Bound algorithm is constructed to solve the problem. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm is effective.

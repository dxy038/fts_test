We present in this paper an e-banking platform used as a collaboration tool between more than 15 industrial companies, a school of engineering and different research laboratories. The main objective of this collaboration is to prepare the new e-banking protocols that will take place into the SEPA program (Single Euro Payments Area). This program has for objective to harmonize bank payment systems in Europe. It began to take effect in January 2008 and will continue through 2010. Many engineers have to be trained, lots of tests have to be realized from end to end in the e-banking chain with new protocols and recent research developments have to be integrated. Some quantitative results show the interest of this platform for all the partners.

Objective: To develop a HPLC method for determining the contents of schisantherin and deoxyschizandrin in the dispersible tablets of Fructus Schisandrae Sphenanthera. Methods: The samples were extracted with methanol through supersonic wave and determined by HPLC on Hypersil ODS column (250mm &#215; 4.6mm, 5&#956;m) using methanol-water (73:27, V/V) as a mobile phase. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min and the detection wavelength was set at 254nm. Results: The calibration curve was within the range of 0.124&#956;g~1.24&#956;g (r=0.9999) for schisantherin and 0.124-1.24&#956;g(r=0.9999) for deoxyschizandrin respectively. The recoveries (n=5) of schisantherin and deoxyschizandrin were 102.05% and 101.05%, respectively. Conclusion: The method was accurate, quick, easy and can be used for determination of schisantherin and deoxyschizandrin in dispersible tablets of Fructus Schisandrae Sphenanthera.

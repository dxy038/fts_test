Urban terrain poses a challenge for modeling air pollutant diffusion. In tropics, because of
the dominant low wind speed environment, the importance of understanding the turbulence diffusion is
even more critical, and uncertain. The objective of this study is to estimate the vertical eddy diffusivity of
an urban, tropical atmosphere in low–wind speeds. Turbulence measurements at 1 Hz were made at 4-m
level over an urban terrain with a roughness length of 0.78 m during winter months. Eddy diffusivity is
estimated from spectral quantities of the turbulence data involving turbulent kinetic energy (E) and its
dissipation rate (e). The spectral information of the vertical velocity fluctuations is used to estimate the
vertical length scale which provides information on the eddy diffusivity. In addition, the product of friction
velocity and the vertical length scale has been used to non-dimensionalize the eddy diffusivity, which is
shown to increase with increasing instability. Using the eddy diffusivity (K) estimates from the E – e
approach, a relation is suggested for the mixing length based eddy diffusivity models of the form: K =
cw.[2.5 ) 0.5(z/L)], where z is the measurement height, L is the Obukhov length, and cw has an average
value close to 1 for unstable and near 0.5 for stable conditions for the urban terrains.

Objective
Based on the hypothesis that the origin of nystagmus is from the posterior canal (PC), the nystagmus in the head hanging and sitting position should be mirror images. To clarify the anatomical origin of positioning nystagmus in BPPV patients, we analyzed the positioning nystagmus of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) patients three-dimensionally.
Methods
Twenty-six patients with BPPV participated in this study. The positioning nystagmus was recorded in complete darkness from the patient's left eye by means of an infrared CCD camera. We performed three-dimensional analysis of nystagmus using video image analysis system (VIAS). Subsequently, the rotation axis of the 3D eye movements of the positioning nystagmus was calculated.
Results
Among the 26 patients tested, 20 patients demonstrated the axes of nystagmus in good or relatively good alignment to the PC axis. However, in 11 of these 20 patients there was poor alignment of the axis of nystagmus in the sitting position to the PC axis. In addition, six patients showed axes of nystagmus with poor alignment to the PC in the head hanging position. Among them, two patients exhibited axes of nystagmus in good alignment with the anterior canal, in spite of diagnosis of these patients as PC BPPV by experienced examiner based on the positioning nystagmus test.
Conclusion
These results demonstrated that only one-third of patients who were diagnosed as BPPV, could be diagnosed as true BPPV which originates from a PC pathology. Besides the possibility that the pathology may originate from the AC, it is still unclear which part of the inner ear may be the candidate site of origin of the pathology of BPPV in the other 15 patients.

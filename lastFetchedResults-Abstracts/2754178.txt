A 10 Gbps/ch full-duplex (simultaneous bidirectional) optical link utilizing two optical subassembly (OSA) transceiver (TRx) modules and two wavelengths, 850 and 1060 nm, for sending and receiving optical signals through a single fiber channel in a fiber array is demonstrated. Each of the OSA TRx modules consists of transmitter/receiver chips, optical fibers embedded in a V-grooved silicon substrate, two 45 &#176; mirrors formed in fibers, and three silicon optical benches for mounting vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, photodiodes (PDs), and monitoring PDs. Mirror-1 in the fiber is coated with a wavelength-filtering layer to reflect transmitted light and pass through received light. Mirror-2 deflects received light to the PD. Two OSA TRx modules were applied in an end-to-end quad small form-factor pluggable optical link for 40-Gbps operation. This optical link showed good performance with clear eye-diagrams and a BER of at &lt;;10<sup>-12</sup> Gbps/ch with -8-dBm input power.

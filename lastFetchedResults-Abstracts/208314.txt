Background and Objective: The curative properties of garlic in medicine have been known for a long time. However,
it was only in the last three decades when garlic properties were seriously investigated confirming its potential as
therapeutic medicine. The aim of this study was to measure the MIC of aqueous and methanolie extracts of garlic and to
compare them with ketoconazole as positive control.
Materials and Metbods: In this laboratory study, the fresh smelly bulb of garlic was cleaned, skined, dryed aod
powdered. Garlic powder was solved in 80% methanol and distilled water. This yellow solution remained in the lab for
4 days. After that the stimmed, filtered and concentrated solution was kept remained inside the pipet in oven for 48h in
50'C to make dry extract. Then methanol and aqueous dilutions (0.625 mg/mJ, 1.25 mg/ml 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml,
10mg/ml and 20 mg/ml) were prepared separately from 200mg powder of the concentrated extracts of garlic. Three
strains of dermatophytes were cultured on the media which contained different dilutions.
Results: This experimental study showed that the rate of the effect of the aqueous extracts of garlic on Sporothrix
schenckii in the minimum dilution (0.625mg/ml) was 8% and in the maximum dilution (20mg/ml) was 100%. This rate
in methanol extract on the same fungus was 25% and 100% in lOmglml dilution, respectively. The amounts of the
effects of extracts on Candida albicans were 17% in the minimum dilution and 100% in 10% dilution. The effect of this
plant on Cryptococcus neoformans was more than our expectation, because the amount of MIC in all dilutions was
close to its minimum dilution (0.625mg/ml).
Conclusion: As the effects of the garlic extracts were the same or even more than ketoconazole, and also regarding the
side effects of the synthetic drugs, the use of herbs as useful drugs are neeessary.

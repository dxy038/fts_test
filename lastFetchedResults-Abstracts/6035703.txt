The concept of a simulated response surface is presented as an aid to motor dynamical parameter optimization in high performance brushless motor drive (BLMD) identification with a multiminima objective function. This methodology provides useful information concerning the formulation and nature of the most suitable objective function to be minimized, based on actual drive experimental test data available and BLMD model simulation, coupled with an effective system identification (SI) strategy for accurate motor parameter extraction. This simple approach, although computationally intensive, can also be used as an alternative means of providing the optimal set of parameter estimates from inspection of the global minimum location on the simulated cost surface with embedded local minima. Furthermore it can be used as a basis for comparison of the effectiveness of other identification search strategies deployed in terms of the accuracy of returned parameter estimates. The problem of inertia J and friction B parameter extraction of an actual BLMD system over a sinc-shaped (sin x/x) multiminima cost surface, based on step response feedback current (FC) target data which has a constant amplitude swept frequency characteristic, is investigated as a test case using response surface simulation

This paper deals with disturbance decoupling by measurement feedback. The objective is not to find an exact algebraic solution to this problem but to minimize a norm of the transfer matrix between the disturbance and the regulated variables. The method consists in assigning eigenvalues in a first step and to use the freedom on the corresponding eigenvectors to minimize the norm in the second step. Constraints on the magnitude of inputs are taken into account. Our approach is tested on a gust alleviation problem.

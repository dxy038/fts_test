This paper proposes a non-linear state-space dynamic model for planar proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Our objective is the realization of a model that evokes a more realistic approach of dynamic behavior of the fuel cell by considering most of elements that influence the system evolution. For instance, pressure, temperature and humidification rate effects on the cell resistance are taken into account. The model is based on both thermodynamic and electrical aspects, proposing a realistic equivalent circuit which integrates most of the fuel cell components. Simulation results show that our proposed model is in agreement with fuel cell real operating principles.

Objective To investigate the effect of local applied Zoledronate Acid on bone healing of Bio-oss bone graft and osseointegration of dental implants in osteoporotic rats. Methods Forty female rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham operated group (A), ovariectomized group (B) and zoledronate-treated group (C). Twelve weeks after ovariectomy surgery, hyroxyapatite coated titanium implants were inserted into rat tibiae and bone defects were made near the implants with simultaneous transplant of Bio-oss particles. The materials used in group C were Zoledronate acid immobilized implants and Bio-oss particles. Animals were killed at 4 and 12 weeks after implant surgery and underwent histological and histomorphometrical examinations. Results At both 4 and 12 week after implant surgery, all bone indices were all significantly decreased in group B when compared with group A; while most of bone indices in group C were significantly higher than those of group A. Conclusion Experimental osteoporosis can impede bone healing of Bio-oss bone grafts and decrease osseointegration of implants in bone grafts, while local application of Zoledronate Acid may resist the negative influence.

Objective: To see the presentations of patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricle cardiomyopathy (ARVC).Material and Methods: The study was conducted in the Department of Cardiology Postgraduate Medical Institute, Hayatabad Medical Complex from Jan 2003 to Dec 2004. Patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of ARVC were included. Twelve channels ECG. 24 hours ECG monitoring, transthoracic echo and signal average ECG (SAECG) were done for all patients.Results: Sixty-two patients presenting with LBBB type of broad complex tachycardia were studied. Only twelve patients could fulfill the diagnostic criteria of ARVC. Mean age at presentation was 34Â± 8 years. Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) of LBBB type with inferior axis was the commonest presentation. T-wave inversion in surface ECG was seen in right precordial leads in all the patients. SAECG was abnormal in only one patient. Epsilon waves in right precordial leads were seen in one patient. Transthoracic echo revealed RV dilatation in 11 of the 12 cases. VT was responsive to amiodarone in all the cases.Conclusion: ARVC commonly presents with ventricular arrhythmia of LBBB type and 12 leads resting ECG is abnormal in almost all cases. RV is mostly dilated and response to amiodarone is good.

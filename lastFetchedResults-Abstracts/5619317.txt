In this text we took An Shan Iron &amp; Steel Company Dagushan mining plant magnetic separation workshop as object of study and established energy consumption optimization model. On the ground of magnetic separation workshop water consumption and electricity consumption forecast model, we established magnetic separation workshop energy consumption system optimization model based on the multi-objective genetic algorithm. Given concentrate ore production, concentrate ore grade, coarse ore processing quantity, coarse ore grade, by this optimized model we may obtain some optimized production parameters such as the workshop circulating water amount used, ball mill effective work rate and so on, which takes the workshop water consumption and the electricity consumption as the optimized goal and provides the energy consumption optimization strategy for the enterprise. Because the genetic algorithm has the stronger search ability, the auto-adapted ability and robustness, this optimized method is simple, has high accuracy and strong study function compared with the traditional method.

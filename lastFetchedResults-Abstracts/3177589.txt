Improving the efficiency of oil field development is an important strategic objective of all oil fields. Development units are the basic units of production and operation of oil field, and their development efficiencies directly determine the efficiency of the whole oil field development. This paper establishes a scientific and applicable efficiency evaluation indexes system of oil field development unit, and based on the indexes system, it establishes DEA evaluation models including CCR model and super efficiency model, which provide effective means for the efficiency management of development units. An empirical analysis proves that the evaluation models are effective and applicable.

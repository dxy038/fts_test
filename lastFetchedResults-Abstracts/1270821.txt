The clay matrix of a soil has a number of characteristics. Many of them are structural features and shrinkageâ€“swelling phenomena including cracking. Hydraulic properties are determined by the geometry of the crack network and pore structure of the clay matrix. The objective of the work is to develop a simple quantitative model of the pore structure and the shrinkage curve of clay matrix through parameters of matrix microstructure. We assume that clay particles (or quasicrystals) form a microstructural network comprising pores of different dimensions, and propose a probabilistic description of such a structure. The model predictions are in quite satisfactory agreement with published experimental data on the pore distribution, microparameters and shrinkage curves of soil clay matrices.

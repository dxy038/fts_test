Exergy is a way to sustainable development and may be defined as the maximum theoretical useful work, while exergy analysis identifies the sources, the magnitude and the causes of thermodynamic inefficiencies within each system component. By using the ANN, exergy results can be obtained easily including closer results. The results were solved by CogeNNexT code developed by authors and fast ANN (FANN) Library is implemented to this C++ code. The main objective of the present study is namely (i) to apply the ANN method to exergy analysis of thermodynamic systems by presenting the performance of the ANN method and (ii) to emphasize the definition of ANN inputs. It may be concluded that most of thermodynamic systems can be trained and analyzed by using the ANN method. It is expected that this study would be very beneficial to those dealing with the intelligent systems of the future.

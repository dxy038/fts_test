The quality evaluation of software products, e.g., defect measuring and identification approaches of individual versions, gains importance with higher use of software applications. Process metrics are considered as the main predictor of defect prediction and software maintenance in numerous empirical studies for the software product. In addition to that, there are few models, consider process metrics as an indicator of software quality too. The prime objective of this paper is to design of process metrics framework for Aspect Oriented Software. This framework can be extended for defect prediction and quality evaluation of aspect oriented software.

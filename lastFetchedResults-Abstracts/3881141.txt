This paper presents a new topology optimization technique for electromagnetic problems. Mutual energy terms are defined in the electromagnetic system, and the objective function that represents the design objective is expressed in terms of mutual energy. The design sensitivity is calculated from the first variation of mutual energy and the density method is used to optimize the material property distribution in the design region using the obtained sensitivity. The proposed algorithm is applied to a numerical example of transformer core topology optimization and verified

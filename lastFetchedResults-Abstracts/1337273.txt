Housing conditions do not frequently meet the natural needs of horses. German and Swiss studies have shown that merely 16% of horses are kept in group housing systems, but even these vary greatly with different effects on horses’ behavior. The objective of the survey was to determine whether horses show increased activity in barns with various options for movements and functional elements. Free movement stables allow horses to live within a herd, to decide whether to be outside or inside the herd, and to enable them fresh air supply. Data from 25 horses kept in three different open barns (O1–O3) were compared with that from two active barns with functional elements (active barn 1 and active barn 2), for example, automatic feeder, with five horses each. Activity-Lying-Temperature-pedometers fastened to a rear leg of each horse were used to measure activity. Animal data were recorded throughout a test period of 10 days per barn. The results showed a median of 46 to 68 mean daily activity impulses per 10 minutes for horses in stables O1 to O3. In stables active barn 1 to active barn 2, this measure was exceeded considerably with medians of 77 and 151. The activity impulses in the stable systems were significantly different at an error level of α = 0.05. These results support previous studies and show that activity of horses depends on their opportunities for moving. The sectioning of a stable, placement of functional elements, and feeding frequency have considerable effects on the activity level of the horse. It is useful to integrate different functional areas in a group housing system.

Objective
The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with urinary incontinence severity at baseline in women undergoing surgery for stress incontinence.
Study design
Baseline data were obtained from 650 women (age 28 to 81 years) with stress incontinence participating in a randomized surgical trial. Severity of incontinence was defined by the mean number of incontinence episodes per day recorded in a 3-day bladder diary. The relationships between severity and several baseline variables were examined, including demographics, medical, obstetric, and gynecologic history, body mass index, smoking status, Q-tip displacement, and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification stage (POP-Q).
Results
In a multivariable model, severity of incontinence was positively associated with body mass index (P = .0003) and current smoking (P = .01), and negatively associated with prolapse stage (P< .0001) and Q-tip displacement (P = .042).
Conclusion
Incontinence severity in a surgical population was independently associated with 2 modifiable factors, obesity and tobacco use, as well as pelvic support.

Renewable resources in the field of fibre-reinforced polymeric materials with their
new range of applications represent an important basis in order to fulfil the ecological
objective of creat ing eco-friendly materials . Because of their low density,
renewable origin, relatively high specific strength, light weight, unlimited availability, low
price, resistance to corrosion and abrasion, ease of processing, good mechan ical performance
and problem-free disposal , natural fibres offer a real alternative to the technical
reinforcing fibres presently available. Keeping in mind these immense advantages
of natural fibres, in the present communication a study on the fabrication of Hibiscus
Sabdariffa (HS) fibre reinforced urea-formaldehyde matrix based polymer composites
has been reported. Urea-formaldehyde resin matrix was prepared by the technique
developed in our laboratory. Urea-formaldehyde matrix was reinforced with Hibiscus
Sabdariffa fibres to prepare natural fibre reinforced composites. These polymer composites
were subsequently subjected to evaluation of their mechanical, morphological
(SEM) , and thermal (TGAlOTAlOTG) properties. Present work reveals that mechanical
propert ies such as: tensile strength , compressive strength, flexural strength, and wear
resistance, etc. of the composite increase with increase in fibre loading up to 30% loading
and beyond this loading these properties decrease. In case of morphological (SEM)
behaviour, morphological results clearly show that when polymer resin matrix is reinforced
with the different loadings of fibre, morphological change takes place depending
on loading of the fibre. In case of thermal behaviour, results indicate that the presence
of cellulose fibres affects the thermal stability of polymer matrix. The lOT and FOT values
for composite have been found in between those of matrix and the fibre which indicate
that the composite is thermally slightly less stable as compared to resin matrix .

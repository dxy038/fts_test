Salmonelllosis is one of the most common food borne and waterborne diseases that usually do not warrant antimicrobial therapy but systemic infections require effective chemotherapy. The emergence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella strains is of great concern world wide. The objective of our study was to determine the Salmonella contamination of irrigation water, the serotypes and the antimicrobial resistance pattern. A total of 200 water samples from 5 different sources of wells, pots, ponds, canales and rivers (n=40) were collected. The isolation and biochemical identification of the organisms were performed by common microbiological methods and the isolates were serotyped by using somatic and fellagelar antigens. The antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by using the agar dilution method. The results showed that salmonella prevalence was 18%. The Ponds were the most (44.4%) and the wells were the least (2.7%) polluted sources (P<0.05). The most resistance was to Erythromycin, Tetracycline, Nalidixic acid and the least was to Cefepime, Cephoxitin, Amoxicillin (p<0.01). The isolates were belonging to 13 different serotypes.

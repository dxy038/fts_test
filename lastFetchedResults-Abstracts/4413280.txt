Objective: Establish three dimensional solid model of thorax of pectus excavatum with scoliosis, carry out numerical simulation of minimally invasive correction surgery of pectus excavatum with scoliosis, study the influence how pectus excavatum correction affect scoliosis, and conduct clinical correction surgery. Methods: Reconstructed the model of thorax of pectus excavatum with scoliosis by CT images with software Mimics, simulate minimally invasive correction process by considering geometrical non-linear finit element method, design correction surgery plan, and carry out correction surgery according to the result of numerical calculation. Result: The result of calculation indicates that if the spine twisted toward the direction of the location of pectus excavatum, the scoliosis will be improved, the symptom of which will be ease. The surgery plan designed by the result of numerical calculation has been adapted to clinical surgery, and a good result has been obtained.

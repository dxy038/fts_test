Reconstructing the evolutionary history of all species is an essential objective for evolutionary biologists. Much effort has been devoted to ancestral genome reconstruction. Numbered genome sequencing of current and extinct organisms enables evolutionary biologists to compare genomic data and reconstruct ancestral genomes. Long-term conservation of karyotype, gene order or gene sequence are clues to the heritage of each species and these data can be used by evolutionary biologists to synthesize distant ancestral genomes. In this review, we referred to the recent advances in ancestral genomes reconstruction and the insight it gives on genome evolution. Special attention is devoted to the use of this knowledge to understand the evolution of the immune system genes.

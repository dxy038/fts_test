In multiobjective programming, the concept of equitable efficiency strengthens the concept of Pareto efficiency by additionally requiring that the objective functions be anonymous and satisfy the principle of transfers. The preference relation satisfying these assumptions is not related to a cone as is the Pareto preference. A complete preference structure of equitability is derived and an approach to generating equitably efficient solutions is proposed.

This study addresses the thermo-economic assessment of a mid-scale (20 MWth,wood) wood gasification, gas cleaning and energy conversion process, with particular attention given to electricity generation costs and tar control. Product distributions were estimated with a parametric stoichiometric equilibrium model calibrated using atmospheric air gasification data. A multi-objective optimisation problem was defined for a superstructure of alternative energy flow diagrams for each processing step. The trade-off between total investment costs and the exergy efficiency of electricity production was obtained, and analysed to identify operating conditions that minimise tar formation to prevent equipment fouling. The use of air, oxygen or steam fluidised bed gasifiers, closed coupled to an internal combustion engine combined cycle (ICE-CC) requiring cold gas cleaning, or gas turbine combined cycle (GT-CC) requiring hot gas cleaning have been considered. The operating conditions that maximise ICE-CC efficiency with cold gas cleaning (low pressure and high temperatures) also favour minimal tar formation. For GT-CC tar concentrations are higher, but this should not be of concern provided that hot gas cleaning can effectively prevent tar condensation. The trade-off appears to be optimal for steam gasification, with minimal specific costs of 2.1 €/We for GT-CC, and 2.7 €/We for ICE-CC. However, further calibration of the reaction model is still needed to properly assess product formation for other oxidants than air, and to properly take account of the impact of pressure on product distributions. For air gasification, the minimal specific cost of GT-CC is 2.5 €/We, and that of ICE-CC 3.1 €/We.

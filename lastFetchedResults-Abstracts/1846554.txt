The objective of this study was to determine whether T1-weighted sagittal images alone are adequate in the diagnosis of vertebral metastasis, epidural metastasis, and malignant spinal cord compression. Ninety-four complete magnetic resonance (MR) studies of the spinal column (a complete study consisting of T1-weighted sagittal images, T2-weighted sagittal images, and T1- and/or T2-weighted axial images) and 94 T1-weighted sagittal images alone (a subset of the complete studies) from 57 consecutive cancer patients over the last 2 years with clinically suspected cord compression were blindly and independently evaluated by four radiologists. The complete MR studies were used as the standard. Overall, the sensitivity of T1-weighted sagittal images alone to vertebral metastasis (87%) was statistically greater than cord compression (70%) (p = 0.05), and statistically greater than epidural metastasis (46%) (p ≤ 0.02). The specificity for cord compression (97%) was greater than the specificity for epidural metastasis (89%) (p = 0.03), and greater than the specificity for vertebral metastasis (83%) (p ≤ 0.02). There was a strong trend for better detection of cord compression overall and better detection of vertebral metastasis in the cervical spine by the most experienced radiologist. Complete studies of the spine are necessary in the diagnosis of vertebral metastasis, epidural metastasis, and cord compression, particularly with less experienced radiologists.

There is strong evidence in literature supporting the benefit of monitoring plasma concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics in the critically ill to ensure appropriateness of dosing. The objective of this work was to develop a method for the simultaneous determination of total concentrations piperacillin, benzylpenicillin, flucloxacillin, meropenem, ertapenem, cephazolin and ceftazidime in human plasma. Sample preparation involved protein precipitation with acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and subsequent dilution of supernatant with 0.1% formic acid in water. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a reversed phase column (C18, 2.6 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm) via gradient elution using water and acetonitrile, each containing 0.1% formic acid, as mobile phase. Tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS) analysis was performed, after electrospray ionization in the positive mode, with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The method is accurate with the inter-day and intra-day accuracies of quality control samples (QCs) ranging from 95 to 107% and 95 to 108%, respectively. It is also precise with intra-day and inter-day coefficient of variations ranging from 4 to 12% and 5 to 14%, respectively. The lower limit of quantification was 0.1 μg/mL for each antibiotic except flucloxacillin (0.25 μg/mL). Recovery was greater than 96% for all analytes except for ertapenem (78%). Coefficients of variation for the matrix effect were less than 10% over the six batches of plasma. Analytes were stable over three freeze-thaw cycles, and for reasonable hours on the bench top as well as post-preparation. This novel liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method proved accurate, precise and applicable for therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies of the selected β-lactam antibiotics.

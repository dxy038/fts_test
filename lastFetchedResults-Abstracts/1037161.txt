This paper presents a hybrid optimization method for optimizing the process parameters during plastic injection molding (PIM). This proposed method combines a back propagation (BP) neural network method with an intelligence global optimization algorithm, i.e. genetic algorithm (GA). A multi-objective optimization model is established to optimize the process parameters during PIM on the basis of the finite element simulation software Moldflow, Orthogonal experiment method, BP neural network as well as Genetic algorithm. Optimization goals and design variables (process parameters during PIM) are specified by the requirement of manufacture. A BP artificial neural network model is developed to obtain the mathematical relationship between the optimization goals and process parameters. Genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the process parameters that would result in optimal solution of the optimization goals. A case study of a plastic article is presented. Warpage as well as clamp force during PIM are investigated as the optimization objectives. Mold temperature, melt temperature, packing pressure, packing time and cooling time are considered to be the design variables. The case study demonstrates that the proposed optimization method can adjust the process parameters accurately and effectively to satisfy the demand of real manufacture.

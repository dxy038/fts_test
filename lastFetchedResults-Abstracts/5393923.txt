Maintaining a poorly documented Web application is not an easy task; software engineers must understand various parts of an application before they can make changes that preserve reliability and other system attributes. In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of studies that aim at reverse engineering web applications. These studies embody a rich set of techniques that differ in a variety of ways. In this paper, we study several techniques for reverse engineering of Web applications. The objective is to understand the trends in this area as well as uncover key research questions that remain unaddressed.

The objective of the research was to study tribological properties of EN 31 bearing steel. The study focuses on how surface roughness and working temperature affect wear and friction under dry sliding conditions. Experiments were conducted with 3 different loads 10N, 20N and 30N. Milling and grinding technique was used to prepare the samples in order to get different surface roughness values. It is observed that wear is well correlated with surface roughness and temperature. A high wear rate and friction is observed under 10N load, in both samples prepared with milling and grinding. This may attributed to the fact that the oxides formed on the surface were highly stable and remained on the surface which led to the increase in coefficient of friction.

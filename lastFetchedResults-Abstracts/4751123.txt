This paper describes an algorithm for the radiometric and spectral calibration of hyperspectral data. The objective of the radiometric and spectral calibration is to convert the instrument digital counts into spectral radiance at the TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) expressed into physical units. The instrument calibration process can be divided into two phases: the pre-flight instrument characterisation and the in flight calibration. The first one is based on laboratory measurements that provide the instrument and the on board calibration device characterisation. The second one is in charge of monitoring the instrument behaviour by using the in flight calibration and the pre-flight measurements. The proposed method is foreseen to be used for the processing of the HypSEO mission data, an Italian Space Agency future mission aimed to the demonstration of the spaceborne hyperspectral sensor technology and data exploitation.

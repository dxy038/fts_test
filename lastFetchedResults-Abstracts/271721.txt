The J!A1 three!term asymptotic solution for a crack in a power!law hardening material has been suc!
cessfully used to interpret the constraint e}ects due to _nite specimen geometry and loading con_gurations[
In the current paper\ we study the mechanics behavior of the J!A1 solution for a plane strain mode!I crack
in very low hardening materials[ The objective is to investigate the validity of the J!A1 characterization\ in
an approximate sense\ for the fully plastic crack!tip _elds in non!hardening materials[ In particular\ the
constraints at the crack tip for several conventional specimen geometries and loading con_gurations in non!
hardening materials are studied under the framework of the J!A1 description[ The results indicate that within
the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip the three!term solution can capture the essential features of fully
plastic _elds in various _nite size specimens in non!hardening materials[ Consequently A1 can be e}ectively
used as a constraint parameter in characterizing the crack!tip _eld in non!hardening materials[

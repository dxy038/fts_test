AbstractBackground
scular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, which modulates angiogenesis and neurogenesis within the neurovascular unit, might play an important role in the neuro-endocrine-immune (NEI) stress-adaptation system. Recent evidence suggests that VEGF is involved in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases including major depressive disorder (MDD) and is affected by some treatments, including antidepressants. The objective of the study was to investigate the VEGF level variations in MDD patients during antidepressant treatment with duloxetine, a relatively new SNRI.
s
l of 30 MDD patients and 32 healthy controls were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and monitored for VEGF plasma levels at baseline, week 6 and week 12 of duloxetine treatment (60 mg/day) and at baseline, respectively.
s
ing to early clinical response to duloxetine (defined at week 6 by reduction&gt;50% of baseline HAM-D score), the MDD patients were divided into early responders (ER) and early non-responders (ENR). During duloxetine treatment, we found an opposite trend in the VEGF levels between ER and ENR: in ER the VEGF levels significantly increased in association with clinical response at W6, while in ENR the VEGF levels significantly decreased in association with an overall clinical response at W12.

posite trends in VEGF levels, increasing in ER and decreasing in ENR, might reflect differential Norepinephrine/Serotonin effects of duloxetine on differential neurobiological backgrounds of depressive syndromes. Overall, the modulation of VEGF signaling within the neurovascular unit during antidepressant treatment could hypothetically favor the remodeling of neural circuitry, contributing to adaptive adjustment of the NEI stress-adaptation system.

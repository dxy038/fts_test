The optimization of thermal processing of foods is a topic which has received great attention during the last decades. The majority of the authors have considered the use of single-objective (criteria) for the optimization. However, the simultaneous optimization of several objectives is much more realistic and desirable, but the associated non-linear programming problems can be very challenging to solve. Here, we describe an efficient and robust multi-criteria optimization method which can be successfully applied to large dynamic systems, like those arising from the modelling of thermal processing of foods. Further, their capabilities for better design and operation of these processes will be highlighted with selected case studies, where the generated Pareto solutions will be analysed. Finally, we will also illustrate their advantages over other recently proposed strategies.

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to examine the accuracy of frozen section for the identification of products of conception on curettage of patients undergoing surgery for suspected ectopic pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of 87 consecutive cases in which frozen-section assessment of an endometrial curettage specimen to identify products of conception was undertaken. A frozen-section diagnosis was considered correct if the final diagnosis concurred with the findings at frozen section. RESULTS: Eighty-one of 87 (93.1%) specimens were correctly identified at frozen section. Frozen section had a sensitivity of 78.3% and a specificity of 98.4%. The positive predictive value of frozen section in this population was 94.7% and the negative predictive value was 92.6%. No significant correlation was found regarding the attending pathologist at frozen section, preoperative human chorionic gonadotropin, or time of day at frozen section. CONCLUSIONS: Frozen section is accurate for the identification of products of conception on endometrial curettage in the evaluation of a suspected ectopic pregnancy.

A Hub Location Problem (HLP) deals with finding the locations of hub facilities and assignment of demand nodes to established facilities. Hubs play a central role in many networks such as telecommunication networks and their unavailability may lead to network breakdown or poor service levels. An objective in design of a hub-and-spoke network is maximization of reliability to transfer flows. This paper puts forward design of a reliable single-allocation hub-and-spoke network using an interactive fuzzy goal programming. To model and solve the problem, a fuzzy goal programming approach was developed for design of network in an interactive manner between decision maker and the model. To validate the model and the proposed solution approach, a test problem is presented and comparison of results is made using this problem.

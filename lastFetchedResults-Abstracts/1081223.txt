From 2002 to 2006, a combined R&D project named AQUASOL has been carried out at the facilities of the Plataforma Solar de Almería (Spain). Main objective of this project has been the development of a hybrid solargas desalination system based on multi-effect distillation process that meets at the same time the requirements of low-cost, high efficiency and zero discharge.

The final AQUASOL plant, implemented at the Plataforma Solar de Almería for its evaluation under real meteorological conditions, is composed of: (i) a 14-cell forward-feed vertically-stacked MED unit, (ii) a 500m2 stationary CPC (compound parabolic concentrator) solar collector field, (iii) a 24 m3 thermal storage system based on water, (iv) a new advanced prototype of double-effect absorption (LiBr-H2O) heat pump, (v) a smoketube gas boiler to guarantee 24-h operation

This paper shows the first experimental results obtained during the test campaign of the project. The performance ratio reached by the distillation plant in different operational modes is evaluated, as well as the issues related with the operation of the subsystems that compose the AQUASOL desalination system.

This paper aims at developing an efficient finite element based computational procedure for the topology design of heat conducting fields. To evaluate the temperature change in a specific position, due to varying the conducting material distribution in other regions, a discrete temperature sensitivity is derived for an evolutionary topology optimization method. In the topology optimization of the conducting fields, the thermal conductivity of an individual finite element is considered as the design variable. By removing or degenerating the conductive material of the elements with the most negative sensitivity, the temperature objective at the control point can be most efficiently reduced. Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate this proposed approach.

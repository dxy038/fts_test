Recently, there have been many advances in the field of wideband (7 kHz) speech coding because of evolutions and new applications in high-quality communication systems. The paper proposes WBSD (wideband bark spectral distance), a wideband speech codec quality measure based on a bark spectral distance objective quality assessment method for narrow-band telephone speech. The frequency band expansion method and accurate loudness calculation are discussed in detail. The variable bit-rate codecs and packet loss are used to simulate the speech quality degradation on communication systems. Correlation analysis between WBSD and DMOS are examined in order to evaluate objective speech quality measures. The experimental results show that the correlation degree reached is more than 0.8 in informal tests.

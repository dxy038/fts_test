Current visualization technology cannot effectively show high dimension multi-objective optimization problems. In view of this problem, a visualization method is proposed in this paper, which chooses the vertexes of regular tetrahedron as the basis points and maps the space coordinates of Pareto optimal front by the space vector balance. The relative merits of 4 objectives can be displayed effectively in this visualization model. Meanwhile, a regional scoring system is proposed. After that we show the results of the regional scoring system described by the form of the mapping points color gradient. On the basis of thought mentioned above, the visualization model is designed and analyzed by the experiment. The purpose of comprehensive analytical and decision-making of Pareto optimal solutions has been achieved.

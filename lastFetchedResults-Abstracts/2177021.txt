Tropomyosin, a myofibrillar protein, was described as the major allergen in crustaceans. The objective of this study was to screen and identify the linear IgE epitopes of tropomyosin in Penaeus monodon. Three immunoinformatics tools were used to predict the potential epitopes and the resultant epitopes were confirmed by dot-blot inhibition with sera from shrimp allergic subjects. As the result, 10 peptides were predicted and assembled by solid-phase synthesis. Eight epitopes were identified by dot-blot inhibition test, among which peptide 4 and 8 had not been reported by previous researches. Moreover, peptide 6 and 10 had IgE binding capability with all sera, while peptide 5, 8 and 9 could bind with 80% of the sera. Amino acid analysis demonstrated that Y, E, R, F and S presented more frequently in epitopes. Although further research should be done, it seems that immunoinformatics-driven epitope prediction can benefit epitope identification with high accuracy and efficiency.

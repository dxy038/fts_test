The main objective is to design a MEMS based gyroscope. A device which is capable of maintaining and measuring the orientation is termed to be a gyroscope, which works based on the principle of angular momentum. MEMS Gyroscopes are gaining popularity because they are highly accurate, less expensive and can be manufactured in large quantities. Gyroscopes can be used for detecting and monitoring Parkinson´s disease. In case of Parkinson´s disease movement asymmetry is one of the motor symptoms. Parkinson´s disease is the disorder of the central nervous system at substancia nigra due to absence of dopamine. Dopamine is a simple organic chemical which plays a number of important physiological roles. Once Parkinson´s disease can be detected at early stage by the use of MEMS gyroscopes, patients are treated with dopaminergic drugs in order to increase the amount of dopamine.

Objective The primary purpose of this study was to establish normative for 18 parameters of Motor Speech Profile (MSP; Computerized Speech Lab; KayPENTAX, Lincoln Park, NJ) in Indian population, specifically for Kannada-speaking adults across age and gender. Study Design Cross-sectional study. Method Native Kannada speakers (nآ =آ 300) were divided into three age groups (20â€“40, 41â€“50, and 51â€“60آ years) with 50 males and 50 females in each group. The obtained data are reported across age and gender for the parameters of diadochokinetic rate, second formant transition, and voice and tremor characteristics of MSP software. Results Across gender, a statistically significant difference (Pآ <آ 0.05) was seen for seven parameters; whereas across age, a statistically significant variation was seen for nine parameters in the age group of 51â€“60آ years than other groups (20â€“40 and 41â€“50آ years). Conclusion Establishment of the normative is essential for the effective use of acoustic analysis as an objective tool. The findings of the present study serve as a norm-based reference for MSP software in Indian population, aged between 20 and 60آ years.

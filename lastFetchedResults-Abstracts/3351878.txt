Human uses intonation to make focal prominence to give emphasis that highlights the focus of speech. Automatic extraction of proper intonation features from a speech corpus is desirous for processing speech prosody, especially in the context of speech synthesis. This paper presents a method to extract pitch register from observed F<sub>0</sub> contours for this purpose. The method utilizes a constrained tone transformation technique under an assumption that lexical accents are confined to parallel high and low tone lines with a limited constant span. Consequently, the extracted pitch register captures dynamic range variation of the pitch accents of an utterance. The method is evaluated by objective tests upon a large-scale expressive speech corpus. A finding is that proper intonation manifested in pitch register in Japanese is very comparable with English intonation in the sense of structural form.

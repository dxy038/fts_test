In this paper, we present a new direction of research which deploys these TM technologies to construct and maintain data bases organized in the form of pathway, by associating parts of papers with relevant portions of a pathway and vice versa. In order to materialize this scenario, we have being constructing a corpus (GENIA Pathway annotation) which associates portions of papers with specific parts in a pathway. Since we have already completed another GENIA annotation, Event Annotation, the main objective of this paper is to compare the two corpora and discuss how we can integrate events in papers with an organized whole of a pathway.

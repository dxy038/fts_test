The electrical power sector has been in permanent development during the past decade starting from the wholesale market towards the retail segment. Following that trend, the metering activities have accompanied that progress, and reached their boom with the embracement of smart metering. In the recent past, the electricity grid was characterized by its verticality and unidirectional flow from generation to consumption. The interactivity with clients was nonexistent and there was no major need for providing information, apart from the strictly needed billing data. This paradigm suffered a remarkable adjustment, with the introduction of renewable energy connected not only to the transmission grids but also in to distribution grids. Indeed, renewable generation offered not only variable production to the grids, but also bidirectional energy flows. Furthermore, the emergence of smaller generators extended the challenge to the low voltage level (230 V) and the promotion of electricity efficiency, locally and internationally, through the European directives, namely the 20/20/20 target, has given a more active role to consumers in the electricity sector.

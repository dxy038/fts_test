Rumen-protected conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) may increase the protein to fat ratio in milk,
and potentially improve the energy balance of early lactation cows. The objective of this study
was to evaluate the production performance and blood metabolite changes in Holstein cows
supplemented with four different doses of CLA postpartum in early lactation. Eight multiparous
Holstein cows with atleast 25 kg/day milk production were randomly chosen and were included
in an experimental design with four three week periods (7 days of adaptation and 14 days of
treatment and sampling). The experiment was carried out with four levels of protected CLA
supplement including 0, 50, 100, and 150 g per day per cow. Blood metabolites such as cholesterol
and LDL-C content decreased significantly (p < 0.05), but other metabolites such as HDL-C,
VLDL-C, triglyceride and BHBA did not change (p > 0.05). Milk production increased
significantly (p < 0.05), and 100 g/day of CLA supplemented treatment resulted in the highest
production compared with the other groups. Milk fat percentage of the treated cows was reduced
significantly and followed a dose-dependent response. No significant results were observed with
regard to the protein content, solids-non-fat and milk density of the milk (p > 0.05). The increased
milk production, and decreased blood LDL-C and cholesterol levels indicate an improvement in
the physiological state of the cows. Given the enrichment of produced milk using this supplement,
it is highly recommended to provide these supplements in dairy cow diets

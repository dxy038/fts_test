This paper presents a co-evolutionary game optimization algorithm (CEGA) to explore the layout design of a simplified international commercial communication satellite module. The method is inspired by game theory and co-evolutionary optimization algorithm. Some comparisons are offered with other optimization algorithms in terms of both solution quality and efficiency of computation. These contrast algorithms are a single-objective global optimization method using genetic algorithm (GA) and a traditional co-evolutionary optimization algorithm (CEA). The results of numerical experiment show that the proposed method offers a precise and robust alternative for the layout design of the satellite module

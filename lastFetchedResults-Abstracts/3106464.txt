The study area is located at the tectonic boundary between the Povungnituk and Chukotat Groups in the Early Proterozoic Cape Smith Belt near Cross Lake, in northern Quebec. This zone is characterized by elongate intrusive bodies of mafic-ultramafic rocks which have been interpreted as co-magmatic with the Fe- and Mg-rich basalts of the lower Chukotat Group. Such ultramafic sills are often Ni-Cu-PGE bearing in the area. Probe-1 Hyperspectral imagery is being used to differentiate the lithologies in the study area. In an applied field setting such imagery records the spectrum of the surface weathering product rather than the signal from a fresh rock surface. The objective of this investigation was to generate a calibrated database of the hyperspectral signatures of the surficial weathering products of each of the local lithologies. Validation of lithologies and surficial weathering characteristics was carried out during two field campaigns, as well as in subsequent laboratory evaluation using infrared spectroscopy and mineralogical analyses. Field ground-truthing indicated significant visual compositional and textural differences between surficial weathering products for study area lithologies, found to be related to their composition, grain size and most commonly associated vegetation (lichen). In-situ and subsequent laboratory and powdered sample infrared analyses of fresh and weathered surfaces confirmed that infrared absorption features observed in hyperspectral imagery signatures for the lithologies was solely associated with the weathered mineral oxides.

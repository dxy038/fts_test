The rotor of IPM (Interior Permanent Magnet) brushless motor is characterized with a high-strength structure so that the magnet is protected from centrifugal separation when running at a high speed; also, as designed a non-concentrically circular rotor to increase the motor torque output, there is a reluctance torque produced by the salient poles effect in addition to the electromagnetic torque generated by the interactive reaction between the magnet and the coil; however, such a consequence will lead to an increase of the cogging torque. Thus, this research explored the salient-pole interior permanent magnet by going through the modifications of appearance dimensions of motor rotor, application of equivalent magnetic-circuit analysis and finite element method to analyze the cogging torque in a bid to make the objective toward the cogging torque reduction in interior permanent magnet brushless motor achievable.

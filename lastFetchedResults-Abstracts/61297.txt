This paper proposes a picture reference system for a cyber art gallery. The picture reference system is a client-server system on the Internet and consists of the associative picture database (server) and the visual user interface (client). The implementation by client-server system enables us to implement a distributed cyber art gallery. The associative picture database searches pictures by using conceptual fuzzy sets. The conceptual fuzzy sets are implemented by bidirectional associative memory and Hopfield neural network. The visual user interface without keyboard and mouse, captures user's movement and informs it to the system as a command. To show pictures attractively, the visual user interface provides some visual-effect functions. We implement and evaluate the picture reference system.

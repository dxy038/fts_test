This study examines coordination processes in Distributed Group Support Systems. A 2&#215;2 factorial design was used to investigate coordination mode and group leadership in an asynchronous environment, as a means of exploring the impact of restrictiveness of coordination structures on group performance. Objective decision quality was equal for both parallel and sequential coordination groups, but was significantly better in groups with a leader. Perceived decision quality was better in parallel coordination groups than sequential groups. Satisfaction with a decision process was higher in parallel coordination groups and groups with a leader. The study concludes that less restrictive coordination structures are more appropriate to support asynchronously interacting distributed groups

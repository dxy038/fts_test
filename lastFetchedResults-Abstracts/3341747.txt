This paper presents a multi-objective Simulated Annealing Optimization to solve a Dynamic Generation Dispatch problem. In this work, the problem is formulated as a multi-objective one with two competing functions, namely economic cost and emission functions, subject to different constraints. The inequality constraints considered are the generating unit capacity limits while the equality constraint is generation-demand balance. To show the advantages of the proposed algorithm, it has been applied for solving multi-objective EELD problems in a 3-generator system with NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> emission, and in a 6-generators system considering NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> emission. This technique is compared with other techniques which reveals the superiority of the proposed approach and confirms its potential for solving other power systems problems.

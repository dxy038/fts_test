Presents a method to design sliding mode observers for a class of uncertain systems using linear matrix inequalities. The objective is to exploit the degrees of freedom available in the design which have hitherto been ignored because of the lack of a tractable solution framework. The relationship between the linear component of the sliding mode observer and a particular sub-optimal observer arising from classical linear quadratic Gaussian theory is demonstrated. This helps show how the design weighting matrices inherent in the method may be chosen in practice

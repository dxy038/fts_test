The self-learning is always considered as a kind of ability, but how to evaluate this capability is a hard work. In this paper, an evaluation model, including evaluation criteria and an evaluation algorithm, is presented, it could make a fair-minded, objective, and comprehensive evaluation on self-learning ability for self-learners. The judgment factor &#955; and the normalization are introduced to our algorithm.

The objective was to develop a model that can accurately describe the hybrid-mode operation of deep submicron LDD pMOSFETs in a circuit simulation environment. The device threshold voltage, various current components, transconductance, and output conductance are extracted experimentally, modelled analytically, and adapted to meet the circuit simulation requirements. The latter necessitates that the model equations, together with their derivatives, be continuous. The effects of independently biasing the source, drain, gate, and body potentials on the device currents and parameters are highlighted. A critical comparison between the presented model XSIM and HSPICE is made. The results show that unlike HSPICE, where the MOSFET and the bipolar device embedded in the structure have to be simulated as two entities, the suggested model describes the composite structure as a single entity and predicts its behaviour accurately for a range of different channel lengths based on a single set of process and device model parameters

Photovoltaic systems utilize solar energy to generate electrical energy to meet load demands. Optimal sizing of these systems includes
the characterization of solar radiation. Solar radiation at the Earth’s surface has random characteristics and has been the focus of various
academic studies. The objective of this study was to stochastically analyze parameters involved in the sizing of photovoltaic generators
and develop a methodology for sizing of stand-alone photovoltaic systems. Energy storage for isolated systems and solar radiation were
analyzed stochastically due to their random behavior. For the development of the methodology proposed stochastic analysis were studied
including the Markov chain and beta probability density function. The obtained results were compared with those for sizing of stand–
alone using from the Sandia method (deterministic), in which the stochastic model presented more reliable values. Both models present
advantages and disadvantages, however, the stochastic one is more complex and provides more reliable and realistic results.

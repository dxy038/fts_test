This paper presents a robust voicing estimation algorithm for low bit rate harmonic speech coding. The algorithm is based on waveform time-warping followed by spectral matching based on voiced and unvoiced local spectral models. The objective of time warping is to reduce the effect of pitch variations on the voicing decision. Several adaptive techniques are used to improve the flexibility and robustness of the conventional spectral matching algorithm. An objective evaluation of the new voicing algorithm is obtained by comparing to manually estimated voicing values. Subjective tests of a sinusoidal coder using the new voicing algorithm show significantly better performance than the standard spectral matching under both clean and noisy environment

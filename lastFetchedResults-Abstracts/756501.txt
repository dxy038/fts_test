Objective
Hyperhomocysteinemia is recognized as an independent risk factor for arterial disease including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease. Previously, an association between increased plasma homocysteine level and peripheral arterial aneurysms has been reported. However, the relationship between coronary artery ectasia (CAE) and plasma homocysteine level has not been investigated. Accordingly, this study was designed to investigate plasma homocysteine level in patients with isolated CAE.
Methods

Thirty-two patients with isolated CAE without significant stenosis and 30 control subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries were included in this study. Fasting plasma homocysteine concentrations were measured by Florescence Polarization Immunoassay method using homocysteine kids. Hyperhomocysteinemia is defined as plasma homocysteine levels above the 95th percentile of the control subjects (13.6 μmol/l).
Results

According to the definition of hyperhomocysteinemia, 19 (59%) of patients with isolated CAE had elevated levels of plasma homocysteine compared to 2 (7%) in the control subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries (p<0.001). In addition, patients with isolated CAE had significantly higher levels of plasma homocysteine compared to control subjects (14.9±4.5 μmol/l vs. 8.6±1.9 μmol/l respectively, p<0.001). Besides, we detected a significant positive correlation between the number of ectasic segment and plasma homocysteine level (r=0.537, p=0.002).
Conclusion

We have shown for the first time an association between elevated plasma homocysteine level and isolated CAE. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the role of hyperhomocysteinemia in CAE and to evaluate the usefulness of homocysteine-lowering therapies.

The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between knowledge management dimensions and organizational learning levels among the board of academic members at Esfahan university. The statistical population included all the academic members at Esfahan university, 500 people out of which using cohen et al, table 217 people was chosen through simple random sampling. The research method was causal comparative-correlation. To gather the data two questionnaires: knowledge management (Golizadeh et al.), organizational learning (Watkins & marsik)were used. To test the hypotheses inferential statistic such as Pearson correlation coefficient, stepwise multiple regression, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), Scheffe test and structural equation modeling were used. Findings indicated a statistically significant relationship between dimensions of  knowledge management and levels of organizational learning ( ).The results of stepwise multiple regression indicated that the individual level and group level were the best predictors of knowledge management. No significant difference was found between faculty members' comments on knowledge management dimensions based on their sex, field of study, university degree, teaching level and working backgrounds. But there was a significant difference between their comments on organizational level based on teaching level and working backgrounds. The results of  the structural equation modeling indicated that organizational learning had direct effect on knowledge management.

The derivation of an accurate small-signal model for a galvanically isolated, bidirectional dc-dc converter and the implementation of a corresponding controller on a DSP as well as key methods and functions required for the digital implementation are detailed in this paper. The investigated dc-dc converter, an automotive dual active bridge (DAB) system, enables power transfer between a low-voltage port (ranging from 11 to 16 V) and an HV port (240 to 450 V). The nominal power rating is 2 kW. The developed small-signal model yields highly accurate results for the DAB system, but the proposed modeling procedure could also be applied to arbitrary resonant power converters with unidirectional or bidirectional power transfer.

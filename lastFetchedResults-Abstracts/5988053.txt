Related Vehicle Routing Problem is another form of Vehicle Routing Problem. RVRP also belongs to NP-Hard, The research based on single distribution center RVRP with road capacity dynamic constraint. Road capacity factor shows as a road condition coefficient, then added it into the objective function. To build a model of single distribution center and single vehicle type RVRP with soft time windows and dynamic constraint. The simulated result shows that the self-adapting chaos genetic algorithm is flexible and feasible to solve this kind of model.

The present study proposes a novel multimodal biometrics framework for identity recognition and verification following the concept of the so called `on-the-move` biometry, which sets as the final objective the non-stop authentication in an unobtrusive manner. Gait, that forms the major modality of the scheme, is complemented by new dynamic biometric signatures extracted from several activities performed by the user. Gait recognition is performed through a robust scheme that is based on geometric descriptors of gait energy images and is able to compensate for undesired gait behaviour like walking direction variations and stops. On the other hand, the biometric signatures, based on the user activities, are extracted by tracking of three points of interest and are seen to provide a powerful auxiliary biometric trait. Finally, score level fusion is performed and the experimental results illustrate that the proposed multimodal biometric scheme provides very promising results in realistic application scenarios.

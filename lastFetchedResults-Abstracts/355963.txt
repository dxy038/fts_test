Objective Before balloon dilation, failure of compensatory enlargement and even arterial shrinkage are frequently observed at the lesion site in response to plaque accumulation. Balloon angioplasty may be regarded as artificial remodeling to enlarge the artery. The prevalence of the different types of arterial wall remodeling after applied stretch by balloon angioplasty is unknown.
Methods and Results In 181 patients an intravascular ultrasound study was performed after coronary balloon angioplasty ( n = 200 lesions). The vessel area was measured at a proximal and distal reference site and at the lesion site. Subsequently, the relative vessel area [(Vessel area lesion site)/Vessel area reference site) × 100] was calculated. Lesions were classified in three groups on the basis of their relative vessel areas: ≥105%, <105% but >95%, and ≤95%. A relative vessel area ≥105%, indicating enlargement compared with the reference site, was observed in 84 (44%) lesions. A relative vessel area <105% but >95% was observed in 43 (22%) lesions. A relative vessel area ≤95%, indicating “shrinkage” compared with the reference site, was observed in 66 (34%) lesions.
Conclusions After balloon angioplasty, the vessel area was found to be smaller compared with the reference site in 34% of the lesions. This small vessel area at the lesion site compared with a reference site may be a reflection of insufficient stretch by balloon angioplasty. (Am Heart J 1997;134:680-4.)

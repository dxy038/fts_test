Background Obsessive–compulsive disorder
(OCD) is the fourth most frequent diagnosis in
psychiatry. Patients with OCD suffer from obsessive
thinking and compulsive behavior, which impact their
everyday life negatively. Objective Subjective quality
of life (QoL) in patients with OCD was examined and
compared to the general German population and to
patients with schizophrenia. Methods Seventy-five
patients, aged 21–72, with OCD (ICD 10 F42.0–F42.2)
were recruited from the outpatient clinic for anxiety
disorders at the Department of Psychiatry of the
University of Leipzig. By means of the WHOQOLBREF,
QoL was assessed in patients with OCD in a
representative sample of patients with schizophrenia
and in a sample of the general population of Saxony/
Germany. Results Compared with the general population,
QoL in patients with OCDs was lower in all
domains of the WHOQOL-BREF. Unexpectedly, QoL
in patients with OCDs was lower in the domains
‘‘psychological well-being’’ and ‘‘social relationships’’
when compared with schizophrenia patients. Conclusions
OCD has a substantial adverse effect on patients’
subjective QoL, which may be even greater
than the adverse effect of schizophrenia. Therefore, it
will be necessary to include interventions in the
treatment of OCD aimed at improving residual deficits
in psychosocial functioning and QoL.

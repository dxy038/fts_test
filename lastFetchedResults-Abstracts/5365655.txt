A new technique is proposed for determining the responses of three-phase AC/DC power converters. The technique consists in connecting fictitious voltage sources such that the nonlinear circuit is separated into a linear part and a nonlinear part. Analysis of the circuit is simplified and the mismatch currents flowing into the fictitious voltage sources are determined. The objective of the proposed technique is to determine the voltage sources for which the mismatch currents are zero. The technique is general and it can be applied for simulating the transient and steady-state responses

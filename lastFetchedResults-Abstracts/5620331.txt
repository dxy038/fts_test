This article proposes a bidirectional-output alternative for a 3-input DC-DC boost converter. This converter has 3 inputs including a bidirectional battery input allowing both charging and discharging operations, two unidirectional power inputs and a bidirectional output specialized in this article for use by electric motor(s) implemented in an electric vehicle allowing regenerative braking power to charge the battery. This converter is more applicable in case of hybrid renewable energy inputs, such as a PV panel and a fuel cell unit. The converter comprises five independently controlled power switches with different duty ratios that dictate different modes of operation. Decoupling network is adapted to separate interactions of the control loops and to enable the use of SISO control strategies for this interacted MIMO system.

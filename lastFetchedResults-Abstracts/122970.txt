Chronic purulent otitis media is a permanent disease with gradual initiation which leaves intensive destructive and irreversible damages, if untread. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial species in chronic otitis media. In this descriptive, cross - sectional study , the data was collected from 120 patients, who were bedridden at ward or coming the ENT clinic . Sample was obtained when the patients were not consuming any antibiotic or antiseptic materials for at least 72 hours. For biopsy, two sterile swabs was used, one to culture at different culture medium, and the other one to prepare essential expansion for different coloring (gram, real nelson, etc). Secretions on swabs were cultured at suitable culture mediums, such as blood agar Eosine Metylen Blue, chocolatic (or sweet) medium, neotizine broath and thioglicolate for unaerobic medium which was maintained at 36-37Â° c for 24-48 hours, in a medium with 5-10% concentration of C02. The most prevalent bacteria that grew at cultured samples was staphylococcus areus (30.83%). The finding like this was equal to Fridman's study.

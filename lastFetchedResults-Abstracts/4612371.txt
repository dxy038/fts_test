As the phased array radar works in a multi-objective environment, itÂ´s necessary to refer to the priority of targets when allocating resources during scheduling. The determination of priorities of targets needs to be fast and efficient, and consider multiple factors. Artificial neural network has adaptive and self-learning ability, and good fault-tolerance features, especially for processing problems that need to consider many factors and uncertain information processing. This paper analyzes the main factors affecting target priority of phased array radar, proposes the use of improved BP neutral network algorithm to determine target priority. Simulation results show that the method used to sort the target priority is effective.

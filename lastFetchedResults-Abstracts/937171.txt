The majority of analytical results in the Greenland AMAP  Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme. have
been produced by laboratories that participate regularly in performance studies. This makes it possible to judge the
quality of the results based on objective measurements made by independent assessors. AMAP laboratories
participated while analysing the AMAP samples in the QUASIMEME laboratory performance study programme, in
the ‘Interlaboratory Comparison Program’ organised by Le Centre de Toxicologie du Qu´ebec, in a toxaphene
intercomparison study organised by The Food Research Division of Health Canada, and in an International Atomic
Energy Agency Intercomparison exercise. The relative errors of the trace analyses, i.e. the relative deviation of the
result obtained by the AMAP laboratory from the assigned value, are in most cases less than the 25% which is
regarded as acceptable by QUASIMEME. Usually the errors, especially for trace elements, are less than 12.5%,
while errors for trace organics below 1 mg kgy1 may rise to 50% or more. This study covers the period 1993 to 1998
for trace elements and one or more years from the period 1994]1996 for trace organics

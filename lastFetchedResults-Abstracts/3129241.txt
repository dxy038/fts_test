This paper presents a new class of two-stage fuzzy location-allocation problems with credibility objective, in which the customer demands are uncertain and assumed to be characterized by fuzzy variables. Since the fuzzy demand usually has an infinite support, we cannot solve the location-allocation problem by conventional optimization algorithms. To overcome this difficulty, we apply an approximation method to the two-stage fuzzy location-allocation problem, and turn it into an approximating optimization problem. In order to solve the approximating problem, we design a hybrid algorithm which combines approximation method, neural network (NN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). At last, we present one numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed algorithm.

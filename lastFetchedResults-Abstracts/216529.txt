Objective: The number of orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC) worldwide has increased as a result of the Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) pandemic. New Life Home (NLH) specialises in the care of infants who have been orphaned or abandoned, often
because of their exposure to HIV and places them for adoption . This paper documents the lessons learnt from the Home's first 8.5
years of existence. Methods: this is retrospective study an alyses the pattern of the 490 infants admitted at NLH. The characteristics of
the infants'stay are analysed : bio -data, weight, HIV exposure, referring organisation/agent and outco me. This study ceased to follow
infants after adoption, death, transferral to other homes, or reunion with own family. The infants came via health facilities (58%), local
authorities (15%), good Sama ritans (2% ) , and other children's homes (25 %) . Results: At the end of the study period, 425 (92%) of babies
were still alive. Of those who died, 8% were less than 6 months old (P<0 .003) and 45% were HIV positive. A child mortality rate of
77.6/1000 was demonstrated with the key associated factors being HlV exposure (p <0001), and weight at admission (P=0.002). The
mortality rate for the HIV exposed was 71/1000 at 6 months, 94.7/1000 at 12 months and 100.6 /1000 at 18 months, while for th ose
not exposed to the virus it was 43.3/1000 at 6 months and 46.7/ 1000 at 12 months. The major cause of de ath in th e HIV exposed was
pneumonia (56%) and septi caemi a (22%) . The majority of infant s, 3 23 (67%) wer e ado pted, som e were re abso rbe d into their biological
families 31(6.3%) and a minority 7(1.4%) transferred to other children's homes which cater for older children. Conclusion: NLH
demon strates a possible model of care for OVC as majority of vulnerable child can have the opportunity to be adopted and thereby
a 'second lease' of life. This strategy is worth studying and duplicating in the mitigation of the OVC dilemma in HIV high prevalence
countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

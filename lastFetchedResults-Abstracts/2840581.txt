Airborne ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a suitable tool to perform cost-effective surveys of the underground of a large possibly non-accessible areas. And It is concluded that airborne GPR will receive more attention in the future. So we have developed a L-band Full-polarimetric Step-Frequency GPR acquisition system, which consists of a GPS receiver, the Vivaldi antenna, a signal amplifier and a vector network analyzer (VNA) under the control of a PC unit. The main objective of our work is to conduct some experiments to test the feasibility of this airborne testing system.

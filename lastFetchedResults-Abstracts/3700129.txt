A novel low-cost fiber in-line-type bidirectional optical subassembly using a tilted fiber Bragg grating has been developed for fiber-to-the-home applications. We successfully realized a low-cost subassembly by reducing the number of components and simplifying the packaging process. The extinction ratio of 14.8 dB, receiver minimum sensitivity of -26.5 dBm at a bit-error rate of 10<sup>-12</sup> and frequency response of 2.7 GHz were experimentally obtained. The electrical crosstalk between transmitter and receiver part was less than -86 dB up to 2.5 GHz.

Introduction: Boron possesses widespread properties and is important for human and animal nutrition. Since Boron is rapidly bioavailable, the objective of the present study was to determine whether acute (hourly or daily), and weekly supplementation could have any significant biological effects on the synthesis of steroids as well as inflammatory biomarkers.
Methods: Eight male volunteers participated in experiments on three occasions (day 0, 1 and 7). On the first day (day 0), a blood sample was collected at 8.00 A. M, followed by ingestion of placebo. On the next day (supplementation- day 1), similar procedure was followed by ingestion of 10 mg of boron capsule. On both occasions samples of blood were collected every 2 h for the next 6 h. Subjects  consumed a capsule of 10 mg boron every day and on day 7, blood collection was carried out again at 8.00 A.M. Independent sample t-tests were used to evaluate the differences.
Results: Plasma boron was significantly increased following hourly (P=0.002) and weekly (P=0.000) consumption of boron. After one week of supplementation, free testosterone levels were significantly increased (P < = 0.02) and estradiol concentrations were significantly decreased (P < = 0.01). Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), cortisol and Vitamin D showed slight non significant, increases. The ratios of free testosterone/testosterone (FT/T) (P < = 0.001), free testosterone/estradiol (FT/E2) (P < = 0.004) and testosterone/estradiol (T/E2) (P < = 0.009) were significantly increased. Also, all 3 inflammatory biomarkers were decreased after supplementation.
Conclusion: Although there are previous studies that report a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines induced by boron consumption, to our knowledge, this is the first human study reporting an increase in plasma free testosterone concentrations following consumption of a boron supplement. This indicates a possible protective role against diseases of pathological conditions for this microelement.

This research improves the presentation of an automatic multiple-document summarization system, which produces the frequently asked questions (FAQs) of a topical forum. The design and findings of the proposed presentation structure based on a four-part pattern of traditional Chinese articles are presented. An experiment was designed to conduct an objective experimental analysis based on criteria consisting of compression rate, recall rate, and precision rate, as well as a subjective experimental analysis based on user acceptance in terms of the indication, readability, appropriate number of sentences, and structure of the summary. The experimental results show that the proposed summary presentation structure with both domain-terminology corpus methods produced a significantly improved summary presentation compared with the original system. Nevertheless, the FAQ summary presentation system could have used complete sentences instead of partial sentences from the original articles for improved readability.

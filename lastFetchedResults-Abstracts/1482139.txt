The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of CO-MAP compared to traditional high oxygen MAP (HiOx-MAP) packaging and enhanced with different phosphate on enhanced pork quality. Pork loins were enhanced to 10.5% over initial weight to contain 0.3% salt and 0.4% phosphate (either sodium tripolyphosphate [STP] or a blend of STP and sodium hexametaphosphate) on a finished weight basis. Chops were cut, packaged in atmospheres containing 0.4% CO/30.0% CO2/69.6% N2 (CO-MAP) or 80% O2/20% CO2 (HiOx-MAP), aged in the dark, then placed in a lighted retail display case for 48 h. Chops packaged in CO-MAP were redder (higher Minolta a∗ values) and darker (lower Minolta b∗ values) than chops packaged in HiOx-MAP. Based on sensory scores, the CO-MAP chops were pinker than the HiOx chops after cooking. CO-MAP chops also experienced less purge loss than chops in HiOx-MAP. Results indicate that CO-MAP had no effect on flavor or consumer acceptability and only minimal effects on other characteristics.

Resource allocation is studied for a forward-link two-cell code division multiple access (CDMA) voice network with multiple service classes. System resources are transmitted power and codes. The service classes are specified by different user utility functions that relate utility to received signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR). The objective of the resource allocation is to maximize total utility over the two cells. The optimal power allocation is characterized by a set of distances, or radii, from the desired base station. Each radius corresponds to the set of active users in a particular service class, and can be enforced through a pricing scheme. We also consider setting prices to maximize revenue. In general, the prizes and power allocation that maximize revenue differ from those that maximize utility.

The objective of the presentation is to review what can be achieved today for practical optical interconnections using polymer waveguides, and provide insight into the status and versatility for polymer waveguide technology based optical interconnectivity. The unique attributes enabled by GuideLinktrade for a practical scalable polymer waveguide technology will be evident. The general sense is that widespread applications are now becoming realizable for practical cost effective planar polymer waveguide optical interconnectivity in the form of board, chip level and device applications.

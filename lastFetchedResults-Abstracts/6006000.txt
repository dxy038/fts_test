The objective of this paper is to present a double-layer charging control model which can be utilized by an Electric Vehicle Supplier/Aggregator (EVS/A) for scheduling and managing the electric vehicle (EV) charging demand. The first layer is a cost-minimization load scheduling algorithm considering the EV demand forecast and wholesale prices. EVS/A can be incentivized by the DSOs to offer load management services, thus, the scheduling algorithm is further enhanced by considering network performance. The second layer is a dispatch algorithm for allocating the purchased power to EVs without violating network constraints. The efficiency of the presented charging control tool is evaluated through simulations in a realistic urban MV distribution network.

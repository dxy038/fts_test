In a Bayesian tomographic maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction, an estimate of the object f is computed by iteratively minimizing an objective function that typically comprises the sum of a log-likelihood (data consistency) term and prior (or penalty) term. The prior can be used to stabilize the solution and to also impose spatial properties on the solution. One such property, preservation of edges and locally monotonic regions, is captured by the well-known median root prior (MRP), an empirical method that has been applied to emission and transmission tomography. We propose an entirely new class of convex priors that depends on f and also on m, an auxiliary field in register with f. We specialize this class to our median prior (MP). The approximate action of the median prior is to draw, at each iteration, an object voxel toward its own local median. This action is similar to that of MRP and results in solutions that impose the same sorts of object properties as does MRP. Our MAP method is not empirical, since the problem is stated completely as the minimization of a joint (on f and m) objective. We propose an alternating algorithm to compute the joint MAP solution and apply this to emission tomography, showing that the reconstructions are qualitatively similar to those obtained using MRP.

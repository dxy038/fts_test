The main objective of this study is to devise a technique, which, when implemented into finite-element codes, is efficiently applicable to impact collapse analyses of framed structures. In this study, the formerly developed adaptively shifted integration (ASI) technique for the linear Timoshenko beam element is modified into the ASI-Gauss technique by placing the numerical integration points of the two consecutive elements forming an elastically deformed member in such a way that stresses and strains are evaluated at the Gaussian integration points of the two-element member. On comparison with the ASI technique, the ASI-Gauss technique proves its higher accuracy and efficiency in elastic range. Moreover, instead of applying impact loads in the form of nodal forces, we consider the impact phenomenon by means of contacts between the elements involved and the elemental contact algorithm is verified from the point of conservation of energy. Impact analyses considering member fracture with different sets of parameters are performed using a high-rise framed structure and a small aircraft. From the results obtained, we can observe propagation phenomena of impact loads and shock waves. Also, a proper difference in impact damage is obtained by different sets of parameters. The results also indicate that the mass of the aircraft has a stronger influence on impact damage than its velocity. Moreover, soon after impact, tensile stresses are observed in the columns that were compressed by dead loads before impact.

In ball grid array (BGA) packages, solder balls are exposed to cyclic thermo-mechanical strains arising from the thermal
mismatch between package components. Thermo-mechanical fatigue crack propagation in solder balls is almost always
observed at the chip side of the bump/pad junction. The objective of the experimental part of this study is to characterize
the bump/pad interface under fatigue loading. Fatigue specimens are prepared by reflowing Sn3.8Ag0.5Cu lead-free solder
alloy on Ni/Au substrates. Obtained results show that fatigue damage evolution strongly depends on the microstructure.
Applied strain and solder volume both have an influence on the fatigue damage mechanism. In the numerical part of the
study, fatigue experiments are modeled using the finite element technique. A cohesive zone approach is used to predict the
fatigue damage evolution in soldered connections. Crack propagation is simulated by an irreversible linear tractionâ€“separation
cohesive zone law accompanied by a non-linear damage parameter. Cohesive zone elements are placed where failure
is experimentally observed. Damage evolution parameters for normal and tangential interaction are scrutinized
through dedicated fatigue tests in pure tensile and shear directions. The proposed cohesive zone model is quantitatively
capable of describing fatigue failure in soldered joints, which can be further extended to a numerical life-time prediction
tool in microelectronic packages.

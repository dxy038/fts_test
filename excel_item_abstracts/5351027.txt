In this paper, we present a testing model to support the verification and validation for composite components. The testing model supports two types of components: atomic and composite. Atomic components are non-decomposable software units, while composite components are developed by composing existing components. Our main contribution presented in this paper focusing on two issues: (1) to provide a testing model for atomic components while these components are being designed and developed; and (2) to provide a mechanism to construct new testing models for composite components by composing existing testing models of atomic components. In addition, we address how our integrating testing model can support both centralized and distributed testing of composite components.

The objective of this research is to determine the molecular structure of the mineral hinsdalite using vibrational spectroscopy. The mineral hinsdalite (Pb,Sr)Al3(PO4,SO4)2(OH)6 is a hydroxy phosphate–sulphate mineral belonging to the beudantite subgroup of alunites. The mineral is interesting because it contains two oxyanions, phosphate and sulphate, which is unusual. The formation of hinsdalite offers a mechanism for the removal of phosphate from the environment.

neral has been characterised by Raman spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy. The spectra are then related to the molecular structure of the mineral. Bands at various wavenumbers are assigned to the different vibrational modes of hinsdalite, which were then associated to the molecular structure of the mineral. Bands were primarily assigned to phosphate and sulphate stretching and bending modes. The Raman spectrum is characterised by an intense sharp band at 982 cm−1 with a component band at 997 cm−1 assigned to the ν1 (PO4)3− symmetric stretching modes. Two symmetric stretching modes for both phosphate and sulphate supported the concept of non-equivalent phosphate and sulphate units in the mineral structure. Bands in the OH stretching region enabled hydrogen bond distances to be calculated. Hinsdalite is characterised by disordered phosphate/sulphate tetrahedra and non-equivalent phosphate units are observed in the vibrational spectrum of hinsdalite.

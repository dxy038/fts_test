A bidirectional converter for electromechanical brake/the recycling of power generation energy is proposed in this paper. The gain of the converter is high. Since the converter use the technique of passive lossless buffer and synchronous rectification, the main switches achieve the technique of soft switching. Meanwhile the conversation efficiency is high too. Some experimental results and analysis of theory are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed bidirectional converter.

Objective
m of this study was to immunohistochemically analyse bone resorption regulators (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand [RANKL] and osteoprotegerin [OPG]), angiogenic index, and myofibroblasts in Gorlin syndrome-related odontogenic keratocysts (SOKCs) and non-syndrome odontogenic keratocysts (NSOKCs).
design
-two SOKCs, 22 primary NSOKCs, and eight recurrent NSOKCs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using anti-RANKL and anti-OPG antibodies. The angiogenic index was determined by microvessel count (MVC) using anti-CD34 antibody. Anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) antibody was used for the identification of myofibroblasts.
s
is of the expression of RANKL and OPG in the epithelial lining and fibrous capsule did not reveal significant differences between groups (P &gt; 0.05). In the epithelial lining, the RANKL/OPG ratio was RANKL &lt; OPG and RANKL = OPG in most primary NSOCKs (54.5%) and SOKCs (59.1%), respectively (P &gt; 0.05). In the fibrous capsule, the ratio was RANKL = OPG in most primary (81.8%) and recurrent NSOKCs (75.0%) and in most SOKCs (45.5%) (P &gt; 0.05). No significant differences in the angiogenic index or number of myofibroblasts were observed between primary NSOKCs, recurrent NSOKCs, and SOKCs (P &gt; 0.05).
sions
esent results suggest that differences in the biological behaviour of SOKCs and NSOKCs may not be related to the expression of RANKL and OPG, to the RANKL/OPG ratio, to the angiogenic index, or to the number of myofibroblasts in these lesions.

The objective of this article is to complete preliminary results from the work of Bonnard and Sugny (2009) and Sugny et al. (2007), concerning the time-minimal control of dissipative two-level quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by the Lindblad equation. The extremal system is described by a 3D-Hamiltonian depending upon three parameters. We combine geometric techniques with numerical simulations to deduce the optimal solutions.

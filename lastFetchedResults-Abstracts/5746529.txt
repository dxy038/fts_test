A generalized analysis methodology for satellite systems has been developed, and it can be used for the analysis of any space system architecture addressing any mission in communications, sensing or navigation. The generalized information network analysis (GINA) methodology is a hybrid of information network flow analysis, signal and antenna theory, space systems engineering and econometrics, and specifies measurable, unambiguous metrics for the cost, capability, performance and adaptability. The important contribution made by GINA is that by standardizing the representation of the overall mission objective, in terms of generalized quality of service parameters, GINA organizes, prioritizes and focuses the engineering effort expended in satellite systems analysis. The GINA methodology is thus identified as a valuable tool for space systems engineering, allowing qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of system architecture, deployment strategy, schedule slip, market demographics and technical risk

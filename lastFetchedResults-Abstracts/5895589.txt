In current enterprise IT solution services, many customers cannot utilize IT systems effectively nor reap any benefit from their services due to problems encountered and failures. To rectify this situation, we analyze these issues using reverse engineering method in this paper. First, we discuss the current situation of this field in Japan. Second, the IT solution service that we have developed is introduced as a case study. In this case study, we discuss the concept of two service "values", i.e., "objective value", which is the customer\´s end goal to be achieved by the IT systems and services, and "functional value", which is actually provided by those systems and services. Third, a service model is presented, which shows the relations among the agents who provide and receive services in the case study. To model the service, we discuss the important role of "design office" as a facilitator and a producer. Finally, our developed MUSE method is demonstrated as a practical and reasonable way to reveal and clarify a customer\´s objective value. It has become harder than before for customers to optimize and balance the overall system goals by themselves; collaborative work among service agents becomes a crucial factor to realizing effective services. Significant activities of the design office and effective use of the MUSE method are valuable and indispensable for achieving the customer\´s end goal.

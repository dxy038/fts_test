The objective of this study was to collect more information on the intricate relationship between the presence of a tumor, insulin status and blood lipids. We selected non-obese subjects suffering from colon, stomach and breast cancer and determined the concentration of fasting insulin, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides in blood before (BS) and after surgery (AS). Controls were healthy non-obese subjects. Insulin was also measured in tumors and non-cancerous tissues from the same organ. BS insulin and glucose (with the exception of glucose in colon patients) were significantly higher than the controls and fell to almost normal levels at AS. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels were reduced in stomach patients, BS and AS and cholesterol in colon patients BS. Tumors had 1.9â€“3.0 times as much insulin, or insulin-like substances, as control tissues. These results are consistent with our previous studies showing hyperinsulinemia in the presence of a tumor.

This paper presents an indexes system for the evaluation of electric power suppliers´ operation ability. The indexes system has three criteria and forty five indexes which take from the four links of electric power system. Then the TOPSIS and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method are used to evaluate the electric power suppliers´ operation ability separately, the average values of the upper two method evaluation results are used as the final evaluation results. By doing so, the combination of subjective evaluation with objective model is realized. At last, an experiment is done and the test results show the performance of this method is good and practical.

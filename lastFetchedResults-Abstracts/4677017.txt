Temperature cycle data in conjunction with the strains obtained from finite-element analysis has been used to evaluate gold wire fatigue parameters and the mean time to failure for different silicon device sizes. The objective of this study was to develop a numerical procedure to simulate reliability testing results. Such simulations can significantly improve engineering efficiency and reduce package development cycle times. The number of cycles to 1.3% failure point was obtained for different die sizes

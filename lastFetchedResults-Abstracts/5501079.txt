Automatic service composition is a key issue of cooperative resource utilization in component-based networked robot system. In this paper, a semantic-based automatic service composition method is proposed. The semantic representation and composition of service is achieved by semantic descriptions of service functions and formulating a set of I/O parameters matching rules. Based on this, a bidirectional breadth-first traversal search algorithm inspired by the maze problem is proposed. As a result, the proposed method is capable of automatically generating plans to compose the functions according to the task requirement. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and the flexibility of the proposed method.

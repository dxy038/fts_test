Doroodzan Dam is located in Fars Province (near Shiraz- 90 km) and Doroodzan watershed (425.400 ha area) was studied for defining of evaluation of environmental capabilities and site selection for recreational use.
The objective of this study were.
Description of Doroodzan dam and recreational specifications of the region. Description of Environment in these fields:
Physical Environment (topography, physiography, climate and meteorology, geology & soil specifications, water resources, erosion)
Biological Environment (vegetation, wild life, habitats)
Preparation of basic maps such as topography, slope elevation classes, direction of slope, land form unit, soil, vegetation
These maps overlaid by Mc. Harg method and environmental untis map prepared. Based on ecological model, the suitable polygons for recreational land use has identified and recreational land use map has prepared.
The best recreational site was selected as a results of this map, specifications of
ecological model and socio-economical specifications.
After site selection, A management plan for recreational center was prepared main tasks of this plan are including:
Prediction of carrying capacity of the site.
Defining of Camping and Picnic locations.
Identification of main environmental impacts and regarding mitigation plan such as waste management and conservation aspects for treatened animal and plant species.

In the present era, Language of the Qur'an is an important issue with a special position among the Quranic researchers and theologians. Some of the most important viewpoints presented in this regard include the theory of “language of inner nature", "the language of common knowledge" and "Language for direction and guidance”. Although each of these languages is bound to be concise, they maximally express an aspect, attribute or component of the language of the Qur'an, and no more; this prompted some scholars to offer the theory of "compositional language". By accepting this theory, one of the components and elements of the language of the Qur’an, that is the element of motivation, can be identified and presented. The present paper seeks to prove the  spread of the element of motivation throughout the Quran and to introduce the component of motivation as an element inseparable from its language .This objective is accomplished  in two ways: (1) drawing inspiration from the general attributes of the Quran such as the miraculous character of the Quran, remembrance and invocation of Divine Name, giving glad tidings and  warning, exhortation and teleology ( guidance) (2) analyzing the statements of the Quran in two traditional and compositional forms. Meanwhile, compositional statements are typically used in common dialogues to generate motivation and essentially have this function; therefore they do not need elaboration. But the motivational aspect in the Quranic statements are studied in at least four ways including speaking of God (the divine origin of statements), its  motivational traditions and content, its motivational style in conveying traditions and association of these statements with motivational particles. Then, the knowledge- spreading feature of the Quran in contrast to the theory of expressionism and emotionalism of the language of religion is also explained.

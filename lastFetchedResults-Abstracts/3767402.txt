The objective of this paper is to gain a better understanding of factors influencing software piracy. A model explaining the contribution of different factors to software piracy intention and its subsequent effect on actual software piracy is constructed based on established theories of human behavior. The model is then tested empirically in a longitudinal study with a survey. Findings show that social factors and beliefs concerning consequences of software piracy have significant effects on software piracy intentions. The data also show that while habits and facilitating conditions were significantly related to actual piracy behavior, intentions did not necessarily lead to the actual act of software piracy. The implications of the findings to research and practice are discussed.

The essay outlines one particular possibility of efficient evaluating the Performance of edge detector algorithms. Three generally known and published algorithms (Canny, Marr, Shen) were analysed by way of example. The analysis is based on two-dimensional signals created by means of two-dimensional Semi-Markov Model and subsequently provided with an additive Gaussian noise component. Five quality metrics allow an objective comparison of the algorithms.

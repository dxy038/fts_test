Scheduling plays an important role of mapping interactive simulation tasks onto heterogeneous computing nodes in simulation grid. A multi-objective multi-constrained task scheduling model was established considering the consumption of task load, message interaction between tasks, load of computing nodes, and communication delay. And the problem was solved on basis of genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible.

Remote labs that enable students to conduct realworld experiments at a distance using a computer and Webbased tools can be the only realistic method of performing practical experiments in the context of distance learning. eSience Tempus project "Maghreb Network of remote labs" offers an innovative pedagogical approach which integrates eLearning and is complementary to classroom learning. The main objective of this project is to create an efficient remote labs network in the Maghreb region for the modernization of higher education in technological sciences. The current paper summarizes the work carried out on a heat exchanger bench to be fully accessed and controlled remotely. Through this new device a student of Mechanical Engineering is introduced to many fundamental aspects of heat transfer.

An experimental hardware system designed to permit evaluation of the European Conference of Post and Telecommunication Administrations (CEPT) Group Speciale Mobile (GSM) air interface standard is described. The system is a two-way radio link which operates as a fully functional mobile radiotelephone and permits both objective (bit error rate) and subjective (speech codec quality) performance measurements to be made. A complete description of the mobile radio system along with key aspects of the signal processing algorithms used therein is provided and performance results of the system in the presence of co-channel interference and multipath fading are given

Objective: The objective of our study was to determine the impact of obstetric attending physician characteristics (eg, region of previous residency training, sex, year of graduation from residency) on the rates of vacuum and forceps delivery at our institution. Study Design: The analysis was based on 19,897 vaginal deliveries that were performed by 171 attending physicians and 160 resident physicians between 1977 and 1999 at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center. Z-tests and multivariate logistic regression were performed on a perinatal database that contained standard obstetric variables. Results: Male attending physicians had a higher percentage of forceps deliveries compared with female attending physicians (11.1% vs 6.6%; P< .001); female attending physicians had a higher percentage of vacuum deliveries compared with male attending physicians (9.8% vs 5.1%; P< .001). However, multivariate regression analysis revealed that only the year in which the procedure was performed affected both the forceps and vacuum delivery rates (P< .041). The region of previous residency training of the attending physician affected the vacuum delivery rate (P< .0001) but not the forceps delivery rate (P> .06) in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Factors such as the sex of the obstetric attending physician, the sex of the resident, and the year of graduation from residency for the obstetric attending physician did not have a significant impact on the forceps or vacuum delivery rates (all P> .05). Conclusion: Our study is the first to report that the apparent gender differences in forceps and vacuum delivery rates among obstetric attending physicians was due to the year in which the procedure was performed and not due to sex per se. We also found that the region of previous residency training for the obstetric attending physician significantly influenced the vacuum delivery rate. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:1299-303.)

We give some necessary and sufficient conditions which completely characterize the strong and total Lagrange duality, respectively,
for convex optimization problems in separated locally convex spaces. We also prove similar statements for the problems
obtained by perturbing the objective functions of the primal problems by arbitrary linear functionals. In the particular case when
we deal with convex optimization problems having infinitely many convex inequalities as constraints the conditions we work with
turn into the so-called Farkas–Minkowski and locally Farkas–Minkowski conditions for systems of convex inequalities, recently
used in the literature. Moreover, we show that our new results extend some existing ones in the literature.

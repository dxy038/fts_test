In this paper the fundamental idea is top develop and explore an innovative approach of completing human designed networks with that of machine built word networks. This network forms a hybrid method which combines human precision with that of machine computation to form a knowledge representation model. This model in turn encourages faster and efficient construction of automatic ontology. Our objective is to tackle the problem faced in the field of information retrieval and classification in the current era of information overflow

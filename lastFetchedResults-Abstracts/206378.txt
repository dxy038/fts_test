Background: Diabetes type 2 is one of the most prevalent reasons of Hyperglycemia. Different areas experience varying degrees of epidemic intensity. Diabetes is one of the most important causes of death and disability in most countries and imposes heavy financial burdens on people and governments. Although much research has been conducted on its prevention and treatment. It has been recognized as a hereditary disease, the genes causing it or its mode of inheritance are not yet known. Because of the significant role they play in metabolism of glucose, several genes have suggested, but the main cause of the disease has not yet been identified. Our objective is to investigate the epidemic aspects of the hereditary diabetes in people aged 20 years and over.
Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on 14687 subjects, in the urban setting of east Tehran between 1379 and 1380. Of 407 families, 180 agreed to and completed related questionnaires and underwent the necessary tests; 180 diabetic families, with at least one member suffering from diabetes type 2, were studied closely in order to clarify the degree of spread and family background. Analysis was performed using Chi Square and t-test.
Results: Of 1612 subjects, 497 had diabetes, including 802 women and 792 men (p<0. 001). Most of the diabetics (approx. 79%) were between the ages of 41-70 years old with the highest (55.3%) and lowest (6.2%) rates in the age groups of 51-60 and 20-30 years respectively. Diabetes was more prevalent among siblings with 53% in comparison to the prevalence among offsprings-44%. The prevalence of Diabetes type 2 in first-degree relatives was more frequent between sister and brother (52.7%), followed by that between father and daughter (36%).
Conclusion: It is recommended that the related authorities implement strategies, including screening of families, with a view to identify those at risk and reduce related complications.

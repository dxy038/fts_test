ABSTRACT: Persian Cumin, a medicinal and aromatic plant, belongs to Apiaceae family. The objective of this study was to assess the chemical variation of Persian Cumin essential oil in native populations collected from Kerman province using gas chromatography method. The Persian Cumin fruits were collected from 43 various regions in Kerman province of iran. Essential oils were extracted from fruits using hydro distillationmethod. To assess chemical variation among the populations, all essential oils were analyzed using Gas Chromatograph (GC). In order to cluster Black Cumin populations, the data were analyzed using SPSS (Ver. 12.0) software. So, squared Euclidean distance, agglomerative hierarchical algorithm and within-group average linkage were used for cluster analysis. Then, the dendrogram has been plotted and the various populations were grouped in 6 clusters. For better explanation of the diversity, factor analysis has performed.The results of factor analysis showed that the 18 factors contributed 87/5% of total variations in the populations.The volatile oil content was varied from 1.8 to 4.6% (v/w). The results arise from chemical analysis of essential oils indicated that qualitative and quantitative differences are existed in various populations. This variation may be due to genetic, environmental differences or both of them. These results are valuable for using in breeding programs of Persian cumin.

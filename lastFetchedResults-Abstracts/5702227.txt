There are three separate power control algorithms utilized in the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS). They are Point-to-Point, Group, and Common-Channel. Although MUOS is largely based on Third Generation Project Partnership (3GPP) standards, a unique non-standard group network capability is provided in the system. This point-to-multipoint capability requires a novel dedicated Group Power Control algorithm to serve the requirements of multiple users sharing the same base-to-user RF link. The algorithm has a primary objective of minimizing satellite downlink power requirements, but must also manage bandwidth utilization of the uplink signaling channel and consider system processing requirements. While there are multiple Common Control Channels with various transmission methods, only the Forward Access Channel (FACH) uses a power control algorithm. This algorithm is the R<sub>&#194;&#191;</sub> Procedure used in both the Group and FACH at the User Equipment (UE). This paper describes the Group and Common-Channel power control algorithms together with simulation results using time-varying channel models specified by the MUOS program office.

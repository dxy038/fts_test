Problems of water appropriate delivery correct Planning for the proper distribution needs indifferent parts of drinking water, agriculture and more are one of the reasons for poor performance of optimization operation of water resources projects. These problems lead to high operational losses and miss-match of water delivery with water requirements. The use of analytical and optimization methods could resolve some of these difficulties. Water delivery planning for optimization operation is a complex, multi-variable, and multi-constraint problem, which requires powerful optimization methods to be solved. Classical optimization methods are facing some limitations such as: being trapped in local optimum points, and difficulties in handling different variables. To overcome some of these limitations, new techniques which can solve complex problems could be used. In the paper two of these methods, particle Swarm optimization and genetic algorithms are introduced and their efficiency in optimization reservoir operation problems is compared. objective function downstream water issue needs to establish relationships based on continuity were selected. Comparison of two models in four different populations 100, 200, 300 and 400 showed that the PSO algorithm with average best objective function value of 190.44, 188.34, 187.07 and 187.04 the number of objective function evaluation less than genetic algorithm with objective function value of 193.96, 191.03, 188.23 and 187.94 with a number of further evaluation of the objective function to achieve higher capacity is the optimum answer.

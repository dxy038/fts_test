Background and Objective: This research investigated the relationship between faculty members’ prioritization of their job responsibilities and their performance quality from students’ point of view at Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences as a structural equation model. 
Materials and Methods: 108 Faculty members and 324 students at Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences and Hygienic were selected randomly through simple random sampling.  The instruments were occupational measurement of tutors and a questionnaire to evaluate the performance quality of educational bureau members. Statistical methods were repeated measures variance analysis, one sample t-test and structural equation model.
Results: First of all, faculty members' highest priority of their job responsibilities was scholarship. Then, Faculty members' performance quality was evaluated higher than average and  lower than optimum level. Finally, Faculty members' priorities in teaching and supervision were significant predicators of students' positive evaluation of their educational performance quality and faculty members' priorities in scholarship and social services were significant predicators of students’ negative evaluation of their educational performance quality.

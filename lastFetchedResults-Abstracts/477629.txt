Objective: This study was undertaken to investigate the utility of an admission battery of findings and laboratory data in the discrimination of patients with severe preeclampsia with or without HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet count) syndrome at high risk for development of significant maternal morbidity. Study Design: The clinical and laboratory findings at hospital admission for 970 patients with severe preeclampsia with or without HELLP syndrome were studied retrospectively to develop parameters associated with low, moderate, and high risks for the subsequent development of significant maternal morbidity involving the hematologic and coagulation, cardiopulmonary, and hepatorenal systems. Results: Nausea and vomiting and epigastric pain are independent risk factors for complicated severe preeclampsia. Results of a panel of tests with values including lactate dehydrogenase level >1400 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase level >150 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase level >100 IU/L, uric acid level >7.8 mg/dL, serum creatinine level >1.0 mg/dL, and 4+ urinary protein by dipstick can be used to discriminate the patient at high risk for significant maternal morbidity. Concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and uric acid above these cut points have the strongest predictive value and are risk additive with worsening thrombocytopenia. Conclusion: The presence of nausea and vomiting, epigastric pain, or both in association with admission laboratory values that are in excess of the cutoffs for lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and uric acid concentrations or for all 6 tests is predictive of high risk of morbidity for the patient with severe preeclampsia. These factors are independent of and additive with the rising maternal risk associated with decreasing platelet count. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:1407-14.)

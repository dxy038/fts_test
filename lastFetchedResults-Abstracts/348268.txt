Objective
To examine the effect of contractile level on motor unit number estimates (MUNEs) and establish the contraction intensity that will yield the most representative MUNE for the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle.
Methods
Surface and intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) signals were collected during a range of submaximal (threshold, 10, 20, 30 and 40% MVC) isometric dorsiflexion contractions using decomposition-enhanced spike-triggered averaging (DE-STA). Six MUNEs were calculated, one for each of the five intensities, and an ensemble sixth MUNE that had equal MU contributions from all intensities.
Results
Mean surface-motor unit potential sizes increased significantly (26–69 μV) and MUNEs decreased accordingly (226-91) as contraction intensity increased from threshold to 40% MVC, respectively (P<0.05). The ensemble MUNE was 153, and extrapolated to  25% MVC.
Conclusions
There was a significant and progressive decline in the MUNE as contraction intensity increased, confirming the importance of monitoring torque during data collection. The ensemble MUNE suggests that collecting EMG signals at a contraction intensity of  25% MVC provides the most representative sample of the actual number and sizes of MUs in the TA.
Significance
Establishing appropriate contraction intensities improves the utility of DE-STA as a useful method for tracking changes to the MU pool in disease states and healthy aging.

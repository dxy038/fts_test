This paper reports some of the findings in a project at Loughborough University in the UK. An objective of the work has been to create a pass band square spiral Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) onto waveguides attached on walls to increase productivity and efficiency through enhancing received signal power. The FSS is simulated by Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio (MWS). Remcom `Wireless InSiteÂ´ is used to simulate indoor propagation and to predict the performance. The concept has been tested in real room. Significant improvements are shown using an innovative model.

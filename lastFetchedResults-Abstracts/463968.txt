Objective: This study was designed to compare the results of preliminary evaluation, ovarian hyperstimulation, and monitoring of patients at a distant in vitro fertilization satellite center with those treated at the main campus of the program.
Study design: Fifty-four patients completing oocyte retrieval cycles at the Eugene satellite Oregon Health Sciences University in vitro fertilization program for the period Jan. 1, 1991, through Dec. 31, 1993, were compared with 222 patients at the main campus for age, peak estradiol level, number of oocytes, retrieved, number of embryos, clinical pregnancy rate, and pregnancy outcome.
Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the Eugene in vitro fertilization satellite center and the main campus for any of the factors analyzed with the exception of clinical pregnancy rate. The clinical pregnancy rate per cycle at the Eugene satellite center was 39% while the Portland main campus rate was 23% (p = 0.027), presumably because of a larger number of couples with severe male factor infertility at the central site.
Conclusion: A distant in vitro fertilization satellite program was highly successful in the Oregon experience. In addition to greater convenience to the patients, the program was highly comparable to main campus program in measured parameters of ovarian hyperstimulation, oocyte retrieval, number of embryos, and pregnancy rate

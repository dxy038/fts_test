Objective
Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is a precursor of invasive disease that is being more frequently diagnosed during the reproductive years. Few reports have described the treatment of this condition in gravid women. The purpose of this study was to review our collective experience managing cervical AIS during pregnancy.
Study design
Retrospective medical record review of all women diagnosed with AIS during pregnancy from 1995 to 2004 at 3 academic institutions.
Results
Eleven women with a median age of 32 years were identified. Five who received a diagnosis in the early second trimester underwent uncomplicated cold knife conization (CKC) at 14 to 19 weeks' gestation. Six patients underwent postpartum CKC. All 11 women delivered at term. One patient undergoing postpartum CKC required radical hysterectomy for stage IB1 cervical adenocarcinoma. Four subsequent pregnancies occurred among patients having fertility-sparing surgery.
Conclusion
Management of cervical AIS during pregnancy by early second trimester CKC is safe for mother and fetus.

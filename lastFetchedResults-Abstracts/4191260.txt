This paper outlines the main results of the REAKT and REAKT II ESPRIT projects (EP 5146 and 7805). The primary objective of those projects was to develop a set of tools and the associated methodology for applying knowledge-based systems in real-time domains. Two REAKT applications which we think are typical of the kind of real-time knowledge-based systems that can be developed with REAKT are presented. The first application is an online alarm management system which has been running for about one year in a large oil refinery in Italy. This application was developed within the REAKT project to act as a demonstrator for the project results. The second application is a prototype mobile robot system, currently being developed at CRIN-INRIA

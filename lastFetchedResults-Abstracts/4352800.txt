The planar phased array, due to its low profile and beam agility, has been proposed as one of the land vehicle antennas for the U.S. Mobile Satellite Experiment (MSAT-X) program. The objective is to develop medium gain satellite tracking antennas (as versus omni low gain antennas) that will alleviate the spacecraft power burden through higher gain, and enable multiple-satellite operation in the same frequency band through narrower beam. In addition, this narrower beam can spatially filter out a significant portion of the undesired multipath component. The major challenges are to seek technologies that will minimize the antenna insertion loss, achieve accurate beam pointing with sufficient inter-satellite isolation, and minimize the antenna production cost.

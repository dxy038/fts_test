The clean development mechanism (CDM) has the objective to support developing countries in achieving a sustainable development path, while at the same time assisting industrialized countries in achieving their Kyoto Protocol commitments. Actual practice shows that CDM technology transfers are largely focused on reducing GHG emissions at lowest cost and less on the domestic development needs and priorities of the host countries. This paper discusses an approach to facilitate low-carbon energy technology transfer compatible with the energy development needs and priorities of developing countries. The results reported here are concerned with the relation between the transfer of low-carbon energy technologies and the perceived needs and priorities for low-carbon technologies in the country context. The study has provided insights on improving the CDM for technology transfer in accordance with host countries’ development priorities and has been applied to Chile, China, Israel, Kenya and Thailand. It forms the first stage of an overall approach for facilitating low-carbon technology transfer under the UNFCCC. The second stage of the study is reported elsewhere [ENTTRANS, 2008.

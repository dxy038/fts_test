Wireless sensor networks have been attracting a great attention due to their wide range of potential applications. However, due to various limitations arising from their inexpensive nature, limited size, weight and ad hoc method of deployment, the power consumption is one of the major constraints in sensor networks. Moreover, it is well known that packet communication dominates the power consumption in wireless sensor network. Therefore, it is very desirable to reduce the amount of packet transmission as much as possible. Network coding can achieve this by improving network throughput. Thus, recently researchers have been emphasizing on how wireless sensor networks can get benefits from network coding. AdapCode is one of the available works which apply the practical network coding to the wireless sensor networks. However, AdapCode has some limitations. It cannot find out all actual neighbour nodes which is critical in determining the new coding scheme. In this paper, thus, we enhance the AdapCode by deploying the power efficient neighbour discovery protocol to find out all the neighbours. Our objective is to develop a data dissemination protocol that promises the full advantage of network coding by deploying the power efficient neighbour discovery protocol.

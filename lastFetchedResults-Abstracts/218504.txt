
Objective: lododeoxyuridine-induced Radiosensitivityi (IUdR) is a
halogenated thymidine analogue recognized to be effective in vitro and
in vivo radiosensitizer in human cancers. It is reported that Methoxyamine (MX)
potentiates DNA damages in cancer cells with blocking the repair pathway of
IUdR damages. But studies. entirely, are restricted on monolayer culture cells
from human colon cancer cells. Spheroids are 3D form of cells that aggregate
and grow together which resemble in vivo tumor models in several aspects and
the the results of such studies can be extended to tumor in vivo. The aim of the
current study was to evaluate DNA damages from IUdR and gamma rays with
and without Methoxyamine in human Glioblastoma spheroids.
Materials and Methods: The DNA induced damages in U87MG cell line were
compared using alkaline comet assay method. Experiments were performed
with two different sizes of spheroids (100mu m and 300mu m).
Results: Evaluation of the effects of IUdR with and without MX pretreatment
on spheroids following ionizing radiation showed that MX increased the cell
damages of IUdR with and without irradiation in both diameters spheroids. The
damages were further increased in 100mu m compared with 300mu m diameter.
Conclusion: Comparisons of tail moments in spheroids with 100 and 300mu m
diameter showed that cell damages in larger spheroids. 300mu m. are lesser
than smaller one, 100~m. This could be due to existence of Go cells and cells
with longer cycle which IUdR was less incorporated into them. Thus, decrease
in IUdR radiosensitization and base wxcision repair (BER). results in reduction
of MX activities. Using agents for Inhibiting the activities of proteins which
are responsible for carrying the cells to Go may be beneficial in solving such
problems.

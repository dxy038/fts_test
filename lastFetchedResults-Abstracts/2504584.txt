Background: Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is one of the most common health complications with a strong genetic component. Several genetic disorders were identified as etiological factors of hereditary X linked RSA. However, more genetic factors remain to be identified.
Objective: In this study we performed linkage analysis on a large X linked RSA pedigree to find a novel susceptibility locus for RSA. 
Materials and Methods: A linkage scan using 11 microsatellites was performed in 27 members of a large pedigree of hereditary X-linked RSA. Two point parametric Linkage was performed using Superlink v 1.6 program.
Results: Evidence of linkage was observed to markers at Xq23, DXS7133 and at Xq22.1 DXS101, with LOD score of 3.12 and 1.60, respectively.
Conclusion: Identified locus in this study may carry a responsible gene in RSA. Narrowing down of this region may leads to identification of this gene.

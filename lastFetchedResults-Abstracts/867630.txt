The objective of this paper is to design a weekly surgery schedule in an operating theatre where time
blocks are reserved for surgeons rather than specialities. Both operating rooms and places in the recovery
room are assumed to be multifunctional, and the objectives are to maximise the utilisation of the operating
rooms, to minimise the overtime cost in the operating theatre, and to minimise the unexpected idle
time between surgical cases. This weekly operating theatre planning and scheduling problem is solved in
two phases. First, the planning problem is solved to give the date of surgery for each patient, allowing for
the availability of operating rooms and surgeons. Then a daily scheduling problem is devised to determine
the sequence of operations in each operating room in each day, taking into account the availability
of recovery beds. The planning problem is described as a set-partitioning integer-programming model
and is solved by a column-generation-based heuristic (CGBH) procedure. The daily scheduling problem,
based on the results obtained in the planning phase, is treated as a two-stage hybrid flow-shop problem
and solved by a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). Our results are compared with several actual surgery
schedules in a Belgian university hospital, where time blocks have been assigned to either specific surgeons
or specialities several months in advance. According to the comparison results, surgery schedules
obtained by the proposed method have less idle time between surgical cases, much higher utilisation of
operating rooms and produce less overtime.

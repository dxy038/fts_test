In this paper, the security communication system that works on a high-performance statues is constructed with Chua´s circuits. Chua´s circuit is paradigm circuit of chaotic system, which exhibits a variety of chaotic behaviors. A synthesized signal in the improved circuit servers as masking signal in security communication system is got through prodding the signals of Chua´s circuit, which is a simple and efficient way to improve Chua´s circuit. A new four wings butterfly attractor is witnessed in the improved circuit, which is more chaotic and complex comparing to the &#8220;Double Scroll&#8221; attractor. The simulation result of synchronizing the improved Chua´s circuits turns out the improved circuits can be easy controlled by using bidirectional coupling synchronization. Inspired by the improvement and synchronization of Chua´s circuit, the security communication system is constructed with two groups of synchronized Chua´s circuits that can reproduce the improved signal which serve as the masking signal of it. The evaluation of this system with a sawtooth signal shows this system is work at a high performance of security status. As this system is flexible, expandable and easy to be achieved with electronic elements, DSP and other integrated digital circuits, it is quite worthy of a further study.

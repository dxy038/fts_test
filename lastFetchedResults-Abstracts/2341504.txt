Objective
Infantile spasms (IS) are among the most catastrophic epileptic syndromes
of infancy. The purpose of this study was to compare efficacy and safety of
topiramate (TPM) and nitrazepam (NZP) as first-line drugs in the treatment of
IS.
Materials & Methods
In a parallel single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 50 patients with IS referred
to Pediatric Neurology Clinic of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical
Sciences, Yazd, Iran, were evaluated from September 2008 to March 2010.
Patients were randomly assigned to two groups to be treated with TPM or with
NZP for 6 months. The primary endpoint was efficacy in cessation of all spasms
or reduction of more than 50% in weekly seizure frequency, which was evaluated
before and 6 months after the drug use. Secondary outcome was clinical sideeffects
of the drugs.
Results
Twenty boys (40%) and 30 girls (60%) with the mean age of 9.4Â±3.8 months
were evaluated. Cessation of all spasms occurred in 12 (48%) infants in TPM
group and 4(16%) in NZP group. Eight (32%) children in TPM group and 7
(28%) in NZP group had more than 50% reduction in spasms frequency. So,
TPM was more effective. Side effects were seen in 32% of TPM and in 36% of
NZP groups.
Conclusion
Topiramate is an effective and safe drug, which might be considered as the firstline
drug for the treatment of ISs.

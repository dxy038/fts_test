The electrostatic precipitator widely used in the power plant is the highly-efficient environment protection facility. The structure of large-scale electrostatic precipitator is complex, and it is under the complex load cases. ItÂ´s difficult for the traditional structural calculation theorem to complete the structural analysis and optimizing design accurately. Generally, the satisfied solution can be obtained by finite element method. As the nozzle takes up a small proportion of steel consumption and its design method has reached maturity, the nozzle is not the emphasis of structural analysis and optimization. Consequently, a simplified computing model is investigated which substitutes an equivalent frame for the nozzle when the finite element analysis is conducted. By this method, the nozzle is not built in the model and the constraints applied to casing by the nozzle are considered by the equivalent frame. Thus, the modeling procedure can be simplified and the computing efficiency is greatly heightened. The basic idea of constituting the equivalent frame is that the configuration and the component members of equivalent frame are determined by the procedure of repetition adjustments and the subsequent testing computations. The objective frame should ensure the deformation occurring on the contacting edge of nozzle with casing computed by the model with nozzle to be approximately equal to that computed by the simplified model under the same load, which can realize the assumption that the equivalent frame has the same constraints on casing as nozzle. The design method of equivalent frame proposed in this paper can ensure the frame to simulate the nozzle constraints exactly. When the simplified model adopted, the number of elements decreases by 13.8% and the computation efficiency is heightened greatly. The design method of simplified computing model can be referenced by electrostatic precipitator structural analysis and design.

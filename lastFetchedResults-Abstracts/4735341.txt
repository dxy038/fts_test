QoS guarantee in mobile ad hoc network is a challenging problem and has received much attention. Although the access policy with reservation of TDMA can support some QoS services, the extra delay introduced by its time multiplexed communication make it can not be adapted to large scale network. To solve the problem, we propose a heuristic optimal delay routing algorithm which chooses delay as the routing objective function. The algorithm takes into account the effect of static cost as well as congestion cost on the flow forwarding and in turn to balance the traffic load. The simulation results show that the algorithm can significantly reduce the end-to-end delay and can be taken as a promising solution for realizing multimedia application in ad hoc network.

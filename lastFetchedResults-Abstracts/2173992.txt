Epidemiological studies have suggested that lycopene has protective effects against various diseases including cardiovascular diseases. However, mechanistic studies to understand these effects are difficult due to the insolubility of lycopene in aqueous culture medium. The objective of the present study was to use LDL or BSA as physiological vehicles for lycopene and to compare them with various classical vehicles.

tested vehicles, only LDL, BSA, THF/BHT, beadlets, and liposomes were able to solubilise lycopene. No cytotoxicity was observed with these vehicles. LDL and BSA allowed good stability of lycopene during incubation (52% and 43% for 2 μM lycopene solutions), but remained less efficient than THF/BHT or beadlets (67% and 62%). Incubation of adipocytes (3T3-L1) with the different vehicles for 24 and 48 h showed that beadlets best delivered lycopene to cells. Finally, whatever the vehicle used, intracellular localization of lycopene was the same: lipid droplets (32–51%), plasma membrane (32–37%) and nuclear membrane (19–29%). As a conclusion, LDL or BSA display comparable properties to THF/BHT or beadlets. It is the first time that lycopene carried by physiological vehicles is shown to reach different subcellular compartments supporting molecular effects in adipocyte, such as cell signaling or nuclear receptor interacting.

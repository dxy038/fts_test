Background: Prepubertal varicocele has the most devastating effects on the testes. Oxidative stress is the major cause leading to infertility in varicocele. The antioxidant properties of Flaxseed (FS) treatment in some oxidative diseases have been reported. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant effect of FS in prepubertal rats with experimental varicocele. Materials and Methods: Forty two male prepubertal rats were divided into 6 groups: the varicocele group were either fed with 10% FS, or with regular diet, or with Vit E, the group with sham operation fed with 10% FS, or had regular diet, and control rats who had not been operated but received regular diet. Varicocele was created by Koksal method. After 6 weeks sperm superoxide anion and H2O2 were evaluated by flowcytometery. Semen total antioxidant capacity (TAC) by Koracevic method and testes malondialdehyde (MDA) by thiobarbituric acid with spectrophotometry was measured. Results: While superoxide anion and H2O2 were significantly higher in varicocele grop with regular diet (p=0.0001), FS significantly decreased the previously-mentioned parameters (p=0.0001). There were no significant differences for seminal TAC between 6 groups (p=0.07). Left testicular MDA concentration were lower in varicocele or group that were fed with 10% FS compared with other groups (p=0.001). Conclusion: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may cause sperm oxidative damage. FS as a fat soluble antioxidant can scavenge intracellular ROS production in varicocele.

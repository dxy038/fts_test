Eco-industrial chain in mining area is divided into production eco-industrial chain, surplus eco-industrial chain and energy eco-industrial chain, and the paper points out that the structure of eco-industry in mining area is made up of precursor industry, transmission industry and bottom industry. Based on above research, the four on-link modes of eco-industry in mining area have been constructed creatively and the structural characteristics of eco-industrial chain in mining area have been described systematically. Multi-objective Linear Optimal Model is set up based on industrial scale optimization of eco-industrial chain in mining area. The paper also puts forward some measures to take.

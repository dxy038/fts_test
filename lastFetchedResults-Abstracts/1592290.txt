A cross sectional study was conducted from September, 2011 up to December, 2011 in South West Showa zone, in Woliso Woreda, Oromia state with the objective of determining the prevalence of bovine Trypanosomiasis. 384 animals were included in the study and hematological examination was conducted to detect the presence of Trypanosome parasites. During the study, from a total of 196 male animals examined, 17 animals (8.67%) were positive to Trypanasomasis whereas from a total of 188 female animals examined 13 animals (6.91%) were positive to Trypanosome. Even though the prevalence of Trypanosomiasis was relatively higher in male individuals than female individuals there was no significant difference between sexes groups (p > 0.05). The overall prevalence of Trypanosomiasis was 7.81%. From a total of Trypanasoma positive animals 28(7.29%) was positive to T.vivax, and 2(0.005%) of them was positive to T. connglense.  The prevalence of Trypanosome based on body conditions score were 28 (36%) in poor body condition, 2 (0.92%) in medium body condition and 0 (0%) in good body conditions. statistically significant difference among body condition scoring (p < 0.05) was observed. The highest to lowest prevalence rate was recorded in animal age groups of  > 6 years (11.6%),  < 2 years (7.4%), 4-6 years (3.86%) and 2-4 years (3.7%).  Statistically there was no significant difference among age group (p > 0.05). prevalence of Trypanosome in each  peasant association revealed that, abado-lamen 11.39%,  gurura- baka 10%, chirecha- wanber 8.42% , chafe -mekana 7.24%, and dire-duleti 2.46% .Although there was a slight difference in the prevalence of Trypanosomiasis among the peasant associations there was no significant difference  (p > 0.05) among them. Packed cell volume was determined by using haematocrit centrifuge and a mean PCV value of 27.1% was recorded.

A detailed study on the removal of pollutants (NOx, aldehydes and CO) from the exhaust of a stationary diesel engine is carried out using barrier discharge hybrid plasma techniques. The objective of the study is to make a comparative analysis. For this purpose, the exhaust treatment was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the exhaust was treated with plasma process and plasma-adsorbent hybrid process. The effectiveness of the two processes with regard to NOx removal and by-product reduction was discussed. In the second stage, the exhaust was treated by plasma and plasma-catalyst hybrid process. The effectiveness of the two processes with regard to pollutants (NOx, CO) removal and by-product reduction was analyzed. Finally, a comprehensive comparison of different techniques has been made and feasible plasma based hybrid techniques for stationary and non-stationary engine exhaust treatments were proposed.

A bidirectional lightwave 100 km transmission system capable of delivering 80 cable television (CATV) analogue video signals using conventional singlemode fibre (SMF) or large effective area fibre (LEAF) has been demonstrated experimentally for the first time. Elimination of both Rayleigh backscattered crosstalk from the opposite-direction signal and amplified spontaneous emission noise is required to improve the system carrier-to-noise ratio. Satisfactory system performance can be achieved regardless of whether an SMF or LEAF 100 km link is used. However, the composite second-order quality of the LEAF link is superior to that of the SMF link. This technology should play an important role in leased fibre links for trunk delivery between any two multiple system operators across another CATV-operator system

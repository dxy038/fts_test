Several studies have reported that molecules extracted from invertebrates have activity against different viruses, even against those that do not infect these organisms in their environment. One of the main mechanisms against pathogens in these organisms is the production of antimicrobial peptides. The objective of this study was to determine whether the coelomic fluid (CF) of the sea urchin Tripneustes depressus has activity against Suid herpesvirus type 1 (SHV-1) and/or rabies virus (RV). We tested the antiviral activity of CF in neutralizing assays and observed 50% inhibition against SHV-1 lytic plaque formation using 33 μg of CF, whereas 21 μg CF was sufficient to obtain more than 90% inhibition for RV. Cytotoxicity to MDBK and BHK-21 cells was found with whole CF yet was eliminated by heating at 56 or 72 °C (even when using 50 μg of heat-inactivated CF supernatant [SN or thermostable fraction]), and SN retained the antiviral effect. In both cases, the antiviral effect was direct and thermostable (SN 56 and 72 °C), and the best inhibition was observed when CF + virus was incubated prior to the addition of the cells. Therefore, the coelomic fluid of T. depressus has antiviral activity against SHV-1 and RV that is direct and stable at 72 °C. We suggest that further assays should be performed using more accurate methods to characterize new molecules with antiviral activity that may result in new drugs.

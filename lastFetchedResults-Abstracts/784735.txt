Objective: As women age total dietary intake falls which may increase the risk of dietary deficiencies in
some individuals. The aims of this study were to investigate the changes in nutrient and dietary intakes that
occurred with aging in a seven-year longitudinal study of elderly Australian women and to evaluate the adequacy
of their dietary intakes. Design: Longitudinal population based study on health with ageing. Participants and
setting: 911 free-living elderly women aged 70-85 years at baseline from a cohort of 1500 elderly women.
Measurements: At baseline, 60 and 84 months, self-reported Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ) and
demographics were collected and anthropometry measured. Results: During the 84 month subjects lost height
(1.8 cm) and body weight (1.9 kg). Intakes of energy and macronutrients carbohydrate, fat and protein declined
significantly over the 84 months. Mean energy derived from saturated fat was above, whereas energy derived
from carbohydrate was below, recommended levels of intake at all time points. Intakes of vitamins and minerals
all declined with age and subjects had suboptimal intakes of folate, vitamin E and calcium at all time points. The
serve sizes for potato and meat and the consumption of milk, bread and variety of vegetables declined
significantly over time reflecting changes in nutrient intake. Conclusions: Ageing is associated with reduced food
intake resulting in inadequate intakes in energy, and some nutrients. Nutrition policy for elderly women should
include advice to maintain or increase intakes of carbohydrate, milk, vegetables and fruit whilst continuing to
reduce fat intake.

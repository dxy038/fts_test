This paper describes compact mathematical models for estimating the frequency performance and power dissipation of a microprocessor as a function of the supply voltage. The objective is to estimate the frequency and/or power performance across a wide range of supply voltages and operating frequencies using only a small number of configurable parameters and equations. These compact equations are amenable to hand calculations and spreadsheet manipulation. The configurable parameters are derived from actual measurements of microprocessor chips and are calculated using the least-squares curve-fitting method.

This paper presents the state of the art in the field of Image Quality Assessment (IQA), providing a classification of some of the most important objective and subjective IQA methods. Furthermore, some aspects of the field are analysed from a metrological point of view, also through comparison with the software quality measurement area. In particular, a statistical approach to the evaluation of the uncertainty for IQA objective methods is presented and an example is provided. The topic of measurement modelling for subjective IQA methods is also analysed. Finally, a case study of images corrupted by impulse noise is discussed.

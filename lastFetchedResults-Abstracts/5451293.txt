The large-signal control problem in bidirectional switching converters is analyzed. After modeling a bidirectional Cuk converter as a bilinear system, the integration of converter state equations and the subsequent introduction of a linear recurrence between the output variable and an external reference signal leads to a nonlinear control law which is implemented by means of one analog divider, standard operational amplifiers and a pulse-width modulator. As a result, the output variable proportionally follows the reference signal. This allows the availability of different types of power waveforms in the converter output

The objective of this work is to characterize the various deformations to which dough is subjected during kneading, and to investigate the influence of mixer configurations and operating conditions. Several kneader geometries are modeled as representative of the mixing mechanisms taking place in various mixers. Based on the time-dependent velocity fields obtained, the type of deformation taking place in the mixers is characterized using relevant kinematic flow classification parameters. These parameters are then related to the mechanical action of the kneader. The results for the practical design of dough kneaders can be applied, and a complementary experimental program should fit within the design cycle.

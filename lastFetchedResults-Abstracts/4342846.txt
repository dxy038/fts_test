Wind energy is produced at random times, whereas the energy consumption pattern shows distinct demand peaks during day-time and low levels during the night. The use of a refrigerated warehouse as a giant battery for wind energy is a new possibility that is being studied for wind energy integration as well as a way to store electricity produced during night-time by wind turbines. The controller for load management in a refrigerated warehouse with wind power penetration by GA-based is introduced in this paper. The objective function is to minimize the energy consumption for operating the refrigerated warehouse. It can be seen that the GA-based control strategy achieves feasible results for operating the temperature in refrigerated warehouse. Balancing the wind power production with refrigerated warehouse load management promises to be a clean and cost effective method. For refrigerated warehouse owners, it has the potential to lower operational costs.

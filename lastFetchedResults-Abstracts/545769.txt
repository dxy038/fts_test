Objective
The associations between imperforate anus and spinal and vertebral 
abnormalities and neurologic deficits are well recognized; these neurologic 
deficits have been considered static rather than progressive. However, recent 
experience indicates that some patients may develop progressive neurologic 
problems due to spinal cord lesions that are amenable to neurosurgical 
correction. 
Materials & Methods
The medical records of 105 patients with imperforate anus, operated on by 
us, were retrospectively reviewed from 1996 to 2005. Patientâ€™s sex, anorectal 
type lesion and vertebral or spinal anomalies were determined by ultrasound, 
excretory urography, voiding cystouretherography (VCUG) and lumbosacral 
x-ray.
Results
A hundred and five cases, consisting 48  (45.7%) boys and 57  (54.3%) girls, 
with anorectal malformations were studied; 70 patients were in high and 
intermediate type level, and totally 25 patients (35.7%) with spinal and vertebral 
anomalies were found in this group.
Conclusion
All patients with anorectal malformations (ARM) should be investigated for 
spinal and vertebral anomalies to improve treatment outcomes in ARM.

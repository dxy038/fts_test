At Ghent University Hospital, IMRT for head and neck cancer is routinely performed. The desired dose distribution is defined upfront as a range of acceptable doses assigned to each voxel of volumes of interest. It was found important to specify the range of acceptable doses separately to areas of the PTV either in or outside the buildup zone as well as to areas which do or do not intersect with PTV-dose limiting organs at risk (OAR). To avoid high doses at distance from the PTV, the creation of a “surrounding” OAR which is the whole scanned volume minus the PTV was found efficient, especially if inside this OAR, subvolumes were created at increasing distance from the PTV. By specifying inside these subvolumes maximum dose constraints which decreased with distance from the PTV, conformality is secured. The creation of these additional PTV and OAR subvolumes allows comprehensive and unambiguous definition of the range of acceptable doses and thereby avoids user-interactive assignment of weights to the terms of the objective function during optimization. The efficiency of inverse planning is highly improved. Its outcome is predictable, plan evaluation is objective as the plan either does or does not comply with the predefined range of acceptable doses. Accurate reporting of the planned dose distribution is facilitated by description of the dose range to all volumes. The expense of this procedure is modest and lays mostly 1) in the creation of the subvolumes, which can be done semi-automatically by modern image segmentation tools and 2) in the inclusion of constraints to all subvolumes into the objective function.

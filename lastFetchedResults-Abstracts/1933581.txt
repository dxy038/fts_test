Spermatozoa acquire their motility and fertilizing ability during their passage through the epididymal canal. In the epididymal caput and corpus spermatozoa undergo several biochemical and metabolic changes while the cauda of the epididymis should be considered as the primarily site for storage of the spermatozoa. In the horse spermatozoa from cauda epididymis were collected and frozen, and the fertility of semen assessed. However, no studies have detailed semen characteristics of spermatozoa collected from the cauda epididymis in the jackass. In this study sperm characteristics of spermatozoa in the cauda epididymis of the donkey was reported and a comparison with ejaculated spermatozoal characteristics was performed. Samples from 10 Martina Franca jackasses were collected and analyzed for viability (Propidium iodide/Sybr-14® fluorescent stain), mitochondrial activity (Mitotraker® fluorescent stain), objective motility characteristics (by Computer Assisted Sperm Analyzer – CASA) and morphology. A higher viability and mitochondrial activity in the cauda epididymis samples were reported in this paper. Samples reported in this paper were identified and the percentage of total and progressive spermatozoa was comparable, but trajectories were more rapid (higher VCL) with less progressiveness (higher ALH and lower STR and LIN) in the cauda epididymis. Sperm morphology showed a pronounced variability between jackasses, with comparable values for all morphological subclasses. In this study the loss of the distal cytoplasmic droplets happen close to or after ejaculation because the percentage fell to nearly 0% after ejaculation. As suggested for bulls, the presence of a similar percentage in sperm with proximal cytoplasmic droplet in epididymal and ejaculated semen is likely to indicate a failure in the maturation process.

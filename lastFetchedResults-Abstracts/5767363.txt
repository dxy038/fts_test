Currently considerable attention has been given to the effect of data correlation on statistical process control (SPC). Use of traditional SPC methods when observations are correlated often leads to misleading conclusions as to whether or not the process is under control. The objective of this paper is to develop an algorithm to adjust a Dynamic Linear Model, to calculate the run length distribution (RLD), the average run length (ARL), standard deviation of the run length (SRL), for residual control charts X macr and R. The algorithm is applied to data collected from a textile company. The results showed that the process had been out of control needing systematic monitoring, with the objective of improving the quality of the products.

Fungi colonizing senescent chickpea (Cicer arietinum)
stems and postharvest debris from Pullman, WA, were
enumerated and identified with the objective of finding
species potentially useful for biological control of
Didymella rabiei (conidial state Â¼ Ascochyta rabiei),
causal agent of Ascochyta blight. In addition to
D. rabiei, primary colonizers were, in order of decreasing
abundance, Alternaria tenuissima, Al. infectoria,
Ulocladium consortiale, Epicoccum purpurascens,
U. atrum and Fusarium pseudograminearum. Present at
lower frequencies were Al. malorum, Cladosporium herbarum,
Aureobasidium pullulans, Clonostachys rosea
and miscellaneous anamorphic ascomycetes. On agar
media and autoclaved chickpea stems, Au. pullulans
consistently grew faster than As. rabiei, and excluded
As. rabiei from the substrate. When stems received
prior inoculation with Au. pullulans or Cl. rosea, followed
by inoculation with compatible mating types of
D. rabiei, formation of pseudothecia and pycnidia of
D. rabiei was suppressed. Results suggest that
Au. pullulans and Cl. rosea can inhibit As. rabiei and
its sexual stage, D. rabiei, on chickpea debris. Clonostachys
rosea formed appressoria on, then invaded,
hyphae of D. rabiei. Small-scale field experiments using
Au. pullulans and Cl. rosea have been initiate

This paper proposes fault-tolerant (FT) operation of a single-switch dc-dc converter under a switch failure. In order to improve the reliability in critical applications, FT operation is mandatory to guarantee service continuity. The FT operation of a power system can be performed in three steps: fault diagnosis (detection and identification) and remedial actions. In the case of a switch failure, suitable fault detection is essential to avoid its propagation to the whole system. This study is based on a fast and efficient open- and short-circuit switch fault diagnosis. Both types of switch failure can be detected, identified, and handled in real time by implementing fault diagnosis and reconfiguration strategies on a field-programmable gate array target. No additional sensor is required to perform the fault detection. A redundant switch and a bidirectional switch are needed for converter reconfiguration in postfault operation. The results of hardware-in-the-loop and experimental tests, which all confirm the good performances of the proposed approach, are presented and discussed.

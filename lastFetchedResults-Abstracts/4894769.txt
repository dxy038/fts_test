It is shown how a fractionally spaced transversal canceler with five taps is capable of providing large improvement factors in channel situations of practical significance, including large delay differences. How the capability of counteracting the depolarization depends on the performance of the adaptive equalizer in the system is shown using a realistic channel model with bidirectional crosstalk. For an optimum system configuration, a matching between the equalizer and canceler capability is necessary. This has been verified experimentally for a 140 Mb/s system employing 16 QAM and operating with plesiochronous data streams.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

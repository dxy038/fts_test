The identification and measurement of inhibition zones and the calculation of their key parameters are critical aspects to the work of the quality of inhibition zone measurement device. For current inhibition zone measurement systems having some deficiency such as low processing speed, inability to identify conjoined objects and precision decline when inhibition zone deforms, an algorithm is proposed in this paper. This algorithm can convert a multi-target identification problem to single-target one adaptively by using the information from bidirectional histograms, and can avoid most of interferences from deformation points by extracting a limited number of isometric candidate point-pairs from the inhibition zone contour and configuring non-isometric constrain. Test results show that this algorithm not only has an equivalent ability with traditional algorithm in identifying normal inhibition zones, but also has a significantly better effect in identifying and measuring sunken, extruded, conjoined or other distorted inhibition zones. And the processing speed is forty times faster than before.

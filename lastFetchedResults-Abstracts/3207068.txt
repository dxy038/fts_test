Power companies around the world are incorporating wind power into their electricity networks. Wind power is an intermittent source of energy and their technical and financial impacts on the transmission and distribution networks are not totally known. Due to this situation, it is necessary to study the influences of wind energy on electric network. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of wind energy on power systems reliability and operating reserve associated with wind power. The uncertainty of the wind power output means that operating reserves from conventional sources are needed. Different reliability models of power systems are presented. The paper presents a method of Monte Carlo simulation combined with Frequency &amp; Duration method. The combination has proven to give an effective modeling for estimating system reliability and operating reserves for system with wind power. Computational results of a sample system will be included to support the proposed concept.

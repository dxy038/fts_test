The primary objective of the research discussed in this paper is to develop a compact electro-explosive fuse (EEF) for a flux compression generator (FCG) power conditioning system, capable of rapidly obtaining and maintaining high impedance. It was observed that significant gains in EEF performance are introduced with the application of an insulating coating to the surface of the EEF wire. A 2 kA small scale test bed has been designed to provide a single wire EEF with similar current density (&#8764;10<sup>7</sup> A/cm<sup>2</sup>), voltage gradient (&#8764;7 kV/cm), and timescale (&#8764;8 &#956;s) as to what is seen by and EEF utilized in a HPM generating FCG system. With the small scale test bed EEF performance data was rapidly obtained at a significantly lower cost than equivalent full scale FCG experiments. A one-dimensional finite difference model coupled with the Los Alamos National Laboratory SESAME Equation-of-State database was utilized to simulate the resistive behavior of the single wire EEFs. Further, a large scale test bed, designed to provide a similar current action as to what is provided by a FCG is used to test 18 wire EEF arrays at the 40 kA level.

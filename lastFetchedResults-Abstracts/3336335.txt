We proposed a remote pumped bidirectional C+L band fiber amplifier for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) passive optical network (PON). A high-reflectivity pump reflector using three cascading fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) is designed to reflect the residual pump power for L band amplification. Both the gains for C band and L band are larger than 10.0 dB under -10 dBm launched power. Using the remote pumped bidirectional fiber amplifier, the power penalty is only 0.82dB after 10Gb/s, 24 km bi-directional transmission.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a very hazardous disease caused by infection of germ Mycobacterium, tuberculosis that can cause death to the patient. TB can spread like common flu such as through air or direct body fluid connection. Since, the manual screening process is labor intensive and time consuming, thus image processing can be implemented to improve diagnosing and analyzing of TB slide images. One of the important parts in digital image processing is image enhancement. Enhancement refers to the process of image refinement to produce better images compared to the original images in term of contrast and intensity for a specific application or set objective. In this paper, some of the general enhancement methods related to biomedical image processing especially to tuberculosis bacilli slide will be reviewed.

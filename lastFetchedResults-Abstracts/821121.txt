Background: The natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP-1) gene encodes a protein which finally kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Susceptibility to tuberculosis may be influenced by mutations in this gene. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of NRAMP-1 gene polymorphisms among tuberculosis patients and control group in Zahedan. 
Methods: This molecular epidemiologic study was conducted on 82 tuberculosis patients and 150 healthy controls referred to Booali Hospital in Zahedan, during 2012. After Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR products were treated by AvaII, FokI and ApaI restriction enzymes and were evaluated by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to determine the NRAMP-1 gene polymorphisms at INT4, D543 and 3' UTR loci. Data were analyzed by Fisher Exact test and descriptive statistics.
Findings: The heterozygote patterns at INT4 (G/C), D543 (G/A) and 3'UTR (+/del) loci were more prevalent in the controls than in patients while the homozygous patterns at these loci were more prevalent in patients. 
Conclusion: This study showed that individuals with homozygous type mutation have an increased risk of developing tuberculosis compared to heterozygote ones.

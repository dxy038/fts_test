Summary form only given. Mobile communications services are penetrating society at an explosive rate supporting our goal of mobile communications: anytime and anywhere with anyone. Approaching the 21st century, we need to add one more important objective: multimedia services to mobile users. However, the current 2nd generation systems are optimized for voice. To support a variety of wideband multimedia services, e.g. high speed Internet and high quality video/images, the 3rd generation systems, called IMT-2000 systems, are now under intensive development worldwide. A wideband direct sequence code division multiple access (W-CDMA) is believed to be the most promising mobile radio access scheme. The author introduces the evolution scenario of mobile radio communications systems towards IMT-2000 and addresses the state-of-the art technology of W-CDMA. The important concept of W-CDMA and also a perspective on adaptive antenna array and interference cancellation techniques are presented

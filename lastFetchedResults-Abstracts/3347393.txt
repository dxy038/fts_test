In this position paper, we present and demonstrate the idea of using an interdisciplinary literature review to accelerate the research on continuous integration practice. A common suggestion has been that build waiting time in continuous integration cycle should be less than 10 minutes. This guideline is based on practitionersÂ´ opinion and has not been further investigated. The objective of this study is to understand the effects of build waiting time in software engineering and to get input from waiting time research in other disciplines. The objective is met by performing two literature reviews, first on build waiting time and second on waiting times in the contexts of service operation, web use and computer use. The found effects of build waiting time were categorized into continuous integration specific, cognitive and emotional. Two minute build waiting time was considered optimal, but under 10 minutes was considered acceptable. Insight from other waiting time research suggests that the perceptions of waiting time are important and the perceptions can be lowered by providing feedback and giving developers other activities during the integration.

The objective of this paper is initially to present a basic modeling of the railway traction system. This model includes the basic technologies used today. The voltage dependencies of the maximal possible power consumption as well as the maximal velocity of the common Rc-locomotives are included. The latter is very crucial for the studies of time table sensitivity, which is of our immediate interest. Moreover, a method is presented, that estimates the expected train delay time for a given feeding technology. The reference timetable assumes the same train and surrounding conditions, but no voltage drops. In the numerical example where the developed model is applied to a realistic test system, a set of possible amounts of railway traffic are treated as uncertainties. Mainly, the contributions of this paper are three: compiling and connecting already accepted models, the development of a method for numerical calculations using this model compilation, and an example to apply this model on

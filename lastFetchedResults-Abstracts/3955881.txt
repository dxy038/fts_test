We present an analytical model for the maximum throughput of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), considering the presence of uncorrelated bit errors and the impact of a key BLE parameter that defines the time between the start of two consecutive connection events. The derived analysis models the generic application of master-to-slave unidirectional data transmission, which also forms an upper bound for bidirectional data transmission throughput. Simulation results show that our model accurately predicts the maximum BLE throughput for all bit error rates and BLE parameter settings evaluated.

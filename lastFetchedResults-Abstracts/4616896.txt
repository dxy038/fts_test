Workflow technologies automate, totally or partially, the business processes. Such technologies use standard languages, like BPMN, to model business processes, BPMN. On the other hand, from the software engineering, OMG has defined a metamodel for the software process engineering (SPEM). This metamodel is used for describing a concrete software development process. The objective of this research work is to formalize the transformation of SPEM activities view into BPMN subprocesses view. In order to achieve such transformation, a language of formal specification RSL is used. This work is composed by three phases: an RSL formal specification of the SPEM view, an RSL formal specification of the BPMN view and an RSL formal specification of the relation between the concepts of both views. This way, any software development process described with SPEM can be converted into an input of a workflow engine. It would lead to obtain the automation of the management of the software development process.

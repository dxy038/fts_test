Low frequency inter-area oscillation is a major problem in power system operation. If not damped, these oscillations prolong, grow, and decrease transmission capacity of the tie-lines, causing interruption in energy supply. Several methods for damping of these oscillations are reported in literature. The damping may be provided by appropriate control of different components in power system such as generator excitation systems and various FACTS devices including SVC. The main objective of SVCs is to support reactive power and maintain bus voltages. However, supplementary controllers may be added to SVCs to provide the needed damping for inter-area oscillations. The supplementary controllers reported in literature use only local measurements. This paper proposes a SVC supplementary control scheme that uses both remote and local signals (provided by PMUs). A two-area four-machine test system was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Results show that the proposed controller provides better damping than other types of controllers.

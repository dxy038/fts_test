Departing from two-terminal molecular electronic devices (<sup>ME</sup>devices), this paper examines multi-terminal <sup>ME</sup>devices. These devices are envisioned to be utilized in emerging molecular gates (<sup>M</sup>gates) and neuronal hypercells (<sup>X</sup>hypercell) for expected molecular integrated circuits (<sup>M</sup>ICs). In addition to molecular- centered processing and memories, <sup>ME</sup>devices are of importance in molecular sensing and interfacing applications. We concentrate on the device-level analysis researching transitions and interactions which are due to quantum phenomena and effects exhibited by microscopic (molecular) systems. Our ultimate objective is to analyze the controlled electron transport, study the I-V characteristics, evaluate performance and assess device capabilities. Using three-dimensional Schrodinger and Poisson equations, we study the electron transport by numerically solving the above mentioned equations using the self-consistent conditions. The controlled electron transport, super-fast transitions (switching) and multiple-valued I-V characteristics in <sup>ME</sup>devices are observed.

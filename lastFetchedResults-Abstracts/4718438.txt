This paper presents an approach for providing high availability to the requests of cloudÂ´s clients. To achieve this objective, fail over strategies for cloud computing using integrated check pointing algorithms are purposed in this paper. Purposed strategy integrate check pointing feature with load balancing algorithms and also make multilevel checkpoint to decrease check pointing overheads. For implementation of purposed fail over strategies, a cloud simulation environment is developed, which has the ability to provide high availability to clients in case of failure/recovery of service nodes. Also in this paper comparison of developed simulator is made with existing methods. The purposed fail over strategy will work on application layer and provide highly availability for Platform as a Service (PaaS) feature of cloud computing.

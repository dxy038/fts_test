Video quality monitoring has become an important issue as multimedia data is increasingly being transmitted over the Internet and wireless channels where transmission errors can frequently occur. Although no-reference models are suitable to such applications, current no-reference methods do not provide acceptable performance. In this paper, we propose an objective video quality assessment method using embedded video quality metrics (VQMs). In the proposed method, the video quality of encoded video data is computed at the transmitter during the encoding process. The computed VQMs are embedded in the compressed data. If there are no transmission errors, the video quality at the receiver would be identical with that of the transmitting side. If there are transmission errors, the receiver adjusts the embedded VQMs by taking into account the effects of transmission errors. The proposed method is fast and provides good performance.

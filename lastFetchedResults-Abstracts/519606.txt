The main objective of this work is to implement the Multivari approach along with Design of Experiment (DOE) framework to effectively benchmark the hypervisors over heterogeneous workloads. Multivari approach determines the interaction effect very easily for many factors at a time by keeping panel parameter constant. This experiment has given a very interesting way to benchmarking the hypervisors over heterogeneous workloads. The presented work gives a flexible base for performance investigation on how the heterogeneous workloads perform over different hypervisors which in turn helps us to choose high performance hypervisor for the user workloads.

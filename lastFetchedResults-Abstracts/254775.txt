In this paper a characterization of seismic site response is proposed, taking into
consideration geo-morphological conditions, geotechnical and geophysical parameters such as slope,
average shear-wave velocity, maximum expected acceleration on bedrock, depth of ground water table.
An empirical relationship is presented between these parameters and applied, with the objective of
determining ground motion amplification coefficients to be used in specific programs of land use or town
planning dedicated to the mitigation of seismic risk.

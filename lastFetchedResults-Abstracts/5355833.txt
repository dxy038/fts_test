The Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa (UAMI) has a biomedical engineering academic program with a track in clinical engineering. The clinical engineering students must initiate a project linked to the healthcare environment as one of the requirements to conclude the academic program. The objective of this work is to show the teaching-learning strategies used in the relationship between the student and the healthcare institution and in the development of the project. This paper reports the results obtained with two clinical engineering student pilot groups by evaluating the kind of project and its impact inside the healthcare institution where it was made as well as its diffusion in academic conferences and the alumni work force incorporation.

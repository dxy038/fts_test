Today, with the raise of city population and industrialization of big cities, concentration of air
pollutants has increasingly accelerated. Employing more than ten million people and too much focus
of industries and factories in geographical area of Tehran along with geographical situation,
topography and certain climate condition caused Tehran to be one of the most polluted cities in the
world. Due to increase of pollution in cities, awareness with air quality in a period and changes of air
pollutants can have key role in urban health management. In the current paper, temporal changes of
nitrogen pollutants, nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide in Tehran were reviewed.
In this paper data of air pollution monitoring data of Aghdasiyeh station were applied that are under
supervision of air quality control Company in order to study changes of pollutants CO, NO2 and O3 in
Tehran. Meteorological data and wind speed were gathered from geophysics station in a 12-month
period in 2011. First, data required were extracted from raw data and then they were applied based on
the research objective.
The results of the current research indicate that according to monthly temporal changes of O3
concentration during the period mentioned, the minimum amount is in Dec and the maximum one is in
Jun. Average monthly trend of concentration N2 indicated the minimum amount is in Dec and the
maximum one is in Jul. And according to CO concentration, the minimum amount is in Apr and the
minimum is in Jan and Feb.

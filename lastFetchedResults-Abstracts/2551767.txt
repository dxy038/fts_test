Background and Objective: Performance evaluation of decision units based on their efficiency is one of the continuous efforts to upgrade the organizations. Training centers, including the University of Police also have not been excluded from this category. In this paper a mathematical model is employed for evaluating and ranking departments of Amin Police University. The Model inputs are composition and number of teachers, composition and number of students, teachers working hours (fuzzy) and the features. The model outputs are included research and scientificperformance activities and composition and number of graduate students.
Method: In this paper, with the aim of improving the results of data envelopment analysis, principal component analysis and common weights approaches is employed and a DEA model is presented. Feature of this model is the ability to assess the fuzzy data. First, considering the fuzzy operators the ratio of any output to any input are calculated for all the units. Using fuzzy principal component analysis, the possible association between variables was destroyed and the principal components are used as variables of DEA model. In the end, a multi objective MinMax problem is planned to find a common weight. 
Results: The obtained results indicate that department of Traffic Operations and Marine Sciences are in the first and the last rank respectively.
Conclusion: Fuzzy DEAPCA model is a good model for performance evaluation with dependent and fuzzy variables in which common weights using multiobjective programming technique can be used to determine the performance of the units.

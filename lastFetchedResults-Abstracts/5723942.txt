In this paper we consider on-line disjoint path routing in energy-constrained ad hoc networks. The objective is to maximize the network capacity, i.e., maximize the number of messages routed successfully by the network without any knowledge of future disjoint path connection request arrivals and generation rates. We first present two on-line algorithms for the problem. One is based on maximizing the network lifetime and the other is based on an exponential function of energy utilization at nodes. We then conduct extensive experiments by simulations to analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform those existing algorithms that do not take into account the power load balancing among the nodes.

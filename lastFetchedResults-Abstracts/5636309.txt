The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of surface roughness on electrochromic characteristics. The rough surface of indium tin oxide/glass (ITO/Glass) was prepared by wet etching. And the poly (3-methylthiophene) (PMeT) has been deposited on ITO/Glass by potentiostatic method. The electrochromic behaviors of the PMeT/ITO/Glass were performed in 0.1 M lithium perchlorate (LiClO<sub>4</sub>)/propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte. Compared with the oxalic acid ((COOH)<sub>2</sub>&#183;H<sub>2</sub>O) and ferric chloride + hydrochloric acid (FeCl<sub>3</sub>+HCl) solutions, the ITO/Glass has high surface roughness when the ITO/Glass was etched in (COOH)<sub>2</sub>&#183;H<sub>2</sub>O solution. The PMeT/ITO/Glass has the best transmittance variation (&#916;T(%)) (25 %) at 450 nm after the ITO/Glass was etched in (COOH)<sub>2</sub>&#183;H<sub>2</sub>O solution for 160 sec. And, the PMeT/ITO/Glass has the best transmittance variation (&#916;T(%)) (5 %) at 650 nm after the ITO/Glass was etched in FeCl<sub>3</sub>+HCl solution for 60 sec. Furthermore, the experimental results observed that the color of PMeT/ITO/Glass was changed from blue (oxidation state) to red (reduction state).

We define and evaluate a framework for estimating the energy consumption of pervasive Java-based software systems. The framework´s primary objective is to enable an engineer to make informed decisions when adapting a system´s architecture, such that the energy consumption on hardware devices with a finite battery life is reduced, and the lifetime of the system´s key software services increases. Our framework explicitly takes a component-based perspective, which renders it well suited for a large class of today´s distributed, embedded, and pervasive applications. The framework provides a novel approach that facilitates the accurate estimation of a system´s energy consumption both during system construction-time and during runtime. In a large number of distributed application scenarios, the framework showed very good precision on the whole, giving results that were within 5% of the actually measured power losses incurred by executing the software.

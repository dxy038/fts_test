Life-cycle analytic techniques include emerging tools that help users integrate holistic perspectives into the decision making process. One such technique, life-cycle assessment (LCA), provides decision makers valuable information on inputs, outputs, and associated environmental impacts of a defined system throughout its entire life cycle-from the acquisition of raw materials to recycling or final disposal of waste materials. Although LCA is useful for environmental decision making, it typically lacks information on costs. Including cost information in LCA would make it a more powerful overall decision making tool. This paper provides background on state-of-the-art LCA and cost assessment techniques with the objective of building an integrated, user-based life-cycle cost assessment (LCCA) model. The foundation for the model is the existing LCA framework, as developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC). Working definitions for key LCCA terms are provided, and a conceptual framework for the LCCA model is outlined

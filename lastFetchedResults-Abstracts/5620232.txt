This paper presents a digital controlled distributed converter system with a switched-mode boost type PWM rectifier and several bidirectional buck/boost dc/dc converters for battery charge and discharge system using digital signal controller (DSC). The rectifier can implement bidirectional power flow, sinusoidal current control and unit power factor in grid side. The system is able to control power flow between the ac supply and dc side, or within the dc side. It is significant in development of green, economizing energy equipments. Simulation and experimental results are shown to verify the proposed distributed control scheme.

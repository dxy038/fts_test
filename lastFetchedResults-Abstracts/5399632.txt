The objective of this paper is to propose an adaptive threshold method based on peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Nowadays, PSNR has been widely used as stopping criteria in multi level threshold method for segmenting images. Alternatively, we apply the PSNR as criteria to find the most suitable threshold value. We evaluate this proposed method on license plate recognition application. At the same time, we compare this proposed algorithm with multi-level and multi-threshold methods as the benchmark. Via the proposed technique, it could relatively change according to environment such as when there is a high or low contrast situation.

Software defined radio (SDR) is often characterized by its rapid refine-able design flow on a reconfigurable platform. The SDR methodology allows for the convergence of seemingly different communication standards into a single realization. This requirement sets a demanding task on the design of the respective SOC-based enabling platforms. In this paper, the SDR design flow and platform configuration are modeled as an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization problem. We will show that both the refinement process and configurability can readily be presented via sets of appropriate objective and constraint functions. The analysis of the Bluetooth wireless technology is demonstrated as an example.

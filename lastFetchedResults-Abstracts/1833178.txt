A renal cell carcinoma from a 15-year-old male had a 49,Yt(X;1)(p11.2;g21), +der(X)t(X;1) (p11.2;q21), +5, âˆ’16, +17, +18 karyotype. This is the third report of a tronslocation involving a breakpoint at Xp11.2 in a renal cell carcinoma in a child. A total of nine cases of renal cell carcinoma involving Xp11, including this case, have been reported. Of the eight cases for which there are genetics reports, all are male. Patients with renal cell carcinoma with abnormalities at Xp11 appear to be younger than renal cell carcinoma patients overall.

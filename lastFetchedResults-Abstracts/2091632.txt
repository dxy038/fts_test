Energy crisis in recent decades has demonstrated strong interdependence between national security and energy security. We are also witness of sever conflicts in oil-rich zones such as Middle-East and West of Suez. This study is the first attempt to provide a flexible multi-objective mathematical model which not only mitigates catastrophic risks by filtering and taking plausible oil-supply disruption scenarios into account, but also reduces oil-supply disruption probability by considering and optimizing political, economic and financial dimensions of oil procurement. Mentioned model determines a resilient portfolio of oil suppliers under each scenario and decides which ports or pipelines must be prepared for receiving oil. Furthermore, the proposed model in the second phase enhances oil-availability in crisis time by storing strategic oil stocks in appropriate geographic points. Also regarding to complexity of the second phase model, a meta-heuristic algorithm has been provided to solve the mentioned model. Finally validity of proposed model is checked by solving it for Greece case problem; sensitivity analysis shows that provided model significantly mitigates catastrophic risks threating energy security by balancing political affairs and reinforcing infrastructural facilities with the least possible cost.

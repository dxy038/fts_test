The objective of this work was to create a software application (Bugdeath 1.0) for the simulation of inactivation kinetics of microorganisms on the surface of foods, during dry and wet pasteurisation treatments. The program was developed under the Real BasicÂ© 5.2 application, and it is a user-friendly tool. It integrates heat transfer phenomena and microbial inactivation under constant and time-varying temperature conditions. On the basis of the selection of a heating regime of the medium, the program predicts the food surface temperature and the change in microbial load during the process. Input data and simulated values can be visualised in graphics or data tables. Printing, exporting and saving file options are also available. Bugdeath 1.0 includes also a useful database of foods (beef and potato) and related thermal properties, microorganisms (Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes) and corresponding inactivation kinetic parameters. This software can be coupled to an apparatus developed under the scope of the European Project BUGDEATH (QLRT-2001-01415), which was conceived to provide repeatable surface temperature-time treatments on food samples. The program has also a great potential for research and industrial applications.

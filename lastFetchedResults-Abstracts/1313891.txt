There was a significant relationship between physical activity
stage of change with cons, pros, self-efficacy, expirential and
behavioral processes (p < 0.05(.Sex varriable (OR=8.234,
95% CI:3.721-18.223( and behavioral processes of change
(OR=2.259, 95% CI:1.388-3.676) were the most siginficant

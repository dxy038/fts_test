The growth of technological capabilities of mobile devices, the evolution of wireless communication technologies, and the maturity of embedded systems contributed to expand the Machine to machine (M2M) concept. M2M refers to data communication between machines without human intervention. So, M2M is the convergence of three families of technologies: mobile agent connected by wired network or by wireless network, with an information system capable of making decisions. The objective of this paper is to present the grand schemes of a model to be used in an agricultural Decision support System. We start by explaining and justifying the need for a hybrid system that uses both Multi-Agent System (MAS) and Constraint Programming (CP) paradigms. Then we show our approach for Constraint Programming and Multi-Agent System mixing based on controller agent concept. Also, we present some concrete constraints and agents to be used in a distributed architecture based on our proposed approach for M2M services and agricultural decision support. The platform will be built in Java using general interfaces of both MAS and CSP platforms and the conception is made by agent UML (AUML).

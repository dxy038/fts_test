In this paper, we proposed an alternative approach for dealing with imprecise data in Data Envelopment Analysis. First, we transfer the evaluated data to upper and lower bounds for performance estimation. Second, utilizing fuzzy multiple objective programming method estimate the relative efficiency score of decision makiiig units (DMU). The proposed approach adopted to improve the discriminating power of DEA with imprecise data. The performances of govemment funded R&amp;D projech in Taiwan applied to illustrate the merit of our approach. Finally, we categorize the performance of twenty technology applicaliotis callcd DMU in three clusters, four are absolutely efficient, eleven are weak efficient and live are inefficient.

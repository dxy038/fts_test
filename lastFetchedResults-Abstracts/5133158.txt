This paper presents a performance study on various broadcast algorithms in a real-time information dispatch system. The objective of the study is to design an efficient broadcast algorithm for providing data in a timely manner for real-time transaction processing applications in broadcast environments. We construct and conduct a series of simulation experiments to look at the performance of our proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed broadcast algorithm can further reduce the probability of mobile read only transactions missing deadlines in broadcast environments

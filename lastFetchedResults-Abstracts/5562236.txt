The performance of an industrial process is strongly dependent on available sensor measurements. Inaccurate measurements resulting from insufficient measurements or improper sensor placement can significantly deteriorate fault observability and process control. However, the performance of a diagnostic system highly depends on the number and location of sensors. An optimized design of sensors and strategy of sensors placement will be proposed to enhance safety of industrial systems. The objective of this paper is to provide a new method based on structural analysis approach that is able to help sensor placement in the model. The problem under study is known to be a combinatorial problem. Our algorithmic contribution is a combinatorial optimization solution which improves, through a tripartite graph research, the global execution time comparing to classical bipartite graph.

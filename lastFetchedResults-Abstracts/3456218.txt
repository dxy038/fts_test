It has been previously proved that the optimal routing control of a two-station Markovian network with linear cost is described by a monotone switching curve. With the discounted cost objective function, it is proven in this paper that the optimal switching curve has a finite asymptotic limit when <e1>c</e1><sub>1</sub>&#8800;<e1>c</e1><sub>2</sub>, where <e1>c</e1><sub>i</sub> is the unit inventory cost at station <e1>i </e1>. Whereas, for the case with <e1>c</e1><sub>1</sub>=<e1>c</e1><sub>2</sub>, as well as the case with the long-run average objective function, the switching curve does not have a finite asymptote

A new criterion DMPC is proposed to evaluate the overall quality of temperature match between two fluids across a heat exchanger. As the criterion DMPC goes up, the unnecessary entropy generation will increase, while the second law efficiency of the heat exchanger will decline, and vice verse. This criterion can also be applied to be the optimization objective for getting a better temperature match between the two heat transfer fluids in heat exchanger.

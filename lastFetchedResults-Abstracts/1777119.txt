The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of whole blood viscosity and its major determinants (plasma fibrinogen level, hematocrit, hemoglobin and blood cell count) to advancing age. A total of 249 subjects (mean age 49.9±21.5; range 19–102 years) were included in the study. They were divided into three groups, (A) &lt;30 years of age, n, 58; (B) 30–60 years, n, 107; (C) &gt;60 years, n, 84. Whole blood viscosity at two different rates of shear (450 and 45 s−1) was evaluated using a cone-plate digital viscosimeter. The hematological parameters (hematocrit, hemoglobin and blood cell count) were evaluated using an automatic Coulter Counter. Plasma fibrinogen concentration was measured by a clotting method. When both sexes are considered together, whole blood viscosity shows no significant difference among age groups. Plasma fibrinogen concentration significantly increases with age (P&lt;0.001); hemoglobin, red blood cell count and platelet count, on contrary, are significantly lower in aged group. In the male sex, blood viscosity at higher shear rate (450 s−1) negatively correlates with advancing age (P&lt;0.005). The age-related decrease of hematocrit value in the male sex accounts for this occurrence.

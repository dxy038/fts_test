This work investigates the problem of progressive transceiver design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with automatic repeat request (ARQ) capability. We consider a generic MIMO transceiver architecture that employs a linear transmission precoder and a linear decoder followed by intra-block decision feedback detector at the receiver. Our objective is to progressively design the optimal precoder and receiver feedback system to jointly minimize the mean square error (MSE) under the assumption of perfect feedback. Unlike in single transmission design, joint ARQ receivers cannot change previous precoders and existing results do not apply. In this paper, we propose an approach to design the precoder and receiver iteratively to achieve MSE performance close to the known lower-bound

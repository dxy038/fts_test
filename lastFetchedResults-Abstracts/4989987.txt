This paper describes the short-term resource scheduling (STRS) function that has been developed by Siemens-Empros as part of the new SBB/Direktion Kraftwerk (Swiss Rail) energy management system. Optimal scheduling of the single-phase hydroelectric power plants, single-phase and three-phase energy accounts, and purchase and sale of three phase energy subject to a multitude of physical and contractual constraints (including spinning and regulating reserve requirements), is the main objective of the STRS function. The operations planning horizon of STRS is one day to one week using an hourly time increment


Objective: Young’s schema theory provides a theoretical basis that relates coping styles to
early maladaptive schemas. This research aimed to identify maladaptive coping strategies
including avoidance and over compensation strategies associated with migraine and tension
headaches. Method: The present research was of cross sectional and correlational study type. The
measures included Headache Disability Inventory and Avoidance and Over Compensation
Questionnaires. The population of the study comprised adult patients with migraine and tension
headaches aged 18 to 55 years living in Tehran, Iran. The final study sample included 69
participants with migraine or tension headaches and 86 non-clinical samples of both genders.
They were selected by convenient and purposeful sampling after referring by psychiatrists. The
two groups were matched based on sex and education. Results: Migraine and tension headache sufferers and non-clinical participants were
significantly different in 9 avoidance strategies. There were also a negative correlation
between headache and 2 overcompensation styles. In addition, a series of maladaptive coping
(avoidance and overcompensation) strategies could significantly predict 84.1% and 70.4% of
the total change in position of tension headaches and migraine group, respectively. Discussion: It seems that maladaptive coping strategies are important factors influencing
migraine and tension headaches. The implications of the findings for both theory and treatment
concerning are discussed, along with suggestions for future research.

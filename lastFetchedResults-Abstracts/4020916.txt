A speech encryption system based on permutation of DFT coefficients is described. This system was designed for use on a band limited telephone channel. The choice of permutation matrices and methods of synchronisation are discussed. Results of subjective and objective tests performed on the system are given which indicate low residual intelligibility and good recovered voice quality. The cryptanalytic strength of the system is also considered.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Information about cloud heights can be retrieved by satellite images. Cloud heights can affect total liquid and water content. Cloud heights are needed to determine the reflecting layer reference altitude (RLRA). Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) can retrieve information about clouds. MISR determined cloud-top height geometrically by a stereophotogrammetric technique. MODIS estimates cloud top pressure by a CO<sub>2</sub> slicing method. To ensure the retrieval of cloud heights, it is important to look for good algorithms that process this kind of information. But the way the instruments process cloud information is different. The objective of this research is to study, analyze and implement the existing algorithms used for the retrieval of cloud-top heights, from both MODIS and MISR instruments. In this paper, the algorithm to retrieve cloud-top heights will be presented. An analysis on cloud information form both techniques will lead to a better understanding of the earthÂ´s climate system.

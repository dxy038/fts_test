This paper con tributes to the comparative prediction study by the artificial neural networks, taking into account uncertainty, of the deviated intentional behaviors of the human operators in the human-machine systems. This type of behaviors is a particular human operator violation called barrier removal. A predictive BCD model is developed by considering a multi-reference, multi-factor and multi-criteria based evaluation. As human operatorÂ´s evaluation can be uncertain, the objective of this research work is to integrate the uncertainty on the subjective judgments in the prediction of barrier removal. A comparative study is therefore implemented between the prediction without consideration of uncertainty and the prediction with consideration of uncertainty. The proposed approach is validated by a railway application in a European project named urban guided transport management system.

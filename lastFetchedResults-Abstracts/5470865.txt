The fuzzy mathematics method is used to convert the multiobjective problem into the single objective problem, and then the model is solved by constructing fuzzy telescopic indicators. The model is used to optimize the industrial structure of Hebei province in 2005.The comparison between the actual value and the optimized value shows that under the condition of water shortage the local water resources quantity is saved effectively, and the wastewater and the pollutant emissions are reduced by optimizing the industrial structure and adjusting the water use structure. Finally some practical measures on the industrial structure adjustment of Hebei province are put forward accordingly.

The objective was to study the population development of Tuta absoluta (Meyrick, 1917) on tomato in greenhouse conditions at Droh. The trial assessed the occurrence of T. absoluta adults from the month of October to May in traps; a low numbers is noted. The high numbers recorded (170 adults/greenhouse) are caught at the end of crop cycle. The mean number of capture is 22 adults/ week/ trap. Regarding the other developmental stages, immatures of T. absoluta are also very low mainly at the beginning of the crop season. The highest numbers of immature stages recorded is: 36 eggs per 30 leaves on 19 April 2012, 14 larvae 19 April and 3 May 2012. One pupa is recorded on 17 November 2011 and 26 January 2012. During the survey, no natural enemies are detected on the different developmental stages of T. absoluta.

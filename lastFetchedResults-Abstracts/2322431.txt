Introduction & Objective: The antibacterial, antifungal and anti-parasitical effect of selenium and silver nanoparticles have been reported previously. The purpose of this study was to determine the anti-Leishmania healing effect of selenium nanoparticles and silver in lesions caused by Leishma-nia major in mice. Materials & Methods: In the present experimental study, Balb/c mice were experimentally infected with Leishmania major promastigotes. After the appearance of the lesion in the tail, they were di-vided into four groups of six. Two groups were treated with selenium and silver nanoparticles by injection in the three-points of the lesion as well as Glucantime per day, for 4 weeks. The mice in the negative control group did not receive any treatment. The diameter of the wound and body weight of the mice was measured every day for 5 weeks. Results: The diameter of the lesions in the group treated with nanoselenium was not different with the untreated control group. The diameter of the wounds treated with nanosilver was significantly different with the control group without treatment, but was larger than the group treated with me-glumine antimoniate. Conclusion: Unlike selenium nanoparticles, silver nanoparticle showed anti-Leishmanial effect in vivo. Like Glucantime, it did not heal leishmanial lesion entirely.

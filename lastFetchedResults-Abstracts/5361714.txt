The authors discuss two available methodologies used for ergonomic evaluation of in-vehicle systems. One method corresponds to the objective measurement of the driverÂ´s behavior, and more precisely the visual strategies, and the other one belongs to the subjective evaluation category and is used for rating the mental workload of a task. For this second approach, the authors propose a new version of the TLX adapted to the driving task and called the DALI-Driving Activity Load Index. Both objective and subjective approaches are illustrated with results extracted from the ergonomic evaluation of the guidance/navigation system CARMINAT tested in the Lyon urban area

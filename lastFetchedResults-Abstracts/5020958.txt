Advances in mobile communications and medical technologies facilitate the development of emerging mobile systems and applications for healthcare. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview and the current status of mobile health care systems (mHealth) and their applications for Emergency healthcare support (eEmergency). Our paper reports on journal papers that use wireless, emergency telemedicine systems that appeared since 2000. The majority of the applications are focused on the transmission of crucial biosignals (mainly ECG) for the support of heart-related healthcare. A limited number of new studies were focused on supporting emergency healthcare for trauma by facilitating both 2D image or video transmission (eg: ultrasound). Alternatively, new studies have focused on integrated systems for specialized emergency scenaria such as stroke. This paper is an extension of work previously published by our group.

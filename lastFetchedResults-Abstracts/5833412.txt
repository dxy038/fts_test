Reducing noise and vibration is an increasingly important objective for designers and users of a wide range of mechanical system. Lubricant can contribute to reduction of overall noise and vibration generated by machines, both by reducing generation of acoustic energy in lubricated contacts and by modulating the transmission of vibration through the lubricant. This paper outlines various mechanisms by which the lubricant may affect the generation and transmission of acoustic vibration. Examples from the area of refrigeration compressor lubrication are presented, demonstrating that correct design and selection of lubricant can have a significant impact on noise and vibration.

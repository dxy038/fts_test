We consider a set of multicast sources, each multicasting a finite amount of data to its corresponding destinations. The objective is to minimize the time to deliver all traffic, i.e., to obtain schedules of minimum length. We consider time-varying wireless networks with imperfect side information at the sources. We model the minimum-length scheduling problem through partially observable stochastic shortest paths and provide an optimal solution. Due to the high complexity of computing the optimal solution, we finally provide a set of heuristics and illustrate their performance through numerical experiments.

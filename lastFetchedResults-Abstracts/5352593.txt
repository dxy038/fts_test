A new representation for evolutionary subsurface identification from surface or well geological data is proposed. The idea is to represent the subsurface as the combination of, first, a geologically initial set of horizontal layers and, second, fault parameters like shape and displacements. Based on volume and bed-length preservation, a morphogenesis process then gives the structure at present time. A first implementation of this representation is tested on an artificial geological inverse problem in foothills region: the fault locations and dips are considered as two different objectives, and the e-MOEA multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is applied. The first results show the efficiency of the chosen representation.

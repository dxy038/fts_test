During inclement weather, airport will experience a large portion of overall system delay. It is very important for the airport operation manager to reassign the gates in real time. In this paper, an integer programming model for airport gate reassignment is proposed, which reassign the airport gates to the flights entering the airport after the accident, with the objective to minimize the weighted sum of the flights being assigned to the apron and whose reassigned gates are different from what was planned. A tabu search (TS) algorithm is designed to solve the model. According to the gate configuration and flight schedule of a busy domestic airport, simulation is conducted which shows the effectiveness of the model and the TS algorithm.

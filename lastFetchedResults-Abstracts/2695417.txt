In this paper, an optimized pMOS-triggered bidirectional silicon-controlled rectifier (PTBSCR) fabricated in a 0.18-&#956;m CMOS technology is proposed as a viable electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection solution. Capable of working under both the power-ON and power-OFF conditions, this structure is verified to provide bidirectional ESD protection performance superior to those reported in the literatures. Critical ESD parameters, such as the trigger voltage, holding voltage, and leakage current, can be flexibly adjusted via layout changes. With a low trigger voltage, a small ESD design window, a high robustness, and a small silicon area consumption, the PTBSCR is very suitable for low-voltage and low-power ESD protection applications.

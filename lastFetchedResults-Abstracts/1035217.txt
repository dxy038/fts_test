In present work, the characteristics of three methods such as the orthogonal design, Fuzzy optimum method and artificial neural network modeling technique were made on the basis of the optimization and evaluation of the performance of the phosphate graphite mold. The variance analysis indicates that the phosphoric acid has greatest influence on both compression strength and tension strength of phosphate graphite mold, both drying temperature and drying time greater, and Al2O3 minor, respectively. The Fuzzy multi-objective comprehensive evaluation shows that the optimum technology for phosphate graphite mold designed by us is phosphoric acid 30%, Al2O3 30%, drying temperature 400 Â°C and drying time 60 min. In addition, the ANN can be used to establish mono- and multi-objective models for the prediction of other tests outside orthogonal test with rather high accuracy. However, the predicted results are worse for the linear regressive equations by the orthogonal analysis.

The objective of this research is to identify which characteristics of a colour image can influence the coding performance of a wavelet-based codec. It is envisage that the result from this study can be used to select the most appropriate wavelet to compress still colour images. Correlation coefficients between many statistical features of colour images and their PSNR, CR and bpp values are computed. The results show that the colour histogram statistics of the images do not influence the coding performance. However, image gradient and spatial frequency of the colour images have good correlation with the PSNR, CR and bpp.

In present scenario economic dispatch for the microgrid (MG) is better suited to the requirements of a system in actual operation because it not only considers the lowest cost in a scheduling cycle but also coordinates between different distributed generations (DGs) over many periods. Wind energy and solar energy are subjected to random variations and intervals, so there is a great difficulty in solving the economic dispatch problem. In this paper, different distributed generations are employed in MG which includes photovoltaic arrays, wind turbine, fuel cell, diesel engines, gas-turbine and battery. In this work the MG is considered to be operating in islanding mode. The main objective of this work is to minimize the generation cost and emission cost of the MG while satisfying system hourly demand and system constraints. Economic dispatch for MG involving DGs is an optimization problem and in this paper Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) is used to perform the optimization process. The results obtained from CSA is compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and it is inferred that CSA shows better global convergence when compared to PSO and also gives good optimum solution by reducing system generation cost and emission cost.

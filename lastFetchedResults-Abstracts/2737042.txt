The general objective of this paper is to investigate the physical mechanisms and processes involved in the propagation of arc over the surface of ice. In the present research work, high-speed imaging and optical emission spectroscopy techniques were synchronized with the electrical measurements to study the various parameters of arc on an ice surface, i.e. channel radius, propagation velocities, arc column temperature and electron density. These results, together with observation of the propagation patterns and arc foot geometries, calculation of arc energy and the examination of the state of thermal equilibrium provide background information for understanding the ice-covered insulator flashover phenomenon. Arc root structure, current profile, propagation pattern and velocity were investigated under different type of applied voltage and different polarities. Water film conductivity and thickness, relative air humidity and the direction of arc propagation were also analyzed as influencing parameters of arc propagation. The effects of different possible mechanisms, e.g. collision and thermal ionization, buoyancy force and electrostatic force, on different stages of arc propagation has been discussed.

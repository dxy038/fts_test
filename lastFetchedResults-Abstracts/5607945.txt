This paper started from an investigation of characteristics of knowledge workers, then moved to an examination of multi-skilled workers scheduling problem under the multi-stage and multi-task conditions, on the basis of stochastic learning capacity. It also introduced the relationship between skill score and efficiency, and constructed a stochastic states transfer equation of knowledge workersÂ´ skill score. On this basis the paper proposed a multi-objective flexible scheduling model to maximize skill scores of all knowledge workers and minimize the overall cost. The model can provide decision support in the area of knowledge worker scheduling.

When high bit rate calls are multiplexed with low bit rate calls in an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) fashion, cells for high bit rate calls are more likely to be discarded in succession than cells for low bit rate calls even though the cell loss rate for each call is the same value. The objective of admission control is to keep the network load moderate so as to guarantee the user requirements for communication quality. An admission control must determine in real time whether to accept a call or not when a call set-up request occurs. A novel admission control method which can be applied to the case of fulfilling priority control is proposed and evaluated. This proposed method is suitable for real-time operation, even in a multimedium case, because the amount of calculation for admission control is reduced drastically in multimedium cases using recursive equations in estimating cell loss rate

The basic objective of this work is to compare the utility of an expert driven system and a data driven system for classifying encrypted network traffic, specifically SSH traffic from traffic log files. Pre-processing is applied to the traffic data to represent as traffic flows. Results show that the data driven system approach outperforms the expert driven system approach in terms of high detection and low false positive rates.

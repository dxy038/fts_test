Path planning is one of the key technologies in an intelligent car-parking system. This paper presents a path planning method for parallel parking mode. a scheme of a two-arc parking path is proposed, with the start position given but the goal to be yielded. the parking process is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem, where two objective functions are studied. and we gained the optimized results by MATLAB Optimization Toolbox.

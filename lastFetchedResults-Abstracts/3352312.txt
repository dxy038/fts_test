Summary form only given. For the burning process of high density (about 10<sup>18</sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>) high temperature (tens of keV) plasma, the trapping by a high mirror-like magnetic field is a challenging objective. Numerical simulations<sup>1-3</sup> may lead to conceptual designs of relatively large magnetized volumes (cm<sup>3</sup>) at large magnetic field (10 to 100T) with a tailored spatial profile. Taking the example of a Compact Magnetic Fusion (CMF) device<sup>3</sup>, <sup>4</sup> driven by ultra-short, high intensity laser beam interaction with cluster or solid targets, we present a pulsed power device capable of feeding a single turn coil at the level of 100s of kA and &#956;s duration. The key component is a low inductance switch which will be described, paying attention to the triggering process, the plasma characterization, the B-field metrology and its scalability. The proposed device will be discussed in comparison with other solutions from the literature.

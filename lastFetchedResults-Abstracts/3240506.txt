This paper deals with the analysis of a pyrolysis unit cooler. The pyrolysis unit is built during solution of a EU grant project focused to the use of non-traditional energy sources, especially to produce hydrocarbon mixture from different type of waste. Pyrolysis gas from the pyrolysis reactor enters to cooling system, consisted of two cooling units. This paper deals with the analysis of the first cooler unit - air cooler. The main objective of this cooler is the condensation of liquid hydrocarbon mixture components and their separation from the gaseous phase. Mathematical model of the cooler has been derived based on physical properties and the expected gas composition. Many simulation experiments had been done with help of Matlab/Simulink software a showed some limitations in the cooler construction, which determine the maximum gas flow. These findings helped to prepare correct operational tests of the pyrolysis unit. Paper presents the cooler structure, developed mathematical model, results of realized simulation experiments and the recommendations for operational tests.

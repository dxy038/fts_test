With the advent of renewable technologies in the power market, it is of keen interest of researchers to utilize these technologies in the most optimum manner. Nowadays, the emphasis is on the integrated utilization of these resources to minimize the cost and maximize the profit. In this paper, an optimal daily scheduling approach for a wind-diesel system with battery storage has been presented. A mathematical model has been developed with the objective of maximizing profit. The problem has been optimized using Evolutionary Programming technique. This model is then tested on a test system and in order to obtain results MATLAB codes have been developed.

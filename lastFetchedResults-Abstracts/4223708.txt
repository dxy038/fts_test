This paper presents theoretical and experimental aspects related to the implementation of a DSP-based fully digital single phase true sine PWM inverter. The proposed digitally-controlled PWM inverter employs a single chip DSP to realize a double-loop voltage and current mode control scheme. The Motorola DSP56F80&#215; family is well-suited for digital inverter control, combining the DSP´s calculation ability with the microcontroller´s function on a single chip and is a fully versatile part for a high performance, low cost, single chip PWM generator with many additional features not found in other solutions. The conclusions of the paper allow an objective evaluation of using DSP in the generation of sinusoidal PWM signals and in inverter control schemes.

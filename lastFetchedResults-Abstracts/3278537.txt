Anonymous communications have been exponentially growing, where more and more users are shifting to a privacy-preserving Internet and anonymising their peer-to-peer communications. Anonymous systems allow users to access different services while preserving their anonymity. We aim to characterise these anonymous systems, with a special focus in the I2P network. Current statistics service for the I2P network do not provide values about the type of applications deployed in the network nor the geographical localisation of users. Our objective is to determine the number of users in the network, the number of anonymous applications, and the type of those applications. We also explore the possibility of inferring which group of users is responsible for the activity of an anonymous application. Thus, we improve the current I2P statistics and get better insights of the network.

The objective of this paper is to illustrate how these problems can be best handled on scalable affordable personal computer clusters. The authors propose to achieve this goal through the use of out-of-core matrix solvers. Since, the authors do not require RAM but hard disk to deal with the storage, now the problem can be handled at an affordable personal level. Examples are presented on how this goal can be accomplished.

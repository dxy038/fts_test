In this paper a new control law of inverters based on immune algorithms is presented. In the control law multi-objective function is created, which enables a voltage-source type inverter to produce a near standard sine wave with a minimum switching loss. Because the control law is based on float-coded immune algorithms (IA), the method overcomes the disadvantages of binary-coded genetic algorithm (GA), effectively adopts float-coded manner to make the work simple and quick and improves the speed and precision of the algorithm. Through computer simulation the result has proven that the immune algorithms are effective to the inverter control.

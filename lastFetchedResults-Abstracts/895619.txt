Objective (s): Continuation rate is one of the most important factors in the success of any contraceptive methods. Although oral contraceptive pill (OCP) is the most reliable method for preventing pregnancy, a number of women do not contnue to use the pills. This study reports on improving continuation by appliying the theory of Planned Behavior.
Methods: This was a case-control study of women aged 15-49 years old using low dose (LD) pills attending family planning centres in Ahwaz, Iran in year 2012. To improve continuation of OCP an educational program based on the Theory of Planned Behavior was developed. Cases received the usual care plus the program while the control only received the usual care. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews at baseline (before the intervention) and at three and six months follow-up. This paper reports on three months data. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of the educational program on continuation.
Results: The results revealed that the educational program did not have a statistically significant effect to increase continuation of OCP (OR =2.09, 95% CI=0.77-5.68, P =0.15). However, women who did not receive the educational program 2 times were more likely to discontinue the pills compared to women who received the intervention.
Conclusion: The findings indicated that educational intervention based on Theory of Planned Behavior might improve continuation of OCP. To asretain such conclusion the effect of the educational program on continuation reamins to be assessed at six months follow-up.

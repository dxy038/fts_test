The objective of this work is to present to the users of electric energy, a computational program and a related piece of hardware that is able to make a complete power transformer diagnosis. The software is developed in a C++ environment for Windows and it is aimed to the study and analysis of power and distribution transformers. With the use of the software one is able to compute the Steinmetz equivalent circuit, the Efficiency and Voltage Regulation, Daily Average Efficiency, the derating due to harmonics, the K factor, draw graphs of Efficiency against Load Factor, Regulation versus Load Factor and the Kapp Diagram for both dry and oil immersed transformers. The computation is made with the use of data obtained from routine transformers tests, which are acquired automatically by the proposed hardware and relevant transformer operational data.

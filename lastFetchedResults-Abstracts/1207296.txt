Background: Cornus sanguinea L subsp australis (C.A. Mey.) J?v. (Cornaceae) is a native species in north and northwest of Iran. It is locally named Siah-al. The genus Cornus is rich source of anthocyanins.
Objective: In this study the antioxidant activity, total phenol and total anthocyanin contents of different extracts of C. sanguinea L subsp australis. were investigated for the first time.
Methods: The fruits were extracted with ethyl acetate, methanol (1% HCl) and water. DPPH and FRAP assay were performed for investigation of antioxidant activity of each extract. The total phenols were measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method while total anthocyanins were detected by spectroscopic method modified by Peksel.
Results: The results showed that C. sanguinea L subsp australis methanol (1% HCl) extract (CME) had the highest amount of anthocyanins (12.56 ± 0.01 µmol/g extract) as well as the highest amount of total phenolics (88.56 ± 0.04 mg GAE/ g dry extract). The CME were found to have the highest antioxidant activity in DPPH assay (IC50=90.43 µg/ml) and in FRAP method (1419.167± 0.025mmol FeII / g dry extract). Radical scavenger activity of CME at 100 ?g/ml was comparable with ?-tocopherol (20 ?g/ml) and with BHA (200 ?g/ml), p > 0.05.
Conclusion: There was a significant correlation between the total phenolic content an antioxidant activity of CME as well as total anthocyanin and antioxidant activity in DPPH assay (R2 = 0.99). The results suggest that C. sanguinea L subsp australis is a natural sources of anthocyanin and have considerable antioxidant activity.

Bi-Level Integrated System Collaborative Optimization (BLISCO) is a recently developed hierarchical multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) methodology, owning good convergence property, accuracy and robustness. However, the subsystem objective functions in existing BLISCO methods may be mutually coupled again caused by the step of calculating partial derivatives of the original objective with respective to the shared coupled variables, and thus prevent the parallelization of the subsystem optimization. In this paper, the quasi-separable MDO problem form is introduced and an improved BLISCO method based on this form is proposed to tackle this problem. At last, one mathematical example and one engineering problem are used to test the feasibility, accuracy and efficiency of the improved BLISCO method.

In this paper, a new region control scheme is proposed for underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMS). In the proposed control concept, the desired objective can be specified as a region instead of a point. The proposed region control concept is a generalization of setpoint control problem because when the desired region is specified arbitrarily small, the control objective reduces to a point. Lyapunov-like function is proposed for the stability analysis. Simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sarcoidosis (Sa), a multisystem disease of unknown etiology presents protean manifestations. Triad of Sa-gout-psoriasis has been reported in a few patients but coexistence of Sa and gout has not been reported.
CASES: A 36-year-old man presented with acute polyarthritis, bilateral hilar adenopathies and erytheme nodosum. Diagnosis of acute gout was established with regard to clinical findings, refusing other causes of acute arthritis and identification of monourate crystals from synovial fluids. Diagnosis of Sa was confirmed by extensive exploration including CT scanning of thorax, bronchoscopy and biopsy of epitrochlear adenopathies.
CONCLUSION: Development of gout may be due to hyperuicemia (caused by granolumatous tissue destruction) or release of inflammatory cytokines from granolumatous tissue destruction of Sa.

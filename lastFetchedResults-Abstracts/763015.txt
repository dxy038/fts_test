In this paper we propose a multi-objective mathematical model to aid the marketing team of a company in customer service marketing. Customer reflects to the services provided by a company, and the reflections affect the profit of the company.  Thus, the services can be evaluated by the customers to imply the company's performances. First, the services are purified based on the opinions of the customers conducting a survey study by a questionnaire. The service purification is carried out using statistical hypothesis testing. The remained services are then assessed regarding time, cost and quality objectives constructing a multi-objective mathematical model. Then, a multi-objective mathematical model is utilized to determine the services with more profits. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to solve the multi-objective model. The applicability and validity of the proposed mechanism is illustrated in a case study.

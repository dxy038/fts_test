Summary form only given. An array of photon diagnostics have been deployed on a high power relativistic electron beam diode. Surface flashover of a carbon fiber velvet cathode generates a discharge from which electrons are accelerated through a 17.8 cm diode. This discharge is assumed to be a hydrocarbon mixture. A small portion of the off energy electrons accelerated during the rise and fall of the 80 ns FWHM pulse impact the beam pipe and generate a flux of 0.1-4 MeV photons. The principal objective of these experiments is to quantify the dynamics of the hard X-ray and gamma-ray flux generated in the diode region, in addition to quantifying dynamics of the visible photons generated, and the ion species of the surface discharge on the velvet cathode. A qualitative comparison of different diagnostic results are presented, which include time resolved measurements with X-ray PIN diodes, a PMT, and CCD images. In addition initial visible spectroscopy measurements will also be presented.

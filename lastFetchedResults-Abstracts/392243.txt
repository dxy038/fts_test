Objective: to evaluate the probable presence of otorhinolaryngological pathology accompanied by head and neck region skin findings in patients with Xeroderma pigmentosum. Methods: a total of 19 patients with Xeroderma pigmentosum were investigated for otorhinolaryngological findings. The patients gave their anamnesis and underwent physical examination, audiological tests and endoscopic examination. Results: various malignancies developed in 14 patients on the sun-exposed areas of the head and neck region. Multiple malignancies were found in six of them. There was no other pathological condition secondary to this rare clinical entity. Conclusion: Xeroderma pigmentosum causes skin lesions. Some otolaryngological findings such as rhinitis, sinusitis etc. were thought to be coincidental.

A new method is proposed in this paper to improve the cross regulation in a multioutput forward converter. An objective function is determined for each of the multiple DC outputs to track its reference. The error of each output is maintained within an acceptable level. The presented control scheme which minimizes the objective function can be applied to the multioutput system without a dominant load. Experiments are performed to show that there exists a duty cycle satisfying the defined objective function.

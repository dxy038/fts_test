Infectious microorganisms represent the causes of many of the most common and dangerous diseases in our modern society. Two major problems exist when tackling the problem of infections: detection and treatment. Here we utilize two distinct nanotechnology platforms to combat these problems. First, we demonstrate a novel detection method for identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA using rolling circle amplification (RCA) of the pathogenic DNA. Second, we design a system for the development of antiviral drug combinations using feedback system control to rapidly determine effective antiviral drug combinations. Using Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1) as a model we show the effectiveness of this approach. Taken together, we have begun to develop a platform for better handling of infectious disease in the future using novel nanotechnology and nanomedicine approaches.

Video Car Recorder embedded into intelligent mobile devices is considered in this study. That is, the Lead Management System (LMS) is developed. The features of the LMS include recording instant car traveling screen, displaying the current location map, and capturing the current location data; namely, comprises latitude, longitude, speed, altitude and directional acceleration. Besides, the prominent feature of the entire application is that the system can be embedded into intelligent mobile devices for a variety of the iOS System. Because the iOS mobile devices with GPS and camera which is widely used, the Video Car Recorder application is not limited to the problems of hardware-integration. At the same time, the iOS SDK, Google Map API, Objective-C, and Xcode platform are applied to develop the application of intelligent mobile devices with Video Car Recorder. Consequently, the proposed application is a widely used and saving costs system.

High-tech industrialization is one of the critical paths for cultivating strategic emerging industry, while knowledge management is the effective mean for promoting high-tech industrialization process. According to the demand, characteristics and functions of knowledge management of High-tech industrialization, the knowledge management running performance appraisal index system of high-tech industrialization is designed from knowledge butt joint, knowledge learning, knowledge sharing, knowledge integration and knowledge innovation. Then, the evaluation model is constructed based on the rules method and fuzzy borda number analytical method. Afterwards, five sample units are selected for the empirical study. The objective reference and method support are provided for bringing knowledge management theory method into the whole industrialization process, and realizing the scientific, standardized, efficient management in order to improve the High-tech industrialization efficiency.

This paper studies the problem of designing robust H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controllers for networked control systems (NCSs) with time delay, packet dropout and time-varying sampling period. The NCSs in this paper may receive more than one control input during a sampling period, time delay and packet dropout are also taken into full consideration. The problem of controller design for NCSs with time-varying sampling period and packet dropout is converted into a multi-objective optimization problem in terms of LMIs, and some methods can be used to deal with the multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller design is also applicable for NCSs with constant sampling period. The simulation results have illustrated the better effectiveness of the proposed H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller design in term of the allowable maximum of consecutive packet dropout and H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance index than Wang and Yang(2008).

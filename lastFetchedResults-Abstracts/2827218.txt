This paper addresses the problem of hallucinating the missing high-resolution (HR) details of a low-resolution (LR) video while maintaining the temporal coherence of the hallucinated HR details by using dynamic texture synthesis (DTS). Most existing multi-frame-based video super-resolution (SR) methods suffer from the problem of limited reconstructed visual quality due to inaccurate sub-pixel motion estimation between frames in a LR video. To achieve high-quality reconstruction of HR details for a LR video, we propose a texture-synthesis-based video super-resolution method, in which a novel DTS scheme is proposed to render the reconstructed HR details in a time coherent way, so as to effectively address the temporal incoherence problem caused by traditional texture synthesis based image SR methods. To further reduce the complexity of the proposed method, our method only performs the DTS-based SR on a selected set of key-frames, while the HR details of the remaining non-key-frames are simply predicted using the bi-directional overlapped block motion compensation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant subjective and objective quality improvement over state-of-the-art video SR methods.

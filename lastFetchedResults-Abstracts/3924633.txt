The objective of this article is to develop a method of calculation of cable ampacity in the presence of harmonics for a cable system. A simple general equation has been developed that can be used to calculate the harmonic derating factor (HDF), and neutral harmonic derating factor (NHDF), of a cable system. A review of a generalized method of calculating ampacity of a cable system is presented in the Appendix using matrix techniques

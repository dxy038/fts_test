Objective: Our purpose was (1) to describe use of the postpartum visit among US women of different social and ethnic backgrounds and to identify risk factors for nonuse and (2) to determine the association between postpartum care and breast- feeding duration. Study Design: The responses of a nationally representative sample of 9953 women who had a live birth in 1988 surveyed by the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey were included for our secondary analysis. Risk factors for nonuse of the postpartum visit, and its relationship with breast-feeding duration, were evaluated with use of multivariate regression analyses. Results: Fifteen percent of respondents had not made a postpartum visit within 6 months after delivery. Having no prenatal care was associated with increased likelihood of nonuse of postpartum care (adjusted relative risk 3.39, CI 1.98-5.81). The postpartum visit was not significantly associated with breast-feeding duration. Conclusion: Further research is needed to reevaluate the timing, content, and delivery of postpartum care.

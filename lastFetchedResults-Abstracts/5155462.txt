Two excitation controllers are presented for the generator excitation system by employing the control strategy proposed in this paper. The linear control system accorded with Brunovsky system with its special configuration is built actively to relate the system objectives and control variables. Therefore, nonlinear control design method with objective holographic feedbacks (NCOHF) is proposed when the linear system theory is applied to the constructed system. Furthermore, pole assignment mechanism is discussed to examine the NCOHFÂ´s effectiveness considering the topology equivalence between nonlinear system and its linear approximation system near hyperbola equilibrium point. Researches show that the nonlinear system stabilization may be achieved by the pole assignment near equilibrium point when the NCOHF method is employed. In addition, NCOHF is applied to design the controllers for the generator excitation system. Compared with the existing controller, simulation results on a single machine infinite bus system have illustrated better performances.

Study Objective: We sought to compare the characteristics and medical outcomes of motor vehicle crashes for drivers 70 years and older with those of drivers between the ages of 30 and 39 years. Methods:  We probabilistically linked statewide motor vehicle crash and hospital discharge data between the years of 1992 and 1995 for the state of Utah. We calculated the odds of older drivers exhibiting certain motor vehicle crash characteristics compared with younger drivers. Adjusting for nighttime crash, high-speed crash, and seatbelt use, we calculated the odds of an older driver being killed or hospitalized compared with those of a younger driver. Results:  During the study years, there were 14,466 drivers older than 69 years and 68,706 drivers between the ages of 30 and 39 years involved in motor vehicle crashes in Utah. Older drivers were less likely to have crashes involving drug or alcohol use (odds ratio [OR] 0.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1 to 0.2) and less likely to have crashes at high speed (OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.6 to 0.7). Although older drivers were no more likely to have a crash involving a right-hand turn (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.9 to 1.1) than younger drivers, they were over twice as likely to have a crash involving a left-hand turn (OR 2.3; 95% CI 2.2 to 2.5). Also, older drivers were more likely to be killed or hospitalized than younger drivers (OR, 3.5; P <.001). Among belted drivers, an older driver was nearly 7 times more likely to be killed or hospitalized than a younger driver (OR 6.9; 95% CI 5.4 to 8.9). Conclusion: Older drivers do have distinctive motor vehicle crash patterns. Interventions must be taken to reduce the number of left-hand turn crashes involving older drivers. In addition, further research is needed to design, implement, and evaluate countermeasures that may enable older drivers to continue driving while keeping public safety in the forefront.

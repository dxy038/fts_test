Control charts are widely used for monitoring the quality of a product or a process. Their implementation
cost motivates researchers to design them with the lowest cost and most desirable statistical
properties. Usually, the cost function is optimized subject to statistical properties. However, the cost
function also depends on statistical properties, and minimizing it as the only objective is not an efficient
method of economic statistical design of control charts. In this paper, cost function, as well as statistical
properties, including probability of Type I error, power of X control chart, and Average Time to Signal
(ATS), are considered as objectives; the corresponding constraints are also used. Then, a Multi-Objective
Genetic Algorithm for Economic Statistical Design (MOGAESD) is proposed for identifying the Pareto optimal
solutions of control chart design. The preferred solution is selected by the designer. The performance
of the proposed method is compared through some numerical examples reported in the literature. The
results show that the proposed approach is effective.

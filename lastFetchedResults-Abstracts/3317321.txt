This paper proposes a framework for selecting affinely parametrized qLPV model structures that facilitates solutions to specific control design tasks. The proposed scheme is an iterative process in every step of which a Tensor Product model transformation is applied to generate a finite element convex polytopic representation in order to obtain a quasi Linear Parameter Varying model. Then the LMI feasibility of a robust control objective is verified, which is closely related to the original control task. This step provides a selection criterion that sorts out the suitable models from a finite set of model candidates generated by the TP method. The proposed modeling scheme is simulated through an academic example.

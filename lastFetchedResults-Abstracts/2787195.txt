Joint synthesis of static state-feedback and dynamic feed-forward is considered for a homogenous platoon operating under the leader and predecessor following scheme. The problem is formulated with two &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub>-type performance objectives. The first objective requires the first vehicle to respond in a desirable way to the maneuvers of the leader and it is to be realized by a joint synthesis of the feed-forward filter together with a state feedback gain. Novel LMI conditions are derived for this objective by fixing the order and the poles of the filter. The second objective aims at preventing the amplification of the errors backward along the platoon, while also maintaining robustness against communication problems with the leader. New sufficient LMI conditions are provided for this objective, based on which leader and predecessor feedback gain matrices can be constructed.

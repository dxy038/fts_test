This paper proposes a unique topology of voltage-fed high-frequency series load resonant inverter with a lossless snubber capacitor and an auxiliary switched cell for induction heating appliances. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate how high power density can be achieved by including a switched capacitor cell with the capacitor-clamped half-bridge zero voltage switching high-frequency inverter circuit using the PWM control scheme. The operation principle of the proposed inverter circuit is based upon an asymmetrical duty cycle pulsewidth modulated (PWM) control scheme. The operating performances of high-frequency ac regulation and power conversion efficiency characteristics are shown through experiments with their soft-switching operating ranges.

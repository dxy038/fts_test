A digital image copyright protection system model is built on the foundation of chaotic map and image fusion. During the pretreatment progress of chaotic map, the safety of the system is reinforced by using encryption technology. As the new embedding algorithm presented, the ability of JPEG anti-compress of the spatial domain algorithm is improved. The reliability of the algorithm is proved by a series of subjective and objective evaluation also by some offensive experiments. Results from large quantity of experiments can prove that the digital watermarking algorithm in this work is able to embed and extract watermark efficiently from the carrier images and it has a remarkable functional value.

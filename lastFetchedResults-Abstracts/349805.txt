Objective
To examine in detail the relations between seizures and K-complexes in autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE).
Methods
Prolonged continuous video-EEG recording and analysis of 30 seizures in an 18-year-old woman suffering from ADNFLE with a CHRNA4 gene mutation.
Results
Twenty-seven of 30 recorded seizures started just after a K-complex. In nine cases a sound induced a K-complex that was immediately followed by the seizure. Most seizures preceded repetitive and brief ictal restarts.
Conclusions
Three new characteristics have been observed in this ADNFLE patient: a K-complex is almost invariably present at seizure onset; sounds trigger some seizures; ictal restarts occur often.
Significance
These new observations – the presence of K-complexes at seizure onset and occurrence of sound-triggered seizures – support the view that ADNFLE seizures may be initiated by K-complexes.

Background: Nelumbo nucifera has been used as antifertility agent in females by the
local tribals of Rajasthan especially of Udaipur district India.
Objective: The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of Nelumbo
nucifera on the fertility and general physiology in female rats.
Materials and Methods: 20 female albino rats were taken and divided into two groups.
Group 1 served as control and group 2 received ethanolic extract at dose of 800mg/kg
b.wt. for investigating the nature of the drug and antifertility effect. Vaginal smear was
monitored everyday in the morning to study the estrous cycle. On day 41st all the
animals were sacrificed and various haematological and biochemical parameters were
estimated.
Results: Data revealed that oral administration of Nelumbo nucifera extract brought
about a significant decline in the weight of Ovary; Control (43±4.75mg), Nelumbo
extract treated (25±3.86mg), Uterus; Control (236±0.004mg), Nelumbo extract treated
(214±0.007mg) and Vagina; Control (221±0.002mg), Nelumbo extract treated
(178±0.003mg) as well as protein and glycogen level, however cholesterol level
increased significantly. In addition, the diestrous phase of the estrous cycle was found to
be prolonged; Control (1.81±0.21) days, Nelumbo extract treated (3.62±0.42) days.
Conclusion: These results suggest that Nelumbo nucifera has the anti-estrogenic nature
without altering the general physiology of the female rats.

The objective of this work is to analyze the dynamic behavior of a generator which uses a grid-connected inverter with an output LC filter. In this paper, we focus on modeling and simulating this kind of inverter using real time simulation. A control strategy based on resonant controller is proposed. State feedback structure and pole assignment methods are used to design the controller. To test this control algorithm, a virtual PWM converter is embedded in a real time simulator. Using interpolation techniques, the controller can directly control this virtual inverter with real PWM high frequency signals.

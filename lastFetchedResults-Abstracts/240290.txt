This paper describes a PC based simulator for training students/engineers in the area of power system control and operation. The simulator models a generation and transmission system to meet a prespecified daily demand with an objective of minimizing the system operating cost. Transmission constraints, overcurrent relays, frequency dynamics and load-shedding schemes are also incorporated as part of the simulator. Sample training scenarios and an auto-assessment based on a prespecified grading scheme are presented.

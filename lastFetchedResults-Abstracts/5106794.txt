The objective of this paper is to present advanced and less known techniques for the analysis of performance degradation due to statistical uncertainty for a wide class of linear stochastic systems in a rigorous and concise manner. The main technical advance of the present paper is a strong approximation theorem for the Djereveckii-Fradkov-Ljung (DFL) scheme with enforced boundedness, in which, for any q ges 1, the L<sub>q</sub>-norms of the so-called residual terms are shown to tend to zero with rate N<sup>-frac12-epsiv</sup> with some epsiv &gt; 0. This is a significant extension of previous results for the recursive prediction error or RPE estimator of ARMA processes given in [L. Gerencser, Systems Control Lett., 21 (1993), pp. 347-351. Two useful corollaries will be presented. In the first a standard transform of the estimation-error process will be shown to be L-mixing. In the second the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimator will be given. An application to the minimum-variance self-tuning regulator for ARMAX systems will be described

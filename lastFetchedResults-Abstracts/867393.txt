This paper studies the vehicle routing problem with due times. The vehicles are supposed to visit customers within the due times, and a penalty cost is imposed in case the vehicle arrives past the due times. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the traveling time of vehicles and the tardiness of the service customers receive. A mixed integer programming formulation and a heuristic based on the tabu search for a practical use are suggested. Route-perturb and route-improvement method for the neighborhood generation is proposed. Performances are compared with other heuristics appeared in the literature using the bench-mark data set modified to be fit to the model. It is shown that the suggested heuristic gives a good solution in a short computation time.

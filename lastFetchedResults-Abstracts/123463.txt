Background: Smoking is one of the major health problems worldwide and health politicians, especially medical doctors can play a key role in preventing and controlling of this global epidemic among their patients.
Objective: To evaluate the physicians' knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) towards smoking.
Methods: This was a descriptive analytical study in which the target population included all general physicians employed in state-run or private sectors. A total of 5140 GPs in 20 provinces of the country were randomly chosen based on available information from health care organization. Data were collected using questionnaires completed by educated questioners.
Findings: The prevalence of smoking among general physicians was 7.43% (9.7% in males and 0.8% in females). Regular smoking was found in 1.79% of women and 10.37% of men and the average of cigarettes used by smokers was 6.6 per day. The average age to start smoking was 23.04Â±5.7 years. Most doctors (90%) believed in necessity of education to quit smoking manners.
Conclusion: Although the prevalence of smoking among GPs found to be less than the general population, regarding the important of their roles, inclusion of extra educational sessions on tobacco control and prevention methods in universities seems to be of prime necessity. This will eventually cause a decrease in prevalence of smoking among this important shell of the society.

In order to assessment and prediction of hydrological processes with inherent complexity, processes changes effects on the nonlinear behavior of watershed system in the past and future and specification of water and soil conservation operation, using indirectly methods such as simulation of watershed processes therewith directly methods is necessary. The objective of this research is evaluation of runoff generation in space and time using distributed hydrological WetSpa model in Taleghan watershed of the Sefidrood basin. Thus flow hydrographs and peak discharges in any space of the stream network were predicted also spatially distribution of hydrological processes such as runoff was simulated using incorporating of both daily meteorological data in an 11 year period and three base maps information. Simulated results reveal that there is good agreement between observations and simulations. The Nash- Sutcliffe criteria, 83.3% and accuracy of the simulation show the high performance of the model in this watershed. Regarding to the outputs and spatially distributed hydrological factors in daily time step the model is capable to analyze topography, soil type, and land use effects on the hydrological behavior of the watershed.

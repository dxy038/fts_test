This paper describes a program directed toward eliminating the need for a stator seal in turbine-driven space power generators that are required to operate in an energy conversion loop using liquid metals such as mercury and potassium Stator seals may be one of the major development problems affecting the reliability and design of space power generators. The need for higher system reliability and improved generator design optimization is the compelling reason for the effort towards eliminating the stator seal requirement. Development of a generator insulation system and winding configuration that permits direct exposure of the generator stator to a liquid-metal-vapor environment was the initial objective of the program, and development of a generator that incorporates the unsealed stator concept is the ultimate program objective.

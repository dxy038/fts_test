This paper presents a new approach for assessing agricultural landscapes based on mixture
methods and the study and definition of aesthetic attributes as lines, forms, texture, spatial composition, scale
and color as they are the closest to human perceptual aesthetic attributes. A set of variables capable of
quantifying those attributes in a simple, objective and systematized way will be proposed. They are related
with physical dimensions such as length, radium, angle, surface or brightness. People preferences for a specific
type of agricultural landscape have been collected and different regression models between preferences and
variables capable of quantifying attributes have been tried. The optimal model, explaining 82.3% of the
variance in population preferences, selects 41 variables, adopts a linear structure and identifies the color as the
most relevant attribute on population preferences and, inside it, green brightness as the most positive influencing
variable on preferences being referred to red gamma the most influencing negative one.

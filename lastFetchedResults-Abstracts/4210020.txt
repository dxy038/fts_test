A multi-product, multi-objective vendor selection model which incorporate fuzzy demand, shortage cost and fuzzy chance constraints, is proposed in this paper. Different weight is assigned to each objective according to the decision-makerÂ´s preference, and the model is converted into a single-objective hybrid integer programming. A genetic algorithm combined with fuzzy simulation technology is provided to find the optimal solutions. Lastly numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.

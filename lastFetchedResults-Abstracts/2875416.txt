The concept of interoperation between cloud providers is a recent research challenging objective. Current cloud systems have been developed without concerns of seamless cloud interconnection, and actually they do not support intercloud interoperability. The paper proposes a conceptual model for Intercloud Interoperability, to enable schedule dynamic operation for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) between different clouds. The paper is providing a better understanding of elaborates on the cloud computing architecture, appropriate metrics for Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Quality of Service (QoS) models that are required for seamless integration and interoperability between cloud environments. Then, a conceptual model for the Intercloud Interoperability Framework for Workload Migration is proposed. The novel component of the framework that provides interoperability is the Transformation Engine that maps workload between heterogeneous cloud providers, whilst Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is adopted as an applicable method for developing the Transformation Engine module.

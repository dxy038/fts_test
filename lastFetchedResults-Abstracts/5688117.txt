In the liberalized power market the electrical networks remain a monopoly. Therefore a comparison of the system operators becomes necessary to assume the function of a market within the monopoly. Here the use-of-system charges show clear differences between the various system operators in all voltage levels. In spite of many qualitative reasons and quantitative efforts for explanation, no objective relations between cause and effects could be determined. In this article a method is introduced, hereinafter referred to as reference network analysis, to investigate the influences of structural parameters on the costs of networks by objective criteria. The individual cost-influences of structural parameters are additionally quantified by a multiple regression analysis. Basing on the structural parameters, a comparative evaluation of the network efficiencies takes place calculated by the reference network analysis and the data envelopment analysis.

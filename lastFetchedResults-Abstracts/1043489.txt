The main objective of the present investigation is to study heat transfer in parallel micro-channels of 0.1 mm in size. Comparison of the results of this study to the ones obtained for two-phase flow in “conventional” size channels provides information on the complex phenomena associated with heat transfer in micro-channel heat sinks. Two-phase flow in parallel micro-channels, feeding from a common manifold shows that different flow patterns occur simultaneously in the different micro-channels: liquid alone (or single-phase flow), bubbly flow, slug flow, and annular flow (gas core with a thin liquid film, and a gas core with a thick liquid film). Although the gas core may occupy almost the entire cross-section of the triangular channel, making the side walls partially dry, the liquid phase always remained continuous due to the liquid, which is drawn into the triangular corners by surface tension. With increasing superficial gas velocity, a gas core with a thin liquid film is observed. The visual observation showed that as the air velocity increased, the liquid droplets entrained in the gas core disappeared such that the flow became annular. The probability of appearance of different flow patterns should be taken into account for developing flow pattern maps. The dependence of the Nusselt number, on liquid and gas Reynolds numbers, based on liquid and gas superficial velocity, respectively, was determined in the range of ReLS = 4–56 and ReGS = 4.7–270. It was shown that an increase in the superficial liquid velocity involves an increase in heat transfer (NuL). This effect is reduced with increasing superficial gas velocity, in contrast to the results reported on two-phase heat transfer in “conventional size” channels.

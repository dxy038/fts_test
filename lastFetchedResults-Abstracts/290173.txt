Gynaecologists have become increasingly aware of the need to offer conservative therapy for genuine stress incontinence. There is good objective evidence from randomized controlled trials to support the use of supervized pelvic floor exercises. The efficacy of biofeedback therapy, vaginal cone weights and electrostimulation therapy is variable and requires further study to identify those women who will benefit the most. The mainstay of therapy for detrusor instability/sensory urgency remains bladder training, which has proven objective efficacy, but new treatments such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) offer promise. Finally, for certain groups of women with mixed stress and urge leak, a new range of vaginal and urethral devices provide useful additional options. The specific requirements for future research are discussed.

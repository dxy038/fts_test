The objective of this paper is to study a method which can estimate DOAs for a general situation, i.e., cohere pair/noncoherent source and correlated/uncorrelated unknown noise environments. The proposed method employs the difference between the FB averaging of the covariance matrix and its transformation to eliminate or reduce the noise effects. The FB averaging is to provide the effects of doubling the number of samples data and to decorrelate the coherent sources in pair

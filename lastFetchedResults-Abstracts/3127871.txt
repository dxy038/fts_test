In today´s service provider networks MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS TE) is one of the fastest growing implementation. MPLS adoption in service provider networks has increased manifold due to its inherent TE capabilities. A purpose of traffic engineering in a network is to setting up paths between the edge nodes of the network to meet traffic demands while optimizing network performance. It is known that total traffic throughput in a network, or resource utilization, can be maximized if a traffic demand is split over multiple paths. MPLS networks can use native TE mechanisms to minimize network congestion and improve network performance. MPLS TE also relay on class of routing algorithms called online routing algorithms to avoid occurrence of congestion and to optimize network resource utilization, but primary objective is to try to minimize the probability of blocking future requests for creation of the new LSP´s on the network.

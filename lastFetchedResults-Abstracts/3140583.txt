According to the features of partner selection, TL-ACO divided each selection step into two stages and each stage was given independent pheromone and visibility. As a result of that, the objective function could be much simpler than if original ACO was used, and the local optimum solution can be easily avoid by using the local obstruction (LO) method which was developed based on bionics. The simulation experiment manifested that the TL-ACO was effective and high-efficiency.

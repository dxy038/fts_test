Although much research focuses on online game addiction, few of them study its formation based on players. The objective of the study is to explore the formation of online game addiction based on the players and find the factors of leading to online game addiction by empirical approaches. This study adopted a questionnaire on a website to investigate the relationships between the addiction and flow experience, behavior repetition and psychological profile among Chinese college students. After regression analysis, the results indicated that behavior repetition was the main contribution to the online game addiction, and flow experience of the players was a facilitating factor, and loneliness of the players also was a latent factor. The three factors jointly resulted in online game addiction.

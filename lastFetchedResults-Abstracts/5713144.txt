Software agents offer a promise to change electronic commerce trading by helping Internet traders to purchase products from online distributed resources based on their interests and preferences. Users delegate trading responsibilities to software agents to automate many of the real world trade practices. Existing e-commerce systems inhabit some limitations, which are not realistic in real world trading. This paper presents a peer-to-peer agent-mediated e-commerce system. The system architecture describes the different stages and components that require automation and needed to develop an e-commerce system. The main objective of this system is to address some of the shortcomings that are present in contemporary e-commerce systems, such as single attribute-based negotiation and the necessity of an electronic marketplace. To demonstrate the proposed system a prototype is implemented.

The most common ground locomotion method to make a mobile robot move is to use two-wheel drive with differential steering and a rear balancing caster. Controlling the two motors independently makes the robot non-holonomic in its motion. Such robots can work well indoor on flat surfaces and in environments adapted for wheelchairs. But the benefit of providing mobility to a robot directly relies on its locomotion capability, for handling different types of terrains (indoors or outdoors) and situations such as moving slowly or rapidly, with or without the presence of moving objects (living or not), climbing over objects and potentially having to deal with hazardous conditions. It is with this objective in mind that we designed AZIMUT. AZIMUT is a legged tracked wheeled robot capable of changing the orientation of its four articulations. Each articulation has three degrees of freedom (DOF): it can rotate 360deg around its point of attachment to the chassis, can change its orientation over 180deg, and rotate to propulse the robot.

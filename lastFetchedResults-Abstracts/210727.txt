OBJECTIVE: To determine the magnitude and types of corneal complications of Vernal Kerato- Conjunctivitis (VKC) and their effects on vision.
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive case-series.
PLACE AND DURATION: This study was conducted from September 2007 to January 2009 at three institutions in Karachi; Department of Ophthalmology, Dow University of Health Sciences and Civil Hospital, Baqai Medical University Hospital and Sindh Government Qatar Hospital Orangi Town.
METHODOLOGY: All cases of vernal kerato-conjunctivitis presenting from the different areas of Karachi were included in the study. The diagnosis was made mainly on the basis of history and clinical examination.
RESULTS: Total 200 patients were examined. Superficial punctate keratitis was the most common corneal complication (46%). Visual impairment was more pronounced in case of Schield ulcer (16%) and corneal plaques (8%). Association with keratoconus (13%) was also noted. Corneal opacification (13%), and psuedogerontoxon (4%) were also abserved.

Introduction: The execution of composed educational programs for general
practitioners is one of the most common methods of continuing medical
education. This research project aims to evaluate one of these programs.
Methods: For this purpose, a pre- and post-test design was developed. The
subjects consisted of 45 participants. They were tested (by a 76 MCQ knowledge
test) in two stages: before and after the program. A questionnaire was also used
to gather the participants’ views on four variables including teachers' behavior,
the degree of achieving the objective of the program, objective of the learner,
and satisfaction with the program.
Results: Based on the results of this study, the mean scores of the participants’
knowledge increased from 10.05 (first test) to 12.61 (second test), (p < 0.0001).
In addition, the results showed that the teachers’ behavior and satisfaction with
the program were rated by participants as the highest and least, respectively.
Conclusion: The results of this research are indicative of the effectiveness
of the composed educational program in continuing medical education.
Nevertheless, such programs are recommended to be further evaluated with
more rigorous design.

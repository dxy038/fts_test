Remote sensing images acquired in various spectral bands are used to estimate certain geophysical parameters or detect the presence or extent of geophysical phenomena. In a majority of cases, the raw image acquired by the sensor is processed using various operations such as filtering, compression, enhancement, etc. In performing these operations, the analyst is attempting to maximize the information content in the image to fulfill the end objective. The information content in a remote sensing image for a specific application is greatly dependent on the gray-scale resolution of the image. One of the measures to quantify information content is classification accuracy. The authorsÂ´ research reveals that the loss in information is exponential with respect to the number of gray levels. The model is seen to be applicable for Landsat TM and SIR-C images. Using their mathematical model for the information content of images as a function of gray-scale resolution, one can specify an &#8220;optimal&#8221; gray-scale resolution for an image

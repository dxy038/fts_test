A layered algorithm of bidirectional search is proposed for the problem of the route with multiple restrictions. The first step is to calculate the reachability set of path to each intermediate nodes using starting from the source nodes and the target nodes separately; and the second is to filtrate the path in the set. The reachability of paths can be obtained from the adjacent matrix transform, and the riddling paths are selected using the heuristic optimal selection according to the nonlinear overhand function. And when the accumulated sum of nodes from two-way search reaches n-2, merger the paths from two directions to the intermediate node, so obtain numbers of paths among the different nodes from the source node to the target node, and select the optimal path as the output route. The courses of the reachability set of route and the heuristic optimal selection methods are introduced in detail through calculation examples, the worst complexity in time is analyzed. According to the simulation and evaluation, the result validates the correctness of the new algorithm, and also proves the new algorithm has obvious advantage in performance than other algorithm.

The objective function considered is the total weight of the structure subjected to material and performance constraints in the form of stress and deflection limits. The Modified BPSO is population based optimization algorithm which was inspired by the social behavior of birds. Individual birds in the flock exchange information about their position, velocity and fitness, and the behavior of the flock is then influenced to increase the probability of migration to regions of high fitness. The calculation results show that the Modified BPSO is able to achieve better results in comparison with conventional mathematical, genetic algorithm and harmony search algorithm methods used in truss structures.

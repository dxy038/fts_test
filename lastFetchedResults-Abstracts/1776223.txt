Inroduction & Objective: Fishes might experience starvation in the process of catching and transportation and the prior events. These events of hunger can be effective on some factors of blood serum and survival. 
Materials and Methods: To understand the effects of starvation on some blood parameters of the Cyprinus carpio blood serum, with the average weight of 3.243 ± 0.132 gr, a study was initiated for 6 weeks, with 2 groups and 3 repeats. The study was carried on with feeding 10% of body weight (3 times a day) and complete hunger, in the temperature of  28 ± 2 C, pH: 7.8-8.2 and 6 ppm oxygen. To gather information about the effects of starvation on Cyprinus carpio's blood factors by every repeat, 5 to 7 fingerlings fish were accidentally chosen each week. The fish were anesthetized with 200 ppm of colve oil .The blood was sent to the lab for measuring the blood factors.
Results: The research showed that starvation has notable effects on the level of all of the aforementioned blood factors, also the chance of survival. And thus, there's a disparity between the attendances (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Finally, the results that came from this research shows that by protracting the starvation duration, the studied biochemical factors  of blood, and the survival chance will drop noticeably.

The oxygen pulse as an indicator of02 conveyance in circulatory system has
recently been subject to clinical investigations, and there is not much
information about this cardiovascular variable. The purpose ofthis study was the
prediction and comparison of maximal 02 pulse in male adolescents. For this
purpose, 60 adolescents with a mean (S.D) age, weight and height of 16±0.81
years, 59.92±JO.39 Kg and 168±8./7 em respectively , and were selected
randomly, participated in this research. To predict the maximal 02 pulse, the
subjects performed 4 exercise tests :GXT Treadmill test, pwc 195, pwc 212
ergometer test and one mile running test. Then, til select an optimum exercise
test, the values obtained from 4 exercise tests were compared with Cooper
predictive protocol (criterion protocol). GXT test, in comparison with pwc 195,
pwc 212 and 1 mile running test, revealed that objective prediction of maximal
02 pulse (14.40 mI.beat) did not show an}' significant difference from Cooper
protocol (P=0.519) . The pwc 195 (P=0.001) , pwc 212 (P=0.00l) and 1 mile
running test (P=0.003) were significant different (from the viewpoint of
overestimation, underestimation) from Cooper protocol. The results suggest that
maximal 02 pulse, as an indicator of cardiopulmonary efficiency, is predicted
more objectively by GXT test rather than other exercise tests, so the value of
maximal 02 pulse resultedfrom this protocol, is very close to Cooper values.

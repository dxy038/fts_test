Objective: Anthropometric indices to obesity were evaluated as predictors of metabolic syndrome
risk factors. Our purpose was to explore an optimal or more reliable anthropometric indicator and optimal cutoff
points for obesity on metabolic syndrome in Chinese adults. Participants and methods: The survey was
conducted involving 2947 participants, aged 20 or above with cross-sectional study of population. The
predictive validity and optimal cut-off values were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves,
area under curve (AUC) and the largest Youden’s index (sensitivity + specificity -1) by gender group,
respectively. Kappa value showed diagnostic consistency. Results: (1) According to the criteria of CDS 2004,
IDF 2005 and AHA/NHLBI 2005, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 10.32%, 9.64% and 16.12%
respectively, which indicated that the prevalence was higher in men than in women and increased with age (P
< 0.05). (2) The BMI, WC, WHR and WHtR in metabolic syndrome patients were greater than those in healthy
volunteers and the indices in men were higher than those in women. (3) With adjusted age and gender, the
partial correlation coefficient for BMI-WC, BMI-WHR and BMI-WHtR was 0.7991, 0.5278 and 0.8196,
respectively (P < 0.05). (4) The area under curves (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
for WHtR was larger (P < 0.05) than that for WC and WHR. The cut-point of WHtR was approximately 0.5 in
both genders with a satisfactory balance between sensitivity and specificity, where the Kappa (κ) value for
WHtR-BMI was higher than that for WHtR-WHR, and WHtR-WC. Conclusions: The results indicated that
WHtR might be an optimal anthropometric predictor of metabolic syndrome risk factors and the cut-point of
WHtR was approximately 0.50 in both genders of Chinese adults.

Based on the practicable of function, environment compatibility and economic applicability of packaging, and using life cycle assessment (LCA), the hierarchy structure of evaluation index system was established. Then weight of items in the evaluation system was given by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation was used for rationality evaluation of packaging. Furthermore, an example was analyzed for demonstration. The results showed that using LCA in rationality evaluation of packaging could comprehensively consider evaluate environmental, economic and functional factors. It was a comprehensive evaluation index system, and could get the objective and impartial results. For the strong social significance, it could provide direction for improvement assessment with this simple and practicable method even good maneuverability. It also showed the feasibility of rationality evaluation.

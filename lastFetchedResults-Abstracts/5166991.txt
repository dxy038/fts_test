Many post-processing algorithms can efficiently reduce blocking artifacts but pay less attention to the sharpness of the image edges. In this paper, we propose a new post-processing method based on forward and backward anisotropic diffusion for reducing blocking, ringing effects and sharpening the edges. The proposed algorithm has been applied to the compressed video sequences for picture quality enhancement. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently improve the objective and subjective quality for different bit rate case

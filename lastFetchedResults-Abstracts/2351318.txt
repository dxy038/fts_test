Saturation currents and chemiluminescence, especially at the CH∗ and C 2 ∗ wavelengths, are measured for a range of small, laminar methane flames during progressive addition of air, with the principal objective of distinguishing between pure diffusion flames, premixed flames of compositions falling between the upper and lower flammability limits, and the broad range of aerated flames lying in between these regimes. Flame areas defined by the loci of maximum luminosity and by schlieren contours were recorded, so that saturation current densities, CH∗ and C 2 ∗ emission per unit flame area, as well as burning velocities could be deduced. For admixtures of less than 70 vol.%, air appears to act, surprisingly, as an inert diluent as regards saturation currents, so that saturation currents are essentially proportional to fuel flow alone. Much the same applies to chemiluminescence. However, schlieren contours, which were recorded both to provide a basis for burning velocity measurements and to explore density changes in the reactants, indicated the presence of a burner – stabilised propagating reaction zone ahead of the luminous flame surface starting at around 50 vol.% and possibly even at lower air admixtures. This evidence of a steep change in refractive index is indicative of a premixed reaction zone involving the added oxygen, which however generates no chemi-ionization and emits no light. Even photographing the flame by radiation emitted at the CH∗ and C 2 ∗ wavelengths shows no sign of its existence. Its burning velocity is about 10 cm/s, when stabilized by the surrounding diffusion flame. The most plausible rationale for these observations is the formation of syngas by the partial oxidation of methane. The subsequent burning of CO and H2 is known to occur without chemi-ionization or appreciable light emission.

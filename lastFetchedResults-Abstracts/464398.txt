OBJECTIVE: In spite of increased expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor surface receptors on solid tumors, the growth modulatory effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor have not been well defined in gynecologic malignancies. We assessed the in vitro growth effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor on such cell lines. STUDY DESIGN: By use of a chromium 51 incorporation assay the in vitro growth effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor on 12 cell lines derived from human malignancies were measured. RESULTS: No growth stimulatory or inhibitory effect was mediated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor on six cell lines, whereas three lines showed consistent but not statistically significant dose-dependent growth stimulation. There was, however, a statistically significant increase in growth of short duration in three other cell lines at clinically relevant doses of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Fluorometric cell cycle analysis demonstrated no change in cell-cycle distribution. CONCLUSION: Within this in vitro system, stimulation of gynecologic malignancies in patients receiving granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for mitigation of the myelosuppressive effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy does not appear to be widespread nor sustained beyond 48 hours.

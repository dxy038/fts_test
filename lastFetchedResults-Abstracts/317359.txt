Objective—To assess the value of a computer-assisted three-dimensional guidance system (Virtual Patient System) in maxillofacial operations. Design—Laboratory and open clinical study. Setting—Teaching Hospital, Austria. Subjects—6 patients undergoing various procedures including removal of foreign body (n=3) and biopsy, maxillary advancement, and insertion of implants (n=1 each). Interventions—Storage of computed tomographic (CT) pictures on an optical disc, and imposition of intraoperative video images on to these. The resulting display is shown to the surgeon on a micromonitor in his head-up display for guidance during the operations. Main outcome measures—To improve orientation during complex or minimally invasive maxillofacial procedures and to make such operations easier and less traumatic. Results—Successful transferral of computed navigation technology into an operation room environment and positive evaluation of the method by the surgeons involved. Conclusions—Computer-assisted three-dimensional guidance systems have the potential for making complex or minimally invasive procedures easier to do, thereby reducing postoperative morbidity.

This paper presents an implicit enumeration based 0-1 integer programming methodology for finding the optimum preventive maintenance schedule of generating units. The objective function is to maintain the units as earlier as possible. Various constraints such as spinning reserve, duration of maintenance and maintenance crew are being taken into account. In a case study, using the power system of the first reference with six generating units, and implying implicit enumeration, we obtain one optimum solution and seven other feasible solutions. Finally with respect to the mentioned reference, we make a conclusion.

The purpose of this study is to examine what types of objective functions should be dynamically optimized to improve overall operation efficiency of a single-car elevator system with destination hall call registration. Here, destination hall call registration is such an elevator system that passengers can register their destination floors directly at elevator halls. We propose a method to apply simulated annealing to this dynamic operation optimization problem. Then, we show by numerical experiments that the weighted averages of two types of objective functions such as the weighted average service time and the maximum service time are effective, where the service time of a passenger is the time from when he/she pushes a button at an elevator hall till when he/she leaves the car at his/her destination floor.

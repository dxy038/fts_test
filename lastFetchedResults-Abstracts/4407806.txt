Energy saving is one of the main themes for the green communication. But the conflict between energy consumption and transmission delay in stochastic wireless networks has become an inevitable problem which must be solved. In this paper, an optimization problem is formulated with the objective to minimize the energy consumption under a transmission delay constraint. We use the theory of stochastic network calculus to investigate the relationship among: the delay constraint, the transmission rate and the energy consumption. Thereafter, we achieve the optimum solution of the optimization problem. In the end, numerical results under different configurations are presented and discussed.

Manpower predictive methods have been divided into “subjective” and “objective” methods. Evidences indicate that the “objective methods” are more trustworthy. One can act in two different ways in the form of “objective methods”, to predict the faculty members needed for the active universities: first the procedure based on the ratio of university instructors to students; second the procedure based on the required working hours. It appears that the procedure based on the required working hours, on one hand, considers most of the effective variables which have impact on the approximation of estimation, and on the other hand, it is practicable with those data which are considered as the accessible data that are prepared in universities as usual. 
Therefore, this procedure presents an easy and practical framework for the estimation of the faculty members needed for universities, and can be applied in other levels; that is, it can be applied in the levels of faculties, educational groups and fields, and then one can predict the required faculty members.

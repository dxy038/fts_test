In the process of product intelligent design, product model usually should be established. Generally speaking a complete product model contained a group of attributes, however, in many cases, each attribute needed to be distributed appropriate weight. In this paper the method of extracting attribute sets of product model using product cases was proposed based on attribute reduction in rough set theory, meanwhile, based on the dependency degree and significance concept in rough set theory the method of distributing weight for attributes was proposed. The methods in this paper were objective and universally applicable methods, which were applied to intelligent design of relay product and were proved to be simple and effective.

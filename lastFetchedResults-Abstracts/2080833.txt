Objective
infiltration is considered as a treatment option for initial caries lesions. As cavitated early lesions might require additional restorative intervention, a caries infiltrant might be also used for enamel conditioning prior to composite insertion. This study aimed to analyse the shear bond strength of a flowable composite to sound and demineralised enamel pretreated with a caries infiltrant, a conventional adhesive or a combination of both.
s
ned bovine enamel specimens (n = 120) were either demineralised (14 d, acidic buffer, pH 5) or remained untreated. Sound and demineralised specimens (each n = 20) were then treated with: (1) 35% phosphoric acid, conventional adhesive, (2) 15% hydrochloric acid, caries infiltrant or (3) 15% hydrochloric acid, caries infiltrant, conventional adhesive. Shear bond strength of a flowable composite was tested after 24 h water storage (37 °C) and statistically analysed (ANOVA, p ≤ 0.05). The mode of failure was assessed microscopically at 25× magnification.
s
ineralised enamel, the combination of caries infiltrant and conventional adhesive showed significantly higher shear bond strength values than the conventional adhesive alone, while both being not significantly different from group 2. No significant differences between the groups could be detected on sound specimens. A higher percentage of cohesive failures could be observed in demineralised samples of group 2 (40%) and 3 (65%), while all other specimens presented almost only adhesive failures.
sion
e of a caries infiltrant before application of a conventional adhesive did not impair bonding to sound and demineralised enamel and might be beneficial as a pretreatment in demineralised enamel.

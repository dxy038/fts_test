The objective was to investigate measures of cellular innate immune responses among calm and temperamental Brahman bulls in response to handling and transportation. Sixteen Brahman bulls (344 ± 37 d of age; 271.6 ± 45.5 kg BW) classified as either calm (n = 8) or temperamental (n = 8) were loaded onto a trailer, transported for 4 h to a novel facility, rested 16 h overnight, and then were returned to their original facility after a 4 h transport. Blood samples were collected immediately prior to (time 0) and at 24, 48, and 96 h after initial loading for analyses of innate immune and blood parameters. Leukocyte counts did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) due to temperament before or after transportation, but neutrophil:mononuclear cell ratios were greater in temperamental bulls compared to calm bulls at 24 h. At 24 h, expression of peripheral neutrophil β2-integrin decreased among all bulls compared with 0 h (P &lt; 0.01). Temperamental bulls had greater glucose and cortisol than calm bulls (P &lt; 0.01) at 48 h; whereas calm bulls had elevated neutrophil l-selectin expression, and phagocytic and oxidative burst activity compared with temperamental bulls (P &lt; 0.10) at 48 h. The supernatant collected from endotoxin-stimulated whole blood cultures had greater TNF-α concentrations at 48 h than at the other time points (P &lt; 0.05), but no temperament effect was observed (P &gt; 0.05). In contrast, 96 h after initial loading the supernatant TNF-α concentrations were lower (P &lt; 0.05) among all cattle. Lastly, transportation increased neutrophil phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and cell adhesion molecule expression 96 h post-transportation and the effect was more pronounced among calm bulls. These data suggest that neutrophils from calm bulls are more likely to resist microbial invasion at 96 h after transportation than neutrophils from temperamental bulls.

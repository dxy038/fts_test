Objective: To see the effect of pre-operative incentive spirometry on postoperative atelectasis in patients undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting. Methodology: This was a randomized prospective study. The duration of
study was 05 months from 01-02-2015 to 31-06-2015. A total number of 170 patients were included in this study. In Group I, there were patients in whom incentive spirometry was done before surgery (Study group). While
in Group II patients pre-operative spirometry was not done (Control group). There were 85 patients in each group. Data was analyzed using SPSS Version 19. Chi-square test and independent sample t-test were used for analysis of
qualitative and quantitative variable respectively. P-value < 0.05 was taken as a significant difference.
Results: There were 42.4% patients who have positive smoking history in group I as compared to only 24.7% smoker patients in group II (p-value 0.02). Ventilation time was significantly less in group I patients, it was 5.49+2.28
hours versus 6.74+5.46 hours in group II patients (p-value 0.05). Incidence of post-operative atelectasis was 14.10% in group I and 27.10% in group II patients (p-value 0.04). So we found that pre-operative incentive spirometry
results in considerable reduction in incidence of post-operative atelectasis and it also can reduce ventilation time as well.
Conclusion: Pre-operative incentive spirometry helps to reduce and prevent post-operative atelectasis in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

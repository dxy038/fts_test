The electricity consumption of a charging station is obviously fluctuant. An energy storage system is an effective device to improve the load variation of the charging station. In order to give full play to energy storage system, this paper proposes a charging and discharging control strategy of the storage system considering multi-objective including stabilizing load and economizing electric consumption, changing a bi-objective problem into a single objective problem with weights after fuzzy processing. This paper solves the problem based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, and considers constraints including the demand of uninterruptible power supply and SOC at given time, which has greater practical significance. In this paper, the data of a practical integrated smart grid construction project is taken into considered. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the optimization strategy after simulation analysis.

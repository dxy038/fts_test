Tribol Int 2004;37(8):651–60] to study rectangular elastomeric seals used in linear hydraulic actuators has been expanded to study the system of two identical seals in a row at some distance from each other (tandem or dual seals). The objective is to evaluate the leakage performance of this particular seal arrangement and possible problems associated with the development of a substantial interseal pressure, which have been observed in some experimental studies. The updated model involves anti-extrusion rings supporting the tandem seals. The present study covers the full typical range of operating conditions of such seals, namely sealed pressure between nearly zero and 35 MPa, stroking velocity between 0.05 and 0.5 m/s, and operating temperature from −54 to +135 °C. The leakage results are in quantitative and qualitative agreement with experimental studies and industrial experience. It is found that the tandem seal arrangement offers a significant reduction of leakage (in the order of 50% or more) compared with the single-seal configuration and that the interseal pressure remains low until the time when it rises abruptly to high value, even exceeding the sealed pressure and risking seal failure. However, by allowing a sufficiently large interseal space, the interseal pressure problem is resolved for the projected service life of the sealing system.

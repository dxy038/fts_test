In a world of global marketing, compliance with international standards for quality in conjunction with ISO 9000 certification has become of paramount importance to manufacturing companies in America. American textile companies are more than ever faced with the challenge to produce better quality products, faster, and at reduced costs. These companies are making every effort to achieve control of their manufacturing processes-from dyes and chemicals usage, to machine efficiency, to operator performance, from inventories to on-time deliveries-every aspect of the process is being analyzed in an effort to improve quality and to optimize productivity. Both statistical methods and computer technology are being deployed in this effort. The objective of this paper is to explain the similarities and differences in control achieved via statistical methods such as statistical process control (SPC/SQC) and control via computer technology such as a distributed control system (DCS) in a manufacturing environment. A case study is presented which demonstrates how the techniques are used by a textile manufacturer in its pursuit of world class manufacturing status

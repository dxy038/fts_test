Modern rearing conditions may cause stress to pigs. At the cellular level all animals respond to stress by synthesizing heat shock proteins (HSP), which protect cells from injury. The objective of this study was to examine the concentrations of stress-inducible HSP72 in porcine small intestine and colon, known to be stress sensitive tissues, and to compare the findings with HSP72 concentrations in serum and with conventional markers of stress, namely blood lactate and serum cortisol, glucose, free fatty acids and acute phase proteins.

in the colon correlated with serum HSP72 but there was a negative correlation with carcass weight (growth). The results suggest that the colon may be a significant source of serum HSP72, the concentration of which may reflect changes in the permeability of intestinal epithelium due to stressors, such as transport and handling.

This work presents a combination fuzzy-GA method to resolve the service restoration problem. The problem formulation proposed herein considers five different objective functions related to maximizing the amount of total load to be restored as well as minimizing the number of the switching operations, deviation of the bus voltage, the feeder´s current and transformer´s loading. Meanwhile, the operational constraints, radial structure of the network configuration and sequence of the switching operations are included in the problem formulation. These objective functions are modeled with fuzzy sets to evaluate their imprecise nature. In the interactive method, the dispatcher provides his or her anticipated value (the degree of preference) of each objective, then the optimization problem is solved by the genetic algorithm, Analyzing the results from the former interactive and updating the expected value of each objective function via the interactive procedure allow us to derive the compromised or satisfied solution efficiently. Simulation results obtained from the Tai-Power system demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution algorithm

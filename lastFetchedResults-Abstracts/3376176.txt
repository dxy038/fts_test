The National Science Foundation (NSF) issued a grant to support the formation of a national consortium of universities and industries. The mission of the consortium is to coordinate independent efforts of the member universities to update the engineering and applied sciences curricula for the 1980\Â´s. Shortly after its formation, the consortium recommended that industry "encourage the development of joint research projects with universities." In the spirit of the consortium, but independent of its funding, the General Electric Company (GE) designed, organized, and hosted a workshop that included professors from a number of engineering universities in the northeast and several GE educational specialists. Their objective was to define "Computer Requirements for Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Curricula." Since most university faculty are reluctant to change their legitimate area...curriculum, it is significant that the GE-hosted group arrived at a consensus. The proceedings which are presented here outline the approach used in the workshop and the results. These proceedings were reviewed by a member of the NSF consortium, who found them commendable and right on track with the spirit and effort of the consortium.

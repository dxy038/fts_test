This paper deals with a new inversion technique for nonlinear control systems called the trajectory pattern method (TPM). The objective of this study is to lay out the foundation for the TPM and generalize the open loop results already obtained. Furthermore, a feedback control law based on TPM which allows one to obtain tracking is proposed. The methodology proposed is applied to attain bounded solutions for the inverse of nonminimum phase systems; moreover, under some mild assumptions one is able to get output tracking. The authors also show how the trajectory pattern method is utilized to get point to point motion for nonholonomic control systems. Finally an adaptive based uncertainty scheme is discussed

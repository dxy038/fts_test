Some lighting system designs look good at the beginning, but mask deficiencies that are revealed when the lamps in the system reach the mid-point of lighting system life. Good lighting design is further challenging when the area is a hazardous (or classified) area. Because a luminaire is considered an ignition source, it is essential to consider proper temperature and at the same time, to maintain sufficient light in hazardous areas. New protection methods and new technologies (improvements in lamps, ballasts and light sources) afford designers new choices and flexibility. Lighting software enhances design by offering specific light levels (footcandles), and by considering external surroundings and environmental considerations (e.g. dirt build-up). However, lighting software does not account for hazardous location designs in two key areas: 1) lumen depreciation relative to lamp life and 2) a limited selection of luminaires suitable for hazardous areas due to their energy output. The objective of good lighting design for hazardous locations is to sustain lumen levels longer into lamp life and to improve the lighting system performance. This paper will cite new protection methods and new light source technologies, and their effect on lighting layouts and illumination levels.

Objective
In this paper a new checklist (CLCE-24) for identification of cognitive and emotional problems after stroke is presented. The CLCE-24 is intended to support a clinical interview by health care professionals other than the trained (neuro)psychologist.
Methods
Patients were interviewed with the CLCE-24, 6 months post stroke. Usability was determined by interviews. Quality of the self-report version was determined using reference instruments (MMSE, CAMCOG).
Results
Sixty-nine patients participated in the study (37 men; mean age 66 years). Both patients and assessors were positive about the use of the CLCE-24. Eighty percent of the patients had cognitive and/or emotional problems (73% cognitive; 51% emotional problems). Patients with complaints on the CLCE-24 also showed problems on the MMSE and the CAMCOG (p < 0.05). The CLCE-24 was a predictor of the MMSE and CAMCOG (Adj. R2 = 0.13 and 0.16, respectively) at 12 months post stroke. Internal consistency of the CLCE-24 was good (alpha of 0.81).
Conclusions
The CLCE-24 is a usable and valid instrument for cognitive screening by health care professionals in the stroke service in the chronic phase after stroke.

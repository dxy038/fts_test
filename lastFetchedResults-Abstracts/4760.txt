An optimization framework based on the use of hybrid models is presented for preparative chromatographic processes. The first step in the hybrid model strategy involves the experimental determination of the parameters of the physical model, which consists of the full general rate model coupled with the kinetic form of the steric mass action isotherm. These parameters are then used to carry out a set of simulations with the physical model to obtain data on the functional relationship between various objective functions and decision variables. The resulting data is then used to estimate the parameters for neural-network-based empirical models. These empirical models are developed in order to enable the exploration of a wide variety of different design scenarios without any additional computational requirements. The resulting empirical models are then used with a sequential quadratic programming optimization algorithm to maximize the objective function, production rate times yield (in the presence of solubility and purity constraints), for binary and tertiary model protein systems. The use of hybrid empirical models to represent complex preparative chromatographic systems significantly reduces the computational time required for simulation and optimization. In addition, it allows both multivariable optimization and rapid exploration of different scenarios for optimal design.

This paper investigates the pth moment exponential stability of stochastic bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with time delays and impulses based on the stochastic differential equation theory and norm approximation theory. By estimating the solutions of stochastic differential equation, some criteria ensuring the BAM neural networks stability are obtained. Different from some existing results, the proposed method is much more simple and only depends on the parameters of the BAM neural networks.

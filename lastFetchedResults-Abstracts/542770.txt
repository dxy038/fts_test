Introduction: : In order to prevent from the complications of the coronary angiography, patients who undergo this procedure need to have absolute rest on bed at least for 6 hours. This restriction to bed leads to patient's fatigue and back pain. The objective of this study is to assess the effect ofpatients' instruction by video on the levels offatigue and back pain after angiography. Methods: In a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design, 128 patients were randomly assigned to either control or experimental group. Control group received verbal routine education by nurses, and experimental group received an informative video about the required measures before, during and after the coronary angiography procedure. Using visual analogue Scale (VAS), levels of fatigue and back pain were assessed immediately after and at 2, 4 and 6 hours after the procedure. The data were analyzed by descriptive and interpretive statistics such as t-test and ANOVA via SPSS 15. Results: Analysis of data showed that the average score of fatigue and back pain in the first stage of assessment was not statistically significant between the two groups (P>0.05). The study finding also showed that the control group at 2, 4 and 6 hours had significantly higher fatigue and back pain score than the experimental group(P<0.001). Conclusion: The results of this study recommend the use of instructional video as a useful method for decreasing fatigue and back pain in \ patients undergoing coronary angiography procedure. To increase satisfaction and reduce fatigue and back pain, it is suggested that this | method be used as apart of the preparatory program for patients who are to undergo invasive procedures.

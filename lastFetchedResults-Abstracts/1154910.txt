The objective of the paper is to present a general algorithm that enables, in a simple way, the incorporation of a set of well known elasto-plastic constitutive models, for porous sintered materials, and to perform a comparative analysis of these various models. These models were modified in order to incorporate an isotropic work hardening and a porosity coupling behavior and implemented in the ABAQUS@ finite element program. The proposed algorithm considered an operator split technique which decomposed the problem into an elastic predictor followed, if necessary, by a plastic corrector step. The algorithm is presented in a general frame work and is thereafter particularized for a given set of constitutive models for porous sintered materials. In the work is also implemented some of these published elasto-plastic models that have not been implemented previously into FEM programs. Finally, some simple examples are solved with the aim of comparing the performance of these different models.

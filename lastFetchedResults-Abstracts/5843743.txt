In the mobile IPv6 based integration of wireless communication and computer network technology, there is a problem of Ping-pong effect, namely Mobile Nodes(MN) hands over frequently between two access routers, causing location update and registration update to be continually carried out and resulting in communication being constantly interrupted as well as seriously affecting usersÂ´ Quality of Service (QoS). A novel scheme based on Ping-pong effect for predictive fast handovers for mobile IPv6 is proposed to solve the problems of long latency, high packet loss rate and excessive signaling redundancy in exiting schemes. And in our scheme a new Hop-by-Hop option header named TM (Tunnel Message) header, PCoA Table and Tunnel Table are defined. TM is encapsulated in the acknowledgement of the last packet sent by NAR to PAR, telling PAR that MN would move back to PAR in the near future, and hoping that the previous bidirectional tunnel between PAR and NAR will be available then, so that MN could implement fast and smooth handovers. Analysis shows that this scheme would be viewed as an effective method to solve the above problems and can improve the QoS for mobile users.

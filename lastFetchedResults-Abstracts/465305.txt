OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine conservative conization as treatment for microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix with depth of invasion <3 mm.
STUDY DESIGN: Twelve patients with microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix underwent cervical conization under colposcopic guidance followed by careful observation.
RESULTS: The 12 patients were alive without evidence of disease after a mean follow-up of 6.7 years. Four pregnancies with term deliveries were identified.
CONCLUSION: Microinvasive carcinoma with a depth of invasion <3 mm without confluent invasion or lymph vascular involvement can be treated successfully with conservative conization and provided a good pregnancy outcome. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:1009-10.)

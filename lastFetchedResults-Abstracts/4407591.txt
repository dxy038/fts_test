Quality of experience (QoE) indicates usersÂ´ perception of an Internet service or business in objective conditions, which is significantly meaningful to service providers or network operators to improve their quality of services and to utilize valuable network resources efficiently. Online video service has become the most fast-growing Internet service in recent years. Building models for QoE evaluation of video services has become a hot research topic. In this paper, we propose three metrics to evaluate buffering situations of HTTP video streaming, which have been verified to be the main factors that influence the QoE of network videos, and together with three fundamental quality of service (QoS) parameters, to build a three-layer QoE model for HTTP video streaming. Then, we use linear regression and BPNN (back propagation neural network) to reflect the mapping relations of the QoS parameters, buffering-related metrics and QoE, and demonstrate that BPNN performs better than linear regression in this situation.

Simulation of inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of a space target and reconstruction under sparse sampling via compressed sensing (CS) are developed. The numerical bidirectional analytic ray tracing (BART) method is employed to compute the polarized scattering from an electrically large target. With multiorbit and multistation imaging modes, 2-D and 3-D ISAR images are acquired, leading to information retrieval of the space target, such as shape, structure, attitude, etc. CS is introduced into the reconstruction of ISAR images under sparse sampling. As an example, the models of the Aura satellite and the X-37B orbital test vehicle are presented for ISAR imaging and reconstruction.

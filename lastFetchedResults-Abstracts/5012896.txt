In this paper, we propose an adaptive cross-layer fragmentation technique for reliable IPTV service delivery over 802.11 WLAN. In our service, the link layer fragmentation is controlled dynamically by the application layer (i.e., RTP) using a cross-layer interaction. This allows to tackle link degradations and to avoid the overhead introduced by the MAC fragmentation level. Performance evaluation conducted using an experimental test-bed shows the ability of our cross-layer mechanism to reduce packet video losses and to enhance the overall objective video quality given by the PSNR and SSIM metrics.

This paper presents a multicycles protocol for hospital automation (MP-HA) that works over multicast addressing and use a master-slave architecture. The protocol creates a segmented logical network based on multicast addressing associated to hospital beds. The objective of MP-HA is to ensure the determinism on network through medium access control mechanism increasing the transmission throughput. Thus, it creates a periodical environment making use of the parallel cycles which is called multicycles.

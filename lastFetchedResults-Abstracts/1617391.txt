A highly practical and efficient regio- and stereoselective synthesis of novel trispiropyrrolidine/thiapyrrolizidine derivatives have been accomplished via multi-component reaction of 7,9-bis[(E)arylidene]-1,4-dioxa-spiro[4,5]decane-8-ones, sarcosine/1,3-thiazolane-4-carboxylic acid and substituted isatins using 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol as a solvent. This new protocol has the advantages of environmental friendliness, higher atom economy, shorter reaction time and convenient operation. The structure and relative stereochemistry of spiro product was established by single crystal X-ray analysis and spectroscopic techniques. Synthesized compounds have been screened for their ‘in vitro’ antifungal and antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.

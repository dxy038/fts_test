Sandwich construction has been extensively used in various fields. However, sandwich panels have not been fully exploited in critical structural applications due to damage tolerance and safety concern. A major problem of sandwich panels is the vulnerability to impact loading, which can lead to a sudden loss of structural integrity and cause catastrophic consequences. In order to improve the energy absorption of sandwich panel under impact loading, a new sandwich core is proposed which is a hybrid core consisting of hollow metallic millitube grid stiffened polymer matrix. The objective of this study is to characterize its impact performances. Quasi-static low velocity impact test and ballistic impact test demonstrate that the new sandwich panel may be considered as a promising option for critical structural applications featured by multiple impact tolerance.

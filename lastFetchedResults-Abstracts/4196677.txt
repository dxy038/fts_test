Modeling and controlling of level process is one of the most common problems in the process industry. Non linear process control is a difficult task in process industries. As the process is v employed. The objective of the project is to control the water level of a cylindrical tank using a adaptive control technique. A tube MRAC scheme is employed in this project. In this work, we develop a new paradigm of performance shaping in MRAC is developed. The general concept is to replace the classical adaptive goal setting in the form of the reference model with a single predetermined trajectory by a Tube reference model. In addition to stability, robustness and asymptotical tracking it also diminishes the control cost with respect to some criterion. An additional optimization is used within the MRAC framework in order to find the value of the correction control term at each instant of time. The performance of tube MRAC is compared with conventional MRAC. The results show that the tube MRAC gives better performance than other controllers and it reduces rise time, settling time and dead time.

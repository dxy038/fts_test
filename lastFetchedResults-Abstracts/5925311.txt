In this paper a comparison between hybrid modulation and space vector technique, applied to trinary hybrid multilevel inverter is presented. The objective of this comparison is to apply and to evaluate the vector technique to current active filters. In the hybrid asymmetric topologies, voltages in DC sources are not equal, and they are multiples one or other, achieving that the number of voltage levels will be increased. The space vector techniques have features such as low switching frequency and generation waveform with a low harmonic content in the PWM pattern. Furthermore, the voltages in common mode can be reduced. The space vector modulation technique together with the trinary hybrid multilevel inverter present several advantages and a good performance in this application.

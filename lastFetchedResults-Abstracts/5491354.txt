This fast abstract introduces a fault injection approach that achieves the mentioned objective while facing a number of facts and technical limitations discussed onwards. While commercially available AUTOSAR basic software (BSW) implementations are certified and ISO 26262 complaint, third party hardware and application software might have not gone through the same rigorous and extensive non-simulation-based validation activities. Also, AUTOSAR was built without taking explicitly fault injection needs into account, which resulted in the lack of required accessibility to either hardware or software interfaces in order to support the injection of faults.

Four algorithms, all variants of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), are proposed. The original one-measurement SPSA uses an estimate of the gradient of objective function L containing an additional bias term not seen in two-measurement SPSA. As a result, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the iterate convergence process has a bias term. We propose a one-measurement algorithm that eliminates this bias, and has asymptotic convergence properties making for easier comparison with the two-measurement SPSA. The algorithm, under certain conditions, outperforms both forms of SPSA with the only overhead being the storage of a single measurement. We also propose a similar algorithm that uses perturbations obtained from normalized Hadamard matrices. The convergence w.p. 1 of both algorithms is established. We extend measurement reuse to design two second-order SPSA algorithms and sketch the convergence analysis. Finally, we present simulation results on an illustrative minimization problem

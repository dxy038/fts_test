Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) with the ability to provide accurate positioning and timing information have become very important for many essential applications of both military and civil purposes. The upcoming European GNSS, Galileo system, foresees providing new advanced signals aiming to improve the receiver sensitivity. Towards the objective of a high sensitivity Galileo receiver architecture capable of operating anywhere at any time, the authors introduce possible joint data/pilot acquisition strategies to adapt with the problem of low received signal power in indoor environments. Analytical expressions as well as Monte Carlo simulations in indoor scenarios are presented to describe and prove the strategies improvement with respect to the conventional one currently operating inside GPS receivers. Additionally, based on the performance comparison among all the strategies, some applicable suggestions with respect to different operation modes are provided as the main contribution here.

Red wine tank aging is monitored by organoleptic analysis, therefore, it is necessary to use an objective parameter representing the process. Among the possible parameters to be checked, it stands out the knowledge of dissolved oxygen because it offers the possibility of anticipating undesirable situations that bring about too much oxidation. Dissolved oxygen measurement, with non-intrusive luminescent technology is becoming an effective alternative. Uncertainty arises when trying to choose the measuring point able to represent the entire tank since previous works have considered the existence of gradients throughout the volume of the treated wine.

This paper shows the results obtained from the study of the existence and the quantification of gradients of the dissolved oxygen in a 15% hydroalcoholic solution during the micro-oxygenation process. Different measuring point placements are studied and the solutions to monitor the process by controlling a representative point are set out. A successful monitoring of a red wine tank aging with alternative oak products and adaptative micro-oxygenation has proved that an objective control of the process is, indeed, possible.

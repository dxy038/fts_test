The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is an IETF-standard transport layer protocol in the IP protocol suite. SCTP is very attractive for data communication over satellite networks due to its unique features such as multihoming and multistreaming that are not present in TCP. SIGMA, an SCTP-based mobility management scheme, has been developed for space networks. RTEMS, an open source Real Time Operating System (RTOS), is used by the computers onboard several spacecraft. The network stack of RTEMS does not include SCTP. The objective of this paper is to describe the issues and challenges in implementing SCTP on the RTEMS operating system. The lessons learned will be helpful to implement SCTP in other operating systems.

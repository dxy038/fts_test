Objective speech quality assessment is a important research in speech processing recently, but there are so many disadvantages in assessment based on input-output. A novel modeling method for non-intrusive objective speech quality measurement based on cloud theory is proposed in this paper. The mothod for rule-maker constructed and feature extracted is proposed. The speech quality for subjective quality speech database is measured. The correlation between subjective system and objective system is analyzed. The Experimental results show that the method is an effective technique to increase nicety and decrease complexity for speech quality assessment.

Islam is a comprehensive and accommodating religion which has proposed practical codes, means and objective plans in all arenas of man’s life. One of the arenas receiving prime focus in the holy Quran refers to issue of command and leading forces in the fields of defense and military. Following a relatively long period of declining shining period of early Islamic ruling system and the caliphs, Imam Khomeini as an Islamic leader rose sun-like from the east and raised again the Islamic Shia’s flag all over the world. The revolutionary movement led by imam Khomeini is significant in that he as a high-ranking Shia authority (Marja), while leading and commanding the armed forces as the commander-in- chief, practically institutionalized the capability and authority of a religious leader in the management of great ruling and military affairs, and provided the man with an objective and positive answer to the question that religion can manage people’s politico-military affairs”. To this end, this study has addressed “strategic, tactical and operational” dimensions of the late and elite leader’s command during the eight-year imposed war by Iraq on Iran, as a model for all military leaders and commanders in the Islamic system.

Objective; To detect Salmonella choleraesuis rapidly, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was developed. Methods: According to fliC gene of S. choleraesuis flagellin protein, LAMP inner and outer primer sets were designed. Amplification reaction carried out within tens of minutes. Specificity of LAMP primers were validated by as-saying 10 different strains. Sensitivity of LAMP method was evaluated by serial gradient dilution of S. choleraesuis cultures. LAMP used for the detection of simulated meat samples. Results: S. choleraesuis LAMP method was rapid and specific. The detection limits of LAMP assay were 1.33&#215;101 CFU/mL for pure cultures and 2.0&#215;101 CFU/mL for simulated meat samples. Conclusion: LAMP method is a rapid and feasible method for the detection of S. choleraesuis.

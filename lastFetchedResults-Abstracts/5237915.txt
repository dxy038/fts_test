The authors describe a novel conceptual multistage topology of a sinewave-modulated DC-LFAC (DC-low-frequency AC) power conversion conditioning and processing system, which incorporate a phase-shifting PWM (pulsewidth modulation) series-resonant cycloinverter (inverter-coupled cycloconverter cascade circuit) with a high-frequency AC (HFAC) transformer link. Its advanced hardware of system control implementation uses instantaneous sinewave-modulated voltage regulation and compensation strategies, depending upon load disturbance and input DC voltage fluctuation, as well as an instantaneous power regenerating regulation scheme. A newly proposed breadboard using MOS-gate power transistor modules is demonstrated and experimentally tested for high-power-density AC mini-uninterruptible power supply. This series resonant cycloinconverter with HFAC link, which includes the control function of a bidirectional power flow, is evaluated as an AC power supply system for telecommunication and spacestation/aerospace energy situations in the next generation

Background: Research is essential to change the dynamics of health care systems. Researches that are based on the system needs provide the process of reform and development.
Objective:  The purpose of this study was to assess the health system researches (HSR) of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences from 2001 to 2009.
Methods: In this descriptive study, 118 completed health system research projects of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences were assessed from 2001 to 2009. Data were collected by using a checklist  includes: general information (subject, place and time of the project, job type and position of the executive director, project type and statement of problem), the planning and intervention information (Such as educational classes, workshops, production of educational booklets and pamphlets, etc.), intervention type (what kind of intervention took place), results of the intervention (What results were achieved after the implementation of interventions) and the publication of the results (to be applied and make changes in the system).
Findings: The highest frequency of executive director was related to the administrative experts (36.44%) and faculty members (29.66%). Most projects (28.81%) have been implemented at the university. The most common subject (43.22%) was management issues and only about 53 cases (44.91%) have been planned for intervention. Projects were presented as final project reports (50.84%), application of the results (28.81%), published paper (16.94%), conference presentation (2.54%) and patents (0.84%). The results of 34 projects (28.81%) have been applied.
Conclusion: There is a big gap between knowledge production and its application and such a delay can cause failure to use of this knowledge to improve the system.

This paper briefly surveys the different models that have been proposed for dynamics of duopolies with competitive advertising and churn. It also proposes a model that is capable of representing competitive advertising and churn, in a unified way for saturated and unsaturated markets. The objective is to carry out a qualitative analysis of the effect of different types of competitive advertising policies in the presence of churn. The proposed model can be seen as a generalization of duopolistic dynamic models that of the classical Vidale-Wolfe and Lanchester type, also including a model of churn. The firm with a perceived lower share of the market switches on an extra control effort in its attempt to get a larger share than its competitor. The main contributions are to show that the proposed approach can serve to explore whether or not it is worth entering a dispute for market share and, if so, what control strategies should be adopted. Furthermore, the effects of churn are studied systematically.

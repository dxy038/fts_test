In this paper, a novel multi-objective optimization method based on genetic algorithm (MGA) is proposed. MGA is applied to optimize the three objective functions. The objective functions are designed for reactive power optimization control, such as, loss and/or invest cost minimization. The simulation results of the new method for IEEE-30 bus system are compared with the results obtained by the single weighted objective method, which shows better performance.

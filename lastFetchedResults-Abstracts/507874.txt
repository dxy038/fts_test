The objective of present study was to determine factors responsible for germination and early seedling growth due to salt toxicity or osmotic effect and to optimize the best priming treatment for these stress conditions. The primed seeds (control, KN03 and hydropriming) of corn {Zea mays L.) cultivar OSSK444 were evaluated at germination and seedling growth for tolerance to salt (NaCl) and drought conditions induced by PEG-6000 at the same water potentials of 0.0, -0.3, -0.6, -0.9 and -1.2 MPa. Results revealed that germination delayed in both solutions (NaCl and PEG), having variable germination with different priming treatments. Germination, root and shoot length were higher but mean germination time and abnormal germination percentage were lower in NaCl than PEG at the same water potential. Seeds were able to germinate at all concentrations of NaCl but no seed germination was observed at -1.2 MPa of PEG treatments. NaCl had less inhibitor effect on seedling growth than the germination. It was concluded that inhibition of germination at the same water potential of NaCl and PEG resulted from osmotic effect rather than salt toxicity. Priming increased germination and seedling growth under salt and drought stresses.

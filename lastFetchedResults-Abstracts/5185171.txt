We describe a network module detection approach which combines a rapid and robust clustering algorithm with an objective measure of the coherence of the modules identified. The approach is applied to the network of genetic regulatory interactions surrounding the tumor suppressor gene p53. This algorithm identifies ten clusters in the p53 network, which are visually coherent and biologically plausible.

Objective:
Our purpose was to investigate the antepartum characteristics and perinatal outcomes of twin-twin transfusion syndrome cases from a multicenter national registry.
Study Design:
Perinatal centers in Australia and New Zealand voluntarily notified a central evaluation registry with information on identified pregnancies with twin-twin transfusion syndrome during 1995 through 1998.
Results:
One hundred twelve cases of twin-twin transfusion syndrome were registered. The median gestation at diagnosis was 21.5 weeks (range, 14.4–34.6 weeks). Oligohydramnios-polyhydramnios sequence was the most common presentation, with 84% of cases involving “stuck” twinning. Therapeutic amnioreduction was used in 92 cases (82.1 %), with the median number of procedures per case being 2 (range, 1–23). The median gestation at delivery was 29 weeks (range, 18–38 weeks). The overall perinatal survival rate was 62.5%. Abnormal findings on cranial ultrasonography were present in 27.3% of live neonates, and periventricular leukomalacia was reported in 10.8%. Increased gestational age at delivery, the presence of umbilical artery diastolic flow, and a prolonged interval from final amnioreduction to delivery were positively associated with the delivery of live fetuses without complications.
Conclusions:
The majority of antenatally identified cases of twin-twin transfusion syndrome are managed with serial amnioreduction. Despite contemporary obstetric and neonatal management strategies, perinatal mortality and morbidity rates are high.

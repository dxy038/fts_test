Introduction: Deviation from normal fetal weight and growth contribute to
morbidity and mortality in the perinatal period. Over 50 formulas for EFW
(estimated fetal weight) have been published and yet the ideal formula has not
been determined . The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of
sonographic estimation of fetal weight using Hadlock. formula in comparison to
birth weight.
Methods: In this descriptive-analytic study, 96 pregnant women without major
fetal anomaly participated. Sonography was preformed 10 days prior 10 delivery.
Biparietal diameter (BPD), femor length (FL) and abdominal circumference CAC)
were measured and fetal weight was calculated according to Hadlock. Formula.
The fetal weight was determined immediately after birth. The difference between
these two weights was analysed by t-test and variance analysis. P<O.05 was
considered significant.
Results: In these 96 pregnant women the range of birth weights was 2000-4100
grams. The mean difference between sonographic EFW and birth weight was
237.8 grams . In 26%, it was less than 100 grams and in 66.7%. less than 300
grams, There were no significant difference between weight groups of < 3000
grams, 3000-3500 grams and >3500 grams.
Conclusion: Sonographic EFW has acceptable value in clinical decision-making.

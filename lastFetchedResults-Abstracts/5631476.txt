This paper aims at achieving a successful WiMAX system, by providing the optimized downlink resources using a proper balance between the revenue of service providers and the satisfaction of subscribers. For these two resources, our framework integrates two management mechanisms, namely, adaptive power allocation (APA) and call admission control (CAC), Since it is difficult to solve the APA-CAC optimization as one mathematical problem. To make APA and CAC to work cooperatively an integrated APA-CAC downlink resource management framework is used. The objective of the downlink resource management is to satisfy the demands of both WiMAX service providers and subscribers. To obtain fair resource allocation, we have used fair-bandwidth allocation algorithm and found comparatively good among the existing mechanisms.

The ROAR Project (1997-2002)- Looking Back Nirmal R. Saxena, NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA, USA Around 1996, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced the adaptive computing systems (ACS) program to focus on providing rapid adaptation and acceleration of sensor front-end signal processing algorithms using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based computing devices and software. Stanford CRCÂ´s ROAR (reliability obtained by adaptive reconfiguration) project was funded under this ACS program. The ROAR project was proposed with an objective of using reconfigurable architectures and multithreaded computing for fault tolerance.

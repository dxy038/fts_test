IEEE 802.16 has been regarded as a promising broadband wireless access technology for its large coverage, quality of service (QoS) support for different types of application, and easy deployment. IEEE 802.16j is an extension of IEEE 802.16 to support relay mode operation. This paper applies IEEE 802.16j to vehicular network to provide Internet access for high-way vehicles. In particular, it proposes a dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithm specifically for relay stations (RS) to support QoS requirements of different types of service. The objective of the proposed DBA is to allocate bandwidth from relay station to its serving subscriber stations (SSs) with QoS consideration. The simulation results have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DBA algorithm.

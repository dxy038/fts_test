Multi-Service channel allocation supporting video service and data service simultaneously for frequency/time slotted cognitive radio (CR) networks is addressed. Our objective is to maximize the total network throughput while guaranteeing quality of service (QoS) requirements of both services. Meanwhile, the optimization problem is formulated into a non-linear integer programming problem. For this, first, we discuss its optimal solution and then we design two kinds of efficient heuristic algorithms. Numerical results reveal that our heuristic channel allocation algorithm with negotiation can achieve near-optimal throughput well satisfying the QoS requirements with simplicity.

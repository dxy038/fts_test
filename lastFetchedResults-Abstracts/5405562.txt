In this paper we present a generalized scheme for quality of service routing with both delay and bandwidth constraints using a delay weighted flow approach. The objective is to minimize call blocking probability. A request is routed along the path capable of supporting the required quality of service and which most preserves the routing ability of the network for future requests. A general mathematical model has been formulated to solve this problem. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes.

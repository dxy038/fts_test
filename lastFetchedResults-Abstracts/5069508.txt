This paper describes a study aiming at build of back to back (BTB) system for the test of high power DC-DC Converter. The proposed new BTB system for test circuit offers the solutions in the reduction of the capability of input power source and bidirectional operational mode test at rating condition. This time we built 20 kW BTB system actually and tested it by 100 kW DC-DC converter. We report the evaluation and technical characteristics regarding BTB system with power adjustment controller (PAC). The configuration and the performance of 20 kW PAC are followed by this report on the successful test results.

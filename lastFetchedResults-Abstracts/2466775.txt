Objective: More similarity to in vivo may help to increase the proliferation and differentiation of cells at in vitro culture. The present study has investigated the effect of a dynamic culture medium and nano hydroxyapatite (nHA) presence on proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to bone cells using electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds.
Methods: We prepared PCL and PCL-nHA scaffolds by electrospinning. After static culturing of the scaffolds with MSCs, the scaffolds, were divided into two groups of static and dynamic cultures. The dynamic culture scaffolds were placed on a shaker. Cell proliferation and differentiation at days 3, 7 and 14 were investigated by MTT, and the calcium and alkaline phosphatase assays.
Results: The obtained results from the MTT assay on day 14 showed an increase of 1.1 times in cell proliferation in the dynamic culture compared to the static culture. During this period, the calcium content produced by cells in the dynamic culture at day 14 were 1.23 times higher for PCL scaffolds and 1.46 times higher for PCL-nHA scaffolds compared to the static culture. Alkaline phosphatase levels for the dynamic state PCL scaffold were 1.24 times more and for PCL-nHA scaffolds were 1.28 times more compared to the static culture at day 14.
Conclusion: The obtained results from dynamic culture, showed higher proliferation and differentiation of stem cells to bone for both PCL and PCL-nHA scaffolds compared to the static culture. The amount of cell proliferation and differentiation in the scaffolds that contained nHA was more than scaffolds that did not have nHA.

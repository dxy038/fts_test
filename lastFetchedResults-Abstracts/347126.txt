Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the test-retest consistency of the event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization (ERD/ERS) method during the performance of an auditory memory task.
Methods: The EEG was recorded while 12 subjects performed an auditory memory task on two separate occasions (mean test-retest interval 9 days). Differences in the ERD/ERS responses between the first and second registrations were examined in 4 EEG frequency bands of interest: 4–6, 6–8, 8–10 and 10–12 Hz.
Results: We observed significant differences in the ERD/ERS responses between the first and second registration in all studied frequency bands when examined as a function of time and experimental task. The test-retest reliability of the ERD/ERS values was highest in the theta frequency range (4–6 and 6–8 Hz), poorer in the 8–10 Hz and poorest in the 10–12 Hz alpha frequency range.
Conclusions: The test-retest effect was seen in the ERD/ERS responses of all studied frequency bands during an auditory memory task.

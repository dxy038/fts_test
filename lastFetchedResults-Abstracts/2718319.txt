A hybrid broadcast scheme for mobile wireless networks is proposed in this letter. The main objective is to combine different flooding schemes in order to solve the broadcast storm issue encountered by the simple flooding scheme. For this purpose, the density of nodes is taken into account using a density metric called expansion metric. In addition, in order to reduce the broken links due to mobility of nodes and increasing dissimilarity among the intermediate nodes, a forwarding zone criterion is included in the proposed schemes. The proposed approaches have been implemented and compared with pure probabilistic flooding, and simple flooding schemes.

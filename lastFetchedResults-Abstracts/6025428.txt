Location and sizing of photovoltaic plant from the aspect of independent power market participant are studied. Of the two methods developed, the first one is based on the DC network model and the second one relies on full AC model of the network. Genetic algorithm with the twofold objective function is used. The first goal is to locate the network node with the maximum available transfer capability (ATC) under the bilateral transactions regime and the second, to maximize the sizing of the plant in that node. The two standard test systems, the IEEE 5-buses system and the IEEE 30-buses system, show the applicability of the method in the paper.

OBJECTIVE: Measurment of lipids and lipoproteins is important in screening, prognosis and treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). The purpose of this study was to determine the level of lipids and lipoproteins in normal subjects, acute phase and also two weeks after incidence of MI in stable phase.
METHODS: This study was done on 130 normal subjects and 130 patients with MI. Triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, HDL -C, VLDL-C and LDL-C were measured in normal subjects and in acute and stable phases. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and frequency of risk factors such as smoking, familial hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and familial history of MI were surveyed. T-test and chi - square test were done to analyze the results and p<0.05 was statistically considered significant.
FINDINGS: Mean of total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C, VLDL-C in stable phase in comparison to acute phase decreased but there was not a significant difference. Whereas, they were higher in acute and stable phases in comparison to control group (p<0.0001). Also, the mean of HDL-C in stable phase was higher than acute phase with no significant difference and it was lower in stable and acute phases in comparison to control group (p<0.001). The frequency of risk factors except smoking in females is more than in males (p<O.05).
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that there is a decline in the plasma level of lipids and lipoproteins in stable phase. So, we suggest nutritional regimen and medication for patients with MI during and after hospitalization. Also, the role of sex should be considered in emergence of risk factors in stages of screening, prognosis and treatment.

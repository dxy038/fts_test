OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to compare the antioxidant effect of two different doses of zinc on lipid oxidation in type 2 diabetic patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted on 60 type 2 diabetic patients in Yazd Diabetes Research Center in 2008. The subjects were randomly allocated to receive Zinc sulfate (Iran, Alhavi) either 220 mg (containing 50 mg zinc) or 110 mg (containing 25 mg zinc) daily for two months. 
RESULTS: In the present study it was found that serum levels of zinc at the end of trial differed significantly after 50 mg/day zinc supplementation (P = 0.002), but this difference was not observed with dose of 25 mg/day zinc administration. There were no significant differences in the quantitative parameters of serum lipid oxidation after either of two doses of Zinc Sulfate (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study showed zinc supplementation with 50 mg daily for two months could increase serum level of zinc significantly, but we did not observed any change in susceptibility of serum lipid oxidation by 25 or 50 mg zinc supplementation in diabetic patients

This paper addresses the problem of controller design for constrained robots with the consideration of computational efficiency. An adaptive control algorithm, based on the reduced dynamics formulation, is presented for trajectory tracking of an end-effector on a constrained surface with specified constraint forces. It is shown that the control objective can be achieved without exact knowledge of robot dynamics and online calculation of nonlinear dynamic functions. The control algorithm is constructed with at most four control parameters to be adjusted adaptively, and that number is determined independently of the number of degrees of freedom of the robotic manipulators

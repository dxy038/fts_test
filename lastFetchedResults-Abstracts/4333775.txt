Huge amounts of data information were collected through the multi-objective regional geochemical survey of Ningxia Yinchuan Basin and high-density sampling with laboratory analysis. Statistical method was applied to achieve the total elemental geochemical background values of Yinchuan Basin and the elemental geochemical background values of different types of land use which supplies the useful information of basic geochemistry for regional economic development planning, and assessment for the resource and environment.

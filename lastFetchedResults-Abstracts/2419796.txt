Traditional methods of evaluating energy performance of building tend to focus on comparing the observed energy consumption with the average value of energy consumption by regression method or theoretical value calculated by simulation analysis. This paper attempted to evaluate and rank the energy performance of buildings from the perspective of multiple objective outputs. Specifically, considering the interactions between the weights of attributes of building energy performance, this paper adopts fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral, one of the multiple attribute decision-making approaches, to rank the evaluated buildings. The energy performance of 47 office buildings in Taiwan were evaluated and ranked to serve as a case study to illustrate the procedure and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

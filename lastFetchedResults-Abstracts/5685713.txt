In recent years, formal methods (FMs) have been extensively used for the verification and validation (V&amp;V) of dependable distributed protocols. In our studies utilizing FMs for V&amp;V, we have observed that a number of protocols providing for distributed and dependable services can often be formulated using a small set of basic functional primitives or their variations. Thus, from the formal viewpoint, the objective of this paper is to introduce techniques, utilizing concepts of category theory, that could effectively identify and reuse basic formal modules in order to simplify formal specification and verification for a spectrum of protocols

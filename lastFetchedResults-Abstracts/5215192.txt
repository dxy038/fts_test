This paper shows a three-phase feeding system to rural areas that are supplied by a single-phase feeder. This proposed system allows the use of three-phase agricultural equipments. The system proposed is formed by two bidirectional three-phase PWM converters, easily found to acquire at local market. The energy processed by single-phase transformer is maximized due the use of the power factor correction technique at the input converter. The output voltages are free of harmonics and allow non-balanced loads. The control strategy and design procedure are presents to both rectifier and inverter stages. Finally, will be present the experimental results of the proposed feeding system.

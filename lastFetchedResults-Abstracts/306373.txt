Objective: This article will review the adbancements and new developments being made in (1) adbanced computers, (2) microtechnology, (3) adbanced immunodiagnostics, (4) neural networks, and (5) molecular biology. The influence of these technologies and their products on clinical laboratories is also discussed.
Conclusion: Significant evolutionary and revolutionary technological changes are occurring in a number of scientific and engineering disciplines that impact the medical profession. As a consequence of this era of rapid change, the discipline of Clinical Laboratory Science is undergoing a “technological explosion” which is having a significant and profound effect on how clinical laboratories of today and tomorrow are and will be staffed, equipped, and operated.

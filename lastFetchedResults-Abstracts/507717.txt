OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of good glycemic control on serum lipids levels and lipid peroxidation, and to find out the relationship between the level of malondialdehyde and HbA1c in type 2 diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty type 2 diabetic patients aged 40-60 years with the history of diabetes for more than 10 years were studied. Glycemic control was stable for six months which included: having a healthy diet, doing adequate levels of daily exercise, using medicine for diabetes control, control and measuring blood glucose more often. HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, serum levels of lipids, lipoproteins and oxidation parameter (malondialdehyde level) are measured at the base line and after 6 months good glycemic control.
RESULTS: Good glycemic control decreased fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and malondialdehyde. However, the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased. There was no significant relationship between malondialdehyde and HbA1cin type 2 diabetes.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients, in addition to beneficial effects on lipid profiles, may contribute in lowering lipid peroxidation parameter (malondialdehyde).

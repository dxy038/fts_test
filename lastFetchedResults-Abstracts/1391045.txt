The objective of this paper is to determine both the fuzzy eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a finite element model defined with fuzzy parameters. The proposed method introduces the concepts of mode shape pairing and the functional dependence of eigensolutions with respect to design parameters. High-order approximations are then introduced to limit the computational cost associated with variability management. Numerical test cases are used to highlight the abilities of this method to predict behaviour modifications due to variations in the physical parameters.

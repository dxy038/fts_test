The performance between the watermark scheme using contourlet tranform and that using non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) is compared by a conventional watermark algorithm in this paper, which is rarely mentioned in existing literatures. The transparency analyses with subjective and objective evaluation indicators are performed on watermark scheme using contourlet tranform or NSCT. In addition, the corresponding robustness analyses to various attacks are also carried out. Through the contrast of the transparency and robustness, a conclusion can be drawn that NSCT is more suitable for watermark application than contourlet tranform.

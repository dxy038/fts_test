The main objective of this research is to investigate, based upon the measured outdoor channel characteristics, if an equalizer is required in the LMCS/LIMDS system receiver over a range of bit rates and if any, then of what type and complexity? Then the viability and complexity of applying maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) as an alternative to DFE is studied and the error bounds obtained by applying DFE and MLSE are compared

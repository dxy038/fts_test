Optimization of a 25 nm air bearing slider is performed. The objective of the optimization is to maintain the basic design goals of a flat fly height profile at a specified fly height and roll minimization while decreasing the sensitivity of the bearing to external loading. By decreasing the sensitivity of the slider fly height to an applied load variation, the slider´s stiffness in the vertical direction can be, conversely, increased. By increasing the slider´s vertical and pitch stiffness simultaneously, a decrease in dynamic fly height modulation is expected. It was found, however, that the modulation increased

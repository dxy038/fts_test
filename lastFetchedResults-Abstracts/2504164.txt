Background: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common musculoskeletal condition among athletes. The evidence emphasizes on the importance of hip musculature strengthening exercises for such patients. 
Objective: To investigate the effects of strengthening-stretching knee muscles exercises and hip posterolateral musculature exercises in athletes with PFPS. 
Methods: In this clinical trial, 28 athletes with age average of 22.7Â±2.4 years with PFPS were allocated into conventional knee muscles exercises (CKME) (n=14) and posterolateral hip muscles exercises (PHME) (n=14). The subjects of both groups performed the supervised exercise protocols in 12 sessions. The Visual Analogue Scale and 6-minute walking tests were administrated respectively to evaluate pain intensity and function. The data were analyzed using Shapiro-wilk test, Independent-sample t test, and Repeated Measure ANOVA test.
Findings: Demographic, pain intensity, and physical function data were similar between groups at baseline.  Both groups significantly improved in pain intensity and function following a 4-week exercise program. Additionally, the athletes in PHME group had higher level of decreased pain intensity and improved function in follow-up assessment than the subjects in CKME group.
Conclusion: Using hip posterolateral musculature exercises in addition to the knee conventional exercises is more effective for athletes with PFPS.

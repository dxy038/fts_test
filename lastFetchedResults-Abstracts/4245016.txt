The objective of the engineer responsible for selecting batteries for outdoor systems should be to minimize the cost of batteries over the life of the system. Due to the costs associated with battery replacement in decentralized outdoor sites, this objective is best achieved by selecting a battery which can deliver a long life. This is true even if there is a price premium for the longer life battery. There are several factors which impact the life of batteries in these applications. Extreme temperature, both high and low, is an extremely important factor which effects battery life and performance. The depth and frequency of discharge are also important factors. It is critical that the battery which is selected for an application must be able to survive in its working environment. Design engineers should ultimately make battery selection decisions based on testing. Testing should reflect the real life conditions which will exist in the application. An ideal choice in many outdoor applications is pure Pb/Sn technology. This technology provides long life and high performance in extreme temperatures. It is able to deliver long cycle life when required. Using this technology, engineers can greatly reduce maintenance costs and maximize system reliability

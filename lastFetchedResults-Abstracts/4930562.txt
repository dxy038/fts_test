In this paper, the finite-time robust stabilization problem is addressed in the presence of uncalibrated visual parameters for a class of dynamic feedback nonholonomic robots based on visual servoing with input saturation. The objective is to design a nonsmooth and bounded state feedback law such that the robots system is both Lyapunov stable and finite-time convergent within any given settling time. A new saturated switching controller is proposed directly based on the original system, which can effectively avoid the problem of singularity caused by using state or input transformation. Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control design approach.

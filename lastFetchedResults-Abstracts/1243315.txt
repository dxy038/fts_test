Introduction & Objective: Zinc is an essential element for the immune system. This element has different effects on immune system activity. On the other hand, different serum Zn levels also alter normal B-cell line and T-cell line functions. The present study was carried out to assess B cell line and T cell line tolerance to low concentration Zinc Chloride In vitro study. This experimental study was conducted at the Payame Noor University of Tehran in 2010. The B- cell line and T-cell line were exposed to 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100,125, 150,175 and 200 µm (?) of Zinc Chloride followed by incubation at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hrs. Viability of B- cell line (Raji) and T-cell line (molt-4) were evaluated with hemocytometer method and percentage of living cells have been considered as cellular tolerance index to cytotoxic effects of Zinc chloride. The results were analyzed by SPSS software, version 18 using T-test and Kruskal-Wallis test. In this study, the results showed Zinc chloride concentrations up to 40 µm (?) at different incubation time points (12-72 hrs) had no effects on B cell line and T cell line viability ( p >  0.05) With 50-200 µm (?) concentrations, Zinc at different incubation time points (12-72 hrs) tolerance B cell and T cell line decreased and viability decreased significantly when compared with the control group and test groups up to 40 µm (?) concentration ( p <  0.05). All groups at different after incubation time , Zinc concentrations (50-200 µm ) B cell and T cell line tolerance decreased significantly when compared with Zinc chloride concentrations up to 40 µm (?) ( p <  0.05). Zinc is necessary for the normal function of the immune system. A variety of in vitro effects of zinc on B cell line and T cell line depend on the zinc concentration. High dosages of zinc evoke negative effects on B cell line and T cell line. An excess of zinc can inhibit B- cell line and T-cell line function.

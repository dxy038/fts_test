A large majority of the communication on the tele-immersive environment does not include a real objective presentation. This paper introduces a method of reconstructing a real object to the communication on the tele-immersive environment by using toy blocks. As the similar but an opposite direction approach, our method consists of three stages: (1) 3D object reconstruction using a 3D modeling system with multi-viewpoint cameras; (2) block arrangement; and (3) block construction. In our knowledge, our proposal is the first approach to realize the virtual objects to the real. In this paper we describe our new realization method with using toy blocks and reveal the immanent difficulties to achieve virtual objects reconstruction in real world

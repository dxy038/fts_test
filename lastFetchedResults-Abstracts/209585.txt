Objective: To Compare Argyrophilic Nucleolar Organiser Regions (AgNORs) pattern with Proliferating nuclear antigen (PCNA) in different grades of transitional cell carcinoma. 
Design: Descriptive and Comparative study. 
Material and Methods: A total of fifty transurethrally resected bladder tumour samples (TUR BT) were collected from Mayo Hospital, Lahore and Services Hospital, Lahore and processed for H&E, AgNOR stain and PCNA stain. The grading of tumours were made on H&E stain. While AgNOR pattern and PCNA labeling index were recorded for each case. 
Results: A significant higher proportion of cases (p<0.02) with 3+ AgNOR dispersion were seen in grade III tumours. The AgNOR proliferative index in grade III tumour was significantly higher (p<0.05) as compared with grade II tumours. The cases with AgNOR dispersion of 3+ had significantly higher mean PCNA labeling index (p<0.02) when compared tumours of 2+ AgNOR dispersion. 
Conclusion: AgNOR and PCNA have significant role in grading of transitional cell carcinoma. The demon-stration of AgNOR dispersion is also a simple and cost effective procedure and could be considered as a substitute for PCNA labeling index.

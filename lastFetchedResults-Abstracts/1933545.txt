In this study, different combinations of 2-step, discontinuous gradient centrifugation were used, consisting of three different combinations of isotonic Percoll (45/60, 60/75 and 45/90%) that allowed us to select different sperm subpopulations from fertile and normozoospermic boars. Our objective in this study is to evaluate the effects of centrifugation through three different discontinuous Percoll gradients on sperm function parameters (motility, viability, morphology, acrosome status, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, ROS generation, tyrosine phosphorylation and intracellular calcium concentration) and the sperm penetrating capacity in an IVF system. All the Percoll treatments evaluated increased the percentage of spermatozoa with normal morphology, the proportion of un-damaged DNA, normal chromatin condensation, motion parameters measured by CASA and the percentage of capacitated spermatozoa with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins compared to control group. Finally, the in vitro oocyte penetrating capacity of boar spermatozoa was significantly affected by Percoll centrifugation. All the Percoll treatments increased the penetration rates and mean number of sperm per penetrated oocyte. Despite the efficiency of all three of the sperm treatments tested in selecting spermatozoa with improved sperm parameters and capacity to penetrate oocytes in vitro, the optimum performance of this system was demonstrated after preselecting spermatozoa by centrifugation on a discontinuous 45/90 Percoll gradient. The P45/90 treatment leads to obtain a higher percentage of spermatozoa which develop properly the capacitation process as it was shown measuring tyrosine phosphorylation and intracellular calcium concentration.

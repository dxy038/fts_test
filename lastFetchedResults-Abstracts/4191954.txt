Considering the imprecision of the real-world problems in the batch plant industry, fuzzy processing time and due-date window were introduced into the flow shop scheduling problems in this paper. The fuzzy flow shop scheduling model with multi-objective (to minimize the makespan and to minimize the penalties of the E/T) was set up based on the theory of fuzzy programming, in which the maximum membership functions of mean value (MMFMV) was applied to solve the non-linear fuzzy scheduling model in order to convert the fuzzy optimization problem to the general optimization problem. Finally, an improved simulated annealing (SA) algorithm was adopted to verify the model and satisfactory results are obtained.

This paper presents a coal blending management system incorporating a goal programming (GP) model. The main aim of this paper is to develop a goal programming (GP) model with an objective to provide a decision support system for coal stockyard managers. This model determines appropriate quantities of coal from different stockpiles for a consistent feeding of blended coal while meeting environmental and boiler performance requirements. Finally, the model is implemented as an operational decision making support system so that a novice operator will have no difficulty is using it. A real-world case is presented to illustrate the application of the model.

The objective of this paper is to establish which are the requirements of the component models in a distributed power system in order to satisfy the necessities of the system architect. Based on the information that will help the designer to make the right decision for its architecture and the selection of their components, different levels of modeling will be required for each simulation. The paper also shows the implication of the modeling approach on the requirements for the simulator and the description language.

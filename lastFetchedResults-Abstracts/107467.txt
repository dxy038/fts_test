A study on RC deep beams behavior is conducted in this paper by means of finite element analysis along with experimental evaluation of analytical simulation. The beams have shear span to depth ratio between 0.5 and 1.5 and effective depth from 400 mm to 1400 mm. Lateral reinforcement ratio varies by 0.0%, 0.4% and 0.8% in shear span. A fracture type analysis is employed to simulate RC members through smeared rotating crack approach. The results showed reliability of analysis in predicting deep beams behavior in terms of failure load, failure mode as well as crack propagation. The objective of this study is to investigate capabilities of the finite element simulation for further study on deep beam behavior instead of conducting expensive time consuming experimental works. This includes particularly members with possibilities of failing in shear as well as size effect by means of large-scale structures numerical simulation.

The spectral data of many plant pigments available in the literature are limited in their range and resolution. The objective of this project was to obtain improved spectral data that are representative of in vivo absorption characteristics for a selection of pigments relevant to leaf reflectance modeling. Absorption spectra of anthocyanins, betacyanins, betaxanthins, chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids were obtained between 300 and 800 nm at 1-nm intervals. These pigments were extracted from plant material and separated using column and thin layer chromatography. The two methods showed consistent results for all pigments except the chlorophylls which could not be fully separated using simple column chromatography. The anthocyanin and betacyanin spectra were very similar but anthocyanin displayed greater absorption in the UV range.

The main objective of this paper is to develop a monitoring system and to integrate it into existing power electronics equipment. In that way, they will have one smart meter in any point of the grid where a power electronics system exists, taking advantage of the sensor that these systems already have for implementing their operation strategies. The proposed algorithm is integrated in a previously developed Photovoltaic Array Emulator with the principal aim of monitoring important quality parameters that will be sent to a central repository (by using UDP protocol), where they will be available as pen data.

This paper outlines a strategic risk based approach to regulation based on the generic regulatory system developed with the participation of nine of AustraliaÂ´s premier regulatory organisations. The result is a generic strategic management paradigm of regulation and the various behavioural interactions that regulatory systems may utilise. It includes regulatory strategies that may be employed to influence how organisations and people behave, as well as other aspects of regulating, including regulatory metrics, regulatory types, and the mechanisms of regulation. The generic nature of the framework provides for its application in almost any context and to any objective. It also provides for a top-down strategic approach to risk management, an unfortunately all too rare occurrence.

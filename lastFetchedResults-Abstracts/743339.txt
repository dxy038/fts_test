Objective: Estrogen administration promotes angiogenesis and perfusion in oophorectomized rabbits with chronic limb ischemia. In the present study we tested whether gender affects angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in a rabbit model of chronic hind limb ischemia. Methods and results:  Ischemia was induced in one hind limb of five oophorectomized (Ooph), seven non-oophorectomized (NonOoph) female and eight male New Zealand White rabbits by excision of the femoral artery. Ten days after the induction of ischemia (day 0) and at days 15 and 30 systolic calf blood pressure was measured in the ischemic and non-ischemic hind limbs. Revascularization in the ischemic limb was expressed as ischemic/normal limb blood pressure, capillary/muscle fiber density, and non-capillary, non-lymphatic vessels/muscle fiber density after examination of light microscopic sections taken from the abductor muscle of the ischemic limb at the time of death (day 30). Ischemic/normal blood pressure at day 30 in males was 0.62±0.22, in NonOoph 0.64±0.09 (P=ns vs. males) and in Ooph 0.39±0.05 (P<0.05 vs. males and NonOoph), (F=4.69, P=0.02). Ischemic capillary/muscle fiber in males was 0.96±0.09, in NonOoph 0.95±0.06 (P=ns vs. males) and in Ooph 0.83±0.09 (P<0.05 vs. males and NonOoph), (F=5.93, P=0.01). Ischemic non-capillary, non-lymphatic vessels/muscle fiber density in males was 0.11±0.02, in NonOoph 0.12±0.03 (P=ns vs. males) and in Ooph 0.08±0.02 (P<0.05 vs. NonOoph), (F=5.05, P=0.02). Conclusion:  Gender does not influence angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in the rabbit model of chronic hind limb ischemia. However, estrogen deficiency induced by oophorectomy negatively affects angiogenesis and arteriogenesis.

In this paper, we consider resource allocation optimization problem in the fourth generation long-term evolution (4G-LTE) with elastic and inelastic real-time traffic. Mobile users are running either delay-tolerant or real-time applications. The users applications are approximated by logarithmic or sigmoidal-like utility functions. Our objective is to allocate resources according to the utility proportional fairness policy. Prior utility proportional fairness resource allocation algorithms fail to converge for high-traffic situations. We present a robust algorithm that solves the drawbacks in prior algorithms for the utility proportional fairness policy. Our robust optimal algorithm allocates the optimal rates for both high-traffic and low-traffic situations. It prevents fluctuation in the resource allocation process. In addition, we show that our algorithm provides traffic-dependent pricing for network providers. This pricing could be used to flatten the network traffic and decrease the cost per bandwidth for the users. Finally, numerical results are presented on the performance of the proposed algorithm.

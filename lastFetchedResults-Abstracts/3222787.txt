In this paper a novel bidirectional multiple port dc/dc transformer topology is presented. The novel concept for dc/dc transformer is based on the Series Resonant Converter (SRC) topology operated at its resonant frequency point. This allows for higher switching frequency to be adopted and enables high efficiency/high power density operation. The feasibility of the proposed concept is verified on a 300W, 700 kHz three port prototype with 390V input voltage and 48V and 12V output voltages. A peak overall efficiency of 93% is measured at full load. A very good load and cross regulation characteristic of the converter is observed in the whole load range, from full load to open circuit. The sensitivity analysis of the resonant capacitance is also performed showing very slight deterioration in the converter performances when a resonant capacitor is changed &#177;30% of its nominal value.

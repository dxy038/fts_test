This paper implements a smart loading monitoring and control system with ZigBee wireless network in the objective of developing the potential for demand response for numerous numbers of residential and commercial customers. This system can effectively solve the insufficiency problem of power supply while such problem happened in the electricity utility side, the system restrains the peak loading of Taipower system in time to prevent transformer from overloading, and decrease peak power generation simultaneously in order to achieve the goal of energy conservation and carbon reduction. ZigBee wireless smart loading monitoring and control system uses visualized program language to develop graphic control software, and the control module of this system which applied the perimeter interface controller (PIC) single chip microprocessor and embedded ZigBee wireless integrated circuit (IC). Meanwhile, through the application of infrared control technology and the deployment of temperature loading control module, the software and hardware were integrated into a set of home-using smart loading control system. The operating status of electrical appliances then can be monitored and controlled at any time. The integration of ZigBee smart loading control module and digital meter, in the other hand, can also monitor and control the electricity consumption of household appliances and manage standby power as well. It effectively reduces the power consumption of peak hours and saves the cost of power rate for residential users and commercial clients.

An overview of a generic restart procedure of a computer system - be it a personal computer, a server or a big parallel machine - is presented. The objective of this paper is to analyze the restart procedures and propose techniques to reduce the time taken to restart the system, hence providing higher availability and ultimately assurance. Experiments, data and evaluation are provided to support the achieved results.

Power systems for telecommunications are required to function at high level of reliability in harsh environmental conditions of vibrations, shocks and earthquakes. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the Operational Vibration Test as an alternative to the NEBS seismic test of power equipment at shelf level. The paper discusses the rationale for an alternative to NEBS seismic test, the theoretical background, and presents a case study of power equipment shelf and distribution. Finally, the paper shows that the alternative test is more cost effective than a full seismic test and could be used for power equipment design in a timely manner.

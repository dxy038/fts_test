BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The patients need to be relaxed in hospital so the unallowable sound intensity level can exacerbate the illness and may also have a negative impact on hospital staff. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent of noise pollution in the hospitals of Babol, Iran. 
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done in teaching hospitals of Babol, Iran in 2012. Sound pressure level (SPL) was measured based on 35 and 30 dBA as allowable threshold of sound in day and night by using a sound level meter, model Cirrus CR: 303 made in England. The samples were collected from three parts of each hospital: emergency room, operating room and intensive care unit during a day and holiday in the morning, evening and meeting times.
FINDINGS: The average sound level of different parts in the morning of a day and holiday was 64.88±7.303 and 61.71±6.435 dB respectively and at the meeting times of a day and holiday these averages were 62.17±9.447 and 62.51±5.095 dB respectively. Also, the averages were 60.57±9.697 and 59±8.842 dB in the evening of a day and holiday, respectively. There was a significant difference between the sound level in the morning and evening of ordinary and holiday days (p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in meeting times during these two days: ordinary and holiday days. 
CONCLUSION: On the basis of the results, it is recommended to consider the strategies to control and decrease the sound with informing and training the personnel to provide healthier work environment for them and to improve the quality of services in care centers.

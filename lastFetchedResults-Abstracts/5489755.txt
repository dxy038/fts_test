The main objective of this research is to use prediction markets as negotiation agents, for supporting R&amp;D portfolio management. To support this research, we iteratively designed, developed, operated and evaluated several prototypes. We start by presenting the weaknesses of the current techniques for managing R&amp;D portfolio. Then, we intend to demonstrate that prediction markets correct these weaknesses in R&amp;D portfolio management. Furthermore, following a design science paradigm, we illustrate the design of our artifacts using build-and-evaluate loops supported with a field study, which consisted in operating the prediction markets in different settings.

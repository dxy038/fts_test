For the MIT study of Con Edison´s energy system, a new methodology which uses regression analysis to relate selected data from the several special-purpose tools was developed and successfully applied. The use of a large simulation-optimization computer package was deemed to have significant disadvantages (for convenience, accuracy, time-expense, and overall command of the task). The new method relates these data to provide trade-off analyses and uncertainty analyses&#194;&#191;the key factors in today´s multi-objective, multi-parametered strategic planning.

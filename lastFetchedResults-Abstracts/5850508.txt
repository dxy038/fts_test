It has been known that non-blind watermarking scheme have been more robust than blind ones where both original and watermark signal has been required at extraction level. Generally, there have been two parameters to improve the robustness of watermark algorithm: watermark strength and maximum covered area for watermark embedding. The main objective of proposed 3-D mesh watermarking has been to insert the watermark of good strength in the less visible area of 3-D mesh and of low strength throughout the surface to minimize the perceivable visual distortion and to maximize the robustness of the algorithm. In this paper, we propose watermarking algorithm based on geometrical properties of 3-D polygon mesh. Curvature estimation on discretely samples surface like point clouds and polygon mesh shows stability, accuracy, and consistency even for non-uniform surface. Our objective has been process the object to find the less visible area of 3-D polygon mesh, which results good quality object after watermarking. To increase the robustness of the algorithm uniform distribution of the watermark has also been done. We has also been tested the proposed work against distortion and distortion less attacks.

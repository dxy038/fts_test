In small unit operations (SUO), people and equipment work together to meet some mission objective, have distinct roles and information needs, but are often distributed geographically. We describe the SUO Communicator, a combat situation awareness, information management, and communication system for use in small unit operations. The design is agent-based. Key ideas include email-based communication that is scalable and supports disconnected operation over tethered and wireless LANs and WANs; XML-based messaging, including init messages that provision a generic agent (egent) into a role-enabled egent; and an explicit representation for scenarios in terms of a bcc log of all messages sent that can also be used to drive simulations and for after-action analysis.

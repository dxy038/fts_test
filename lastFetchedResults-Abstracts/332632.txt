Objective
To investigate the influence of patient personality on satisfaction with and use of complete dentures.
Methods

Patients attending a dental school for replacement of existing complete dentures completed a Personality Questionnaire and quality of existing complete dentures was assessed. After the first post-insertion visit quality of new dentures was assessed. Patients’ satisfaction with the new dentures was elicited using a structured interview. Three months and 2 years after insertion of new dentures self completed denture satisfaction questionnaires were mailed to all participants.
Results

Three hundred and eight patients participated and 217 completed all stages of the study. Use of dentures was not associated with personality. In the old dentures patient rating of the three aspects of satisfaction with the mandibular denture, of appearance and general satisfaction were significantly associated with neuroticism. In the case of the new dentures at first review, no aspects of satisfaction rated by patients were significantly associated with personality. Significant negative associations between Neuroticism and all aspects of satisfaction with new dentures were found at 3 months. At 2 years after the dentures were placed significant negative associations between Neuroticism and all aspects of satisfaction with new dentures except rating of appearance and maxillary denture chewing ability were found.
Conclusions

Neurotic patients were significantly less satisfied with complete dentures. Personality traits did not influence patients’ use of dentures.

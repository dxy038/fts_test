Multi-objective optimization tools have been applied in various academic and industry fields. It is often difficult to optimize all the objectives since they often cause trade-offs. It is also difficult to figure what kinds of trade-offs actually cause. We think visualization of multi-objective optimization results assists users to intuitively understand the distributions of their solutions. This paper proposes a visualization of explanatory variable and objective function spaces in the separate views, so that users can easily understand their relevancy. Also, our tool features the linkage mechanism between the two views. When a user selects certain ranges of the values by a mouse click operation, the tool highlights all the corresponding individuals. This mechanism is useful for users to narrow down the results. We expect the tool assists the understanding of the behavior of the optimization processes and improvement of the future processes.

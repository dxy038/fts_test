Inroduction & Objective: Compensatory growth is a phase of rapid growth following feed restriction in such critical situations which it is observed in cold water and warm water fishes. Response to starvation and refeeding this includes eating more fish, feed efficiency and growth factors can be improved. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effect of starvation and compensatory growth on growth and survival of rainbow trout was conducted. 
Materials and Methods: This experiment was conducted for 8 weeks in four Groups and three replications: Group 1: 8 weeks full feeding, Group 2: One week starvation + a week feeding, Group 3: two weeks starvation + two weeks feeding, Group 4: three weeks starvation + three weeks of feeding. 240 fingerlings rainbow trout with an average initial weight 3.81 ± 0.46 g, and the average initial length of 5.4 ± 0.67 cm in 12 breeding tank with 20 fish per tank with a capacity of 50 liters completely randomized design and distribution of water for 8 weeks were maintained under the same conditions in terms of environmental conditions. 
Results: The results showed that there was a significant differences between groups in growth factors of rainbow trout fingerlings (P  < 0.05). As fingerlings grow fed diet with starvation and compensatory growth were compared with other groups. However, no significant difference in survival rates between groups.
Conclusion: Results showed a reduction in starvation and compensatory growth of rainbow trout fingerlings has not been able to offset the slowdown.

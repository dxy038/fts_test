This paper focuses on different High Impedance Surface (HIS) geometries, also known as artificial magnetic conductors (AMC), to compare their performances in terms of frequency bandwidth and size. The main objective is to maximize the HIS bandwidth to perform an antenna association. Most of well known HIS cells are introduced and compared to new cellsÂ´ geometries able to perform HIS properties in a wider frequency range. For each cell geometry, we have compared the HIS bandwidth (i.e. the frequency band where the reflexion coefficient phase is between -90&#176; and 90&#176;) and the cell size (with the aim of reduce their dimensions). This paper shows that cells geometries based on spirals allow to increase the HIS performances and bringing to light several optimization parameters increasing HIS bandwidth.

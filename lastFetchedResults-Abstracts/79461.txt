In this paper, the theoretical performance of cellular systems with A different types of link adaptation is analyzed. A general link and system performance analysis framework is developed to enable the systemlevel performance characteristics of the various link adaptation strategies to be studied and compared. More specifically, this framework is used to compare the downlink performance of fully loaded cellular systems with fixed power and modulation/coding, adaptive modulation/coding (AMC), adaptive power allocation (APA) with system-level AMC, and water-filling (WF). Performance is studied first for idealized methods, and then for cases where some practical constraints are imposed. Finally, a hybrid link adaptation scheme is introduced and studied. The hybrid scheme is shown to overcome most of the performance loss caused by the practical constraints. Moreover, the hybrid scheme, as opposed to WF, enables the system to be tuned to meet the most important performance objective for the system under consideration, such as coverage reliability, capacity, or data rate distribution. The algorithms and the framework presented in this paper can be used to improve the link adaptation performance of modern cellular systems such as HSDPA.

Objective To examine the contribution
of a mental and physical symptom count to the
detection of single or comorbid anxiety, depressive and
somatoform disorders. Method In primary care 1,046
consulting patients completed the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Physical
Symptom Checklist (PSC-51). In a stratified sample of
473 patients DSM-IV psychiatric disorders were assessed
using the WHO-SCAN interview. The diagnostic
value of the HADS total score and the PSC-51 symptom
count was examined with ROC-analyses. Results The
discriminative power of PSC-51 and HADS was highest
for patients with both a somatoform disorder and an
anxiety or depressive disorder, with an AUC of 0.86
(95% CI: 0.81–0.91) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87–0.94)
respectively. Using both symptom counts together did
not increase the diagnostic value for the detection of
the psychiatric disorders. Conclusion Both symptom
counts preferentially detected patients with comorbid
disorders. When interpreting diagnostic values of
screening questionnaires one should keep in mind that
the validity of these values can be dependent of the
presence of comorbid disorders

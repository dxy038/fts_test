The objective of this paper is to present the method of estimation of the acoustic noise emitted by permanent magnet synchronous motor. The presented method is based on multi-physical model: electromagnetic, mechanical and acoustic which is used to determine the electro-acoustic transmittance of the considered machine. This method enables to predict the acoustic noise of the electromagnetic origin on the basis of phase current spectrum. In this article the salient pole machine is taken into consideration.

A novel approach to nonlinear control of induction motors is developed. The proposed approach is used to design controllers for the rotor flux amplitude and the motor speed. The underlying design objective is to endow the closed loop system with high performance dynamics for high speed ranges while maximizing power efficiency and keeping the required stator voltage within the inverter ceiling limits. A comparative study between the performances of the proposed controller and field oriented control is carried out. The methods are compared in terms of their ability to handle loads on the motor shaft, their speed tracking capability and their sensitivity to operating condition variations. To estimate the rotor flux, an open loop observer is used.

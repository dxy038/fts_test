In this paper we propose a simple algorithm to enhance a speech signal with larger energy from a mixture of two sound sources. We used two microphones for acquisition of the sound signals and assume that either one of the speakers is closer of one of the microphones. In this algorithm, we use the concept of auditory filter banks with two psychoacoustic concepts: lateral inhibition and binaural masking. Preliminary computer simulations experiments confirm the validity of the proposed algorithm by objective and subjective measures

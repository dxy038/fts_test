Analysis method of product exergy cost has been presented for scheme-selection optimization of cooling and heating source system of air-conditioning system for buildings in this paper. And the product exergy cost is considered as the objective function by which to evaluate the air-conditioning cooling and heating sources system. Taking other related factors into consideration, the optimization algorithm for the air-conditioning cooling and heating source scheme-selection is brought forward. This optimization algorithm adopts an integrative, multiple objective decision method with the analysis of the product exergy cost. The algorithm essentially allows the air-conditioning cooling and heating source scheme-selection to be quantifiable. An example is presented to prove that the method is scientific and reliable.

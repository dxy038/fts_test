The evolution of the traffic in terms of volume and profile creates a need for multi-Terabit network elements providing the required flexibility to support a bit rate more and more variable than fix. In this paper, we describe an optical matrix that can be used in different network applications. After a description of an optical matrix capable to handle Terabit capacities, we will then describe two important applications. The first one is for the backbone, in the core a multi-Terabit class routers. The objective is to simplify the architecture and to provide better performance. Some extension will be given to project this view at a network scale, envisaging a new multiprotocol packet format. The second one is for the metro, for the HUB. This last concept is studied in the frame of the IST DAVID project. The required optical technology will be described highlighted with some key realizations and validation results. Finally, a conclusion will draw the perspectives for the next steps.

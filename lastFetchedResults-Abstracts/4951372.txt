The objective of this research is to develop a distributed knowledge model for knowledge management which is able to support collaborative knowledge management in the practice of allied concurrent engineering. The underlying approach to the development of this model includes: (1) modeling and characterization of allied concurrent engineering processes, (2) identification, analysis and modeling of knowledge involved in the allied concurrent engineering process, (3) development of a collaborative engineering knowledge management framework for allied concurrent engineering, and (4) development of a distributed knowledge model for collaborative knowledge management in allied concurrent engineering. The results of the research will enable the development of a collaborative engineering knowledge management system to support allied concurrent engineering, which will consequently increase the effectiveness of product and process development as well as enterprise competitiveness.

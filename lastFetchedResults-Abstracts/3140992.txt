Nowadays, many electrical systems are practically sensitive to short power disturbances and voltage sags. Since three decades ago, many research of superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) system have been doing to improve power quality of sensitive electric systems. The objective of this paper is to present the modeling and analysis of a SMES to protect a sensitive load in Azarbayjan distribution network from consecutive voltage sags. The topology of the SMES system and its response to two consecutive voltage sags are described. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

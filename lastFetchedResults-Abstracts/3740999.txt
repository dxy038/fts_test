Opportunistic scheduling algorithms are effective in exploiting channel variations and maximizing system throughput in multirate wireless networks. However, most scheduling algorithms ignore the per-user quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and try to allocate resources (for example, the time slots) among multiple users. This leads to a phenomenon commonly referred to as the <i>exposure problem</i>, wherein the algorithms fail to satisfy the minimum slot requirements of the users due to substitutability and complementarity requirements of user slots. To eliminate this exposure problem, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm based on two-phase combinatorial reverse auction, with the primary objective of maximizing the number of satisfied users in the system. We also consider maximizing the system throughput as a secondary objective. In the proposed scheme, multiple users bid for the required number of time slots and the allocations are done to satisfy the two objectives in a sequential manner. We provide an approximate solution to the proposed scheduling problem, which is NP-complete. The proposed algorithm has an approximation ratio of (1 + log <i>m</i>) with respect to the optimal solution, where m is the number of slots in a schedule cycle. Simulation results are provided to compare the proposed scheduling algorithm with other competitive schemes.

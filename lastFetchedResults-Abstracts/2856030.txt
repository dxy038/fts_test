Synthesis of dynamic output-feedback controllers is considered in a homogenous platoon operating under the leader and predecessor following scheme. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub>-type synthesis in which the goal is to keep the worst-case spacing error variations induced by the maneuvers of the leader as small as possible, while also avoiding excessively large control inputs. Concerns about possible communication problems are also reflected in the problem formulation. Sufficient solvability conditions are then derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities, which also depend on a scalar parameter over which a line search has to be performed. It is also described how the transient behavior of the platoon can be shaped by a simple additional condition. The procedure is illustrated by some sample designs and simulations in the longitudinal control of vehicle platoons.

A class on Technologies for Creative Learning was designed to investigate the answers to a well-researched question: &#8220;What learning mechanisms spark creativity?&#8221; The class was offered for the first time at Oklahoma Baptist University during the Winter 2013 semester, and was structured to introduce computer science concepts to an interdisciplinary group of students. A key enabler of most learning mechanisms today is technology, and this class explored the use of various platforms in the design and functionality of learning through technology, using computer science as the learning objective. This work addresses the implications of programming and robotics to foster creativity in computer science and discusses the outcomes of the class.

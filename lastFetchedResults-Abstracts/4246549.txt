The objective of this panel session is to describe how and when manufacturing simulation practitioners should add to the value of projects by interfacing simulation analyses with other analyses such as optimization, layout/material flow, scheduling, robotic, and queuing. The panelists will discuss how each analytical tool adds value to the discrete-event manufacturing simulation, when in the life cycle of a project it should be brought in, what are the main advantages and disadvantages of bringing in the additional tools, managing and selling collaborative analyses projects, and training requirements for collaborative analyses

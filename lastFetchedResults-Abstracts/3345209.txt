With the minimum amount of coal consumption, pollution emissions, the cost of power generation and carbon emissions, this paper analyzes the running status and the output status of the units and builds the multi-objective optimized model of low-carbon and energy-conservation generation dispatching in single phase. Then it takes this as the foundation to establish a dynamic multi-targeting optimized model of low-carbon power generation dispatching. This article lays a foundation for the study of the algorithm of the mixed programming of large-scale and multi-objective power generation dispatching.

Introduction
Preeclampsia involves a diffuse inflammatory state and elevated levels of troponins in patients with preeclampsia have been anecdotally reported. It is, however, unknown whether it is attributable to the preeclampsia.
Objective
We sought to determine the troponin I levels at the time of delivery in pregnant women with and without preeclampsia.
Methods
Plasma samples were obtained at the time of delivery and serum troponin I was measured by ELISA method.
Results
Thirty-nine women were included (20 with preeclampsia and 19 without). Mean troponin I level was 0.008 ng/mL in patients with preeclampsia and 0.01 ng/mL in controls (P =.59). The highest troponin I level was 0.04 ng/mL for both patients with and without preeclampsia.
Conclusions
Preeclampsia was not associated with a rise in troponin I levels in our study. Patients with preeclampsia and elevated troponin levels should have further cardiac investigations.

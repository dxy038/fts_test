Mobile ad hoc Network is a less infrastructure network, it can be working simply and flexibly in deployed at all circumstances on the other hand it has less wireless coverage and dynamically changes the connectivity. To admission the mobile host to Internet using Mobile IP and IP micro-mobility protocols and change points of accessory without broken the connection, With the integration of proactive routing protocol and IP protocol, extension of the MANET nodes can be achieved, to connecting for two different networks at that time any link break will be occur, unexpectedly to decrease the QoS performance. So in this paper an improved Quality of service used for modified DSDV protocol, named as QoS based DSDV (QBDSDV) protocol has been used to offer bidirectional connectivity between ad hoc nodes and the hosts in the Infrastructure-based networks. This work uses one of the ad hoc hosts known as Mobile Gateway to connect between the two different networks. The simulation result is an evaluation between the proposed approach using QoS based DSDV routing protocol, regular DSDV and AODV protocol, shows the final results is clearly point out the more performance achieved for QoS based DSDV than other protocols.

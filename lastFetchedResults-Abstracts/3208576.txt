The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the features of augmented reality (AR) and human memorization ability. The basis of this relation is derived from the following features. The AR feature is that AR can provide information associated with specific locations in the real world. The feature of human memory is that humans can easily memorize information if the information is visually associated with specific locations. To investigate this relation, we conduct a pilot user study in which blocks are picked from some drawers. As a result, significant differences are found between a situation in which visual information is displayed at the location of each drawer in the real world and that in which textual information is displayed at an unrelated location.

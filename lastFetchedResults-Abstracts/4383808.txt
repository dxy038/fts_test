It is expected that the use of cognitive radio for smart grid communication will be indispensable in near future. Recently, IETF has standardized RPL (routing protocol for low power and lossy networks), which is expected to be the standard routing protocol for majority of applications including advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks. Our objective in this paper is to enhance RPL for cognitive radio enabled AMI networks. Our enhanced protocol provides novel modifications to RPL in order to address the routing challenges in cognitive radio environments along with protecting the primary users as well as meeting the utility requirements of secondary network. System level performance evaluation shows the effectiveness of proposed protocol as a viable solution for practical cognitive AMI networks.

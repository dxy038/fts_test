EARTH is a major new European research project starting in 2010 with 15 partners from 10 countries. Its main technical objective is to achieve a reduction of the overall energy consumption of mobile broadband networks by 50%. In contrast to previous efforts, EARTH regards both network aspects and individual radio components from a holistic point of view. Considering that the signal strength strongly decreases with the distance to the base station, small cells are more energy efficient than large cells. EARTH will develop corresponding deployment strategies as well as management algorithms and protocols on the network level. On the component level, the project focuses on base station optimizations as power amplifiers consume the most energy in the system. A power efficient transceiver will be developed that adapts to changing traffic load for an energy efficient operation in mobile radio systems. With these results EARTH will reduce energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions and will thus enable a sustainable increase of mobile data rates.

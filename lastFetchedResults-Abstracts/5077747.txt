This contribution proposes an effective procedure for the acquisition of pseudo-noise code in satellite spread-spectrum localization systems. The main contribution of our work is twofold: first, we define a new objective function that is able to exploit the capabilities of different detectors in only one ambiguity function. Then, we introduce a compound detection procedure that, taking advantage of a fast interpolation of the optimum discrete samples, outperforms the conventional approaches. Wide simulation trials have been conducted to evidence that the devised methods are well suited for the incoming spread-spectrum satellite global localization systems.

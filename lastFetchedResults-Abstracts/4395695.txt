A new switching scheme for 3-phase interleaved bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed. The proposed scheme provides soft switching condition for all the switches in both charging and discharging modes regardless of the output power level. Analysis and simulation are carried out for 3kW bidirectional DC-DC converter to charge and discharge a battery of an electric vehicle. Simulation results show the usefulness of the proposed scheme.

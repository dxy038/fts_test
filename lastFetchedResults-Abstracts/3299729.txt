The main objective of developing an image-watermarking technique is to satisfy both imperceptibility and robustness requirements. To attain this objective, a hybrid image-watermarking scheme based on Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed in this paper. In order to improve the robustness and imperceptibleness of the watermarked image, a new embedding and extracting method with DWT-SVD is proposed. The LH Band of the third level of image in DWT domain is modified with SVD to embed the singular value of watermark to the singular value of DWT coefficient. The proposed embedding and extracting methodology was employed to accelerate the hybrid DWT-SVD watermarking and to avoid the leak of watermark. This hybrid technique results to optimize both (robustness and imperceptibility) the fundamentally conflicting requirements. The experimental result shows the good robustness under numerous attacks and the high fidelity. The time required to perform the program is greatly decreased.

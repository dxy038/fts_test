Aerial application of herbicides is a common tool in agricultural field management. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of glyphosate herbicide applied using aircraft fitted with both conventional and emerging aerial nozzle technologies. A weedy field was set up in a randomised complete block experimental design using three replicates. Four aerial spray technology treatments, electrostatic nozzles with charging off, electrostatic nozzles with charging on, conventional flat-fan hydraulic nozzles and rotary atomisers, were tested. To evaluate the glyphosate efficacy and performance of aerial spray technologies, spectral reflectance measurements were acquired using a ground-based sensing system for all treatment plots. Three measurements were taken at 1, 8, and 17 days after treatment (DAT). The statistical analyses indicated that glyphosate applied with different methods killed the weeds effectively compared to untreated areas at 17 DAT. Conventional flat-fan nozzles and rotary atomisers performed better than the electrostatic nozzles with charging off. There was no evidence to show that the electrostatic nozzle performed better with charging on or charging off. The results could provide applicators with guidance equipment configurations that can result in herbicide savings and optimised applications in other crops.

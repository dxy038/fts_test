This paper presents the selection process of the best suited topology for a bidirectional charger, intended to be economically implemented for a small electric vehicle with a 16 kWh battery package. The first stage is a State-of-the-Art revision, whose results are a reduced number of topologies pre-selected. Second stage is the evaluation through Multisim-NI Simulation of the pre-selected topologies; looking for the better relation: number of semiconductor devices, stresses to which semiconductor devices are subjected, number of control signals needed with its associated measurement devices, passive elements size and total losses.

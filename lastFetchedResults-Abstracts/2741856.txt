This paper proposes the modeling and control of contactless based Charging Station (CS) in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) scenario. Various charging points, also called multi-point is present in a CS. The CS is a place where Electric Vehicles (EVs) of particular area will come to charge as well as to participate for the grid support. A multi-point bidirectional contactless based CS with its control structure has been modeled in this work. The smart control algorithm is developed for the CS, which has the ability to decide the power flow between EVs and grid. The control algorithm modulates the charging/discharging rates of individual EV batteries by updating the power requirement and realizes a fast and synchronized response among multiple EVs. Each charging points is designed for a maximum peak power handling capacity of 50 kW. The performance of the CS with its control system is investigated with multiple EVs of different battery ratings connected under a single power distribution node of a grid. Simulation studies show that the CS could effectively perform controlled charging/discharging based on the grid condition and EVsÂ´ batteries constraints.

Classical root locus compensator design methods are streamlined with the objective of simplifying the computational procedures. The proposed methods place less emphasis on compensator synthesis and allow for more emphasis on compensator selection. The design procedures for four standard compensators are developed from a design procedure for the PD compensator. A numerical example is included

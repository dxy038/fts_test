There is a particular development path that Incorporated Engineers tend to follow. The majority will have started off as artisans/technicians and will have gained skills, knowledge and expertise over a period of time. They will have also generally taken the ONC/HNC route to qualifications which enables a balance between theory and practical to dictate the model for learning. The Incorporated Engineer has the ability and the confidence to succeed within a given sphere of responsibility. There is also the inherent ability to work successfully at the majority of intellectual levels. Consequently there is a need to firmly establish the role and status of the Incorporated Engineer and gain/enhance full recognition both nationally and internationally of our standing in the world of engineering. Creating an infrastructure which allows for prospective members to be identified early, and then recruited, needs to be a primary objective. Understanding NVQÂ´s and any other innovations in education and training is necessary to ensure that the membership net catches all those potential Incorporated Engineers. At the other end of the scale is the need to continue to promote and provide effective CPD until the loop is closed by new members having moved through a generation lifecycle of membership

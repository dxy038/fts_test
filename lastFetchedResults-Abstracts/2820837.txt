In this paper, the optimal operation of a battery bank in the presence of a Photovoltaic System (PV System) is approached. The battery bank charge and discharge must be controlled to reduce the consumed electrical energy cost. Different tariffs are considered according to the day hour. The optimization model was formulated and solved by mixed integer linear programming - MILP - with Big-M formulation. The problem context, assumed model hypothesis, objective function, constraints, and results are discussed. This work aims to contribute for the insertion of micro distributed generation into the Brazilian energy matrix.

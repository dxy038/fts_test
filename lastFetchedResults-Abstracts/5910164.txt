Presents a summary of research which has been conducted at Monash University-Gippsland Campus. The objective of this research project is to develop a new efficient methodology for mobile robot navigation. The new &#8220;optimistic&#8221; algorithm is based on free space attraction rather than looking for obstacles to avoid. It utilizes a single attractive force, generated by the surrounding local free-space, as opposed to the classical artificial potential field whereby attractive and repulsive forces are employed. Adaptive fuzzy logic is then utilized to limit the `free-spaceÂ´ force so as to promote the movement toward the goal. To demonstrate the algorithms ability, several simulations plus some preliminary experimental results are presented

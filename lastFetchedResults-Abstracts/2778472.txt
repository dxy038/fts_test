Dual active bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter is one of the most famous DC-DC converters for medium and high-power applications. This study presents an extended configuration of DAB DC-DC converter, which uses circuit elements with low power ratings. The main merits of the proposed configuration are its bidirectional power flow, fewer numbers of switches without imposing any limitation on the transferred power rating and zero voltage switching (ZVS) characteristics. The operation principle of the converter is presented, and ZVS analysis is described in detail. Furthermore, the steady-state and dynamic operation models of the proposed converter are derived. A comparison between the extended DAB converter and conventional modular DAB converter is performed to verify the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed topology. The design considerations of high-frequency transformers and required external inductors are presented. Finally, measurement and simulation results are presented to verify the operation principle of the proposed converter and its dynamic performance.

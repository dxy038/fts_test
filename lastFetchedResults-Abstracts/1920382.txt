This report presents the rationale and study design details of the SHock Inhibition Evaluation with Azimilide study, which is recruiting 624 patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) who are at risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, randomized to azimilide 75 mg, azimilide 125 mg, or placebo and followed for 1 year. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of azimilide versus placebo on the symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia burden using a unique statistical analysis based on the unusual temporal distribution of symptomatic ICD therapies. The primary efficacy end points are time to all-cause shocks and time to all-cause shocks plus symptomatic ventricular arrhythmic events triggering antitachycardia pacing measured from randomization.

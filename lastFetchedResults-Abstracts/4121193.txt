BEFORE HE RETIRED as president of Brown University, Dr. Henry M. Wriston defined the responsibilities of a dean. With his customary perception and humor, he said it was the job of the dean to make the college what the president says it already is. This suggests that our objective at this week-end conference of professors of electrical engineering is to make electrical engineering what the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) and EngineerÂ´s Council for Professional Development (ECPD) say it is currently. This topic is one which always generates many differing opinions anyway, but we were asked to choose our remarks purposely to raise problems and questions rather than produce answers.

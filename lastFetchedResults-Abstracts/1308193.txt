A series of 1,4,7-triazacyclononane derivatives of Fe(III) and Ru(II) have been investigated. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of changing the functionality of a pendant group in order to create different Ru(II) and Fe(III) environments. From these studies, some interesting features are elucidated and different stacking properties arise due to the intra- and intermolecular X–H⋯Cl (X=O, N) interactions for the Fe(III) and Ru(II) complexes.

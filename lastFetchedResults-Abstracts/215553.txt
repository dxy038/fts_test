Although tuberculosis involves every organ and has a wide
range of clinical manifestation, however involvement of the
thyroid gland is rare. We report a case of a 25-yr-old female
with supraclavicular lymphadenitis that developed nodular
swelling of the thyroid and had symptoms and sonographic
features mimicking a nodule with a cystic component. The
diagnosis was made by using fine needle aspiration (FNA),
We conclude that thyroid tuberculosis should be considered in
the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules and that FNA can
be the main diagnostic procedure.

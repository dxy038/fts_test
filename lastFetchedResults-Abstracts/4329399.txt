The introduction of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) and Electric Vehicles (EV) into the consumer market provides opportunities and challenges to implement Vehicle-2-Grid (V2G). V2G is a vehicle that can connect to the grid and consume power to charge its battery pack or supply power to the grid. This paper presents research on a novel converter that implements bidirectional power flow between the grid and a vehicles battery pack. The main advantages of this converter are the following: i) soft switching for all switches of the input converter independent of the load, Zero Current Switching (ZCS) ii) The switching of the input converter is simplified i.e four-step commutation is not required for the four quadrant switches of the input side converter iii) The average power flow through the converter is a linear function of the control variable so the control is simple iv) open loop input power factor correction, v) high power density, vi) isolation. The entire topology has been simulated with the proposed modulation method and simulation results confirm the analytical predictions.

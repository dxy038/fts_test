In this work is presented a design and implementation of an intelligent controller applied to dynamic systems. The main objective is to design a management intelligent system that acts in the controllers of Direct current machine (DC) and thermo-eletric control systems drives. The purpose is to evaluate the performance of algorithms for intelligent control that integrate DC and thermal actuators to manage several process. The designed controller are the classic PID and intelligent Neuro-fuzzy controllers, PID controllers performs the temperature and temperature regulation.

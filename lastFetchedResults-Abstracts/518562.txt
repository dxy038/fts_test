Regional disparities characterises Iran's development. The objective of this article is to comprise development indicators of four Azeris provinces in the Northwest of Iran (East Azerbaijan, West Azerbaijan, Ardebil and Zanjan) with those of four similar central-tendency provinces (Markazi, Esfahan, Fars and Kerman).

To do this, 25 indices into 12 groups were used for three selected years of 1995, 1999 and 2004. Indices were analyzed by numerical taxonomy technique.

The research found that:

-During the years of consideration, the level and rank of development of Azeris provinces were lower than that of the similar central-tendency provinces.

-During the period under study, dual coefficient decreased.

-The development rank of central-tendency provinces improved.

-There was a straight correlation between the level of development and population growth.

A tool for switch-box routing that can route regions with cyclic constraints and with terminals on three or four sides is presented. A divide-and-conquer algorithm is used to explore the greedy channel routing idea, using techniques such as routing area partitioning, dynamic routing strategies, and sweeping concurrent bidirectional columns. The routing area is decomposed into three parts by two special lines cut parallel, making routing easier. The algorithm completely routes BursteinÂ´s switch-box problem and with an extension also routes the Deutsch channel example in 19 tracks.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

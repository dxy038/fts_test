Objective:
This survey evaluates the necessity of biochemical and imaging findings
Il, for patients with initial diagnosis of febrile convulsion, and also aims
at determining the degree to which results of paraclinical examinations
delineate management of patients.
Materials & Methods:
Data of 302 patients referred to Mofid Children Hospital during two
years (2005-2006) for febrile convulsions (FC), were collected in formatted questionnaires and analyzed.
Results:
Abnormal lumbar punctures were reported in 9 patients, 3 of which had
bacterial meningitis (I%). Biochemical tests including sodium, potassium,
calcium, urea and glucose measurement, were performed for 289 (of 302 patients); of these 289,9 cases were reported with hyponatremia, one case with hypokalemia and one case with hypocalcemia. Brain CT was done in 51 cases and the results were abnormal in 4%, included a patient with status epilepticus.
Conclusion:
Considering the results obtained from data, we suggest that most of the
paraclinical examinations are not needed for Febrile Convulsions (FC), for simple Fe, in particular.

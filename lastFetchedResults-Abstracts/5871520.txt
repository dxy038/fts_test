This work reports a theoretical study of the dynamic behavior of a beta cinematic Stirling engine (BCSE) coupled with a synchronous permanent magnet linear alternator. The paper presents an analytical study of the BCSE. The objective is to evaluate the thermo-mechanical performances of the engine. The BCSE is designed to produce about 10 W (mechanical power). Helium is the working fluid. It results that the Stirling engine operates at a frequency of 20 Hz. Subsequently, a linear alternator is designed in order to produce electrical power of 5 W in this condition. The alternator is pre-designed by an analytical model and improved by using Finite Element simulations. This preliminary work is a first step of a systemic modeling in order to optimize a small generator set.

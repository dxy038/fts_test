The objective of vehicle driving simulator´s design is to provide a high-fidelity, immersive virtual environment, while maintaining a high degree of flexibility and reconfigurability. In this study, the vehicle driving simulator has been established, composed of the following components: vehicle dynamic model (motion controller), visual scene, scenario editor, driving cab, sound device, and hydraulic platform. With TCP/IP network communication protocol, the motion controller receives driver´s manipulation, road unevenness, and crash situation of visual scene, then generates motion streams that reflecting the current conditions, and sends them to visual scene and to the hydraulic platform. Furthermore, by detecting and analyzing general vehicles´ two-dimensional impact, a kind of applicable calculation method has been established, and complicated vehicle impacts can be analyzed accurately. This racing car driving simulator places a racing driver in an interactive and intelligent environment with high-fidelity motion, visual, auditory, and force feedback cues. It can also supports a variety of applications, ranging from traffic safety research to evaluation of racecar designs.

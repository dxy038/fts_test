Objective
Patients with superior canal dehiscence (SCD) typically have enhanced sound-evoked vestibular reflexes, such as vestibulo-collic and vestibulo-ocular reflexes. We wished to investigate whether sound-evoked lower limb EMG responses and postural sway are also enhanced in this condition.
Methods
Eight patients with CT confirmed SCD (11 affected ears) and 8 age-matched normal controls participated. Three sound-evoked responses were measured; vestibulo-collic reflexes (i.e. vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, VEMPs), lower limb vestibulo-spinal reflexes and body sway (centre of pressure in mm). Sound stimuli were 500 Hz air-conducted tone bursts of varying lengths (VEMPs: 2 ms; vestibulo-spinal: 20 ms; sway: 1 s and 200 ms) set at fixed levels above each subjectâ€™s VEMP threshold.
Results
SCD patients had very large VEMP and vestibulo-spinal responses following high intensity stimulation, but at the matched intensity of 15 dB above threshold amplitudes were similar in both SCD patients and controls. The amplitude of both responses increased linearly with increasing stimulus intensity in both groups. Large ( 20 mm), stereotyped sway responses were present in only one (atypical) patient with high intensity stimulation. Small ( 2 mm) sway responses were present in the remaining patients, and began immediately following the vestibulo-spinal responses.
Conclusions
Despite the presence of large vestibular reflexes, there is usually very little body sway in response to loud sounds in SCD patients.
Significance
Large short-latency vestibulo-spinal reflexes in SCD do not necessarily evoke large sway responses.

The interaction between fractalkine/CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 has been reported to play an important role in various human inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mediated by lymphocyte chemoattraction. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of fractalkine and CX3CR1 in lymphocyte migration in canine IBD. IBD was diagnosed in 34 dogs, and 19 healthy beagles were used as normal controls. We quantified intestinal mRNA and protein expression of fractalkine and CX3CR1 by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively, and examined the localization of fractalkine in canine intestine by immunohistochemistry. The expression of CX3CR1 and surface antigens on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) was analyzed by flow cytometry. Intestinal fractalkine and CX3CR1 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in IBD dogs compared with the healthy control dogs. In addition, fractalkine expression on intestinal epithelial cells was significantly increased in the intestinal mucosa of IBD dogs compared with the healthy dogs. CX3CR1+ PBMCs were significantly elevated in IBD dogs and positively correlated with the histopathological severity of IELs infiltration. These CX3CR1+ PBMCs predominantly expressed markers for cytotoxic T cells. Almost all IELs expressed CD3, and the majority of cells expressed CD8 rather than CD4, which was analogous to the CX3CR1+ PBMCs. These results suggest that the fractalkine-CX3CR1 interaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of canine IBD through migration of IELs.

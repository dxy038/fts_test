Studies quantifying winter annual cover crop effects on water quality are mostly limited to short-term studies at the plot scale. Long-term studies scaling-up water quality effects of cover crops to the watershed scale provide more integrated spatial responses from the landscape. The objective of this research was to quantify N loads from artificial subsurface drainage (tile drains) in a subbasin of the Walnut Creek, Iowa (Story county) watershed using the hybrid RZWQ-DSSAT model for a maize (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and maize–maize–soybean rotations in all phases with and without a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cover crop during a 25-year period from 1981 to 2005. Simulated cover crop dry matter (DM) and N uptake averaged 1854 and 36 kg ha−1 in the spring in the maize–soybean phase of the 2-year rotation and 1895 and 36 kg ha−1 in the soybean–maize phase during 1981–2005. In the 3-year rotation, cover crop DM and N uptake averaged 2047 and 44 kg ha−1 in the maize–maize–soybean phase, 2039 and 43 kg ha−1 in the soybean–maize–maize phase, and 1963 and 43 kg ha−1 in the maize–soybean–maize phase during the same period. Annual N loads to tile drains averaged 29 kg ha−1 in the maize–soybean phase and 25 kg ha−1 in the soybean–maize phase compared to 21 and 20 kg ha−1 in the same phases with a cover crop. In the 3-year rotation, annual N loads averaged 46, 43, and 45 kg ha−1 in each phase of the rotation without a cover crop and 37, 35, and 35 kg ha−1 with a cover crop. These results indicate using a winter annual cover crop can reduce annual N loads to tile drains 20–28% in the 2-year rotation and 19–22% in the 3-year rotation at the watershed subbasin scale over a 25-year period.

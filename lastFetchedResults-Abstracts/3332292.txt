NASA is developing a long-term strategy for achieving extended human missions to Mars in support of the policies outlined in the 2010 NASA Authorization Act and National Space Policy. The Authorization Act states that &#8220;A long term objective for human exploration of space should be the eventual international exploration of Mars.&#8221; Echoing this is the National Space Policy, which directs that NASA should, &#8220;By 2025, begin crewed missions beyond the moon, including sending humans to an asteroid. By the mid-2030s, send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth.&#8221; Further defining this goal, NASAÂ´s 2014 Strategic Plan identifies that &#8220;Our long-term goal is to send humans to Mars. Over the next two decades, we will develop and demonstrate the technologies and capabilities needed to send humans to explore the red planet and safely return them to Earth.&#8221; To accomplish these goals, NASA is employing a capability-driven approach to its human spaceflight strategy. This approach is based on developing a suite of evolving capabilities that provide specific functions to solve exploration challenges. These capabilities can be leveraged and reused, enabling more complex operations over time and exploration of more distant solar system destinations. The Evolvable Mars Campaign is an ongoing study identifying potential exploration options leading to sustainable human exploration of Mars. This campaign will leverage existing activities, adapt to capability developments, scientific discovery, and ever-changing programmatic environments. The results of this study will not produce &#8220;The Plan&#8221; for sending humans to Mars, but instead develop potential human Mars exploration strategies to inform NASA management on key decision options and investment priorities. This paper provides a summary of the 2014 study activities and key findings to date.

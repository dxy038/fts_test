The main objective of this paper is the modeling and analysis of inorganic homo-junction and inorganic-organic hybrid solar cells. For this, an independent model is developed that is capable of simulating the I-V characteristics of any homo-junction solar cell. The efficiency from the model is 14.897% at standard conditions and from PC1D, a commercial software the efficiency is 14.37% under the same conditions. Also hybrid series and hybrid parallel solar cells are modeled. The efficiency of the single inorganic cell is increased from 15% to 19.5% by the hybrid parallel connection.

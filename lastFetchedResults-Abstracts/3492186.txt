An objective classification of faults that can occur during impulse tests on power transformers is proposed. It includes nonlinear elements, breakdown, and partial discharge events. An analysis of a layer winding, in the time and frequency domains, with these faults shows that current assessment methods must be used with caution. A model reference approach is proposed to distinctly improve recognition in such cases. The method is immune to changes of wave shape and the instant of fault is available by observation.

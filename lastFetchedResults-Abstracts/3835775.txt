This paper describes an advanced microelectronic PCM multicoder. The objective of the system was to prove the feasibility of an all microelectronic multicoder. The problems solved include power dissipation, circuit design, circuit fabrication, and system packaging techniques. Monolithic integrated circuits designed especially for PCM are used throughout. Multicircuit packages are extensively employed. Other unique features include use of twosided multilayer boards and a three dimensional card-to-card interconnect scheme.

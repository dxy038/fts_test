Ideal Bessel beam is a non-diffracting beam and the most attractive property of such beam is non-diffracting propagation. In optics, although the comparisons of maximum propagation distance had been done between Bessel and Gaussian beams by Durnin and Sprangle, respectively, their comparison results are conflict result from their different criteria. It is necessary and significant that the comparison is carried out at microwave band. In this paper, we therefore propose a relatively objective and just comparison criterion at millimeter wavelength, and numerical simulation results and a new conclusion are presented.

Biomass availability and transportation are major challenges in establishing a large-scale biorefinery. The objective of this study was to assess the delivery cost of different combinations of multiple forms of lignocellulosic feedstocks including agricultural and woody biomass. Three types of biomass i.e., wheat straw, corn stover and forest biomass were considered in different forms such as loose biomass, bales/bundles, chopped/chipped and pellets. It was found that the delivery cost of a combination of woody and agricultural biomass feedstocks is lower than that for a single type of biomass. The delivery of agricultural residues as bales and woody biomass as chips is an economically attractive option with optimal combination of 30% bales and 70% wood chips to a biorefinery of capacity 5000 dry tonnes per day. The anticipated traffic congestions resulting from biomass supply to a large facility could be significantly reduced by increasing the density of biomass.

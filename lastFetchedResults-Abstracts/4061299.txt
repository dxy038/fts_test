Natural images contain considerable redundancy, some of which is successfully captured using recently developed directional wavelets. In this paper, an affine symmetric image model is considered. It provides a flexible scheme to exploit geometric redundancy. A patch of texture from an image is rotated, scaled and sheared to approximate other similar parts in the image, revealing the self-similarity relation. The general scheme is derived as follows. A texture model is required that identifies structural patterns. Then the affine symmetry is exploited between structural textures at a local level, the objective being to find the minimum residual error by estimating the affine transform relating two patches of texture. Having developed a local model, the methodology is extended to the whole image to estimate the global affine relation. This global model is further developed in a multiresolution framework for multiscale analysis, by which the self similarity of the image is exploited across space and scale. The multiresolution model can be applied to a series of practical problems. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in affine invariant texture segmentation and image approximation.

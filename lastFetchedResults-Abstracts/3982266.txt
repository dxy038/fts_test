A new technique for the power synthesis of reconfigurable conformal arrays with phase-only control in the full three-dimensional and vectorial case is presented. The synthesis problem is stated as an intersection finding problem and is solved by means of a generalised projection algorithm. Following previous results in reflector and conformal antenna array power synthesis, a particular choice of the functional space wherein the problem is stated is exploited to alleviate the problem of false solutions, i.e. the possibility for the iterative solution algorithm of being trapped by a local minimum of the objective functional. Numerical examples showing the effectiveness of the presented technique are discussed

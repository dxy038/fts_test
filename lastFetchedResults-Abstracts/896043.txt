Background: Antigen 85 complex of Mycobacterium tuberculosis includes three
immunogenic proteins which are TB vaccine candidates of great importance. As
they are very hard to be achieved in natural form, recombinant production of
them fuels immunological experiments. Production of such apolar
mycobacterial proteins located in the cell wall faces substantial challenges
mainly regarding their solubility. This study reports the production of soluble
recombinant Ag85B with an efficient yield.
Materials and Methods: Ag85B gene was cloned in pJET1.2 and subsequently
in pET32a (+). Both recombinant plasmids were sequenced. Expression of the
recombinant protein was induced with 1mM IPTG. Recombinant Ag85B was
purified through dissolving inclusions in 8M urea buffer, absorbing to Ni-NTA
resins, washing by buffers with decreasing urea concentrations and finally
eluted in imidazole. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-6His tag
antibody, rabbit anti- M. tuberculosis polyclonal antibody and serum of
hospitalized TB patients.
Results: Ag85B gene was successfully cloned in both plasmid vectors. The
recombinant Ag85B was expressed in E. coli host and purified with significant
yield.
Conclusion: Western blot results along with those of sequencing ensured
accurate production of recombinant Ag85B and retaining of its antigenic
structure.

Objective: Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are a class of posttranscriptional regulators that play
crucial roles in various biological processes. Emerging evidence suggests a direct link
between miRNAs and development of several diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D).
In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of predicted miRNA and target genes on
insulin resistance.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted on the C2C12 cell line.
Using bioinformatics tools miRNA-135 and two respective target genes-insulin receptor
(Insr) and vesicle associated membrane protein 2 (Vamp2)- were selected as potential
factors involved in insulin resistance process. Levels of glucose uptake miRNA expression
and respective gene targets were determined after cell transfaction by miR-135.
Results: It was determined that Insr gene expression was significantly down-regulated
in miR-135 transfected C2C12 cell line (P?0.05). Interestingly; these transfected cells
have shown a significant difference in glucose uptake incomparision the positive control
cells, while it was similar to the insulin resistant cell line (P?0.05). In contrast, no significant
alteration of Vamp2 gene expression was observed.
Conclusion: Our data indicated no change on the Vamp2 expression level after miRNA
transfection, while expression level of Insr was reduced and miR-135 expression
was contrarily increased leading to poor stimulation of glucose uptake through insulin,
and development of insulin resistance phenotype in C2C12 cell line.

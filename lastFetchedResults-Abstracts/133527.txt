The fertile valley of Lenjan is located about 20 Km southwest of Isfahan and at west side of Irankuh mountain which contains rich veins of lead and zinc. Various mining activities such as surface extraction, milling and transportation of concentrate have increased the potential for distribution of heavy minerals (Zn, Pb, Cd) in agricultural soils of Lenjan area.
Since in most of cases, the crops which grow in the agricultural soils containing heavy metals especially around mining areas can retain higher concentration of metals in their tissues, the main objective of this research is to evaluate the uptake concentration of zinc, lead and cadmium in agricultural products of rice, wheat, alfalfa and potato in Lenjan valley.
The obtained results on conducted samples indicate that, the highest concentrations of zinc in alfalfa, grains of rice and wheat and then potato gland were 154.4, 54.0, 53.0 and 9.7µg/g (dry weight) respectively, and the highest concentrations of lead in alfalfa and grains of rice and wheat were 9.75, 2.1 and 1.25µgIg (dry weight) respectively, and no cadmium was measured in these sample. Thus, since the concentrations of zinc and lead in alfalfa were relatively high, it seems that this plant has higher capability to uptake these metals from soils rich in these metalic minerals, but since the samples were limited in this area, further research for cropping alfalfa in soils of the area containing lead and zinc would be required.

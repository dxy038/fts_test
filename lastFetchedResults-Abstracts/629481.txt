The objective of present investigation was to measure radon progeny activity on hair and skin (forehead, paraumbilical, paravertebral) and its decrease after speleotherapeutic radon exposure in the gallery of the Gasteiner Heilstollen. Radon progeny activity was measured by means of a halogen-quenched Geiger-Mueller tube with a mica window (density 1.5–2.0 mg/cm2) and an effective diameter of 45 mm; beta efficiency 32% (210Bi), alpha efficiency 18% (241Am). Results are in counts per minute (cpm). All 17 patients were being treated for rheumatic disease in the galleries of the Gasteiner Heilstollen Hospital. The following activity (mean±standard error of the mean) was measured 25 (±5) min after leaving the treatment area: on hair of the head, 1235±141 cpm; forehead, 503±78 cpm; paraumbilical 460±85 cpm; paravertebral, 270±39 cpm. Taking a shower did not significantly reduce radon progeny activity. Speleotherapeutic radon exposure causes a considerable increase in radon progeny activity on skin. The large surface of hair causes much greater activity on hair than on skin. Owing to their high adhesive properties, radon progenies are not reduced by taking a shower.

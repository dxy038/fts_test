The problem of computing Pareto optimal solutions with distributed methods is considered in games with two decision makers (DMs).

Such procedures are especially relevant in real life situations where the DMs are unwilling or unable to disclose their goals. Problems of this kind include negotiations as well as hierarchical optimization of large-scale systems

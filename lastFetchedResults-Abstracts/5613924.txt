The optimization softwares, on linear programming and nonlinear programming, are making much more difference in social, economic and engineering fields. Most current optimization softwares usually either employ classic local optimization techniques or adopt some global optimization techniques. In this paper, an interactive optimization software with a specially designed evolutionary algorithm, named an interactive optimization platform, is introduced. The key procedure of the platform design is analyzed, and the scheme of the platform is proposed, and finally the platform is implemented. The features of the designed platform include: (1) dynamically adjusting the penalty factor related to the extended objective function at interface, (2) using only two specially designed interactive evolution operators, (3) having a particular mechanism of parallel computing, (4) and a going-back mechanism. With several tests, it was indicated that the implemented platform is easy to use, and can achieve precise solutions stably, having outstanding advantages, and so, the proposed scheme is satisfactory.

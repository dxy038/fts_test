Objective: Antioxidants are essential for sperm motility. Calligonum extract possesses the important antioxidants catechin and quercetin. This study investigates the effects of calligonum extract on sperm parameters and the rate of apoptosis in testes of aging male mice. 
Methods: We initially performed a dose response test with using three doses of calligonum (10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg). A total of 25 aging male mice (11-13 months) were divided into the following groups of five mice each: control, sham and three experimental groups. The experimental groups received IP injections of calligonum extract (10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg) weekly for up to five weeks. The sham group received IP injections of DMSO. At the end of the injection period, mice were sacrificed and sperm parameters analyzed. To determine apoptosis in testes, we performed TUNEL staining. 
Results: Our results showed that after calligonum treatment, there were improved sperm parameters in the 30 mg/kg-treated group compared to the other groups (P?0.05). 
Conclusion: Calligonum extract (30 mg/kg) can improve sperm parameters and decrease apoptosis in the testes of aging male mice. This herbal extract can be employed as an antioxidant component for clinical usage.

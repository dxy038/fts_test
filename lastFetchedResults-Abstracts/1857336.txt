SummaryContext
tandards, Options and Recommendations” (SOR), initiated in 1993, is a collaborative project between the Federation of the French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), the 20 French Cancer Centres and specialists from French Public Universities, General Hospitals and Private Clinics. The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and outcome for cancer patients. The methodology is based on literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary expert group, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery.

elop clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis, management and treatment of patients with renal cancer. This review is part of previously published complete guidelines and focuses on the place of radiotherapy in this disease.
s
ta was identified by literature search using Medline®(up to June 1999) and personal reference lists. The main endpoints considered were survival, risk factors for late effects of radiotherapy, safety and quality of life.
s
y recommendations are: 1) In localised renal cancer, adjuvant radiotherapy has a limited role: it is not indicated for T1 and T2 tumours and there is no proof of a survival benefit for T3 N1-N2 tumours. Postoperative radiotherapy can be considered in young patients without risk factors for the development of post-radiotherapy complications and without loco-regional invasion (renal capsule, renal pelvis, vena cava, regional lymph nodes); 2) For metastatic tumours, the multidisciplinary team must decide whether palliative radiotherapy is appropriate after consideration of the prognostic factors. An isolated metastasis can be treated by radiosurgery and stereotaxic radiosurgery may be of benefit in the case of one or two cerebral metastasis. The optimal dose for palliative treatment is not known. Radiotherapy followed by immunotherapy can also be considered if the patient has no contraindication to such treatments.

The objective of this research was to study the effect of different polarization (HH, VV, VH, and HV) on the radar energy reflectance or backscatter from variety of corner reflectors (e.g. buildings, fences, towers, etc.). Multipolarized and multiple incidence angle L-band (24.5 cm.) JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) aircraft L-band data and SIR-B HH-polarized multiple incidence angle data were used in this study. The results showed that the radar energy reflectance was strongly influenced by radar look direction in relation to objects orientation, type of polarization within the normal range of incidence angle. The corner reflectors were clearly seen and significantly reflect the radar energy on the like-polarized data, but not on the cross-polarized data and low incidence angle. Within the like-polarized data, HH-polarized data showed different pattern of reflectance comparing to the VV-polarized data. This paper discusses the reflectance in different polarizations and the apparent reasons for such radar energy

There has been done a considerable amount of research to develop IN concepts. The actual IN implementations, however, have been mainly targeted to fixed networks. There have been introduced plans how to implement IN in mobile networks but these models are essentially fixed network oriented and are targeted to model traditional call handling. This is a major problem since the GSM network differs from the traditional fixed network in two important aspects. Firstly, the GSM network and its call handling resembles ISDN and its call handling in many ways. Secondly many GSM procedures have no counterpart in fixed network. Take for instance automatic location updating, authentication and paging procedures which are not performed in fixed network call completion, and which correspondingly have not been included to fixed network IN call state models. The objective of the paper is to discuss how the current IN call model should be enhanced to better reflect the GSM call handling. In order to do this one must tackle the two aforementioned differences between the traditional fixed network and GSM network which can be seen as fundamental obstacles in applying IN to GSM successfully

The first objective of this paper is to establish the relationship between electric and magnetic coupling to metallic circuits. Then, conditions for which one or the other dominates are outlined. Following this, a discussion of why the longitudinal electric field (LEF) can be used to calculate magnetic coupling is given. The second objective of the paper is to summarize the differences between electric and magnetic coupling safety analysis. Specifically, the reasons why magnetic coupling effects are inherently more difficult to predict are discussed. Finally, the questions are outlined which must be answered so that safety assessment can be reconciled with the small number of complaints attributed to magnetic field coupling.

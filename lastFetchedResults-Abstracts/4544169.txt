This paper presents a Single-Phase Matrix Converter (SPMC), using 4-units of bidirectional, Power MOSFET-Power Diode as main power switching devices. The converter can directly convert the utility 1-phase sinusoidal supply voltage and frequency into a variable frequency and variable voltage of a variable PWM pattern by adjusting the frequency and modulation index of the PWM control signal that have the number of pulse of 5-pulses, 10-pulses and 20-pulses per cycle. Experimental results are presented in forms of the voltage and current waveforms analyzed in the various harmonic spectra for the different resistor and the resistor-inductor loads for various the PWM patterns, and in forms of the graph of the output rms voltages, the input-output rms currents, the input-output power factors and the input-output powers versus the number of pulses, frequencies and modulation indexes of the PWM pattern.

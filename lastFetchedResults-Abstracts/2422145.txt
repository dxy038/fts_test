In this paper, we study the finitely many constraints of the fuzzy
relation inequality problem and optimize the linear objective
function on the region defined by the fuzzy max-product operator.
Simplification operations have been given to accelerate the
resolution of the problem by removing the components having no
effect on the solution process. Also, an algorithm and some
numerical and applied examples are presented to abbreviate and
illustrate the steps of the problem resolution.

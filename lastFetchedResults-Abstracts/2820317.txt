In this paper, a joint resource optimization scheme is designed for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular wireless networks with multi-user cooperation. Joint relay selection, subcarrier allocation and pairing and power allocation algorithms are developed with the objective of maximizing the total capacity of the system considering the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the users. The optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is often very difficult to solve in its original form. We provide a novel optimization framework to solve such non-linear optimization problems. The joint relay selection and subcarrier allocation problem is modified to a linear assignment problem and an efficient algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal assignment solution based on the Hungarian method. We propose computationally efficient solution to the joint resource optimization problem via dual decomposition method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

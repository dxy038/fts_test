Evidence suggests that children with selective
mutism (SM) display significant aberrations in auditory
efferent activity at the brainstem level that may underlie
inefficient auditory processing during vocalization, and lead
to speech avoidance. The objective of the present study was
to explore auditory filtering processes at the cortical level in
children with SM. The classic paired-click paradigm was
utilized to assess suppression of the P50 event-related
potential to the second, of two sequentially-presented
clicks, in ten children with SM and 10 control children. A
significant suppression of P50 to the second click was
evident in the SM group, whereas no suppression effect was
observed in controls. Suppression was evident in 90% of
the SM group and in 40% of controls, whereas augmentation
was found in 10% and 60%, respectively, yielding a
significant association between group and suppression of
P50. P50 to the first click was comparable in childrenwith SM
and controls. The adult-like, mature P50 suppression effect
exhibited by children with SM may reflect a cortical
mechanism of compensatory inhibition of irrelevant repetitive
information that was not properly suppressed at lower levels
of their auditory system. The current data extends our previous
findings suggesting that differential auditor

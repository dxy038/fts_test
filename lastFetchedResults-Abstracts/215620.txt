Background and Objective: Viral hepatitis is the most frequent disease as a complication of hemodialysis treatment. Because of the importance of reducing the risk of infection, we decided to study the seroprevalence and possible predisposing factors of hepatitis B and C infections.
Materials and Methods: The prevalence of hepatitis B and C serologic markers and risk factors were assessed in 130 hemodialysis patients in two university-affiliated hospitals in Tehran. Sample population included 52 women and 78 men with the mean age of 52.9 years and the mean duration of hemodialysis of 4.83 years. Results: The seroprevalence of antibodies against the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were 8.5% and 4.6%. Out of all patients,55.4% and of vaccinated individuals, 71.3% had positive hepatitis B surface antigen antibody (HBsAb). There was also a significant correlation between anti-HCV positivity and the mean duration of hemodialysis (p=0.00). However, there was no relationship found between the history of transfusion and anti-HCV or HBsAg positivity (p = 0.98, p = 0.71). Among aminotransferases, aspartate transaminase (AST) level had only a relationship with positive HBsAg (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Correlation of duration of hemodialysis with the presence of antibodies against HCV strongly supports that the hemodialysis environment is as a source of transmission of this disease. High prevalence rate of HBsAg positivity in the hemodialysis units needs more restricted rules for immunization with HBV before beginning the hemodialysis program.

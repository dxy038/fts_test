Objective
How well do obstetrics and gynecology residents measure the endometrial stripe by transvaginal sonography?
Study design
Three obstetrics and gynecology residents at the University of Texas Medical Branch from each year level were tested for their ability to perform endometrial stripe measurements. Measurements of endometrial stripe thickness within 1 mm of the reference value that was obtained by an expert sonographer were deemed to be correct.
Results
Residents correctly measured the endometrial stripe in 14 of 24 cases (58%). Postgraduate yearâ€“4 residents correctly measured endometrial stripe thickness in 5 of 6 cases (83%); lower level residents were correct in 9 of 18 cases (50%). The most common error that was noted was an incorrect image plane in 25 of 47 attempts (53%). Fewer errors were committed by upper level as compared with lower level residents (P< .05).
Conclusion
By the end of residency, residents can accurately measure the endometrial stripe using transvaginal sonography. Emphasis should be placed on the improvement of the measurement skills.

The minimization of the production costs and the consumption of the electricity are major stakes in the company strategy led by the specialists of the energy sector. This paper describes the research works on the supervision of a hybrid power plant. This paper deal with conceiving and in overseeing a hybrid multi sources system with Distributed Generators associating an existing photovoltaic power plant with a power plant of small multi-cogeneration hatch in order to, first, mitigate the irregularity of the photovoltaic sources, and in a second time, to participate in the ancillary service during the daily points thanks to a management and an appropriate supervision. The main objective is the optimization of the cogeneration system fuel consumption. This work solves a Unit Commitment Problem which consists to define the organization of starting/extinction of every power plant as well as its production over all the period considered to satisfy constraints at a lower cost. These constraints, besides the satisfaction of the loadÂ´s demand, take into account the dynamics of every sub-system.

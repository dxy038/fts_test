The development of a computationally optimal Compressed Sensing recovery algorithm based on polynomial approximated L<sub>0</sub> minimization of the objective signal x and the error projection, is discussed in this paper. The proposed algorithm X-L0 E-L0 minimization (XEL0) using continuous function approximation for sparse signal recovery, minimizes the L<sub>0</sub> norm of signal x and L<sub>0</sub> norm of projected recovery error A<sup>&#8224;</sup>(y - Ax) using a set of polynomial functions, which approximate Gaussian curve, to improve the signal recovery performance and signal recovery time over the existing L<sub>0</sub> norm minimization based algorithms with L<sub>2</sub> recovery error constraints. The new algorithm for Compressed Sensing recovery reduces the computational complexity by computing L<sub>0</sub> norm with simple polynomial functions. This paper presents the theoretical frame work of the new algorithm, the experimental evaluation of convergence and robustness analysis along with the simulation results.

Background and Objective: Back pain is one of the most common and most costly occupational injuries . Due to the nature of nursing career, low- back pain is highly prevalent in nurses. The aim of this study was to survey the prevalence of low-back pain and its correlation with nursesâ€™ demographic characteristics and occupational factors in hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. 
Material and Methods: This descriptive- co relational study was conducted on 244 out of 260 nurses selected via stratified random sampling . Using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Functional Disability Questionnaire (ODQ), the Pain and functional disability variables were measured, respectively.  To analyze the data, we used independent t-test and correlation coefficient-(p < 0.05). 
Results: The findings showed that 55% of the nurses have different intensity of low back pain (LBP).  The LBP and monthly working hours (r=0.55), LBP and functional disability (r=0.53), LBP and age(r =0.30), and LBP and record of services (0.29) were significantly correlated, But it was not the case  for  LBP and gender. 
Conclusion: Based on the findings that about 55% of the nurses suffer from low- back pain,  it seems that  a comprehensive change in life style and physical activity pattern of the nurses are paramount importance.

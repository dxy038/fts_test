This paper proposes Genetic Algorithm (GA) for solving optimal multi-distributed generation (DG) location and capacity. The objective is to minimize the real power loss within security and operational constraints. Four types of DG are considered including distributed real power sources only, distributed reactive power sources only, distributed generation supplying real power and consume reactive power, distributed generation supplying real power and reactive power, representing photovoltaic, synchronous condenser, wind turbines, and hydro power, respectively. A detailed performance analysis is carried out on 33 bus system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

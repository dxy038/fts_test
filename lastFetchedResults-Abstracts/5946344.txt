The nature of reflectarray (RA) optimization problems is intrinsically multi-target and therefore the use of a multi-objective optimization scheme is particularly convenient, although it can be computationally expensive. In this paper some considerations on the characterization and optimization of a RA are presented. The results of the use of efficient approaches for the modeling of the planar RA or of its elementary components are introduced: all of them tend to improve the numerical efficiency of the optimization procedure, without losing in accuracy. Numerical results are provided for the optimization of a dual layer reflectarray antenna with innovative radiating elements, for use in the base station of the WISPERS Project (Wireless Infomobility System for ultra-light Platforms for Emergency Radio Services), which is based on an innovative Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV).

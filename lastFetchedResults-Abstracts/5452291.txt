This study uses twelve men´s seamless underwear as experimental samples. These samples are all in ordinary style and made from same material but different cylinder diameters, organization structures and knitting methods. The pressure and its sense of different positions in the underbody of seamless underwear are tested on medium-sized young men in the static and motion environment. The methods of objective and subjective evaluation, grey correlation and multiple linear regressions are used to analyze experiment values. The key positions affecting total pressure comfort of men´s seamless underwear are identified they are waist, hip and leg. In the meantime, correlative equations between comfort sense and key positions in different state are obtained. It is confirmed that correlative equations have good accuracy and manufacturers can use them before mass production as good guidance to predict whether the pressure of seamless underwear is in the comfort zone or not.

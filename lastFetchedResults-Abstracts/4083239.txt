The objective of a vehicle information and communication system (VICS) is to disperse traffic by providing drivers with road traffic information to enable them to satisfy their natural desire to &#8220;get there faster&#8221;. Put simply, VICS is based on drivers´ arbitrary selection of routes and on the automobile´s unique ability to take any desired route. The objective is to promote the safe, smooth flow of traffic by naturally distributing the flow of traffic, which is done by guiding cars to the appropriate routes in accordance with drivers´ instinctive desire to reach their destinations quickly by avoiding traffic congestion. VICS distributes road traffic information such as traffic jams or accidents to drivers in real time, and stimulates drivers for accurate and proper utilization

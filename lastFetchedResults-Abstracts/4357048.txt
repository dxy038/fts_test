The increasing complexity of systems and the interdisciplinary necessary to their realization push the organizations to be resorted in teams and thus they must cooperate, because it seems to constitute a means to improve the quality and the time of realizing the products. In this paper, we are interested to the validation phase in the process of requirements engineering in a cooperative context. The cooperation is not a recent practice because people cooperate since always. However, the cooperation, such as it reappears nowadays, is not simply a team work, it wants to be structured and organized in order to produce better results. To this purpose we propose a methodology which presents a collaborative approach of the requirements validation process based on the concepts of competences and multi-viewpoints. The objective of this methodology is twofold; first it increases the quality of the software product (i.e. it leads to better match usersÂ´ needs) and it reduces the complexity of the validation task.

This paper presents the results of analyses about transient stability enhancement using both devices-the fault current limiter and the thyristor controlled braking resistor. Following a major disturbance in power system, the fault current limiter operates for limiting of the fault current, enhancement of the transient stability and suppression of the turbine shaft torsional oscillation, and then the thyristor controlled braking resistor operates with the objective of fast control of generator disturbances. The effectiveness of both devices has been demonstrated by considering 3LG (three-phase-to-ground) fault at 12 fault points in a two-machine infinite bus system. The simulation results indicate a significant transient stability enhancement and damping shaft torsional oscillations.

This paper is about a hierarchical structure with an event-based supervisor in a higher level and a fractional-order proportional integral (FOPI) in a lower level applied to a wind turbine. The event-based supervisor analyzes the operation conditions to determine the state of the wind turbine. This controller operate in the full load region and the main objective is to capture maximum power generation while ensuring the performance and reliability required for a wind turbine to be integrated into an electric grid. The main contribution focus on the use of fractional-order proportional integral controller which benefits from the introduction of one more tuning parameter, the integral fractional-order, taking advantage over integer order proportional integral (PI) controller. Comparisons between fractional-order pitch control and a default proportional integral pitch controller applied to a wind turbine benchmark are given and simulation results by Matlab/Simulink are shown in order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Introduction and objective: A large number of microorganisms live on normal skin as commensals. When the skin is inflamed or otherwise abnormal, bacteria usually regarded as non-pathogenic on body surface may assume the role of opportunist pathogens. In this study we evaluated bacterial colonization on skin lesions of admitted patients in dermatology department in a teaching hospital. 
Materials and methods: Samples were collected from lesions and sent to medical microbiology laboratory for microbial study. Samples were cultured on suitable media and incubated at 37Â°C. All isolated bacteria were identified using microscopic and biochemical tests.
Results: Among 42 patients, who took part in the study, 24 were females and 18 were males. The most common microorganism found was Staphylococcus coagulase positive followed by was Staphylococcus coagulase positive (24) followed by Enterobacter species (5) and Pseudomonas aeroginosa (3). Four patients had infectious diseases. Other diagnosed diseases in the study groups were; pemphigus vulgaris, Stevenson Johonson syndrome, psoriasis, erythema multiforme, and erythroderma. 
Conclusion: The role of normal skin resident flora in diseased conditions has been goal of many studies. This study is important became it was for the first time which has been carried out in Ahvaz area with a huge sampling.

In this paper, the single-machine scheduling problem with convex multiresource
dependent processing times, subject to meeting job deadlines, is considered. The
objective is to minimize the total cost, including the resource allocation costs and the xed
costs. We assume that the actual processing time of each job (task) is a function of the
amount of resources allocated. Therefore, the decision variables of the model are: (1)
resources allocated to the jobs; (2) total consumed resources; (3) processing times of the
jobs; (4) start/completion times of the jobs. We reformulate and solve the problem using a
posy nomial geometric programming model. In the proposed exact solution method based
on the geometric programming, the original problem of any size is reduced to a two-variable
un constrainted optimization problem, which can be easily solved by a simple grid search.

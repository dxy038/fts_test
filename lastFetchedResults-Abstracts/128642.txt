Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an important skin parasitic disease. Ideal treatment is not found yet and seeking for proper drugs continues.
Objective: Comparison of the efficacy of fluconazole with systemic Glucantime in patients with acute cutaneous leishmanisis in Ghaem Hospital in Mashhad in 2002
Patients and Methods: During one year of study, all patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis were divided to two groups. Thirty-one patients were treated with oral fluconazole (100 mg twice a day) for 6 weeks
and 29 patients were treated with intramuscular Glue antime (20 mgSblkg) for 21 days. Both groups were evaluated 3 and 6 weeks after onset of treatment. 'T' test and chi-square test were used for statistical analyses and P<0.05 was considered as significant.
Results: Six weeks after begining of treatment , clinical cure, improvement and failure were observed in 4(12.9%) , 11 (35.5%) and 16(51.5%) of patients treated with fluconazole , respectively. These figures were 11(37.9%), 10(34.6%) and 8(21.5%) of patients treated with Glucantime, respectively (P>0.05).Conclusion: It seems that efficacy of fluconazole in acute cutaneous leishmaniasis is lower than Glucantime. A larger clinical trial is recommended.

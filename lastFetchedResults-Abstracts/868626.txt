The Buffer Allocation Problem (BAP) is a nonlinear, multi-objective one in integer variables and there exists no closed-form solution for the objective function. An efficient and effective search methodology is utilized to generate sub-optimal solutions to the problem for series, merge, and split topologies with M/M/C/K queueing stations. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of this search methodology.

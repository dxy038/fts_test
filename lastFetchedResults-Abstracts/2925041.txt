An electrical cable with its linear characteristic and its function as a link has always been a transmission factor of fire from a point to another one, even if it is rarely at the fire origin. The cable makersÂ´ objective, as it has been for more than twenty years, is to reduce fire hazard due to cables. The authors describe the steps that have been accomplished today which include: reduction of fire propagation; reduction of rate and/or volume of smoke emission; reduction of halogenous materials, to minimize corrosion and toxic hazards; and use of halogen free materials. These improvements have been identified as a need by cable customers in different market sectors

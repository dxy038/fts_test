Multistage Interconnection Networks (MIN) are used to connect processors and memories in large scale scalable multiprocessor systems. MINs have also been proposed as switching fabrics in ATM networks in the future Broadband ISDN networks. A MIN consists of several stages of small crossbar switching elements (SE). Buffers are used in the SEs to increase the throughput of the MIN and prevent internal loss of packets. Different buffering schemes for the SEs are discussed in this paper. The objective of this paper is to study the performance of MINs with different buffering schemes, in the presence of uniform and hot spot traffic patterns. The results obtained from the study will help the network designers in choosing appropriate buffering strategies for MINs. For comparing different buffering strategies, the throughput and packet delay have been used as the performance measures

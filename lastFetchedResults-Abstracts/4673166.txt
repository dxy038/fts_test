Combined Cold Heat and Power (CCHP) is of great advantage in energy cascade using, but the energy grade brings more difficulties for energy equal transformation. Considering the rising of energy transformation efficiency, and the coefficient is decreasing which power converts into coal, so the transformation of different energy will change with production status. So we set out to research the problem from the angle of pollutant emission based on heat equivalent (HE), and proposed the principle of equal emission (PEE) that can reflect the dynamic transformation between cold heat and power, and establish the dynamic transformation model of different energy. Thereafter, the model of multi-objective economic dispatch is formulated including generation cost and environmental cost of CCHP based on the PEE, and then we solve the problem with the fuzzy optimization programming. The results show that PEE is important in economic dispatch and reducing emission, the more important is that it can reflect the change of energy production more accurately; it also provides the reference for the promotion of environmental dispatch of CCHP.

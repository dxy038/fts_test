Background: Although the uterine fibroids are common, their influence on fertility
remains controversial. The association of submucosal fibroid with subfertility is well
recognized, but debate persists as to whether intramural fibroids can cause infertility
and the evidence for its effect on pregnancy in cycles of assisted conception remains
unclear.
Objective: The purpose of present study was to determine the effect of intramural
fibroids less than 6 cm not compressing uterine cavity on the outcome of ART cycles in
patients undergoing IVF/ICSI cycles.
Materials and Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 94 women with uterine
intramural fibroids and 184 controls referred to Royan Institute between 2001 and 2002
were enrolled. The intramural fibroids and their location were detected by transvaginal
ultrasound performed just before the ART cycle. All patients underwent long standard
GnRH agonist protocol. Student t-test and Chi-square test were used for the statistical
analysis.
Results: The mean age of patients was 33.9 ±3.37 years in myoma group (n=94) and
33.28 ±3.59 years in control group (n=184). The total dose of gonadotropin used,
estradiol level on day of hCG administration, the number of metaphase II oocytes
retrieved, fertilization rate, number and quality of embryos developed and transferred,
the clinical pregnancy and abortion rates were similar in two groups.
Conclusion: The presence of intramural fibroids less than 6 cm not compressing
endometrial cavity does not adversely affect clinical pregnancy rate in patients
undergoing IVF or ICSI.

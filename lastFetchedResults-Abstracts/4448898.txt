Owing to new legal requirements, essential changes in the field of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) management are expected. In WEEE management, several deciding factors must be considered to maximize benefits at a determined cost. Thus, the main objective of this study is to contribute to more effective WEEE management. Within this contribution, two models are proposed to help in the management of WEEE between Sorting Centres (SC) and Treatment and Recovery Centres (TRC), at minimum cost. A model for assigning the destination TRC for the WEEE of each SC, i.e., where 1 vehicle moves between 1 SC and 1 TRC. Another model is proposed with the aim of introducing joint WEEE management of 2 SCs to 1 TRC. The models are applied on a case study, with approximately one hundred of SCs and ten TRCs. Based on this case study, conclusions are drawn for WEEE decision managers.

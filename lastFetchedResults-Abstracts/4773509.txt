The control applications of AC/DC Boost converter have been widely investigated. The main objective of the paper is to find the most suitable control method to be implemented that is capable of improving the efficiency of the converter, reducing the effect of disturbances under line and load variation. The aim of this work is to study different control methods implemented in AC-DC boost converter namely (Hysteresis control, Fuzzy Logic Control). The nonlinear nature of diode rectifiers causes significant line current harmonic generation there by degrading power quality, increasing losses and causing failure of equipment. High switching frequency operation of static power converters is often required to reduce size, weight, and electromagnetic interference levels, at the cost of increased switching losses and reduced efficiency. To overcome this problem ac-dc boost converter is proposed. This project presents the use of fuzzy logic to derive a practical control scheme of boost rectifier for improvement of power quality. The methodology integrates fuzzy logic control technique in the feedback path which is used to control the duty cycle of the switch for shaping the input current waveform and it provides improvement of power factor, reduction of total harmonic distortion (THD) and reduction in sensitivity of output voltage to load changes.

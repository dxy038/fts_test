Modern human, after severance from prophecy and spirituality, tried to organize its affairs using reason as the only epistemic instrument and thus based a scientific method on it. So in economic realm, human was introduced as an individual separated from the society and relied on the rationality in which self-interesting and ideality optimizing was the only decisive factor in decision making. In a religious standpoint, however, rationality separated from the prophecy is not accepted and only in the framework of enriched prophetic thoughts and in mutual interactions in order to comprehend the prophecy, rationality can guide human into his supreme objectives of life. In this regard, “justice” is the objective of life, towards which human should move using “reason” instrument and in the bed of the “spirituality”. This article aims to introduce structural aspects of epistemology extracted from religious basis which determines behaviors of rational homo economicus and its behavioral constraints.

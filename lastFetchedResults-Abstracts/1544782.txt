A fuzzy logic-based model is used for generating an index which reflects the harmony of nasal proportions of a rhinoplasty patient. The index generated by the model is intended to be used as an objective tool for evaluating the harmony of nasal proportions of the patient. One of the possible uses of the index is to rate the nasal proportions of the patient relative to an ideal nose. Another possible use of the index is to generate a score for the patient before and after the rhinoplasty operation so that the improvement due to rhinoplasty operation can be determined objectively.

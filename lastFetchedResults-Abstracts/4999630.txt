A computer based curvilinear capsulorrhexis simulation system known as Virtual Phaco Trainer is presented. Interested residents and surgeons can use this system to navigate through the capsulorrhexis procedures and practice their skills. Performance data is presented after each practice with built in objective performance evaluation metrics. The system makes a number of important contributions A mass-spring model based anisotropic mesh is used to simulate a deformable capsule model along with a smooth curvilinear capsulorrhexis path. To navigate precisely, a phantom haptic device is used to track positions as well as to provide snag-free haptic feedback. Solutions to conflicting requirements between a high density mesh update frequency and a high haptic feedback update frequency are addressed. Promising evaluation results from a group of ophthalmology residents and attending surgeons are presented and discussed.

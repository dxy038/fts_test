In this paper, based on the mechanical property of structures, a unified approximate formula with high precision suitable to several structural response functions and various types of finite elements is introduced first and then an algorithm for solving the nonlinear program is presented. This algorithm is not only effective for solving the program constructed by this unified approximate formula, but also easy to change the objective function and to solve the structural optimization problem with dual or multiple objective functions.

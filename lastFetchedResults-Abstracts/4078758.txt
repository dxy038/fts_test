A remote node design for C + L band amplification is characterized and shown to cover the advanced optical power budget for a 55 km reach, 1:32 split hybrid Passive Optical Network (PON) with symmetrical full-duplex 10 Gb/s transmission. Different types of Erbium-doped fiber, designed for the C- and L-band are evaluated in a bidirectional amplification stage at the remote nodes of a ring + tree network, providing 5-10 dB of power margin for the reception of down- and upstream, despite degradation of the Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR). The evolution of signal power and the noise accumulation along the light path is discussed for both wavebands.

This paper proposes a new multi-rate H.264 scalable video multicast in lossy network using network coding. We first prioritize video layer based on its effect to the end-to-end video quality. Each video layer is routed via the path obtained from the optimization framework under the constraints on QoS guarantees. Different destinations may receive different number of video layers depended on their max flows. The bottleneck in the network is resolved by using network coding to ensure that all destinations can receive the rate equaling their max flows. The network coding is only applied within the same layer. Simulation and numerical results under randomly generated networks show the advantage of the proposed scheme in terms of objective and subject qualities of the end-to-end video.

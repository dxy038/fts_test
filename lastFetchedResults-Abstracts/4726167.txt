Transmission of compressed video over error-prone channels such as the Internet and the wireless networks may result in the errors or the packet losses at the decoder. In order to improve the objective and the subjective quality of decoded videos, error concealment (EC) at the decoder side is done to recover the damaged areas based on characteristics of the video signal. In this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm of error concealment considering scene changes, which detects whether the whole scene change or the local scene change occurs according to the coding characteristics of H.264 videos. In the implementations, we create a new sequence containing multiple scene changes to evaluate the proposed method. From the experiment results, we can see that the proposed algorithm provides a good performance.

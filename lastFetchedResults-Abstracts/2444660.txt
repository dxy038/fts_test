Inroduction & Objective: Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in the world Domain genetic changes in the development of colorectal cancer showed a large. Infection is a particular type of E. coli bacteria in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer can begin. Certain types of bacteria Escherichia coli siderophore production of toxins disrupt the cell cycle and begin the development of colorectal cancer, the aim of this study is the relationship between strains of E. coli siderophore and colorectal cancer patients 
Material and Methods: Biopsy of the large intestine The clinic includes 35 samples from colorectal cancer patients and 35 samples from healthy individuals and colorectal cancer were intestinal diseases. Smears of E. coli isolated from healthy tissue and cancer tissue, and DNA extraction by Duplex PCR technique for two genes, feoB and fyuA, as a marker genes siderophore was done. 
Results: The study of 70 patients with colorectal cancer and individual health clinic of intestinal biopsy was obtained and E. coli were isolated from cancerous tissue %59.3  gene feoB and %20 of healthy tissue and gene fyuA %14.8  in patients and %8 were observed in healthy individuals.
Conclusion: The results of the genetic study published in Iran similar to the results in many European countries show less.

The joint problem of manufacturing cell formation and its layout assignment is addressed in this paper, where
machine cells are to be located along the popular bi-directional linear layout. The objective is to minimize the
intercell 0ow cost under the cell size constraint, instead of the typical goal to minimize the number of intercell
movements. An enhanced simulated annealing approach augmented with dynamic programming algorithm is
developed, where the machine cells and their respective locations in the layout are simultaneously determined
by dynamic programming. Consequently, the optimal number of machine cells is obtained by the problem
structure, instead of a prior speci3cation in most of the literature. The enhanced procedure is illustrated by
an example and additional experiments, with data adapted from the literature, are performed to demonstrate
the viability of the approach.

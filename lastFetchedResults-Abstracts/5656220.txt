In this paper, the "multiple-access" problem in a packet network is considered, where the channel time is slotted and the number of transmitting sources is in general finite. In contrast to most existing studies on similar problems, source queues are allowed. The objective of our efforts is the design of multiple-access protocols which control the queue sizes as well as the per packet delays for all sources, where identical as well as nonidentical sources are considered. The present paper includes only a part of studies, which were pursued in a joint effort with Leonidas Georgiadis and Glenn D. Marcus. The interested reader can find more information on the above studies, in reference [6].

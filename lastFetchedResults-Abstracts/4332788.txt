With the advent of wearable computing and the resulting growth in mobile application market, we investigate mobile opportunistic cloud computing where mobile devices leverage nearby computational resources in order to save execution time and consumed energy. Our goal is to enable generic computation offloading to heterogeneous devices that include Cloud, mobile devices, and cloudlets. We propose a generic and flexible architecture that maximizes the computation gain with respect to various objective functions such as, minimizing the response time, reducing the overall energy consumption, and increasing the network lifetime. This novel architecture is designed to automate computation offloading to numerous compute resources over disrupted network connections.

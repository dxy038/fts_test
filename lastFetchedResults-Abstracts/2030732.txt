The objective of this study was to simplify the procedure for evaluation of legume nodulation, by examining if there is a relationship between the nodulation of the whole root system and at the crown region. Roots of peanut, soybean and common bean plants growing in soils were split in two parts (crown and bottom) and assessed for nodulation (nodule number and dry weight). In general, most nodules were concentrated at the crown, and crown nodulation was generally positively correlated with total nodulation of all three legume crops. The results are highly applicable in studies such as strain selection for inoculants and assessment of inoculation technologies, among others, and is an important contribution to help reduce the time and labor required for the evaluation of nodulation parameters.

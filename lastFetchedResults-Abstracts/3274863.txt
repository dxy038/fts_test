Recent advances in Multilingual Machine Translation and in Speech Processing, coupled with the unprecedented computing power increase of mobile devices, served by faster communication means, made possible the implementation of operational Speech to Speech (S2S) translation systems on smart phones and tablets. Through S2S, a text spoken in one language is automatically recognized, translated and synthesized in another language. This article presents an overview of the first version of our Android-based Romanian-English bi-directional speech translation system and covers the methods and technologies used for implementing it. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bidirectional S2S for Romanian-English implemented on mobile devices.

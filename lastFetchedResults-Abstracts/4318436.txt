Activities of the TRON Project in these past ten yeas have produced a hrge aniount of technical results which are published as papers, books, arid reports. Because such publications of TRON are scattered among diverse journals, proceedings, technical reports, etc., it is difficult for the new TRON researchers and developers to discover relevant documents. The primary objective of this bibliography is to eliminate this difficulty, and to improve the accessibility of technical information of the TRON Project. Its contents are restricted to publications on technical issues; nontechnical publications are out of its scope. At, present, the bibliography contains more than 500 entries. Entries in this bibliography are classified into eight sections by their interests: books on the TRON Projecs, Specifimtions, and technical papers on general issues, TRON Specification CHIP, ITRON, CTRON, BTRON, and MTRON/HFDS. In each section, entries are first sorted in the order of publishing year. Next, entries with the same publishing year are sorted in the alphabetical order of their authorsÂ´ names.

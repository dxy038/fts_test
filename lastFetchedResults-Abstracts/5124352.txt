Adhesion at a polymer metal interface is a complex phenomenon that is still not well understood. Several mechanisms for adhesion have been proposed including mechanical interlocking, chemical forces, and electrical forces. The objective of this investigation is to deepen our understanding of the adhesive strength of silver-filled, epoxy-based adhesives bonded to typical lead frame surfaces such as copper. Specifically, we are interested in the interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic energy dissipation mechanisms

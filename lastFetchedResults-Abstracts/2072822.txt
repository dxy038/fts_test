The objective of the present study was to analyze the nutritional composition of Bombyx mori (L.) chrysalis (worm) toast. The results have revealed that this sub-product of the silk thread industry is a rich source of protein (51.1%); lipid (34.4%); essential fatty acids such as the linolenic acid (C18: 3n-3, 24.4%); zinc (244 μg g−1) and potassium (4.77 mg g−1). The composition of this sub-product shows good polyunsaturated/saturated (0.99) and n-6/n-3 (0.30) fatty acids ratios. Chrysalis (worm) toast could balance human nutrition and could be used as an alternative dietary supplement of proteins and fatty acids, or could be used as animal feed.

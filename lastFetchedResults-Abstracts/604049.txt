Abstract
Nowadays, improving total factor productivity (TFP) has become a national priority for both developing and developed countries, since the higher TFP growth rate leads to the higher economic growth and improves standard of living. This paper aims to examine the impact of financial development on TFP using the data over the period 1961-2008. To achieve this objective, we document the stylized facts of the economy focusing on the financial system and then based on the literature review's findings and stylized facts of the economy, the empirical model are specified. Time series techniques are employed to estimate the alternative models. The results show that the financial development indicators have positive and significant effects on TFP in Iran. Moreover, capital intensity, trade openness and real exchange rate have positive and significant effect on TFP while the terms of trade has negative and significant effect on TFP.

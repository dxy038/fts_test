The information capacity of an optical disc is commonly increased by decreasing the diffraction unit lambda/NA of the optical read-out system (NA is the numerical aperture of the objective). We present a method to increase the information capacity at a specific lambda/NA-value by imparting orbital angular momentum to the read-out beam via specially structured optical effects

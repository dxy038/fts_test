The objective of this study is to develop a low cost and high data rate fiber-based BiDi transceiver module using optical subassembly (OSA) with an injection molded polymer optical bench (POB) for optical access network applications. The technique involves the use of a low cost POB to integrate all optical active and passive components. In the waveguide portion, it used a shortcut multi-mode fiber (SMMF) to increase the alignment tolerance to align a laser diode (LD) and a thin film filter (TFF) to separate duplex wavelength. Furthermore, in order to overcome the heat sink problems between the optical active components and the POB, the authors used the silicon submounts to achieve this. Results show that the temperature of the active components could down to around 47 &#176;C and the performance of transceiver module achieved the high data rate with an eye diagram opening at 1.25Gbps for a 2<sup>7</sup>-l PRBS.

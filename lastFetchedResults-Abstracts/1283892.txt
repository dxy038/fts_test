A series of 4-quinolylhydrazones were synthesized and tested against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Preparation of the title compounds was achieved by reaction of 4-quinolylhydrazine and aryl- or heteroaryl-carboxaldehyde. For the most of derivatives interesting antitubercular properties were showed; two compounds (32 and 325), identified as the most active, were tested also against Mycobacterium avium.

 Today, due to rising passenger expectations and other resource constraints, the airport managers and staff do to develop appropriate programs in order to optimize the allocation of the resources. Gates and counters are important resources in airport. In this research problem of gate and counter for arrival flights is considered simultaneously and mathematical model is prepared. The objectives of model includes minimizing passenger walking distance, minimizing the number of flights is allocated parking and alternate assign of gates (as a soft constraint). Zero- one Mathematical model with multi objective function (MODM) has been solved with precise method (GAMS software). Assigned similar flights to a terminal and balance in terminals are constraints of the model that there are low studies about it.

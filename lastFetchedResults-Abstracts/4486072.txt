Normally, statistical methods are used to generate rankings for genes in terms of their ability to distinguish between normal and malignant tumors from a gene expression dataset. However, different statistical methods yield different ranks for same gene and there is no universally accepted method for ranking. Therefore rank aggregation is required to find the overall ranking of the set of genes. There are various rank aggregation methods in the existing literature to integrate the rankings produced by various statistical tests. Moreover, the problem of integration of some partial rankings, containing unequal numbers of genes, is more challenging. In this article, a multiobjective genetic algorithm based rank aggregation method is proposed to integrate some partial rankings in an unbiased way. The first objective is to minimize the total distance from the reference ranking to the input rankings. For distance calculation, the Scaled Footrule Distance is used. The second objective is to minimize the standard deviation among those distances in order to avoid bias toward a particular input ranking. The proposed method is applied on some real-life microarray gene expression datasets, and the performance of it is compared with that of several existing rank aggregation techniques with respect to accuracy and the AUC (Area under ROC curve) value. Again, for real-life datasets, accuracy is plotted for visual comparison.

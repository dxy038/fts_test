This paper describes an approach to the optimal design of high efficiency permanent magnet reluctance motors (PRM) based on the Taguchi method coupled with finite element analysis (FEA) because of the requirements of the impending IE4 Super Premium Efficiency classification. The objectives of the optimal design are to increase the efficiency and to decrease an amount of the permanent magnet of the motor. We present multi-objective optimization design results in number of poles and frequency for PRM using Taguchi Method.

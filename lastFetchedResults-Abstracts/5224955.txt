In order to reduce the tremendous loss brought about by the overwhelming nature disasters on power supply system, the establishment of a certain amount of distributed generation systems at different level load nodes is taken into account in this paper. A multi-objective mathematical model considering construction investment, network loss as well as network deferred cost is proposed, and a type of improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm is adopted to solve the model. From the test case of a standard IEEE 33-node system, simulation results show that reasonable planning of size and site of distributed generation sources is capable of decreasing the loss caused by major accidents on power grid.

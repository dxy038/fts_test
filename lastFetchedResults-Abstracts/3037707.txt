IETF mobile Internet protocol version 6 and its fast handover protocol are proposals for handling routing of IPv6 packets to mobile nodes that have moved away from their home network. To do this, each time a mobile node moves to a new location, iit configures and confirms it temporal IP address. In this paper, we study the impact of the address configuration and confirmation procedure on the their IP handover latency. We first argue that the current strategies for them are unnecessarily slow, hampering the use of current proposals for real-time traffic. We present a new scheme which can be a substitute of the current strategies. The underlying objective of our scheme is to completely eliminate the latency taken by the address configuration and confirmation from the whole handover latency. Further, a mathematical analysis is developed to show the benefits of our scheme. In this analysis, various parameters are discussed to analyze the existing proposals, while our approach focuses on the reduction of handover latency.

Urban traffic is a non-linear, uncertain, dynamic, and complex system. The objective of traffic control is to realize wide range coordination control for urban road network. The theory and technology of multi-agent system are an effective way for distributed processing and control. In order to achieve coordination control of urban area traffic, this paper proposes a multi-agent coordination control mechanism. The system includes area control agent and intersection agent. The architecture and function of the agents are described in details. The communication standard of agents is defined to meet communication requirement of the heterogeneous agents. The multiple agents are coordinated in terms of the dynamic traffic volume density. Simulation results demonstrate our approach effective and practical.

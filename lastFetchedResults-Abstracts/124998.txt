Objective: This project was designed to study the effect of y-Interferon on NO release as an indicator of immune function involved in mice lung disease and resistance to opportunist infectious.
Materials and Methods: Mice were subjected to interperitoneal injection of different. concentrations of cyclophosphamide daily up to five days and left for 28 days. Mice were sacrificed and peritoneal cells were collected by interperitoneal injection of 5 ml cold P13S. The lavage was prepared by inject to and suction of 2m1 cold PBS. Alter 3 times washings. peritoneal and alveolar cells were counted and resuspended in RPMI medium. Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 in air for 2hs followed by three more washing to remove non-adherent cells. Macrophages were fed by 0.2 ml RPMI containing 10 miug/ml IsPS and 100U y-IFN. Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 2411. Supernatants were collected and nitrite was measured by Gricss method as an indicator of NO.
Results: The results showed that cyclophosphamide at low concentration (1.5mg/day) reduced NO release by macrophages compared with the control group (48%12,P<0.05). While alveolar macrophages showed no significant differences in term of nitric oxide release. Cyclophosphamide at high concentration (4.5mg/day) enhanced NO release by both peritoneal and alveolar macrophages by 70% and 56% respectively. treating the cells with combinations of I.PS and -y-ITN enhanced NO production by 200% and 240% by peritoneal and alveolar macrophages respectively.
Conciution: It seems that part of' immunosuppressive effect of cyclophosphamide might be due to reduction of NO release. Therefore, based on the positive effect of Gama-IFN on NO release in groups which received high dosage of cyclophosphamide. it is supposed to use immune respose stimulators in groups under cyclophosphamide treatment. may be warranted.

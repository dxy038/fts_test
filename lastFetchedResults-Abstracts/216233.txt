Group B Streptococcus (GBS)is a leading cause of serious
neonatal infections. Although great progress has been made in
preventing prenatal GBS, its colonization rate in different regions
of Iran remains unknown. The objective of this study
was to determine the colonization rate of GBS in pregnant
women in Hamadan city, Central west of Iran. A group of 544
pregnant women were randomly selected after 20 weeks gestation.
Vaginal specimens were examined by Gram staining and
culture methods and GBS was identified using bacteriologic
criteria, Of these cases, 145 (26.7%) were colonized by GBS,
A significant relationship was found between the career of
subjects and the related colonization rate. Parity, gestational
age, and the number of children were unrelated to GBS colonization,
The results are indicating that the relatively high
colonization rate of GBS in pregnant women living in Central
west of Iran, warrants a routine screening and prophylactic
treatment of the infected women

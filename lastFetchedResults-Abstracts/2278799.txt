The objective of this review was to address the basis for and prevention of selected diseases (fatty liver, ketosis, rumen acidosis and displaced abomasums) that are feeding- and management-related and frequent in periparturient cows. The focus has been to discuss (1) the general physiological regulation and adaptations that are believed to be important for a successful transition to lactation, (2) for each disease the disease incidence rate, risk factors, aetiology and pathophysiology and (3) feeding and management strategies to prevent diseases. Unfortunately, few studies have documented prevention strategies and they consequently need to be developed based on risk factors and knowledge of the aetiology of the diseases. Strategies to prevent these diseases are therefore based on major factors directly or indirectly increasing the risk of fatty liver, ketosis, acidosis and displaced abomasum—factors such as over-conditioning at calving, excessive mobilisation of body fat, low nutrient intake, nutrient or diet specific factors and management and environmental stress. Finally, thoughts are presented on how prevention potentially could be improved in the future. It is suggested that there should be greater focus on individual animals in order to identify “risk animals”. Status-oriented strategies for optimising dairy cow health, reproduction and production are suggested that aims at securing a desirable status of epithelia, metabolism and immune function in different cells, tissues or organs through surveillance and health and production management based on indicators.

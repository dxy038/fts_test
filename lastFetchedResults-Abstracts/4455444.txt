This paper illustrates the application of the feature selective validation (FSV) technique based on the IEEE 1597.1 standard for the validation of CEM computer modeling and simulations. The FSV method facilitates comparisons of sets of electromagnetic (EM) observable data for a given problem to determine a ldquolevel of agreementrdquo measure across any independent variable. This paper compares the results of CEM computer simulations for a cavity problem and a phantom pickup wire used to measure statistical field distributions at various sample points along the length of the wire. The objective of this exercise is to confirm the hypothesis that the field distributions will not vary too significantly along the short wire length. Several different CEM techniques were used, namely finite difference frequency domain (FDTD), multi-level fast multipole (MLFM), and the moment method (MoM). This paper focuses on the results of the FDTD simulations. Future comparisons will be made between the full complement of predictions and a reverberation chamber baseline measurement to establish a level of goodness metric to validate results and demonstrate the efficacy of the FSV approach.

Dispersed generation (DG) is playing an increasing role in the electric power system. In order to investigate the influences of DG-units on the performance of the electricity grid, performance-indicators and their classification are useful to be defined. These classifications enable an objective evaluation of the current situation in the grid and the influences of dispersed generation. This paper gives a survey of the most important performance-indicators, presents classifications for reliability and voltage sags and gives an overview of the influence of dispersed generation on these two aspects.

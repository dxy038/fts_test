Sustainable development is increasingly becoming the main objective to organisations. Companies within Chinese manufacturing industries are eager to adopt sustainable strategy through lean, green, and socially responsible practices. This research was carried out to study the effectiveness of various practices that improve the sustainability performance and embraces economic, environmental, and social dimensions. An explanatory case study was conducted in two local Chinese auto-parts companies. Based on literature review and the case study, a framework combining sustainability practices and measures was proposed. Finally, unpopular practices that are effective were identified as significant practice and recommended for business operations.

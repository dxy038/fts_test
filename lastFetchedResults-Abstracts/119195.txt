A single objective genetic algorithm is applied to a single objective formulation of a harvest scheduling problem with integer decision variables for the management alternatives for each stand of an experimental forest. This Model I harvest scheduling system attempts to simultaneously maximise the present value and minimise deviations between successive cutting periods. Next, a multiple objective genetic algorithm is applied to the same forest management problem, without any need of reformulation into a single objective problem. Moreover, it is possible to obtain a trade-off front between the two objectives in just one simulation run. The results of the single objective approach are compared to those of the multiple objective approach.

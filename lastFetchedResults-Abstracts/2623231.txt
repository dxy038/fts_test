In this paper, we investigate a linear programming problem. Our interest is focused on
the case where the coecients of objective function, the coecients matrix and the right
hand side vector are either compact convex sets or, in particular, convex polytopes. We
are interested primarily in the systems of inequalities; later on we also deal with systems of
equations. A new concept of strict feasibility and the dual case of this kind of problems is
also introduced and investigated. As convexity, compactness and regularity of the coecients
matrix is not sucient for strong duality; the main result of this paper deals with nding a
necessary and sucient conditions for strong duality.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the effect of smoking during pregnancy on neonatal hemostasis.
STUDY DESIGN: Venous blood samples of 26 newborns of smoking and 25 newborns of nonsmoking mothers were obtained from the clamped umbilical cord immediately after birth. Prothrombin fragment 1+2, thrombin–antithrombin III complex, plasmin–α2-antiplasmin complex, and d-dimer levels were determined to assess activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Cotinine was measured in all neonates to objectify cigarette smoke exposure. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the differences between the values of the parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis in the two groups at the p< 0.05 level.
RESULTS: The median values of prothrombin fragment 1+2 and thrombin–antithrombin III complex in newborns exposed to tobacco smoke in utero did not differ from values of newborns who were not exposed. Nor were the markers of fibrinolysis, plasmin–α2-antiplasmin complex and d-dimer levels, influenced by tobacco smoke exposure.
CONCLUSION: The balance between the components of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways in neonates is not disturbed by maternal smoking.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:662-6

The present study is undertaken with the objective of clarifying formability characteristics of welded thin sheet steels, such as Interstitial Free Steels (IFS) and Ferritic Stainless Steels (FSS) based on the LASER, TIG and resistance spot welding (RSW). The characterisation of basic parameters influencing formability of homogeneous; base metal (BMs) and welded parts (WPs) has been carried out by hardness, Erichsen and impact tensile tests (ITT). Relationships between the materials and mechanical parameters derived from these tests are also discussed in this paper.

Acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry have been used to assess nasal airway patency objectively. We compared nasal obstruction symptoms before and after decongestion with several parameters of these objective tests. The patients assessed their nasal obstruction using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Cross-sectional areas and nasal resistance were measured by acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry before and after topical application of 1% phenylephrine solution in 32 patients with nasal obstruction symptoms. There was no significant correlation between the difference in the VAS and the difference in nasal resistance. There was also no significant correlation between the difference in the VAS and minimal cross-sectional area and cross-sectional areas at 3.3 cm (CA3.3), CA4.0 and CA6.4 from the nosepiece both in the wide and narrow sides and in both nasal cavities before and after nasal decongestion. It is concluded that rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry may have no diagnostic value in estimating the severity of nasal obstruction symptoms.

The harmonic distortion of voltage has became an important subject in power quality, especially after use of power electronic equipment and nonlinear loads. Simple method to limitation of harmonic distortion is using of passive filters. The objective of this paper is to determine the location and size of passive filters in distribution networks economically, by using genetic algorithm. With using of genetic algorithm and new coding here some of other methods limits for passive filters locations are removed. The purpose of the genetic algorithm is to minimize the cost of passive filters and, at the same time, to reach the harmonic limitations defined by standard IEEE-519. This algorithm is applied to IEEE 13-bus distribution network and the results are shown, finally.

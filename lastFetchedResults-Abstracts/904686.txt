The objective was to estimate the seasonal and inter-tidal variability of dissolved and particulate mercury fluxes between the Ria de Aveiro
(Portugal) and the Atlantic Ocean. The mercury fluxes were estimated by means of a two-dimensional vertically integrated hydrodynamic
model. Results showed that the particulate fraction plays an important role in the transport of mercury while the contribution of the seston fraction
to the transport of mercury was always <0.5%. During spring tides, in summer, about 2% of mercury transported in seston was present in an
organic form. The mass balance for the mercury fractions revealed that the mercury export to the Atlantic Ocean varied with season and tidal
regime, mainly in terms of the relative importance of the dissolved and particulate fractions. An approximate range of values for the annual mass
balance between 42 and 77 kg shows that the export of dissolved and particulate mercury makes little impact on the near shore region of the
Atlantic Ocean and that the recovery of the lagoon from mercury contamination is likely to remain a long-term issue.

Transitioning from college to industry can be challenging task if students are not exposed to the right content while in college. In this paper we present an Open Source based approach to Software Engineering where students get the opportunity to work on live Open Source projects thereby gaining practical exposure to various Software Engineering principles. The objective of this approach is to enhance the Industry Preparedness of students and addressing the challenges they may face as professionals. This approach is based on the result of our study of Software Engineers who have newly joined the industry. The study involved understanding the Software Engineering (SE) course content they were exposed to as students, whether the SE related course(s) were able to meet the outcomes laid by Software Engineering Education Knowledge, whether the course adequately prepared them to take on various industry responsibilities and the challenges they faced in the transition.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary supplements with lead acetate and aluminosilicates (ATN) on  antioxidative enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation of the heart and skeletal muscle tissues of broiler chickens. Broilers were allotted to four diets including the control group, the Pb group, the aluminosilicate-ATN (antitoxic nutrient) group and the Pb+ATN group, in a 3-week feeding experiment. Dietary intake of lead acetate induces oxidative stress and promotes lipid peroxidation in the heart muscle tissue. The combined data showed that chickens fed with ATN received significant protection against the effects of lead acetate for most of the measured parameters.

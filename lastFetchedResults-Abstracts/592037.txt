Background: Oral contraceptive therapy (OCT) is associated with
an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, venous thromboembolism
and stroke. However, the underlying mechanisms have not yet
been elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the
influence of OCT on blood levels of an oxidative stress maker in
pre?menopausal women.
Methods: Oxidative stress was determined in 87 pre?menopausal
healthy women (24 with and 63 without OCT) using a blood assay
for reactive oxygen metabolites (by the d?ROMs test). The subjects
with OCT received a triphasic preparation consisting of ethinyl
estradiol and norethisterone.
Results: Subjects with OCT showed significantly higher d?ROMs
levels (median: 380; interquartile range: 328?502 Carr U) than those
without OCT (325 [271?369]; P  <  0.05). The results remained the
same after adjusting for potential confounders.
Conclusions: The use of OCT may increase oxidative stress
levels, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, in
pre?menopausal women, providing new insights to the primary
prevention of vascular complications in these subjects.

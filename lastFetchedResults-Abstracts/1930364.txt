The objective of this study was to examine a possible difference in progesterone concentrations between the systemic venous blood and the caudal vena cava in early pregnant gilts. Nineteen crossbred pregnant gilts were offered three different regimens of feeding to examine influence of feeding on the secretion pattern of progesterone. The groups were high (H–H), low (L–L) and low–high (L–H) receiving 3.6, 1.8 and 1.8/3.6 kg/day, respectively. Catheters were placed in a jugular vein and the caudal vena cava (to sample ovarian secretion) on day 19 of pregnancy. Two consecutive samples taken at 30-min intervals were collected four times a day for 5 days (days 20–24). In addition, three gilts were simultaneously sampled from both catheters at 30-min intervals for 12 h on day 22. Progesterone concentration was significantly lower in the jugular vein compared with the caudal vena cava in all three feeding groups (P &lt; 0.001). An indication of episodic pattern of progesterone production occurred in plasma collected from the caudal vena cava, but not from the jugular vein. Dietary intake did not cause a profound effect on plasma progesterone concentrations during days 20–24 of gestation. It seemed that ovarian progesterone was released into the vena cava in an episodic pattern and there were implications that these episodes were temporally associated with LH pulses.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pain is an unpleasant sensation and emotional experience that associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Anti-inflammation and antinociceptive drugs, because of their side effects and in some cases insufficient effects are useless so it seems that finding other more effective drugs is necessary. The present study was designed to evaluate the antinociceptive effect of hydroalcoholic leaf extract of Tribulus terrestris (HET) in male rats.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 36 male rats were divided into 6 groups including the control group (normal saline), morphine group (1mg/kg, i.p.), HET group (50, 100, 200mg/kg, i.p.) and the group treated with naloxone (1mg/kg) with extract (200mg/kg) of body weight was used. To evaluate the antinociceptive effect of HET writhing, tail flick and formalin test were used. 
FINDINGS: HET (200mg/kg) significantly reduced pain in writhing, tail flick (p < 0.01) and formalin tests (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the morphine and HET (200mg/kg) groups in the chronic phase of formalin.
CONCLUSION: From the results it could be concluded that the HET extract exhibit antinociceptive activity.

The rapid growth of renewable energy applications in electric power systems dictates a need to develop comprehensive techniques that can be used to evaluate the economics involved and the reliability of power supply that can be achieved from the utilization of these energy sources. Photovoltaic (PV) arrays have the potential to significantly reduce operating costs in remote small systems which are generally supplied using costly diesel fuel. This paper presents a simulation method that provides objective indicators to help system planners decide on appropriate installation sites, selection of PV arrays or diesel units in capacity expansion and optimum PV penetration levels when utilizing PV energy in small isolated systems.

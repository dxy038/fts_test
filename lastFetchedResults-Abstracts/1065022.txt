Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which emulate the parallel distributed processing of the human nervous system, have proven to be very successful in dealing with complicated problems, such as function approximation and pattern recognition. Due to their powerful capability and functionality, ANNs provide an alternative approach for many engineering problems that are difficult to solve by conventional approaches. Rainfall forecasting has been a difficult subject in hydrology due to the complexity of the physical processes involved and the variability of rainfall in space and time. In this study, ANNs were adopted to forecast short-term rainfall for an urban catchment. The ANNs were trained to recognise historical rainfall patterns as recorded from a number of gauges in the study catchment for reproduction of relevant patterns for new rainstorm events. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of temporal and spatial information on short-term rainfall forecasting. To achieve this aim, a comparison test on the forecast accuracy was made among the ANNs configured with different orders of lag and different numbers of spatial inputs. In developing the ANNs with alternative configurations, the ANNs were trained to an optimal level to achieve good generalisation of data. It was found in this study that the ANNs provided the most accurate predictions when an optimum number of spatial inputs was included into the network, and that the network with lower lag consistently produced better performance.

A novel isolated zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) bidirectional DC-DC converter with coupled inductors is proposed in this paper. The parallel structure in the low-voltage side and the series structure in the high-voltage side are adopted to satisfy the high power and high step-up/down conversion requirements. Moreover, by employing the PWM plus phase-shift (PPS) control technology, the current stress and the conduction losses are reduced. Furthermore, all the switches can achieve ZVS soft switching performance in a wide load range. Finally, a 1kW 48V/380V bidirectional prototype controlled by DSP TMS320F2808 is built and tested to verify the theoretical operation principle analysis.

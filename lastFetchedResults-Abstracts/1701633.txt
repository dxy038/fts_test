Objective (s): Commercial drivers are considered as a high-risk group for road traffic injuries (RTIs) in Iran and a clear relationship has been demonstrated for drug misuse and RTIs. To present the epidemiology of drug dependence among public transport drivers in Iran.
Methods: Using capture-recapture sampling method the prevalence rate of drug dependence was estimated. Overall, 1506 drivers were randomly selected proportionately by type of vehicles. To test the drug dependence, a multi-drug rapid urine kit (ACON 10 Panel Drug Screening Test) was employed. Trained interviewers accompanied by traffic police officers in selected roads asked the drivers to answer the questions and give a urine sample at the police check points.
Results: Overall, 14.1 percent of drivers were test positive. The top three drug dependence was from opium (55.0%), morphine (21.3%) and methadone (8.5%). Using logistic regression model showed no statistical difference for type of drug dependence by educational attainment. Drivers of trailers (21.5%) and trucks (15.1) were more likely to be drug-dependent compared to other drivers (p < 0.001). Many addicted drivers preferred to use drugs during the night time (44.3%) and drive long distances (26.8%).
Conclusion: The prevalence rate of illicit drug use among Iranian commercial drivers is high. Prevention of drugged driving among commercial drivers is an essential strategy for avoiding RTIs. Mandatory drug testing specially during the night time should be put inforce for commercial drivers particularly for trailer, truck, and for long distance drivers.

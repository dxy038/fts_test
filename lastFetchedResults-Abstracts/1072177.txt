Calculation of a specific rate constant (k) and activation energy (Ea) of 18F-labeling reaction is important to obtain objective data. However, it has never been tried, because short time heating required for the calculation of the parameters was difficult. In the present study, we could calculate the parameters using combination of coat-captureâ€“elution method (Aerts et al.) and microfluidic processes. The Ea values obtained for Ts-naphthol in acetone, MeCN and t-BuOH were 5.83, 8.98, and 13.54 kcal/mol, respectively, and for Ms-naphthol in the same solvents were 5.81, 8.16, and 19.34 kcal/mol, respectively. Calculation of these parameters might be useful for setting up [18F]fluorination procedure and for developing new precursors.

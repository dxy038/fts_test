Analysis using GA is capable of responding flexibly to operational planning of a complex system. However, case of large system, requires lengthy analysis time, generates many suboptimal solution, and unsatisfactory solutions of energy balance equations are obtained. Objective of this study is to develop a computer algorithm for planning operation of compound energy system with many design parameters with a high accuracy by introducing orthogonal table in GA. Orthogonal table is introduced to reduce operation range that is considered to include optimal operation of compound energy system. By analysis results, orthogonal table-GA hybrid method is a significant improvement over optimization methods that employ to traditional GA, and can be utilized to increase of design parameters and improve of analysis accuracy.

This paper presents an algorithm for the objective assessment of the motion of a body during health-evaluation physical tests using our inertial sensor, namely the ActimedARM. With the orientation quaternions provided by the sensor and integrating twice the calibrated acceleration measurements, we are able to compute the displacement of the sensor worn by a patient. To validate our data we have made measurements with both our sensor and a reference optical system. The displacement curves provided by our algorithm were correlated to the gold-standard system with a mean rate of 94.96%.

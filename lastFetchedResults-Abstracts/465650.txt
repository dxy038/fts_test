Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with rotations performed with Leff forceps in comparison with nonrotational forceps deliveries. Study Design: A review of 267 rotational and nonrotational forceps deliveries from August 1996 through February 1998 was performed. Multiple maternal and neonatal outcome measures were compared and results were analyzed by Ï‡2 with the Fisher exact test and the Student t test. Results: One hundred sixty-three traditional low-forceps or outlet forceps deliveries were compared with 104 rotational forceps deliveries performed with Leff forceps. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in maternal age, gestational age, gravidity, parity, total labor duration, birth weight, and Apgar scores. There were significantly lower rates of episiotomy, third- and fourth-degree lacerations, and sulcus lacerations in the rotation group, and the second stage of labor was also shorter. The neonatal intensive care unit admission rate was higher in the rotation group; however, none of the admissions were directly related to the mode of delivery. Conclusion: Rotational deliveries performed with Leff forceps are associated with less maternal morbidity and shorter second stage of labor than are deliveries performed with traditional forceps. Leff forceps are a safe option for rotation of the persistent occipitoposterior fetal position. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:1185-7.)

In this letter, we propose and demonstrate a single-fiber bidirectional self-healing wavelength-division-multiplexing multihop mesh network architecture for high-speed metropolitan area networks. With the novel network node design, fiber link restoration is achieved by the proposed all-optical cyclic deflection routing scheme.

Drama or play is a dramatic art and the plays were performed since five century before Christ in Athens and
Roma. Play progressed in different forms in middle age, renaissance and modern period for criticism of cruel
governments and kings. Since the kings did not bear critical language of the plays, most of the plays were
accompanied by satire and ridicules and laughing. In ancient Iran the plays were performed in different kingsâ€™
courts centuries before Christ. After Islam plays like Ta'ziyeh, comedies, Baqqal-Bazi, puppet show and
contemporary plays were performed. The main objective of this study is to better introducing the main and wellknown
types of plays (Ta'ziyeh, Comedy, Baqqal-Bazi, Ruhowzi, Puppet Show and Contemporary Drama) and
their playwriting evolution in Iran and even in some cases for Middle Easterns. As a consequence, the mentioned
different plays in Iran can be considered in New Playwriting Strategies around the world.

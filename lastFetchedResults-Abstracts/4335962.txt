Wetland ecosystems both constructed and natural are becoming important mitigating measures in water resource management around the world, as they have the ability to cycle and retain nutrients such as Phosphorus. However, wetland soils can function as source or sink for phosphorus depending on the quality and quantity of native phosphorus. So a soil/water column experiment was conducted using the soil/water columns to determine phosphorus release and retention by soils. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of floodwater P concentration on P flux from soils.

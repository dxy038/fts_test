The objective of this review article is to give an overview of the current state-of-the-art of photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy as a characterization tool in the study of semiconductors. A detailed description of all of the PL spectroscopic techniques will be given together with examples from the literature of their use. These examples will be the primary tool used to convey the essential aspects and usefulness of the variety of PL techniques discussed throughout this review. The primary examples of semiconductor materials examined with these techniques will be of the prototypical direct-gap and indirect-gap semiconductors, gallium arsenide and silicon, respectively. Additionally, PL characterization of structures with lower dimensionality (quantum wells, superlattices, quantum wires, and quantum dots) will be shown. This article will not cover the history of this type of spectroscopy, inelastic light scattering, infrared spectroscopy, or reflectance, etc. The focus is intended to be experimental in nature, and will be supplemented by theory where appropriate and necessary. There are several fine review articles and books dealing with the subject of photoluminescence, and radiative recombination in general, and this article is only intended to supplement these sources.

Proper recording from population of neurons over a long period of time is a crucial challenge in neurobiology due to various signal degradation factors. In this paper, we have proposed a new method to enable precise repositioning of individual microelectrodes prearranged in an array and implanted in neural cells of brain tissues. This method consists of electro thermal actuators for driving of neural probes and a bidirectional operation has been provided. The main design criterion has been the simplicity of fabrication process. The micro mechanical structure also has a self-latch mechanism to provide optimum power consumption. The structure enables neural probe with precise bidirectional positioning with a step resolution in the order of 2 &#956;m.

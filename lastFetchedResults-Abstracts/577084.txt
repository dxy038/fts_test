Background and Objective: Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor.  Despite many advances in treatment, all patients die within 6 to 18 months after diagnosis. In the cases of glioma, the immune system is suppressed in a local fashion. Therefore, unveiling the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved, with the aim of obtaining an appropriate new treatment is a priority. Designing an appropriate animal model is necessary before any clinical trials.
Material and Methods: In this study, we prepared fifteen 6-8 week-old female mice (Balb/C) from the  Pasteur institute, Tehran,and also selected the mouse glioma cell line GL26 to induce a allogeneic subcutaneous tumor.  After culturing the cell and anesthetization of the mice, we injected different cell doses into distinct groups of mice.  Sterile PBS was injected into the control group.  Animal behavior and clinical symptoms were regularly followed and recorded, and after tumor induction, it was surgically removed and evaluated in terms of macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.
Results: The tumor was induced more quickly with higher number of GL26 cells in mice. Atrophy and weakness was observed in the affected animals. In macroscopic examination, the tumor was relatively large, thick and full of blood. Moreover, in microscopic examination, cell proliferation, mitosis, abundant vessels, and tumor necrosis were observed.
Conclusion: Regarding the limitations of a glioma syngeneic animal model, establishment of an allogeneic subcutaneous model, allows an easy evaluation of the size and volume of the tumor, without a requirement  for sacrificing the animal. This model has the potential to provide opportunities for research on some immunological parameters, the testing of new therapeutic agents, and new discoveries in basic research, concerning glioma, for the first time in Iran.

The fast growth of distributed generation (DG), in particular from non-programmable renewable resources, poses many challenges on the management of MV networks. Storage systems, operated by the Distributor System Operator (DSO) or by third parties, may mitigate both the local and global effects of the DG. A major challenge is the identification of the optimal position and power exchange according to the desired objective. This paper introduces an innovative approach for the identification of the optimal position and the optimal exchange power profile for storage systems. The proposed approach, oriented to the minimization of the energy losses, has been based on simple analytical expressions, which gives a fast and immediate perception of the efficiency problem and a detailed physical explanation of the differences between the selected positions. This method could be extended from the storage system to all the local resources.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether human amniotic fluid contains cells that harbor the potential to differentiate into neurogenic cells.
Study design
Amniotic fluid cells (uncultivated or cultivated in standard or in neurogenic differentiation medium) were analyzed for morphologic neurogenic differentiation and for expression of cluster of differentiation 133 (marker for neuronal stem cells), nestin (neuronal progenitor cells), neurofilament (neurons), the p75 common neurothrophin receptor, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (oligodendrocytes).
Results
The appearance of neurogenic cells was not detected in uncultivated cells, was sporadic after cultivation in standard medium but strongly increased in neurogenic differentiation medium, and was accompanied by the induction of the expression of the analyzed marker genes.
Conclusion
For the first time, this study provides evidence that human amniotic fluid contains cells that express markers for neuronal stem and progenitor cells, which harbor the potential to differentiate into neurogenic cells.

The department of defense (DoD) teleport program integrates, manages, and controls the communications interfaces between the defense information system network (DISN) and satellite communications (SATCOM) assets at a single point of presence. The DoD teleport management and control system (TMCS) provides integrated and automated control functions for satellite earth terminals (operating in C, X, Ku, ultra high frequency [UHF], extremely high frequency [EHF], and Ka bands), network and baseband equipment, and other facility-specific items located at a DoD Teleport site. TMCS replaces existing equipment-specific management systems and provides monitoring and control of previously unmanaged equipment, utilizing an open architecture based on commercial standards and nondevelopmental products. TMCS will mature over three generations of DoD Teleport implementation, including integration of other advanced SATCOM systems such as advanced EHF (AEHF) and mobile user objective system (MUOS). This paper provides an architecture and capability overview of TMCS, highlighting its intent to facilitate network operations and control in a SATCOM environment.

Molecular motors such as helicases/translocases are capable of translocating along the single-stranded nucleic acids and unwinding DNA or RNA duplex substrates using the energy derived from their ATPase activity. The bacterial transcription terminator, Rho, is a hexameric helicase and releases RNA from the transcription elongation complexes by an unknown mechanism. It has been proposed, but not directly demonstrated, that kinetic energy obtained from its molecular motor action (helicase/translocase activities) is instrumental in dissociating the transcription elongation complex. Here we report a hexameric Rho analogue (Rv1297, M. tb. Rho) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis having poor RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and inefficient DNA–RNA unwinding activities. However, compared to Escherichia coli Rho, it exhibited very robust and earlier transcription termination from the elongation complexes of E. coli RNA polymerase. Bicyclomycin, an inhibitor of ATPase as well as RNA release activities of E. coli Rho, inhibited the ATPase activity of M. tb. Rho with comparable efficiency but was not efficient in inhibiting its transcription termination function. Unlike E. coli Rho, M. tb. Rho was capable of releasing RNA in the presence of nonhydrolyzable analogues of ATP quite efficiently. Also, this termination function most likely does not require NusG, an RNA-release facilitator, as this Rho was incapable of binding to NusG either of M. tb. (Rv0639) or E. coli. These results strongly suggest that the ATPase activity of M. tb. Rho is uncoupled from its transcription termination function and this function may not be dependent on its helicase/translocase activity.

Objective
ains unclear whether feelings of being disabled are a relevant psychological factor that determines outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Therefore, we evaluated “feelings of being disabled” as an independent risk factor for mortality 4 years post-PCI.
s
t of the Taxus-Stent Evaluated At Rotterdam Cardiology Hospital (T-SEARCH) Registry, 658 consecutive patients (age 63 years, 75% male) completed the subscale “feelings of being disabled” of the Heart Patients Psychological Questionnaire (HPPQ), within the first month after PCI.
s
ear follow-up, 8% of the patients (n=55) had died, 2% (n=16) underwent a myocardial infarction (MI), 13% (n=90) had a target-vessel revascularization (TVR), and 21% (n=137) had one or more major adverse cardiac events (MACE). One-third of the patients (32%) had high scores on “feelings of being disabled” at baseline. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, including symptoms of anxiety and depression, patients with a high score on “feelings of being disabled” had an increased risk for all cause mortality (HR=2.9, 95% CI=1.5–5.6), the composite end point mortality/MI (HR=2.4, 95% CI=1.3–4.4), and the occurrence of MACE (HR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1–2.7).
sion
gs of being disabled were an independent predictor of all-cause mortality, mortality/MI, and MACE 4 years post-PCI. These patients should be identified in clinical practice, as they warrant additional treatment, e.g., of a psychosocial nature, in addition to the standard medical treatment.

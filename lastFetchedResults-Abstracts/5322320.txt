The use of low-frequency, ultra-wideband (UWB) radar technology to help detect concealed or buried targets has been demonstrated in the past, and could provide an important capability for combat systems on the battlefield. As part of ArmyÂ´s mission and technical objective, the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, Countermine Division has designed and developed a Forward-Looking Ground-Penetrating Radar (FLGPR) with standoff capability. The forward-looking GPR is an impulse-based radar system with a bandwidth that spans between 300 - 3000 MHz. The innovative design uses commercially available, off-the shelf (COTS) components to create an effective sampling scheme of approximately 8 GHz. The design is modular, and can be scaled to provide a means for future improvement of electronic components to eventually meet the requirements of various combat systems. Early results from recent tests suggest that metallic targets buried near the surface can be detected with this radar system.

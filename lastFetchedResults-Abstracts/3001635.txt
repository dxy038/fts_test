We demonstrate a high-speed bidirectional data communication link with simple multimode-fibre transceivers. The single-fiber link uses a vertical-cavity device that functions both as an efficient 850-nm laser source and resonant-cavity-enhanced avalanche photodetector. The receiver sensitivity is found to be better than -12 dBm at 1.25 Gb s<sup>-1</sup> and error-free operation is observed for a 500-m half-duplex link at 1.25 Gb s<sup>-1</sup>.

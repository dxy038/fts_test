In order to assure hygiene safety for patients, optimal use of drugs is necessary for controlling the number of clinically observed tumor cells. Based on a mathematical model of drug therapy for cancer, and on an objective function, the optimal solution is reached. The model therapy is considered for an individual patient over a fixed time horizon. The disease dynamics are given by an ordinary differential equation that describes the evolution of cancer cells in time. An optimization theory is applied in order to minimize the number of cancer cells at the end of treatment. A comparative study is performed on different treatments profiles applied to different types of cancer. This study shows the usefulness of the suggested mathematical deterministic or hybrid model. It considers the treatment in terms of duration and drug dosage, the initial number of detected cancer cells and the objective function.

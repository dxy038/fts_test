Salinization and alkalization are two of the most problematic features of the arid and semi-arid regions, where precipitation is lower than evapotranspiration rate. Under such climatic conditions, soluble salts are accumulated in the soil, bringing about the lessening of the soil productivity and fertility. So, an accurate identification of the salt affected areas is essential to sustainable soil management. The specific objective of this research is the mapping of saline soils through Hyperion EO-1 satellite images, in the Uremia Plain. Throughout the study, spectral responses of 40 saline soil samples were recorded by the Spectroradiometer Fieldspace 3 and Hyperion image to map the soil salinity. These references were obtained from the United State Geological Survey (USGS) archives. Results indicated a significant correlation (R2= 0.89) between Soil salinity Content (SSC) and the percent of reflection at the 42 and 219 bands. A Soil Salinity Spectral index (SSI) was constructed from Continuum Removed Reflectance (CR-Reflectance) at 0.762 and 2.345 micrometers. Subsiquently, a model for estimation of SSC through SSI was constructed using univariate regression. Model validation yielded a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.23 ms/cm and an R2= 0.8. The model was calibrated through a Hyperion reflectance image, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and reasonable agreements with an overall accuracy of 75% and Kappa Coefficient of 0.65. The findings of this project suggest that the satellite hyperspectral data bear the potential of predicting SSC in the study area.

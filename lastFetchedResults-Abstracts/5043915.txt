The objective of this effort is to perform the research and development (R&amp;D) and systems engineering necessary to integrate, demonstrate, and deliver a secure, rapidly deployable high-performance computer system to Naval special warfare commandpsilas mission support center (MSC) that will enable our special forces (Navy SEALs) secure, operational-tempo access to the ultra-fast, high-accuracy predictions of airborne contaminant transport (CT) provided by the Naval research laboratory (NRL) CT-Analyst system. Two 64-core SGI Altix systems have been deployed at the MSC and NRL. The system at NRL is being used to develop new operational procedures and needed code modifications without access or disruption to the dedicated and secure system at the MSC. The NRL installation has been used for developing components of a rapid turnaround, turnkey system to make dispersion nomografstrade for new regions. The SGI Altix at NRL has been in continuous use since installation, for example, for an upcoming national security venue event in Washington, DC. Installing twin systems proved to be critical due to limited accessibility and availability of the MSC system. We were able to demonstrate successful operation of FAST3D-CT including remote visualization with reach back to NRL on the operational machine.

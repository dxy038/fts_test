Few studies have been carried out with the objective of comparing criteria in different paradigms. This work presents an experimental study comparing the cost of mutation analysis in the Procedural and Guided Objects paradigms. A set of 32 programs implemented in C and Java was used. The tools Proteum and MuClipse were used. The strength of an adequate set of test cases comparing a program in one paradigm to the same version of the program implemented in the other paradigm of interest was also evaluated (cross scoring). Results indicate that as much the cost, the strength of the mutation test is greater in programs implemented in the Procedural paradigm compared to the OO paradigm

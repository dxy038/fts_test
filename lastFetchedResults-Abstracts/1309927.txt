Background: Physical activity and exercise increases the oxidation process in the body due to increased production of free radicals and ROS (reactive oxygen species) that can cause tissue damage. Free radicals are atoms or molecules that are highly reactive due to a single electron. An imbalance between the production of free radicals and antioxidant defense system causing oxidative stress. This trend is the use of antioxidant supplements for athletes. Due to the side effects of synthetic antioxidants, natural antioxidants, especially of plant origin tend to use increased. Saffron is a plant antioxidant. 
Objective: The aim of this study was evaluated the effect of saffron supplementation of antioxidant enzymes activities during a session eccentric exercise in active males.
Methods: In a trial, quasi-experimental, 21- man active purposefully available selected as subjects and randomly assigned to three groups of complementary Saffron (n=7), vitamin C (n=7) and placebo (n=7) received 14 days in capsule form. After 14 days of supplementation, subjects with 70 % VO2max and -10% treadmill downhill running for 45 minutes.
Results: The results showed that SOD activity was significantly increased saffron supplements, as well as a place in the placebo group than in the other two groups increased MDA activity was extroverted, while catalase activity did not change significantly.
Conclusion: For the base of these results suggest that supplementation with saffron before eccentric exercise have a preventative effect to reduce the exercise induced oxidative stress.

The present study examines both the unique and
the combined role of best friends’ delinquency and perceived
friendship quality in the development of adolescent delinquency.
Questionnaire data were gathered from 435 Dutch
adolescent best friends (mean age at first wave=12.97) over
a period of 5 years with annual assessments. Results showed
that mean levels of delinquency and perceived friendship
quality increased over time. Adolescent best friends were
highly similar in both mean levels and changes in delinquency
over time. For boys, similarity in mean level
delinquency between best friends was higher than for girls.
In addition, only for boys, friends’ delinquency is associated
with increases in adolescent delinquency over time, and
adolescents’ delinquency is associated with increases in
friends’ delinquency over time. No bidirectional longitudinal
associations were found between perceived friendship
quality and adolescent delinquency. No interaction effects
between friendship quality and friends’ delinquency on
adolescent delinquency were found. Thus, findings were
more in support of the differential association theory than of
the social control theory.

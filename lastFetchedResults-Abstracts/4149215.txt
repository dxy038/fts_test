An optimal modulation scheme that enables minimum conduction and copper losses is presented for a bidirectional dual active bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter. The considered converter system is employed for an automotive application and comprises of a high voltage (HV) port with port voltage <i>V</i><sub>1</sub>, 240V &#8804; <i>V</i><sub>1</sub> &#8804; 450 V, and a low voltage (LV) port with port voltage <i>V</i><sub>2</sub>, 11 V &#8804; <i>V</i><sub>2</sub> &#8804; 16 V; the rated output power is 2 kW. The closed-form expressions for the optimal control parameters are derived and implementation details are presented in order to facilitate the direct application to a given DAB converter. The paper further details the properties of the presented modulation scheme with respect to switching losses. Experimental results confirm a considerable increase of the converter efficiency achieved with the proposed optimal modulation scheme, compared to the efficiency obtained with conventional phase shift modulation. The efficiency increase is most distinct at <i>V</i><sub>1</sub>=450V and <i>V</i><sub>2</sub> = 11V with an increase from 78.6% to 90.6% at 1 kW output power and from 85.9% to 90.7% at rated output power as compared to conventional phase shift modulation.

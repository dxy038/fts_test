Energy efficiency is a critical parameter in wireless sensor networks. Clustering the nodes and controlling the number of cluster heads and members provides an effective way of energy efficiency. In this paper, we develop a clustering protocol for single hop wireless sensor networks. We utilize a competition algorithm for cluster selection phase that the competitionÂ´s range is a function of distance to base station. Our objective is to balance the energy consumption of the clusterheads all over the network. Simulation results show the more balanced energy consumption and longer lifetime. Moreover, the proposed scheme delivers more packets of data to the base station, which provides more accuracy of the monitored phenomenon.

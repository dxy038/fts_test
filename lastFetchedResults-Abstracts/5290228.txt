Electric vehicles technology has been an attractive topic for many researchers around the world during the last three decades. Single, double or four wheeled traction are popular applications with corresponding advantages and drawbacks. ItÂ´s also known that fault tolerance and high reliability are some needed characteristics in this kind of power electronic application. In this paper, it is proposed an interleaved DC/DC converter for multi-wheeled electric vehicles which is capable to reconfigure its structure in order to work as active PWM front-end for battery charging. Moreover, its structure can be modified to be used as bidirectional converter for boosting and regenerative current flow and as a low voltage back-up inverter in case of a fault in any main inverter. The advantages of the power system and partial results are illustrated via numeric simulations..

In this paper, we extend the classes of generalized type I vector-valued functions introduced by
Aghezzaf and Hachimi in [J. Global Optim. 18 (2000) 91–101] to generalized univex type I vectorvalued
functions and consider a multiple-objective optimization problem involving generalized type I
univex functions. A number of Kuhn–Tucker type sufficient optimality conditions are obtained for
a feasible solution to be an efficient solution. The Mond–Weir and general Mond–Weir type duality
results are also presented.

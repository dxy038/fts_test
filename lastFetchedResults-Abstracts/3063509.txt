A distributed signature sequence adaptation scheme is considered for the downlink of MC-CDMA system, wherein each mobile user selfishly adapts its signature sequences to improve its own performance objective with no consideration to the other users in the system. Pricing is introduced to each userÂ´s performance objective to make that user notice the power it consumes. It then serves as a control signal to motivate users to efficiently share the limited transmission power at base station, even thought the adaptation of users signature sequences is independent. It is shown that the proposed adaptation scheme will converge to a set of signature sequences at which no user can further improve its own performance with unilateral adaptation. Simulation result indicates that a simple linear pricing function with a properly chosen unit price can significantly improve the system performance.

Land cover change has largely resulted in deforestation, biodiversity loss, global warming and reduction of environmental services, so many countries and organizations establish land cover data through multiform methods. Despite its importance, accurate statistics on land cover change data is not available in most countries, the detection and monitoring of land cover dynamics is highly desirable. With increasing frequency, remotely sensed data sets have been used to classify global land cover. The objective of this paper is to construct an operational system to update land cover dataset based on CBERS-02B image and outdated land cover data.

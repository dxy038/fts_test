Residential broadband networks present new signaling challenges as compared to the more traditional telephony networks. Access signaling protocols such as DSM-CC and Q.2931 for ATM, are evolving to meet these challenges. A desirable outcome will be a solution that supports seamless interworking among the newer video applications and the more traditional applications. First we examine the new requirements that arise when considering control of VDT networks. We then provide a brief review of the capabilities and development status of each protocol. Finally, we examine possible evolution paths for the development of broadband signaling. Our primary objective is to describe a signaling evolution path that integrates the requirements of both business and residential broadband networks, thus allowing partial or total sharing of network resources in support of both types of applications

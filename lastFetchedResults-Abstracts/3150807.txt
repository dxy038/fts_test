In this paper the new method of the surface shape investigation close to the optimum is presented. To improve parameter study both probabilistic theory and graph theory were applied. The simulations are taken with genetic algorithm and multidimensional test objective function. The results are presented on raw data and with the use of Minimum Distance Rule, which determines the minimum distance between two samples.

Topology control is one of the prime factors affecting overall network performance. The characteristics of the network topology can also greatly impact the performance of other network functionalities, like MAC, routing and security. Traditionally, the objective of topology control approaches has been the formation of power efficient topologies by minimizing the transmission power assignments to radio interfaces, for achieving a connected network. In this paper we present a more versatile approach that is capable of forming robust k-connected networks, while simultaneously minimizing end-to-end delay and transmission power assignments. The approach is based on the combination of general stochastic approximation and min-cut algorithms. The results indicate the effectiveness of the approach, which provably converges to k-connected networks that are also power efficient and end-to-end delay aware.

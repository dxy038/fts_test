Results showed that there were significant differences between rapeseed cultivars and explant densities, but no significant interaction effect was observed between investigated parameters. The cultivar PF-7045-91 was better regenerated with average of 85% regenerated cotyledons than the other one with 62%. Higher percentage of regeneration (87%) was also recorded for treatment with 15 cotyledons in Petri dish rather than 30 cotyledons.

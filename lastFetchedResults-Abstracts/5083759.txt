In this paper, a new isolated dc-dc bidirectional converter is introduced. This converter consists of flyback and forward transformers and only one switch in primary side and one switch in secondary side of transformers. In this converter energy transfers to the output in both on and off switch states and controlled by PWM signal. Therefore implementation of control circuits is easy. Also this converter operates over a wide input voltage range. Theoretical analysis is presented and computer simulation and experimental results verify the converter analysis.

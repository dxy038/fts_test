This paper develops a single-phase ZVS bidirectional AC-link converter to interface batteries of Electric Vehicles (EVs) to the electric grid. A parallel Link inductance charges from the input (grid/battery). Then, the inductance partially resonates with the help of a parallel capacitance. After that, it discharges to the output (battery/grid). Furthermore, during charging mode, the power is fed into the output through a series inductance. Hence, the proposed converter has a continuous power flow capability. Therefore, its output current is very smooth and doesnÂ´t deteriorate the grid. Moreover, the single-phase feature enables interfacing small to medium Battery systems-at a smooth output fed current-to single-phase mains. The, the proposed converter is designed in MATLAB Simulink and is tested in a real time dspace environment. Both of simulation and real time results show that the proposed converter attains a satisfactory performance.

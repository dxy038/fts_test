In this paper we investigate an asset–liability management problem for a stream of liabilities written on liquid traded assets and non-traded sources of risk. We assume that the financial market consists of a risk-free asset and a risky asset which follows a geometric Lévy process. The non-tradeable factor (insurance risk or default risk) is driven by a step process with a stochastic intensity. Our framework allows us to consider financial risk, systematic and unsystematic insurance loss risk (including longevity risk), together with possible dependencies between them. An optimal investment strategy is derived by solving a quadratic optimization problem with a terminal objective and a running cost penalizing deviations of the insurer’s wealth from a specified profit-solvency target. Techniques of backward stochastic differential equations and the weak property of predictable representation are applied to obtain the optimal asset allocation.

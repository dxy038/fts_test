This paper presents a quantitative architecture security evaluation method to identify potential risks of an architecture. The method is based on security of the architecture components. In this method, components of the architecture are classified and their security measures are identified according to component function and architecture level. Then, an integration process applies analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy evaluation analysis to determine quantitative and qualitative factors in evaluating the security of components. These factors are used to obtain security conclusions of the architecture. The experiment shows that the method not only improves efficiency of the evaluation, but also makes security evaluation process more objective and accurate.

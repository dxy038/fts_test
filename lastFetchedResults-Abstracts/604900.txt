Background and Objective: Atrial fibrillation is the most prevalent arrhythmia, accompanied with some adverse complications, after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of psychological risk factors, as well as age and gender for the incidence of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional survey, a total of 317 patients, whom undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery in the Tehran Heart Center and Tehran Cardiac Surgery Center of Bo-Ali Hospital were selected by convenience sampling.  Among these cases, following the coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 89 (28.1%) of them had atrial fibrillation.  Data were collected by demographical questionnaire and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and analyzed by chi-square, independent t-test with binary Logistic Regression using the PASW software.
Results: Depression (OR= 4.57), stress (OR= 4.49), anxiety (OR= 3.61), age (OR= 4.77), and gender 
(OR= 2.38) could significantly differentiate the patients with atrial fibrillation from those without it after the bypass surgery (P < 0.0001). The total regression model explained that 97.2% of this sample was classified correctly (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Depression, stress, and anxiety as psychological risk factors, and age and gender, as background risk factors, all appear to contribute in the incidence atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  These results might have applicable implications in prevention of atrial fibrillation after the bypass surgery and its related adverse complications.

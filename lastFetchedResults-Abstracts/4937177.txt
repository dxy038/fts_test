Distribution system has witnessed numerous problems due to concentrated power loading in cities. Stability, reliability, peak demand, poor power quality, unbalanced loading are some of the major issues besides handling of large AC networks. This paper proposes an insertion of DC power dam connected between transmission and distribution system, through bidirectional voltage source converter (VSC) both on transmission and distribution sides at multiple places, to provide the comprehensive solution to the problems of interconnected AC distribution network. A study has been done through MATLAB simulation and results are presented for solutions to problems witnessed by the distribution system. A new simplified current control technique is also presented for realization of simulation model of the system.

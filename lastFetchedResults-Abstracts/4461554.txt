Wireless networks provide several advantages over wired networks. They offer: a satisfactory bandwidth, mobility, easy deployment in difficult areas, long-term savings and the speed more and more higher. However, they also have some disadvantages in regard to security, performances during re-authentication, execution of real-time applications and interference from other electromagnetic sources (Bluetooth, microwave, etc.). The existing solutions to reduce delays of Handover intercellular are specific solutions to a particular network or manufacturer of this technology. The main objective of this paper is to propose novel mechanisms based on digital signatures to obtain low latency re-authentication during Handover in Wireless Access Networks. Our infrastructure will be based on trusted relationship between the heterogeneous access points and the authentication servers, in order to allow the mobility anytime anywhere to any user, and the ubiquitous access to the Future Internet, while ensuring the right level of security to both the end users as well to the wireless networks. In this context, the main issues are to resolve the seamless Handover and the re-authentication during mobility of station. By using a signed token in our trusted infrastructure, we achieve a unique authentication and a fast re-authentication. Therefore, the requests to the authentication server are considerably limited.

Solving large systems of equations from CFD problems by the explicit pseudo-temporal scheme requires a very low amount of memory and is highly parallelizable, but the CPU time largely depends on the conditioning of the system. For advective systems it is shown that the rate of convergence depends on a condition number defined as the ratio of the maximum and the minimum group velocities of the continuum system. If the objective is to reach the steady state, the temporal term can be modified in order to reduce this condition number. Another possibility consists in the addition of a local preconditioning mass matrix. In this paper an optimal preconditioning for incompressible flow is presented, also applicable to compressible ones with locally incompressible zones, like stagnation points, in contrast with the artificial compressibility method. The preconditioned system has a rate of convergence independent from Mach number. Moreover, the discrete solution is highly improved, eliminating spurious oscillations frequently encountered in incompressible flows.

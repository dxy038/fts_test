Objective: Scutellaria (Lamiaceae) has been implicated for medicinal purposes both in modern and traditional medicine. Some species of the genus Scutellaria has extensively been studied for anticancer activity. Scutellaria luteo-coerulea (S. luteo-coerulea) is one of the Iranian species of the genus Scutellaria. Materials and Methods: In the present study, cytotoxic and apoptogenic properties of CH2Cl2, EtOAc, n-BuOH, and H2O fractions of S. luteo-coerulea were investigated on K562. Moreover, HL-60. DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells were determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining (sub-G1 peak). Results: Scutellaria luteo-coerulea inhibited the growth of malignant cells in a dose-dependent manner. Among solvent fractions of S. luteo-coerulea, the CH2Cl2 fraction was found to be the most cytotoxic one among others. Sub-G1 peak in flow cytometry histogram of treated cells suggested the induction of apoptosis in S. luteo-coerulea. Conclusion: Scutellaria luteo-coerulea could be a novel candidate for further analytical elucidation in respect to fine major components responsible for the cytotoxic effect of the plant also clinical evaluations.

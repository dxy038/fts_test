Considerable interest has been shown in the problems of viscous flow between concentric annulus with one or both of the cylinders rotating. And the problem of instability of isothermal viscous flow between rotating concentric annulus is also important problem in a rotating electrical machine, especially in the drilling of oil well. This study concerns the phenomena and variables which control the rate of heat transfer in the gap of a rotating annulus. The objective of this study is to study the non-isothermal case, showing the effect of a radial temperature gradient in the annulus on the instability of this type flow. In this study the effect of axial flow rate, rotational speed of inner cylinder and temperature gradient between the cylinders on the heat transfer were investigated

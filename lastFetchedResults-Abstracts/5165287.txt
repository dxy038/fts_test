Aimed at the fuzziness of the emergency scheme optimization, a multiattribute decision-making model based on entropy weight is presented. By digging the inherent information of candidate schemes adequately and adopting the method of entropy weight combined with experts scoring, the model can obtain a synthetic weight considering subjective and objective factors, and then entropy weight coefficients of candidate schemes are calculated, by which the optimal emergency scheme can be selected out. Case study shows that the proposed model is reasonable, reliable, and makes for decision-making scientifically, which provides a new approach to resolve fuzzy multiattribute decision-making problem and can be applied to assist commanders in making decision.

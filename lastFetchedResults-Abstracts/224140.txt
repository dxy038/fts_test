The APLC (Active Power Line Conditioner) is a
type of active power filter that compensates the voltage
waveform distortion caused by harmonics in power systems.
This paper presents a new approach based on an
optimization theory to investigate the determination of
locations and sizes of APLCs. The objective is to minimize
the new APLC injection currents and the voltage distortion
while satisfying the harmonic standard. The test result for
an 18-bus distribution system shows the applicability of the
proposed method.

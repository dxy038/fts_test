The objective of this study was to use high content dietary fiber (26%) stabilized rice bran flour (SRBF) in the production of pizza dough. The pizza dough was developed mixing wheat flour with SRBF in a proportion of 5:95 and 10:90; SRF: wheat flour, water, salt, and yeast. All the pizzas were stored for 60 days at −18 °C and their proximal composition, functional properties, and sensorial characteristics were evaluated at 0, 30, and 60 days. The results showed that the content of dietary fiber increased in 3.8% and 5.3% as the level of enrichment increased. The farinographic curves of the pizza dough show that the development time, water absorption, and stability decreased, while mixing tolerance index and departure time were not affected by enrichment level. During storage (60 days), starch content of the three flours was decreased. The sensorial test results indicate that the pizza dough with an enrichment level of 5% with SRBF was well accepted by the panel and it were stable during 60 days at −18 °C.

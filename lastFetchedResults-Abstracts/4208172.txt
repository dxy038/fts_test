This paper presents an experiment about high heat flux plasma generation with ICRF heating in a linear divertor simulator, NAGDIS-II. Main objective of present work is to produce high heat flux plasmas for divertor plasma simulation experiments. High heat flux (/spl sim/0.9 MW/m/sup 2/) plasmas were produced by injecting /spl sim/6 kW RF power, whose parameters were the ion temperature of /spl sim/10 eV, the electron temperature of /spl sim/10 eV and plasma density of /spl sim/10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/. In this experiment, two RF inverter power supplies using Static Induction Transistor (SIT) were employed to excite the Ion Cyclotron Slow Waves (ICSW) in a plasma. Each power supply can generate the RF power of /spl sim/15 kW at 0.25/spl sim/1.7 MHz. Waves are excited by phased loop antenna array. By measuring the loss power during RF heating, the flow channels of the radiated power in NAGDIS-II are identified.

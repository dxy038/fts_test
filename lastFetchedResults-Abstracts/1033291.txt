Steel exposed to high temperatures and stress in a corrosive environment suffers detriment in the mechanical properties and finally embrittlement. The objective of this work is to study the mechanical properties of steels of different chemical compositions under hydrogen attack (HA). The influence of chromium and vanadium in the mechanical resistance was analyzed. The 1.25Cr1Mo0.25V and 2.25Cr1Mo ferritic steels previously hydrogenated are studied at different temperatures and loads. The temperature, electric charge density and electrolyte concentration were modified during the electrochemical charge in order to find the optimum hydrogen income to the material. The metal test conditions were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The material remains in stationary state for a period of time and the residual damage was evaluated. The steels were subject to torsion creep tests while the temperature and the load were maintained constant along the experience. We studied the relationship between the strain rate at the secondary stage and both the stress and temperature. The stress exponent and the activation energy were also determined. A comparison with the same steel samples without hydrogen charge was also performed. The microstructural mechanics during the tests and the embrittlement degree were also discussed.

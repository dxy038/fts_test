Solid-state switch-mode rectification converters have reached a matured level for improving power quality in terms of powerfactor correction (PFC), reduced total harmonic distortion at input AC mains and precisely regulated DC output in buck, boost, buck-boost and multilevel modes with unidirectional and bidirectional power flow. This paper deals with a comprehensive review of improved power quality converters (IPQCs) configurations, control approaches, design features, selection of components, other related considerations, and their suitability and selection for specific applications. It is targeted to provide a wide spectrum on the status of IPQC technology to researchers, designers and application engineers working on switchedmode AC-DC converters. A classified list of more than 450 research publications on the state of art of IPQC is also given for a quick reference.

Full impedance matrices of the method of moments (MoM) type have been decomposed into sparse matrices in the application of on-surface measured equation of invariance (OSMEI) (Rius et al. (1996, 1997)). The objectives in Rius are to find continuous current distributions on scatterers. Thus, the concept of metron and measure is justified under the postulate that the local relation between fields and current densities is an invariant of the excitation. In this paper, we have extended the concept to dipole arrays, where the objective is to find the discrete driving point currents. Numerical results show that using the windowed metrons presented in this paper, the sparsity rate of the sparse matrices can be kept within 1%, while the E- and H-plane patterns are still in good agreement with the MoM results except for the farthest side lobes of the H-plane patterns.

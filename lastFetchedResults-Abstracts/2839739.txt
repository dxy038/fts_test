Preserving the quality of the water is a major concern from ecological, economical and sustainable development point of view, but also a condition when using water for renewable energy production. The European Water Policy defines a common regulation for sustainable and integrated management of water corps and requires that all impact factors to be considered. The environmental friendly concept represents a necessity for worldwide hydropower development. The dissolved oxygen in water courses represents an essential parameter which allows the preservation and development of aquatic habitat. The objective of the work is identification and study of a new solution which will contribute to improvement of the dissolved oxygen quantity in water used as renewable energy resource, so necessary to the aquatic life. The proposed solution takes in consideration the optimum between aeration parameters and energy consumption, in order to be implemented in hydraulic turbines.

The objective of this paper is to highlight different factors relating to firm’s characteristics
and debt’s characteristics that may influence the presence of different types of bond
covenant in debt contract. Using a sample of large US firms and choosing only a contract
per firm over the period 2000-2010, we find that, concerning the firm’s characteristics,
the inclusion of a large number of covenants in the debt agreement is related to the high
indebtedness of the firm, to unavailability of cash flow and, also, to the firm's
profitability. Regarding the debt’s characteristics, we find that the inclusion of bond
covenants depends on the maturity of the debt and the debt rating. Our results are steady
with previous studies.

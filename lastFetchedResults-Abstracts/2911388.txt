The stator winding of a large turbo-generator is constructed from series connected, water cooled, conductor bars. The winding operates at voltages up to 26 kV and is normally insulated with epoxy mica insulation with a peak electric stress of some 34 kV/mm. This paper describes recent work to develop a method of estimating the DC resistance and polarisation index of water cooled stator windings after unit overhaul without the need to dry out the cooling water circuit. The objective being to allow generators to be returned to service in a safe condition with minimum delay

Facility layout problem is about arranging departments within the factory to achieve the desired product quantity and quality. The majority of previous research work has tackled the facility layout problem in terms of one objective, and few researches have considered Multi-Objective Facility Layout Problem. This paper develops and presents Genetic Algorithm model for solving Multi-Objective Facility Layout Problem. It combines quantitative and qualitative objectives into single objective function. The proposed model solves single and multi-objective facility layout problems. For single-objective facility layout, the results reveal that the proposed algorithm is capable of obtaining the best known published solutions for number of facilities up to 24. Furthermore it achieves best known material handling cost for 24 departments arranged in 30 locations. For multi-objective facility layout, the results reveal that the proposed algorithm is capable of obtaining solutions, which deviate between 0 and 15% maximum from its respective single objective best solution.

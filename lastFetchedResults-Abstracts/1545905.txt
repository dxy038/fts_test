By applying hybrid functions of general block-pulse functions and Legendre polynomials, linear Volterra integrodifferential systems are converted into a system of algebraic equations. The approximate solutions of linear Volterra integrodifferential systems are derived. Using the results we obtain the optimal control and state as well as the optimal value of the objective functional. The numerical examples illustrate that the algorithms are valid.

The wind farm micro-siting is an important strategy for reducing the cost of wind energy. In this paper, two different types of wind turbines are considered for a wind farm to take the full advantage of wind resources at different altitudes. The phenotype of the problem is described by an integer encoding method, and a repair operator of genetic algorithm is proposed to handle the position constraint. The optimal objective is to maximize the net present value of a wind farm under a certain initial budget. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the significance of planting multi-type wind turbines.

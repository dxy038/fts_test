The objective of the paper is to develop a microprocessor-based system to monitor the load state and insure the safety of a mobile telescopic crane. The conventional microprocessor-based systems use the searching technique (look-up tables) to read the allowed load from the memory. The drawback of such technique is that it requires a large amount of memory space which would increase the size of the hardware and searching time. The solution adopted in the proposed design consists of developing an equation relating the specific working configurations to the allowed load. This method reduces greatly the memory space, since the microprocessor computes the allowed load from the coefficients, proper to each configuration. This result was checked by implementing the designed system on a mobile telescopic crane, model 1040, manufactured by ENMTP-CPG Company at Ain-Smara, Algeria

This paper presents a bidirectional current-fed parallel resonant push-pull inverter (CFPRPI) for contactless energy conversions. In conventional CFPRPIs, each switch is in series with a blocking diode. Direct zero voltage switching (ZVS) is proposed to remove the series blocking diodes for higher efficiency and boosting ratio. In addition, the modified inverter has bidirectional power flow capability when these blocking diodes are omitted. Resonant tuning of the system is investigated by using a phase-locked loop and a new self-oscillating switching technique (SST). By using the new SST, the inverter has direct ZVS in a wide range of operating frequencies, which is necessary for inductively coupled power transfer systems. Finally, a laboratory prototype with an input voltage of 12 V and a maximum output power of 60 W has been implemented.

This paper presents an algorithm for thermal optimization formulation strategies for multi-heat generation of integrated circuit (IC) on printed circuit board (PCB). Weighted-sum approach for multi-objective genetic algorithm (WMOGA) with formulated initial placement and multi-constraints parameters (FIPMCP) are presented. FIPMCP is used for the components selection and components to PCB placement mapping procedures for random initial population. The objectives are to optimize thermal distribution f(T) of electronic components on PCB and the PCB area f(A) needed simultaneously. For multi-objective optimization process, non-dominated optimal solutions and the best fitness WMOGA over iterations are plotted for both cases in order to obtain the best PCB optimal design solution. The results show that the best solution of f(T), f(A) and F(T, A) are minimized by 1.80%, 8.54% and 4.97% respectively.

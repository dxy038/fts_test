Wireless body area network (WBAN) is more focused for its various applications in medical, rescue, military and so on. Since such network is mainly based on sensing nodes powered by battery, energy efficiency is of significance. According to current MAC protocols, this paper proposes energy efficient MAC for multi-priority wireless body area network, by optimizing Wake up Radio MAC with cost matrix between energy and delay. Linear optimization for objective cost function leads to energy efficient solution, reducing energy cost by adjusting the probability of commands `wake up´ and `sleep´ for sensing nodes under giving status.

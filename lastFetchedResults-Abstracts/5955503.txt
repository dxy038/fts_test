Methods: The routine water quality data and related meteorological data of bathing beach were collected from 2007 2009.Two bathing beaches in Haikou bay were selected for sampling and environmental evaluation. Regular indicators, fecal coliforms and Enterococcus faecalis were examined. Bacterial isolates were identified on multiple tube fermentation and mEI media. All isolated Enterococcus were tested for its vancomycin-resistance by using Kirby-Bauer. Results: The beach water satisfies the requirement of Class-II Water Standard for swimming most time. The concentration of fecal coliforms was (1085.8&#177;538.8)cfu/L in water and (120 000&#177;32 659.9)cfu/1000g in sand, the Enterococcus faecalis was (32.5&#177;19.1)cfu/L in water and (2 425.0&#177;689.8)cfu/1000g in sand. It showed that the water quality was qualified with a tendency of increase of fecal coliforms in last two years. The concentration of the two bacteria decreased with the increase of the distance from the land. The concentration is positively correlated to intraday rainfall (p &lt;; 0.05), but is not correlated with it the day before, vancomyein resistant Enterococcus has not been detected. Conclusion: The micro-organisms in sand are much higher than that in water of bathing beach of Haikou. The monitoring of microorg- nisms and managing of bathing beach should be reinforced and more attention must be paid to potential harm caused by the microorganism in sand.

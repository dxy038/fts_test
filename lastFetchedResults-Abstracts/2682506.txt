Background and Objective: The risk of coronary heart disease by high blood pressure in people with hypertension and those who have normal blood pressure rises. CRP is an inflammatory biomarker for immune system and an acute phase protein. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of caffeine on predictive factor of cardiovascular and pressure men's blood subsequent exhaustive exercise. 

Materials and Methods: Eight active men (BMI 21.55±1.22 kg/m2, Height 174±9.12 cm, weight 61.35±5.65 kg, fat 19.19±2.4 percent) were randomly selected. An hour after caffeine consumption (5 mg/kg) and a placebo in two separate sessions for each subject that are similar to Bruce test conducted 5 days. Inflammatory factor and blood pressure were measured in stages, before taking caffeine or placebo, one hour after, immediately and an hour after exercise. Data were analyzed using t-test, analysis of variance with repeated measures and with a significance level of p < 0.05.

Results: T-test showed that systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase by caffeine consumption, but there was no significant difference between the caffeine and placebo after exercise. However, significant differences were observed in c-reactive protein (CRP). 

Conclusion: Consuming caffeine before exercise can increase the blood pressure higher than normal.

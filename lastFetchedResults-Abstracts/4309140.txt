Mask-based objective speech-intelligibility measures have been successfully proposed for evaluating the performance of binary masking algorithms. These objective measures were computed directly by comparing the estimated binary mask against the ground truth ideal binary mask (IdBM). Most of these objective measures, however, assign equal weight to all time-frequency (T-F) units. In this study, we propose to improve the existing mask-based objective measures by weighting each T-F unit according to its target or masker loudness. The proposed objective measure shows significantly better performance than two other existing mask-based objective measures.

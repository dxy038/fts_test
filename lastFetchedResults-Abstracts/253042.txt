The study of the relationship between host-plants, viral
pathogens and heavy metals can provide new knowledge
to support the eorts directed toward environmental
balance, the development of resistant plants and stable
farming. The objective of this study was to establish the
eect of the combination of virus infection and heavy
metals on tomatoes; the eect of heavy metal accumula-
tion rate in the plants and of plant behaviour under the
eect of both stress factors. It has been established that
infections, caused by the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)
and tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), aect the accumula-
tion rate of heavy metals such as Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd and As in
tomatoes. This process is speci®c for each element and is
expressed more strongly with CMV. The response of
plants, treated with heavy metals through the root system
and infected withCMVandToMVis dierent, depending
on the virus.CMVcombined with heavy metals depressed
the whole plant to the same degree whereas ToMV in
combination with the same heavy metals depressed the
development of the tomato root system more intensively
in comparison with the overground part. There is a
relationship between the studied biotic and abiotic stress
factors of tomato plants.

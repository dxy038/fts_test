In this paper, a multi-objective mathematical model was developed for the assignment of vehicles with minimizing three conflicting objectives. An alternative of variant split delivery strategy allowing the split demands could be delivered by more than one period, was used to cope the fluctuation over available multi-period customer demands. The proposed approach used a systematic method based on a uniform design technique to set the weights of objective functions and used multiple fitness functions instead of a single fitness function to find a set of Pareto frontier solution. The computational experiment studies revealed that the proposed approaches outperform in the capability of search non-dominated solutions that can help the decision makerÂ´s preference on screening the combinations of different cost set.

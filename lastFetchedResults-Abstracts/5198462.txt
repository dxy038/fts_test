With the increasing of the airline passengers, the mobile communications on civil aircraft is expected to be promising and will be widely deployed. With this onboard mobile communications system, passengers can be provided with almost all kinds of mobile services, such as cell phones, WiFi, Bluetooth etc. The environment within cabin turns out to be a multiple radio and multiple channel scenarios. The resources allocation problem is different from the terrestrial applications. Since the safety and security are essential for aircraft, the objective function is designed to minimize the power of the transmission rather than maximizing the capacity of the system. The interference to the other avionics equipment and terrestrial systems should be suppressed as lower as possible. In this paper, the resources allocation algorithm for onboard cabin environment is proposed and evaluated. The simulation results confirm the efficiency of this resources allocation algorithm for cabin mobile communications.

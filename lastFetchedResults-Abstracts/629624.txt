Activities of radionuclides in the 238U (230Th, 226Ra, 210Pb) and 232Th (232Th, 228Th, 228Ra) decay series were determined in sediments from an east Texas watershed and examined with isotope ratios and compared to particulate organic carbon (POC), % fines (< 63 Î¼m) and total concentrations of Al, Fe and Mn. The objective was to elucidate the presence or absence of relationships affecting the effectiveness of these radionuclides in modeling sediment transport. Strong positive correlations were observed between radionuclides and Mn (Th) and % fines (Ra and Th). Isotope ratios effectively reduce these influences, supporting the contention that isotope ratios offset extrinsic variability in terrestrial sediments. Strong associations of 210Pbxs (excess 210Pb) and 226Ra/230Th with POC agree with data from marine and terrestrial settings, indicating that the role of POC in isotope fractionation, transport and sequestration merits further investigation.

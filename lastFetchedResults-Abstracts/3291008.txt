In this paper, a uniform circular antenna array (UCAA) combining genetic algorithm (GA) to find out global maximum of multi-objective function in indoor ultra-wideband (UWB) communication system is proposed. The GA is used to synthesize the radiation pattern of the directional UCAA to minimize the bit error rate (BER) performance and maximize received energy (RE).Using the impulse response of multipath channel, the BER performance of the synthesized antenna pattern on binary antipodal-pulse amplitude modulation(B-PAM) system can be calculated. Based on the shooting and bouncing ray / image (SBR/image) techniques, topography of the antenna and the BER formula. It can be reformulated into a multi-objective optimization problem and solved by the GA. Thus, a multi-objective problem including BER and RE as the optimization function instead of the side lobe level of antenna array pattern.

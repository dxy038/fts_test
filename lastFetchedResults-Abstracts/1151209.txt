The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of temperature and line tension on the creep deformation behavior of duplex stainless steel strip under continuous annealing conditions. For the creep tests, the stresses were calculated from the line tension applied to hot-rolled and cold-rolled duplex stainless steel (Type 2205) strip during continuous annealing.

It was found that Type 2205 steel exhibited the superplastic-like deformation behaviors with a high strain rate sensitivity value (m) and a large uniform elongation. The cold-rolled Type 2205 steel showed more prominent superplasticity as compared to the hot-rolled steel, which could be attributed to the fine grain size of the cold-rolled steel. It is suggested that the rate controlling mechanisms for the creep deformation of hot-rolled and cold-rolled Type 2205 steels are seem to be power law creep and grain boundary diffusion in Î³ phase, respectively.

In recent years software has become integral part of our lives. From product software has become a service now. Software industry has undergone a shift in paradigm. Companies look into every aspect for effective project management. Practitioners have started considering human aspect equally important in the product, process, people triad. Human aspect has become top concern for companiesÂ´ management since companies have realized that software is a product which is completely people driven. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the data mining area, where the objective is the discovery of knowledge that is correct and of high benefit for management. In this paper, we propose a model for high capability performance. This approach has proven to have positive impact on software development. It is a experimental and empirically driven model that builds a project team capability to achieve the desired software quality within the time and cost constraints. It is integration of personnel capability and post training. The capability and training are co-supportive and work in conjunction to ensure project success.

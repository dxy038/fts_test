Drainage pipe installation depth, diameter, and spacing are the important variables in subsurface drainage system design. Different combinations of these variables can be applied depending on the objectives of the design. The objective of this research was to investigate the parameters affecting the cost of subsurface drainage construction. To this end, steady state flow through the soil to the pipes was studied from midpoint of drainpipes using the governing equation of Hooghout and an optimization algorithm. Information of 50 ha of Salman Farsi Agro-industrial Corporation, Khuzestan, Iran, from two 25 ha units was used. The results of the optimization model showed that reduction in drainage coefficient reduced drainage construction costs, considerably. Also, reduction in drainpipe installation depth increased drain spacing and decreased costs. And, with increasing water table depth, costs increased.

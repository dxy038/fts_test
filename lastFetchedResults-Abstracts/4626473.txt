A novel EoC (Ethernet over Coax) approach, called ECAN (Ethernet over Coaxial Access Network) is presented in the paper. ECAN is specially designed for the last 100-meter access over coax rather than an adoption from the home network solutions. ECAN employs MPCP (Multipoint Control Protocol) in the media access control layer and uses the single-carrier n-VSB (Vestigial Sideband) modulation in the low frequency band for the bidirectional communication. The basic concept, the implementation architecture and the tested system performances are presented in the paper. It is shown that ECAN can work in different scenarios and provide &gt;;100Mbps or up to 130Mbps throughput out of the 160Mbps physical level bit-rate. This proves that ECAN has efficient bandwidth utility, high cost-effectivity and high practicality.

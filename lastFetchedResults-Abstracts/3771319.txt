Based on the Jeng exponential bidirectional associative memory (EBAM), a modified updating rule of EBAM is presented. In the recalling processes of the modified EBAM (MEBAM), the continuity assumption of the EBAM is relaxed and heterocorrelation processes run parallel with the autocorrelation processes. An energy function, which is defined and does not increase on the change of neuron states, ensures the stability of the system. Finally computer simulations demonstrates that the MEBAM has much better storage capacity than that of the Jeng EBAM.

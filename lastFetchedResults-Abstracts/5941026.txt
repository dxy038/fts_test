This paper discusses the history and current trends of video retrieval, focusing mainly on video segmentation, indexing and search. The objective is to share with the readers how much we have done so far as well as the current trends in the field. Unlike text documents, video contains dynamic information such as audio, motion (object and/or camera motions), etc. Thus, indexing videos for future search still remains a difficult problem. In addition, one particular problem that remains with digital videos is that it is hard to deal with copyright issues. Thus, indexing videos needs to take this into consideration. In this paper, the history and some of the-state-of-art methods that help to solve these problems will be addressed.

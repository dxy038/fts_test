Objective
To evaluate mechanical registration in a stereotactic system with framework neurosurgery navigation, setting scalp markers as the mutual frame of reference.
Materials and methods
The system can automatically convert the coordinates of the stereotactic device and CT or MRI images, and realize computer-assisted neurosurgery by the stereotactic system (framework neurosurgery navigation). We set targets in the skull; seven patients were operated on by open-skull stereotactic neurosurgery for clinical trials. Three cases were operated on by this method; the other four cases were treated by this method and the ASA620S operation plan system at the same time as a comparison.
Results
The targets were accurately located in seven patients. Four patients underwent the two different localization methods; the probe directed equally accurately (vector error: 3.96 ± 1.90 vs. 3.26 ± 1.22, P = 0.06 > 0.05, paired t-test). All surgical procedures were successful.
Conclusions
Framework neurosurgery navigation has equal localization accuracy compared with the traditional stereotactic device. Framework neurosurgery navigation does not require installation of a stereotactic framework before imaging or narcotic intubation; this differs from the traditional stereotactic technique. It can alleviate patient suffering, shorten preparation time, benefit anesthesia, and aid patient positioning during surgery.

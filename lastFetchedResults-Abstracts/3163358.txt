With the characteristics of the long duration and many influencing factors, this paper proposed a new decision-making analysis method by using the dynamic multi-objective decision-making analysis model. The optimal scheme, that can be met both economic and technical demands of the 10kV to 20kV step-up transformation projects, was obtained. In the final application example, the method this paper proposed proved its practical significance to some extent.

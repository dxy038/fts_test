With development of network technology and applications, it is necessary to develop new theory and method for control systems which operate through data network. Networked control system shares the resource, reduces system wiring and increases the convenience of system diagnosis and maintenance. Renovation of the air defense campaign modality results in networked fire control system. According to closed-loop control system, research on the networked fire control system is performed. Composing and configuration of the networked fire control system is analyzed, and functions and working process of each node is explained. At the same time, the network-induced delay, congestion and other peculiarities of networked control system may degrade the performance of closed-loop system. Necessity and methods of compensating the network-induced delay is illuminated, and objective and technology of network scheduling is made out. Some simulations of the effectiveness evaluation have done to the networked fire control system and the result of the simulation shows that the effectiveness of the system goes up.

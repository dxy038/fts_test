Objective
This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship of demographics, medical school performance, and licensing examination scores to board certification.
Study design
A longitudinal follow-up study of graduates of Jefferson Medical College between 1968 and 1994 identified in the AMA Physicians' Professional Data (AMA-PPD) file as practicing obstetrics and gynecology in 2003. Demographics, grades, and licensing examination scores had been collected prospectively. Board certification status was obtained from the AMA-PPD in 2003. Bivariate differences were evaluated with t tests. Logistic regression was used to evaluate multivariate relationships to board certification status.
Results
Of 310 physicians in obstetrics and gynecology, 291 (94%) were board certified. Those without certification were more likely to be underrepresented minorities, to have been older in medical school, and to have weaker academic records. Logistic regression indicated that scores on step 2 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination were the single most important predictor of achieving board certification. Those with scores of 200 or higher were 7 times more likely to achieve certification than those below 200.
Conclusion
Age, gender, and minority status are not independent predictors of achieving board certification. A low score on United States Medical Licensing Examination step 2 is a risk factor for not achieving certification.

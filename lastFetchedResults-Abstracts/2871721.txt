The main objective of this research is to provide an efficient and flexible control approach for unmanned helicopter (UH) to overcome the major difficulties in aerodynamic parameter uncertainties. A strong adaptive tracking controller with dual-model structure, which has significant advantages of separating model tracking parameter design from adaptive control, is presented for the attitude control problem, and the system stability margin is improved in the process of adjustment parameter correction and tracking error is reduced. The sensors, noise influence on adjustable parameter correction has been reduced through adding a state filter behind the adjustable system. The efficiency and feasibility of this method are provided by flight test.

Objective
tudy examined the molecules implicated in the cytodifferentiation of dental hard tissue cells.
s
ps at postnatal days 4, 7 and 10 were used. Differential display-polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR), Western blot and immunofluorescent localisation were performed to search differentially expressed genes in tooth development.
s
yte-common antigen-related tyrosine phosphatase (lar-tp) was differentially detected between the rat maxillary 2nd and 3rd molar germs on postnatal day 10, which were at the dental hard tissue formation and cap/early bell developmental stages, respectively. Both the mRNA and protein expression levels of lar-tp were higher in the 3rd molar germs than in the 2nd. In addition, the levels in the 2nd molar germs at postnatal days 4, 7 and 10, which corresponded to the early/late bell, crown and root stages, respectively, decreased in a time dependent manner. The immunoreactivity against intracellular P-subunit of lar-tp was detected in the ameloblasts and odontoblasts as well as in the undifferentiated inner enamel epithelia and dental papilla cells. However, strong immunoreactivity against extracellular E-subunit was observed only in the undifferentiated inner enamel epithelia and dental papilla cells in the 3rd molar germs and in the stratum intermedium in the 2nd molar germs.
sion
s the first identification of lar-tp in the molar tooth development and suggests that this molecule may be involved in the cytodifferentiation of dental hard tissue cells.

The objective of this paper was to determine the dielectric properties of AgNb1/2Ta1/2O3 (referenced ANT22) sintered at low temperature without any addition or substitution.

essing was performed to decrease the sintering temperature. By this way, high density were achieved. The resulting samples were compared with conventionally sintered ANT22 and with copper oxide added ANT22.

ghest densities were obtained for the hot-pressed samples compared with the CuO added ones. We concluded that the dielectric losses of the hot-pressed and copper oxide added ANT22 were very similar at high frequency (f &gt; 1 MHz), indicating that copper oxide does not degrade the ANT22 properties.

sely, low frequency dielectric properties were different, with a strong dielectric relaxation for the hot-pressed samples.

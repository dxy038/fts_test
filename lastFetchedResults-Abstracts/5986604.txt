To demonstrate circuit technologies for potential low-power non-volatile RAM, or universal memory, we fabricated a 1.8V 2-Mb SPRAM (SPin-transfer torque RAM) chip using a 0.2-&#194;&#191;m logic process with a MgO tunneling barrier cell. This chip features an array scheme with bit-by-bit bidirectional current writing to enable proper spin-transfer torque writing and parallel-direction current reading for preventing read disturbance. In addition, this memory can improve the power efficiency of digital equipment.

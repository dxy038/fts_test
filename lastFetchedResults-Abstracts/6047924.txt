We report on recent ASR and MT work on our English/Iraqi Arabic speech-to-speech translation system. We present detailed results for both objective and subjective evaluations of translation quality, along with a detailed analysis and categorization of translation errors. We also present novel ideas for quantifying the relative importance of different subjective error categories, and for assigning the blame for an error to a particular phrase pair in the translation model.

Evaluation of the damage caused by the sperm preservation process is crucial to improving fertilization rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of refrigeration temperature (5°C and 15°C) and storage time (0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours) on apoptotic markers in equine semen. Membrane phosphatidylserine translocation index, caspase activation index, and DNA fragmentation index were analyzed using epifluorescence microscopy. Analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis, and Tukey test was used to compare means. The significance level was set at P < .05. The results demonstrated that for transport duration shorter than 24 hours, semen quality was maintained when stored at either 5°C or 15°C. A storage temperature of 5°C should be used when it is necessary to transport semen for longer than 24 hours. There was a significant decrease in semen quality after 48 hours of refrigeration.

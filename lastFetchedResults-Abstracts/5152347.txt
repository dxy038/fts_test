Computational intelligence (CI) based model approaches, realized by fuzzy control models (FC) or models with artificial neural networks (NN), are used as alternative concepts to classical approaches. In university education or further training are on the one hand models necessary which represent the technical system transparent and easy cognizable and on the other hand a programming tool is required that supports an easy development process. That includes tools to verify the results and tuning the system with graphic functions under real time conditions. A fuzzy control design tool (FHFCE-tool) and four technical models are presented. The methodical and didactical objective in the utilization of this teaching models is to develop solution strategies in CI applications, for example fuzzy controller, special to analyse different algorithms of inference or defuzzification and to verify and tune those systems.

In the multi-attribute decision making theory (MADM), fuzzy multi-attribute decision making theory is an important aspect. And in practical problem, some index can´t be expressed by certain number, just only expressed by linguistic words, under this situation, we must use fuzzy decision making method. This paper uses fuzzy LMS neural network to determinate weight, this method has the advantage of evaluating these factors both subjectively and objectively, by using subjective data and objective data, therefore can lead to more reasonable and meaningful conclusions. Through the factors´ weights training, we can obtain the important degree of factors (weight determination). Then according to the weight we obtained, we use the TOPSIS algorithm to make decision. At last the numerical illustrations prove the new model to be effective and scientific.

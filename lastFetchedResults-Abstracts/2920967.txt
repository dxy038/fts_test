In Denmark a large load management investigation comprising 500 customers has been carried out. The investigation lasted 1<sup>1</sup>/ <sub>2</sub> years. The authors describe the basis and the results of the investigation. The results show that multi-rate time-of-day tariffs bring about significant changes of behaviour, particularly with domestic customers, but also significantly with industrial and commercial customers. Over this period, tests with bidirectional communication over the power supply network were made. These showed that this solution is technically possible, if a repeater is placed at intermediate substations

Many defense satellite programs require advanced processors for increased speed, higher levels of reliability, and higher levels of radiation insensitivity, as well as lower weight, power, and cost. The objective of the Digital Signal and Data Processor Model (DSDPM) is to provide a credible estimating method for predicting the development and production cost of future space-based signal and data processors, and to capture the cost of new manufacturing techniques and processor technologies

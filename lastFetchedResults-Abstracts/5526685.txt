The objective of this paper is to present a beam synthesis technique for circular antenna array antennas with efficient tapering. This paper describes a Taguchi to synthesize circular antenna arrays controlled by the phase and amplitude excitation, to synthesize directive lobe. The advantage of Taguchi´s optimization technique is the ability of solving problems with a high degree of complexity using a small number of experiments in the optimization process Taguchi´s method is easy to implement and converges to the desired goal quickly. An 16-element circular antenna has been simulated and tested for various types of beam configurations.

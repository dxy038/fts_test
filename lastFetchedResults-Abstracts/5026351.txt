In this paper, a temporal error concealment method for the H.264 is presented, which uses the high correlation between the motion vectors of neighboring blocks. By using the motion vectors of neighboring macroblock of the lost MB, the motion vectors of the lost MB are recovered. Simulation result shows that the proposed method yields better subjective and objective quality than conventional methods.

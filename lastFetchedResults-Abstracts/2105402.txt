Objective (s): Obesity is affected by genetic, behavioral and cultural factors and has severe negative impact on body and mental health. The objective of this study was finding the possible association between overweight and depression, in regard to socio-economic factors
Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted on 400 high school girls found by simple random sampling. Questionnaires including demographic information, “Depression Anxiety Stress Scale DASS42”, and “Rosenberg self-esteem, physical activity MET” were filled by pupils. Weight was measured using Seca digital weight scale having 100g precision, and height was measured using inelastic tape installed on wall with 0.5 centimeter of accuracy. Data was analyzed using Chi-square, t-test, ANOVA and logistic regression statistical. 
Results: Prevalence of overweight and obesity was 21.8%, and prevalence of depression was 54.7%. The depression prevalence was significantly higher in overweight and obese subjects (P < 0.0001). School stage, weight perception, body fitness satisfaction, birth order, and family history of obesity were factors affecting the association of obesity and depression. After adjusting for these factors in multivariate logistic regression model, the association of obesity and depression remained significant. 
Conclusion: Due to significant association between overweight and depression and regarding high prevalence of depression in high school girls, paying more attention to obesity and its complications including depression is necessary.

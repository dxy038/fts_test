The objective of this paper is to characterize the autonomous location based services (LBS) in wireless pervasive computing environments and to design an autonomous LBS framework and facilitating mobile users of accessing the relevant information or services. The service ontology we built focus on giving a solution of developing a methodology to help users, services, devices, and underlying different networks to communicate with each other in a natural manner. Challenges for making LBS autonomous in this type of environment are discussed. A prototype given in this paper offers a practical solution to solve the implementation problem for autonomous LBS, and is also useful for further researches.

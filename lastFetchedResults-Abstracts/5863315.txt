The damping of oscillation in power system commonly use known controller such as power system stabilizer (PSS). Proportional integral derivative (PID) controller tuning based on power system stabilizer and AVR is presented in this paper. The parameters of PID controller such as proportional gain, integral factor, differential coefficient and gain AVR are selected and optimized by BF-PSOTVAC. The proposed method is applied to PID controller tuning and is compared to another method. The integral time absolute error standards of optimization design as objective function. The results of simulations show that the proposed method has the capability to damn optimally and suppresses error to minimum.

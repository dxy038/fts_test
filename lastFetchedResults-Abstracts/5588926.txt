Electricity is the key factor for industrialization, urbanization, economic growth and improvement of quality of life in society. Today, India is poised with opportunity for urbanization and industrialization. In India electricity is mostly generated from coal based thermal power despite the fact that stock of coal is likely to last till 2050 and CO2 emission is contributing alarmingly to global warming and health hazard in the society. Besides, forbidding import price of coal and crude oil is compelling India to look for alternative renewable source of energy like solar, wind power, etc. Unfortunately, India is constrained with technical know how, requisite technology and capital crunch for this change over of power generation from coal to renewable energy. In this situation, the researchers have developed a model with the use of Multi-objective Fuzzy Non-linear Goal Programming to depict future prospects of Indian power sector and recommend gradual change over of power generation from thermal to renewable energy for sustainable development of Indian economy and containment of global environmental crisis. Application of this Model indicates that in the long run Solar power should be the most ideal and viable alternative renewable source of energy.

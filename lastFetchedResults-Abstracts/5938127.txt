This paper deals with multi-objective decisionmaking problem with fuzzy parameters under a group environment, called fuzzy multi-objective group decisionmaking (FMOGDM). It first presents an FMOGDM method, which integrates fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) with fuzzy group decision making techniques. Based on the method, a fuzzy multiple objective group decision support system (FMOGDSS) is developed. Finally, it gives a case-based example to demonstrate how an FMOLP problem is solved in a group supported by the FMOGDSS.

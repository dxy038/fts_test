The main objective of this paper is to examine the effect of nanomaterials on mass transfer coefficient in bubble type absorption of carbon dioxide by experiment. The absorption process is carried out in a bubble column and in room temperature. Mass transfer coefficient, saturated concentration of CO2, and gas holdup are determined in this system. The kinds of nanomaterials, the concentrations of each one and the gas superficial velocity are considered as the key parameters. The results show that the mass fraction of nanomaterials has an optimum value to the mass transfer coefficient and saturated concentration of CO2. 0.07% CNT nanofluid increases the mass transfer coefficient up to 78%. The superficial velocity of CO2 enhances mass transfer coefficient and gas holdup within the experimental range, whilst it has no effect on saturated concentration of CO2. In addition, nanomaterials in solution increase the gas holdup.

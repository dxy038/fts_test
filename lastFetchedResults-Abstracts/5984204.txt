Basing on lifting technology, this paper researches a design method for multirate sampled-data control system in the background of flight control system design, which consummates the theory of multirate sampled-date control system design for further steps, and provides a method to design multirate sampled-data controller. As the reason of uncertainty in the aircraft model and the need of different sampling frequencies in different control loops, H<sub>&#194;&#191;</sub>-optimal multirate sampled-data control is considered. First, multirate sampled-data control system is outlined, and then the signal description are presented. Because of multirate sampled-data system is time-variant, the direct digital controller design becomes difficult. The equivalent discrete time-invariant systems can be converted from the linear time-variant systems through lifting technology. Then the H<sub>&#194;&#191;</sub> discretization of multirate sampled-data systems is researched. After the sampled-data control system was lifted, the equivalent L<sub>2</sub>[0, h)-induced norm is proven. Base on the above, the method of H<sub>&#194;&#191;</sub>-optimal multirate sampled-data control is summarized. A height control is simulated using a simplified aircraft model to illustrate the design. The simulation shows that the multirate Sampled-data control system can achieve the satisfactory objective accurately and optimally.

We present a scheme for optimised planning that can be applied across strategic, operational and tactical scenarios. In a network centric world, a network to support an effective command and control system is ensured by incorporating aspects of the underlying communication network in the objective function used to select the optimal strategy. This approach provides more reliability and efficiency to dynamically changing networked operations.

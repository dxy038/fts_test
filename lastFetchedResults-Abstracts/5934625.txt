Containment threats during severe accidents may arise due to fuel-coolant interactions, hydrogen combustion, molten core-concrete interactions, and long-term pressure and temperature loading. The objective of the paper is to bring out important issues in the assessment of containment integrity during severe accidents for PWR and PHWR. The issues are identified by extensive review and synthesis of information from literature on severe accident phenomena, severe accident analysis and containment integrity assessment.

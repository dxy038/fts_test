It has been demonstrated that the spectrum of fluorescence emission is dependent on leaf temperature, thus there is a need for thermal information in order to interpret fluorescence signals. Temperature is also related to transpiration and stomata closure, which affects CO2 uptake and fluorescence. Therefore temperature measurements help to confirm the trends observed in fluorescence measurements. While fluorescence is immediately and uniquely related to photosynthesis, temperature provides additional information about plant status and instantaneous energy/water fluxes between plants and the atmosphere. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the role of surface temperature in the context of FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission. To this end a database of land surface emissivity and temperature obtained from thermal radiometric measurements carried out in the framework of the Sen2FLEX (SENtinel-2 and FLuorescence Experiment) campaign has been used. These data were acquired in the agricultural site of Barrax (Spain) in June and July of 2005 simultaneously with airborne imagery acquired with Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) sensors and data from the airborne fluorescence measuring instrument (AIRFLEX). As a result of these studies we have identified the optimal band configuration for the FLEX mission, that allows the estimation of land surface temperature with an accuracy lower than 1.5 K. To this end single-channel, split-window, and Temperature Emissivity Separation algorithms have been compared using a database of simulated brightness temperatures.

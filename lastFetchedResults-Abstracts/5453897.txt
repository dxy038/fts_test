The power transformer is one of the most important equipment in a power system. Optimal design of transformer involves determination of design parameters of a power transformer when a chosen objective is optimized, simultaneously satisfying a set of constraints. In this paper simulated annealing (SA) technique is proposed for Optimization of three-phase power transformer design (OPTD). The initial cost of transformer viz., material cost of stampings and cost of copper used for windings is chosen as the objective that is to be minimized. The algorithm is tested on two sample transformers. The results obtained indicate that the method has yielded a global optimum. The computation time and cost of active material are much reduced when compared with conventional design results. The efficiency of transformer is found to improve with application of this algorithm.

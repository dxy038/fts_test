Patency rates of saphenous vein grafts following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) depend on multiple factors. Information regarding the impact of biomechanical properties of vein grafts on patency rates is not available. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether uncontrolled manual pressure distension during routine preparation of the saphenous vein in CABG-induced changes in the biomechanical properties of the vein. The morphometric and stress–strain properties were studied in isolated segments of the saphenous vein from 12 patients undergoing elective CABG. Six segments were manually distended without pressure control and six were not distended. The mechanical test was performed as a ramp inflation using syringe pump. The vein dimensions were obtained from digitised images at different pressures as well as at the no-load and zero-stress states. The circumferences, the wall and lumen area, the wall thickness, and the outer diameter as function of the applied pressure were largest in the segments with uncontrolled manual distension compared to those without distension (P<0.05). The opening angle and the absolute value of the residual strains were lower (P<0.01) and the circumferential stress–strain curve shifted to the left, indicating the wall became stiffer with uncontrolled manual distension compared to those without distension (P<0.05). In conclusion, manual pressure distension changed the morphometric and biomechanical properties of the saphenous vein. The perspective is that studies on biomechanical properties on the saphenous vein may guide surgeons how to handle graft material without causing major changes of the biomechanical properties during harvesting and preparation.

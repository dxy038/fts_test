Background and objective: This study has been conducted with the goal of established a normal reference range for peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in healthy Iranian adults, among 20-40 age that lived in Tehran.

Materials and methods: This study has been conducted as a cross-sectional study, so 221 health Iranian adults with 20-40 age has been selected using random selection. Samples selected using Cluster selection. We selected any random inclusion criteria having healthy Iranian adaults up to the sample size that we needed. The information has obtained, using interviews, peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets data.

Results: Mean age of the study population in the study was 28.74±6.193 years. Males were 29.07±6.140 and women 28.42±6.255 years. Mean CD3 in males was 69.69±7.377 percentage and women 72.10±7.540 percentage, which did show significant difference (p=0.017). Mean CD 19 in males was 13.46±5.085 percentage and women 12.11±3.895 percentage, which did show significant difference (p=0.028). Mean CD4 in males was 39.48±6.592 percentage and women 42.56±8.699 percentage, which did show significant difference (p=0.003).

Conclusion: We recommended the further study, establishe a normal reference range for peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in a multiracial adult Iranian population and evaluated influence environmental, geographic factors in different Iranian population. Also to establish their own reference ranges as these may have important implications for the management of patients with human immunodeficiency virus and AIDS.

The installation error produced during the arrangement of coil system has important influences on the uniformity of magnetic fields in the desired area. It has been the very considerable difficulty encountered in the past in attempting the numerical solution of the equations involved, especially a region under coil systems, and little study related the installation error was discussed. The paper considers the deviation degree of uniform magnetic field of the region given as the objective function and uses differential evolution algorithm to search the deviation range of coil systems parameters given to make the objective function reach the optimum. The result shows that the problem of research the variation of magnetic fields uniform degree caused by the arrangement error of rectangle coil systems can be solved effectively with differential evolution algorithm.

A feeling of use of cosmetics is judged generally by the various sensitivity of the user. Physiological indices regarding a feeling of use of cosmetics have been measured and analyzed to achieve objective interpretation of the feeling. However, a poor robustness of physiological indices itself might have caused problems. The objective of the present study has been the objective evaluation of a feeling of use of cosmetics by autonomous nervous system activity. Correlation between sensory preference and autonomous nervous system activity when using cosmetic emulsions has been analyzed. A preference for cosmetic emulsions in viscosity and fragrance has been characterized by psychophysiological aspect. As a result, sympathetic nervous activity has been increased and parasympathetic nervous activity has been decreased on estimating fragrant low-viscosity sample with corresponding preference bias to the sample on sensory evaluation.

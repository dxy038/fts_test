The article studies on the application of genetic simulated annealing algorithm in power distribution network reconfiguration. Taking the minimum loss of distribution network as an objective function, the individuals that can not meet the load constraint conditions during reconfiguration will be introduced as penalty functions into the objective function. According to the characteristics of power distribution network, make improvements to fitness function, crossover and mutation in genetic algorithms. Carry out a research on the replication strategy of Metropolis Criteria in simulated annealing algorithm and finally prove the feasibility and validity of this algorithm via a typical example.

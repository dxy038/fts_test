Objective: Periodic alternating nystagmus has been associated with the instability of the velocity storage mechanism, which is known to play an important role in both the vestibulo-oculomotor and the optokinetic systems. In the present study we looked for a possible spinal equivalent to PAN.
Methods and results: In 3 PAN patients, the H-reflex amplitude proved to be slightly but significantly influenced by nystagmus direction, in that it was greater when the nystagmus was beating toward the stimulation side.
Conclusions: This finding suggests that projections from velocity storage may play a role not only in the ocular motor but also in assisting postural stability through the vestibulo-spinal system.

The general issues of designing the hybrid intelligent control systems based on rational combination of different knowledge processing technologies is discussed. The principles of structural construction of such systems are considered. A general approach to design of hierarchical intelligent control systems, based on the expert estimation of complexity of control object, its environment, control objective and subsequent determination of specifications to different control levels of the systems, is proposed. The example of design of hybrid intelligent system for control of autonomous mobile vehicle in the conditions of uncertainty is presented

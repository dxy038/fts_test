A time domain boundary element method (TDBEM) provides us another possibility for microwave simulation in addition to a time domain finite difference (FDTD) method. The time domain boundary element method has advantages in treatments of open boundary problems, coupling problems with a charged particle motion, etc. On the other hand, the time domain boundary element method has problems of numerical instability in long time range simulation and very large memory requirement. In particular, the numerical instability of the time domain boundary element method mainly comes from interior resonance in an open boundary formulation. In this paper, three-dimensional time domain boundary element method employing an initial value problem formulation is presented to avoid the instability caused by the interior resonance.

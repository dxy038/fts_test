Objective (s): Existing data show a considerable prevalence of non communicable diseases risk factors and their rising trend in our country. Unhealthy nutrition is an important underlying factor for mentioned diseases. Considering the necessity of understanding the underlying factors of a healthy nutrition from the perspective of society members and lack of related studies from Iran, the current study investigates perceptions and experiences of Tehranian men who are participating in Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). 
Methods: This is a qualitative study, conducted according to the grounded theory approach. In total 8 semi-structured focus group discussions were conducted in TLGS unit, during 2008 to 2009. Participants were 96 men, aged 25-65 years, who were selected and recruited in the current study from the fourth phase of TLGS. All interviews and focus group discussions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data collection and analysis were done simultaneously according to the Strauss and Corbin analysis method. 
Results: Based on content analysis of data, barriers to a healthy nutrition are “inefficient education”, “behavioral models”,” lack of access”, “women’s role” and “personal taste and interest” .
Conclusion: Study results demonstrated the main barriers for a healthy nutrition as perceived by men, barriers that any effective interventions require to address for tackling non-communicable diseases in Tehranian families.

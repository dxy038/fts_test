The medical diagnosis process can be interpreted as a decision making process, during which the physician induces the diagnosis of a new and unknown case from an available set of clinical data and from his/her clinical experience. This process can be computerized in order to present medical diagnostic procedures in a rational, objective, accurate and fast way. This paper presents a decision support system for heart disease classification based on support vector machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) with three layers is employed to develop a decision support system for the diagnosis of heart disease. The multilayer perceptron neural network is trained by back-propagation algorithm which is computationally efficient method. Results obtained show that a MLPNN with back-propagation can be successfully used for diagnosing heart disease than support vector machine.

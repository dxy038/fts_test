Corrosion is recognized as one of the most significant reliability concerns. The main objective of the program was to conduct a controlled field study aimed at examining the long-term effects of a worst case operating environment on the performance of power connector systems. It was established that connector life was determined largely by connector design and that loss of mechanical contact load at conductor-connector interfaces, due to corrosion and corrosion product buildup, was a major factor controlling connector life. The results showed that the fired-wedge connectors had the most reliable performance whereas the compression and bolted connectors performed less well under the field exposure conditions

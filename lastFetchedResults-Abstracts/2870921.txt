The Distributed Energy System (DES), with energy cascading utilization, high total energy efficiency and environment-friendly characteristics, is developed as a novel and vibrant energy supply way around the world in recent years. In the whole energy conversion process of DES, there are certain links among the heat, water and pollutants. In order to minimum the usage of fresh water, utilities and primary energy, in this paper, the multi-objective pinch analysis (MOPA) method is introduced. The analysis framework of the MOPA is described systematically, and a case study is used to demonstrate the application procedure.

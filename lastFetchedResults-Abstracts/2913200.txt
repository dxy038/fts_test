The paper presents four adaptive strategies for knowledge-based front-ends (KBFEs). These strategies aim to contour the behaviour of a front-end system by acquiring information about the userÂ´s abilities and knowledge. The prototype program incorporating these strategies, Telos, is an adaptive front-end for the NAg FORTRAN Library. This library is contain over 740 numerical and statistical subroutines (algorithms). The four adaptive strategies are: (1) user stereotyping; (2) adaptive terminology; (3) objective qualifications; and (4) context-sensitive examples

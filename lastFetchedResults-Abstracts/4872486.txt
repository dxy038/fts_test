The aim of this paper is to propose a robust approach to the development of supervisory control strategies for hybrid-electric drivetrains. The objective is to determine an output feedback controller that minimize fuel consumption with respect to a family of possible torque/power input profiles, e.g. urban driving cycles. A quasi-static energy model for the hybrid vehicle, based on a Willans lines model of the IC engine and electric motor, is derived. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a robust controller satisfying stability, L<sub>2</sub> gain attenuation between inputs and outputs of interest, and input/output bound constraints are derived by means of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

The oil content of the wax produced in a dewaxing process is the key economic parameter that
should be reduced as much as possible. Some factors such as the type of solvents, cooling rate,
temperature, and solvent to oil ratio influence the dewaxing process. Due to the fact that crude oil
differs from place to place and since the operational conditions for wax extraction vary for different
types of crude oil, the objective of this work is to study the operational conditions for wax
production from an Iranian raffinate sample used in Sepahan Oil Company. All the experiments are
conducted based on a design of experiment (DOE) technique for minimizing the oil content of the
wax produced. The effects of five factors have been determined quantitatively and appropriate levels
are suggested for reducing the oil content. The results show that the solvent ratio, solvent
composition, and cooling rate play the most important role in minimizing the oil content of the
produced wax.

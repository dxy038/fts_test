Objective: The aim of the study was to see the effectiveness of intracavernosal injection of PGE1( alpha-cd, alprostadil alphadex).Material and Methods: This study was conducted at Riyadh Care Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from September 2003 to July 2004, on 18 patients with erectile dysfunction according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary aetiology and contributing factors for erectile dysfunction were noted. Each patient had intracavernous injections of Alprostadil Alphadex (Prostaglandin E,) starting from minimum 2.5ug to maximum 20ug during titration period in the office. All injections were given on separate occasions, at least one week apart. The patient massaged himself for few second after the injection to help to disperse the drug. Patients were observed for at least thirty minutes following the injection. Vital signs of the patient were measured by the doctor.Results: Out of 18 patients 10 (55.6%) were having psycogenic type of dysfunction with mean duration of erectile dysfunction (ED) as 5.6 years while 8 (44.4%) patients had organic type of ED with mean duration of ED of 4.8 years. Half of the patients reported grade 3 erections which were sufficient for successful sexual intercourse with no serious adverse effects except severe penile pain in two patients. No patients develop priapism. Two patients were non compliant. Six out of eighteen left after titration because of lack of efficacy for Alprostadil Alphadex. Eight out of eighteen patients went into period 2 (at home). All these patients reported Grade 3 erections, which were sufficient for sexual intercourse with no adverse effects. Alterations in penile rigidity were noted.Conclusion: Intracavernosal alprostadil alphadex injection is an effective, well-tolerated and safe therapy for both psychogenic and organic erectile dysfunction.

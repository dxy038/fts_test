Cost of Quality is a process-based method of finding costs. The main objective of this method is to make an equilibrium between preventive costs, quality assurance cost and cost of poor quality.  EFQM is known as a well-known method of organization excellence models.  Using its nine criteria, EFQM is a perfect tool for organizations. In this paper, we will consider EFQM criteria and cost of quality and the relationship between them. We will consider a case study (Mirab Company) and illustrate that there is a relationship between EFQM and COQ. Then, the results of the questionnaire administered to 1300 EFQM evaluators will be presented. The respondents were asked whether they agree with the relationship between EFQM and COQ or not. The findings confirmed that there is a relationship between all EFQM criteria and EFQM.

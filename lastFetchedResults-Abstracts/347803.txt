Objective: Our primary aim in the present study was to establish the anatomic and psychophysiological correlates of automatic and controlled semantic priming.
Methods: Current sources were calculated on N400 component data from a previous study on lexical decision tasks [Clin Neurophysiol 1999;110:813] using the variable resolution electromagnetic tomography method (VARETA). In this study, two experiments were carried out, one using directly related pairs and the other one using mediated related pairs. Each experiment consisted of 3 tasks that required different levels of contribution from controlled processes.
Results: Average source localization images showed the brain structures involved in lexical decision tasks. The automatic component of the N400 effect was related to activation of occipitotemporal and parahippocampal gyri and anterior temporal lobes bilaterally. The expectancy strategy was related to activation of the right posterior temporal and right frontal areas. The postlexical strategy was associated with activation of right frontal, anterior cingulate and bilateral superior parietal areas.
Conclusions: The findings indicated that the current sources of the N400 varied according to the relative contributions of automatic and controlled mechanisms. Moreover, the sources of the N400 effect depended on the type of strategy used.

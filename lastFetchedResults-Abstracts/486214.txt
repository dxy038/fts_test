Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for path planning of redundant manipulators. The idea is to use load distribution as an objective function for resolving kinematic redundancy. The method is based on imposing a set of convenient relation among joint torques as dynamic constraints to system. Two algorithms for path planning of redundant manipulators subject to dynamic constraints are proposed. The first algorithm takes advantage of all necessary dynamic constraint equations which can be approximately solved using a pseudo-inverse technique, whereas the second algorithm is based on finding a good starting point with fair load distribution and generate the path by imposing as many dynamic constraint equations as the number of degrees of redundancy. The results for path planning of a 3-DOF planar manipulator using this method are presenteded.

This paper puts forward an adaptive traffic signal control algorithm for intersections group, which is believed to make real-time signal control and yield a lot of traffic light switching schemes according to the changing of traffic conditions. The principle of the algorithm is to minimize some objective function derived from a real-time queue length mode that has been initiated in the paper, of which the character is an optimization over a fixed number of switch-overs but not a fixed number of time steps. The performance of the algorithm is proven to improve the intersection capacity by reducing the waiting time of vehicles

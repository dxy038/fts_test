This paper presents the synergetic control approach for induction motor speed control using indirect vector control. Synergetic control theory has several advantages: it is well suited for digital control purpose and it operates at constant switching frequency, which simplifies filtering design, and reduces chattering, while maintaining the intrinsic robust features of sliding mode control. To verify the performance characteristics of this synergetic control scheme, we compare it with two other control schemes such as integral sliding mode control and fuzzy sliding mode control, a fuzzy logic variant of sliding mode control, developed with the objective of reducing the torque chattering problem. Finally, the effectiveness of this control scheme for robust AC servo drive system is confirmed through simulation in the C language.

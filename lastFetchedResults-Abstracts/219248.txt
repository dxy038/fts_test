Objective- To consider the possibility of ultrasonography evaluation of the plantar tendons
and ligaments and prepare a standard reference for it.
Design- Descriptive study
Animals- 7 female healthy Caspian miniature horses'-age 7year- no clinical sign of lameness
and prior to presentation.
Procedure- The ultrasonography of the right and the left metatarsal region was performed
using a Pie Medical 100 Falco Vet and an 8MHZ linear transducer. The area for
ultrasonography was divided to 9 levels (1a-1b-2a-2b-3a-3b-4a-4b-5a), each 3 cm long
afterwards.
Results- All the structures started to appear with an acceptable contrast and visibility at the 2a
level. SDFT and DDFT were well observed from the level 2a however, no definite borders
were recognizable as ICL (except one case) and echogenicity of DDFT from the 2b level was
hyperechoic to isoechoic comparing SDFT and SL from this level observed the branching area was hyperechoic in compare with DDFT & SDFT, however MSL & LSL were hypoechoic
comparing SDFT and DDFT.
There aren't any difference echogenicity between right and left hind limb.
Conclusion and Clinical Relevance- Investigations have proved that there's no difference
between the echogenicity of each ligament and tendon in different levels in the left and right
limbs which was confirmed in the current inspection as well
The conclusions of the current study on the Caspian horse were showen too that highly
compatible with the previous vestigations in horses on echogenicity and shape of the plantar
tendons and ligaments. Generally it is assumed that transverse images provide a better image of
tendons and ligaments and any injury in any part of the above structures can be diagnosed
easily, however some probable injuries around the tendon may be left unseen in longitudinal
images.

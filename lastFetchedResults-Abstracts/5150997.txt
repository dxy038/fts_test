In this paper, we propose a global model for WiMAX networks planning. This model consists in solving, in one shot, the network planning problem without dividing it in several subproblems. The objective of the model is to minimize the cost of the network while maximizing its survivability. The results show that the proposed model performs up to 40% better than the sequential one, which consists on solving the subproblems sequentially.

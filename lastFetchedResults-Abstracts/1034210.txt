The main objective of the paper is to present a methodology of eco-designing of multi-layer composites using a design of conveyor belts as an example. In the present article, the methodology of designing of multilayer conveyor belts has been shown, experimental results of strength of designed belts have been presented, the eco-indicator 99 according to the SimaPro 5 methodology has been calculated and the methodology of optimisation of strength properties regarding various belts and their impact on the environment during the entire product life cycle has been presented. Changing physical and mechanical properties of layers constitute belt results in changing of rigidity and flexibility of the belt, which determine required exploitation properties of the belt. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, the pressure on the environment might be evaluated with respect to the category of human health, resources and quality of ecosystem. Defining objective function (selection criteria) allows to optimise the mechanical strength of the composite being taken into account and also its impact on environment using the life cycle assessment.

Background and Objective: Appetite monitoring influecnces obesity process. Acylated Ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide that plays an important role in weight controlling and energy homeostatis. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of one cycle circuit resistance training program on plasma acylated ghrelin, insulin and growth hormone in overweight 17-20 year old males. 
Materials and Methods: Twenty male students with  age 18±0.92 years old, height 174.5±5.07 cm, weight 83.57±5.62 kg and BMI 27.48±1.5 kg/m2 (mean ± SE) were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. Subjects performed circuit-resistance training protocol with 60% 1RM for 12 weeks. The levels of plasma Acylated ghrelin, insulin and growth hormone, were measured by ELISA method before and after 12 weeks. 
Results: The results revealed no significant differences in body weight, BMI and insulin level (P=0.83), whereas acylated ghrelin (P=0.02) and growth hormone (P=0.04) increased significantly in the plasma. A significant positive correlation (r=0.58) was found between plasma acylated ghrelin and GH (P < 0.05). 
Conclusion: It seems that circuit resistance training induces depletion of body energy storage .This issue leads to increase in secration of acylated ghrelin stimulating food intake behavior and  compensating for lost energy sources and eventually restoring the body’s energy balance.

As a result of going behind tradition and criticizing its foundations and based upon objective and subjective elements established through centuries, modern rationality has determined a special kind of life-style, an important feature of it is the technical dominance of man over the nature.
Some thinkers like Heidegger (1889-1976) thought that technology had risen out of foundations of the western world-view. Thus, he thinks that it is impossible to achieve the human and sublime goals through philosophical content of technology (essentialism). Karl Popper (1902-1994), at the other side, refuses the essentialism and insists upon the instrumental feature of technology. The analysis of modern media as a kind of technology which has its own affection on world public opinion with taking into account the semiotic various levels gets us beyond this challenge.

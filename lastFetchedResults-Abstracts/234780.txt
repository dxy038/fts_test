The objective of this study is to develop a design support system for effective planning of the integrated workplace performance. The current workplace planning process was analyzed, and lighting fixture and diffuser types were categorized by surveying several office buildings. The concept of an integrated workplace planning module is proposed, and its development procedure is based on the current planning process. Various lighting planning modules and mechanical planning modules are developed by visual and thermal environment simulation. After considering the layout of other mechanical equipments, an integrated workplace planning module, which satisfies the visual and thermal comfort criteria, was developed for various architectural modules. By using this integrated workplace planning module, workplace planners can easily evaluate how their architectural planning decisions will affect the visual and thermal environment in the early stage of architectural design to achieve the more efficient design work.

In this study, we implement a device simulation-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) for the optimal design of silicon solar cells. The short-circuited current, the open-circuited voltage, and the conversion efficiency are calculated and used to evaluate the fitness score and access the evolutionary quality of designing parameters via the implemented non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm in the unified optimization framework. Designing parameters, the material and structural parameters are simultaneously optimized for the explored solar cells. Our device simulation-based MOEA methodology is useful, compared with the conventional genetic algorithm, in the solar cell design optimization.

In this paper we present a new approach for using semantic web technologies in modeling and simulation. In recent years ontologies have been used popularly in many fields to represent and structure their concepts. This work is an attempt to create a specific ontology for the process oriented discrete event simulation domain. The ontology instances represent the model instances. This instance described in XML format and then transformed to another form that is used to generate the simulation code via XSLT rules. The code is generated according to the open source library Japrosim. The objective of this work is to enhance interoperability and automation of the transition from the ontology to the code execution.

We have recently proposed lipid peroxidation as a unifying mechanistic pathway by which several seemingly unrelated risk/protective factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, oophorectomy/hysterectomy, parity, antioxidants) affect renal cell carcinoma development. In experimental studies, increased lipid peroxidation is a principal mechanistic pathway in renal carcinogenesis induced by different chemicals. In this communication, we provide additional lines of evidence that further support a role for lipid peroxidation on renal cell cancer development. (1) Lipid peroxidation may explain the role of other risk (analgesic use, pre-eclampsia) or protective (alcohol intake, oral contraceptives) factors for renal cell carcinoma. (2) Additional experimental evidence supports lipid peroxidation as an important mechanism in renal carcinogenesis, and (3) Existing evidence support a cross-talk between the lipid peroxidation pathway and other pathways that are relevant to renal carcinogenesis, such as apoptosis, VHL, and possibly other pathways.

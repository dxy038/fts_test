Objective: to determine a possible relation between different known medical risk factors for deep vein thrombosis and location of thrombus. Material and methods: we included consecutive patients diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis by the use of Doppler ultrasonography. Symptoms and signs, biochemical parameters and imagistic data were recorded and the presence or absence of comorbidities was noted. Results: a number of 192 patients were included in study. In univariate analysis, location of deep vein thrombosis was associated with age, immobility and unilateral calf edema. The multivariate analysis demonstrated the independent relation between location of thrombus and age (p=0.044), sex (p=0.014) and immobility (p=0.028). Conclusion: age, sex and immobility were correlated with location of deep vein thrombosis.

The job shop scheduling problem (JSP) is well known as one of the most complicated combinatorial optimization
problems, and it is a NP-hard problem. Memetic algorithm (MA) which combines the global
search and local search is a hybrid evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, an efficient MA with a novel local
search is proposed to solve the JSP. Within the local search, a systematic change of the neighborhood is
carried out to avoid trapping into local optimal. And two neighborhood structures are designed by
exchanging and inserting based on the critical path. The objective of minimizing makespan is considered
while satisfying a number of hard constraints. The computational results obtained in experiments demonstrate
that the efficiency of the proposed MA is significantly superior to the other reported approaches
in the literature.

to find the best compromising design of intake manifold for a 3-cylinder engine considering mean
value of torque, torque at 3500 rpm, mean value of brake mean specific consumption (BSFC) and
BSFC at 3500 rpmas four objective functions. To calculate the objective functions, engine simulation
is carried out using GT-SUITE software. The engine simulation code (ESC) is built from experimental
combustion pressure data which come from engine test bench. Results of such simulations are then
used to perform TOPSIS and some design points are obtained considering similar values for the
objective functions weights. Due to high value of torque and low value of BSFC one of the obtained
designs is selected as the best compromising design. To evaluate performance of the selected design,
the flow rate is completely investigated experimentally and numerically. Results show that the flow is
distributed in three runners as uniform, so that the maximum difference of flow rate is 0.49% which
means the uniform air charging for all the three cylinders. Also, good compatibiliy is found between
the CFD and experimenal results from flow rate point of view.

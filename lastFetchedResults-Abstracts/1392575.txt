For the characterization of structure-borne sound sources with multi-point or continuous interfaces, substantial simplifications and physical insight can be obtained by incorporating the concept of interface mobilities. The applicability of interface mobilities, however, relies upon the admissibility of neglecting the so-called cross-order terms. Hence, the objective of the present paper is to clarify the importance and significance of cross-order terms for the characterization of vibrational sources. From previous studies, four conditions have been identified for which the cross-order terms can become more influential. Such are non-circular interface geometries, structures with distinctively differing transfer paths as well as a suppression of the zero-order motion and cases where the contact forces are either in phase or out of phase. In a theoretical study, the former four conditions are investigated regarding the frequency range and magnitude of a possible strengthening of the cross-order terms. For an experimental analysis, two sourceâ€“receiver installations are selected, suitably designed to obtain strong cross-order terms. The transmitted power and the source descriptors are predicted by the approximations of the interface mobility approach and compared with the complete calculations. Neglecting the cross-order terms can result in large misinterpretations at certain frequencies. On average, however, the cross-order terms are found to be insignificant and can be neglected with good approximation. The general applicability of interface mobilities for structure-borne sound source characterization and the description of the transmission process thereby is confirmed.

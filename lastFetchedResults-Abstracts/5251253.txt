Disturbance-utilizing-control (DUC) theory, one branch of the general theory of disturbance-accommodating control (DAC), provides a method for designing feedback controllers which automatically detect and maximize any assistance that disturbances may provide in accomplishing the primary control objective. The authors investigate the application of DUC theory to linear time-invariant plants with bounded control and nonquadratic performance indices. In particular, performance indices of the time-optimal and weighted-time-and-fuel type are investigated, and several numerical examples are worked out.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

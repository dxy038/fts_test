This paper proposes a line search numerical algorithm for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) in Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS). The algorithm maximizes the captured power objective function constructed via a mechanical acceleration estimator with no wind speed measurement necessary. Simulation results are included with varying wind profile, speed and air density to compare the proposed algorithm with the common k&#969;<sup>2</sup> feedback controller.

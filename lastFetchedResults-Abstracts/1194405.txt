Terminal boxes are one of the major building HVAC components and directly impact building room comfort and energy costs. Current terminal boxes may cause occupant discomfort and waste energy if they have inappropriate operation control functions. The objective of this study is to develop and implement applicable terminal box control algorithms. The thermal conditions and energy consumption are compared between conventional and improved control algorithms using measured data. The results of this study show that improved terminal box control algorithms can stably maintain the room air temperature and reduce energy consumption compared to conventional control algorithms.

The objective of this paper is to apply a heat and moisture transfer model in association with a proposed mathematical method to accurately predict moisture generation rates and to study the effects on the indoor moisture levels of different moisture generation rate patterns in buildings. The model is validated by a real test house. Result shows that a good estimation of the transient moisture generation rate can be obtained from the knowledge of the measured indoor moisture contents and the resultant effect on indoor moisture level of different indoor moisture generation rate patterns is normally negligible.

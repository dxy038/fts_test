Nowadays, different power generation strategies for grid-connected systems can be found, ranging from single high power plants (tens and hundreds of MW), to thousands of small wattage (below 1 kW) micro-generators. This paper studies a new power topology for the latter, based on a bidirectional Flyback converter. The comparison with the standard topology for this kind of converters is carried out, and the constraints for the control scheme are also studied.

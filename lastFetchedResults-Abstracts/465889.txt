Objective: The aim of this study was to determine which factors in the perioperative period influence the success of endometrial ablation in alleviating menorrhagia. Study Design: We performed a retrospective chart review of 120 women aged 27 to 49 years who underwent endometrial ablation after 2 months of preoperative treatment with danazol (Danocrine, 800 mg/d orally) or leuprolide (Lupron, 3.75 mg in one intramuscular injection each month). Patients who required medical management or additional operations to control the vaginal bleeding during follow-up (median follow-up, 37 weeks) were considered to have ablation failures. Results: Sixty-three percent of patients (76/120) had a successful procedure. The chance of success was greater if a cavity of normal appearance was found (odds ratio, 2.3; P = .04). The finding of an intramural fibroid before the procedure resulted in a reduced trend toward success (odds ratio, 0.4; P = .06). The use of danazol pretreatment improved the rate of success overall (odds ratio, 2.2; P = .05) and especially among women <40 years old (P = .01) Conclusion: Perioperative findings may provide useful information in counseling patients regarding endometrial ablation. Success is greater among patients with a normal intrauterine cavity and after preoperative treatment with danazol. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:1005-7.)

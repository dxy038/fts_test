This paper is one of a series prepared for use in Current Operating Problems (COPÂ´s) forums for the purpose of focusing the attention of industry on high priority problems faced by those who are involved in the actual operation of power systems. Five short note reports provide definition and discussion of problem areas of operator training. They are (1) evaluation of the training program, (2) limitations of dispatcher training simulators that are now in use, (3) problems of accurately modeling the dynamic response of the power system, (4) special needs of utilities with decentralized dispatching, and (5) new developments for next generation operator training simulators and the problems to be solved. These reports are intended to clarify the problems and concerns. The objective of the COPs forum is to communicate ideas, solicit discussion and stimulate others to devise responsive solutions to these problems.

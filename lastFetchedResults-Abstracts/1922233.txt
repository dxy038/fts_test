Brugada type 1 electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern occurs in 0.2% of Filipinos. A knowledge gap exists on the natural course of asymptomatic patients with Brugada type 1 ECG pattern. Most studies that reported cohort event rates were taken from hospitals or referral centers. This is the first cohort from an entire country where the subjects were selected randomly. The objective of this study was to describe the frequency of cardiac events at 4 and 6 years of 7 patients with Brugada type 1 ECG pattern of 3,907 patients previously screened from the general population of the Philippines during the National Nutrition and Health Survey. Personal interviews at year 4 using a structured questionnaire were conducted by 1 of the investigators. Occurrences of major (syncope, seizure, unexplained accidents, sudden death) and minor events in subjects and their first- and second-degree relatives were elicited. Six-year follow-up by text messaging was conducted to ascertain vital status and occurrence of cardiac events. All 7 patients with Brugada type 1 ECG pattern were men. Three of the 7 initially asymptomatic subjects (43%, 95 confidence interval 6 to 80) developed a major cardiac event by the fourth year. Those with events were younger than those without events. All 7 were alive by the sixth year. No additional events were noted between the fourth and sixth years. In conclusion, cardiac events are considerable in initially asymptomatic Filipinos with Brugada type 1 ECG pattern.

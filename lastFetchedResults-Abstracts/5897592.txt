This paper deals with down link throughput maximization of a cellular system, using joint power/modulation adaptation. The paper first considers a known local search method for maximizing actual aggregate throughput. Then, using a cut-off parameter for SINR, the paper proposes a new objective function which approximates the actual aggregate throughput. It also proposes a new iterative method for maximization of new objective function. The performance of the proposed method for maximization of new objective function is addressed through computer simulations under different loading conditions. Simulation results show that our method and objective function give better results than those published before.

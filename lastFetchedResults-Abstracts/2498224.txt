Background: Plantago australis Lam. is a plant native to southern Brazil largely used to reduce inflammation and improve the
healing process. Interestingly, though, there are no previous studies evaluating the cytotoxicity of its ethanolic extract.
Objectives: The main objective is to assess in vitro the cytotoxicity of the crude ethanolic extract of P. australis at different concentrations.
Materials and Methods: The MTT cytotoxicity assay was performed on a 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line to measure the in vitro cytotoxic
activity of the crude formulation.
Results: In vitro analysis showed that the greater the concentration of the extract, the greater the cytotoxicity.
Conclusions: The crude extract of P. australis might be cytotoxic at high concentrations as evaluated against the cell line.

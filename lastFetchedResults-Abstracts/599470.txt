Teaching Mathematics to intermediate school boys is a challenging process which can greatly benefit from software technology and web-based learning. In this research we study the difficulties and opportunities of using this technology in teaching Mathematics to 13 year old boys studying Mathematics at school. For students' we identify the basic requirements at home, e.g., Mathematics computer software packages, availability of internet access and ability of the parents to provide computers, software and the internet for their sons. We assess the expected improvement in grades, motivation and communication between home and school. For the teaches', we assess the expected improvement in teachers' productivity, teachers' experience, qualifications in computing and Mathematics packages and their anticipated expectations such as improvement in problem solving, grades of students. Our main objective is to determine the expected results resulting from applying computer software and web-based learning in teaching Mathematics.

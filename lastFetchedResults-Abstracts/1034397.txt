This work focuses on the development of an applied methodology for the research of bionics performed at the Nucleus of Design and Selection of Materials (NdSM), Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The proposed methodology is divided in stages, and each stage provides a description of the techniques and the procedures adopted, providing designers and professionals of the area with an objective understanding and a logical organization of knowledge, thus facilitating the use of bionics in the design of new products.

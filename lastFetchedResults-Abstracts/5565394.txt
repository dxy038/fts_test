Wafer fabrication (Fab) is a typical large-scale complicated manufacturing system. With the enhancement of modern Fab´s automation, one of important techniques is to determine lot priority index to meet multiple objectives. Usually different objectives may be paid diverse emphases which are represented by weights. In today´s highly dynamic manufacturing environment, weights of each individual objective may change along with time, and corresponding scheduling may be regarded as the time-variable-multiple-objectives (TVMO) scheduling. The proposed TVMO algorithm presents a practical and useful way to find out trade-off between better optimality for computation, which is essential for real-time response to changes in Foundry fab.

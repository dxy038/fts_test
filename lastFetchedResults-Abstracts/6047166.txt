Objective To evaluate the feasibility of applying low contrast medium volume in cervicocranial artery angiography with 256-slice CT. Materials and methods 30 patients undergoing cervicocranial artery CTA were enrolled into this study, and the patients were injected with low contrast medium volume (50 mL). Results the mean enhancement of the total segments was (292.50&#177;80.70) HU. About 7 of 330 (97.88%) segments had enhancement &#8805;150HU which could be optimal for diagnosis. Conclusion Cervicocranial artery angiography with 256-slice CT can reduce contrast medium volume (33.3%).

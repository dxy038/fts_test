The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology is employed in the open-pit mine slope detection system. When the open-pit mine slope is found abnormal, the WSN transmit data to the monitors timely in case of the unnecessary losses. Quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) is used in the multi-objective optimization problem of slope detection with WSN. ItÂ´s for designing networking strategy of slope detection system. Appropriate encoding mechanism is worked out. Combining with various important parameters, the fitness function is established. Simulation results show: Energy management is optimized with the WSN base on QGA and guarantee maximum life span of the network.

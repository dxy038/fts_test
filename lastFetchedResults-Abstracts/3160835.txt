Learning and memory, which are important functions of the human brain, are the foundations of thinking. Revealing the learning and memory mechanism of human brain is the core objective and main development way of the intelligent science. Improved human brain functional structure model, a memory prediction structural framework on the brain structure and function are proposed. And then we work out a human brain learning and memory algebraic method based on the proposed framework, and offer a reasonable interpretation of the learning and memory mechanism of human brain. This framework provides a formalization method for the study of human brain functional structure and the establishment of image thinking reasoning system.

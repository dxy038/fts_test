This paper reports a bidirectional thermoelectric energy generator (TEG) with double type lenses for concentrating solar power. When solar power was applied to the TEG, solar energy is concentrated by PMMA lens firstly. The concentrated energy is absorbed as heat energy through phase-change of phase change material (PCM). And then, the liquid PCM lens focuses energy on the TEG. After removing energy source, the latent heat in PCM is released. Therefore, the proposed TEG generates energy steadily.

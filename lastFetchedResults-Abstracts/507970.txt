One of the most important subjects of Islamic educational system is invitation to thinking which is man's "accepted differentia", and by which humanity is characterized. This ability is the origin of knowledge and also a source for man's different actions. When it comes to Islam's education system, the subject of 'thought' (or reason) has not been left or abandoned in an absolute way; rather, continuous efforts have been made to throw light on the importance of promoting and nurturing of thought.

This article aims to explain, through Quranic verses and narratives of the Infallibles (a.s.), subjects such as description, conditions, sources, consequences, and obstacles of thought and thinking. In this study, an effort has been made to investigate and ascertain, on the basis of Islamic doctrines, the status of thought in an Islamic system of education. For this purpose, it has been explained that in Islamic educational system, thinking is characterized by three prominent features: capability development, extensiveness of application and vulnerability. The main factors through which intellectual development is achieved are: isolation, external and objective journey, reason-seeking, meaningful silence, paying heed to different viewpoints, good ethics and food control. Also the obstacles to thinking are: hurriedness, acting upon ignorant beliefs, blind imitation, personality-bias, arrogance and carnal desires. At the end of this article, themes and sources related to the subject of the article have been introduced and also several suggestions have been presented to help acquaint teachers and stakeholders of education with the ways of nurturing and promoting thinking according to Islamic doctrines.

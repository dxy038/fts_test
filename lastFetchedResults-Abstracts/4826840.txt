The author first briefly reviews recent success of MOS gate power devices. The main objective is to predict, for the first time, the silicon limit characteristics of IGBTs for its on-resistance and SOA. The author also proposes ideal gate drive in order to realize the ultimate limit of high speed switching of MOS gate power devices. The results lead to new FOM, characterizing the high speed switching capability of various power devices

A very great effort has been done during the last decade on spreading the application of static power converters to power distribution lines. This paper shows work on new distribution line conditioners based on high frequency commutated active filtering. This work has been developed in the scope of a PIE project leadered by Iberdrola S.A. whose aim is the development of 25 kVA to 1000 kVA conditioners for low voltage three phase standard distribution lines. The objective of the project is to find power topologies with better performances than those of the classical conditioners, but with a lower cost than in the case of uninterruptible power supplies. A reconfigurable power topology has been chosen which normally works as a series voltage conditioner and a parallel current conditioner linked by a common DC bus. In case of a line outage, the current conditioner acts an an inverter which is able to feed 30% of the nominal load during 200 ms. It is considered that this short storage time can eliminate more than 90% of the line outages

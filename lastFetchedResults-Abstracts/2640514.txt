 Background Paraoxonase enzyme is attached to HDL and is involved
                            in the maturation of this lipoprotein. This enzyme is activated by
                            several antioxidants. These antioxidants exist in Winter cherry (
                            <i>Physalis alkekengi</i>). In fact, it contains a variety
                            of antioxidants. Objectives The objective of this study is to
                            investigate the effects of a hydro-alcoholic extract of winter cherry
                            fruits on serum lipid profile and paraoxanase1 (Pon1) activity in the
                            rat. Methods In this randomized experimental study, hydroalcoholic
                            extract of <i>Physalis alkekengi</i> fruits was obtained by
                            a percolation method. Four groups of male Sprague Dawley rats (260 +/- 5
                            g), each containing 7 animals, were housed separately and fed standard
                            rat chow and water ad libitum. Experiments were performed for 28 days on
                            each group. Group1 (control 1) received only the standard diet, with no
                            hydroalcoholic extract. Group 2 (control 2) received 1mL of water by
                            gavage in addition to the standard diet. Groups 3 (experiment 1) and 4
                            (experiment2) received, respectively, 200 and 400 mg /kg b.w. of the
                            extract in 1 mL of water through gavage. At the end of the experimental
                            period, animals were fasted overnight and lipid profile and paraoxonase
                            activity were determined and compared statistically by one way ANOVA and
                            Tukey post hoc tests, using SPSS version 11.5 Results Triglyceride,
                            total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were decreased dose dependently by
                            the extract. HDL cholesterol and serum paraoxonase activities were
                            increased significantly by Physalis extract. Conclusions The
                            hydroalcoholic extract of <i>Physalis alkekengi</i>,
                            possibly through the presence of antioxidants, increases paraoxonase
                            activity and this enzyme, in turn, augments the level of HDL in serum.

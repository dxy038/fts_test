In this paper we have introduce a novel hybrid method framework for feature extraction using genetic algorithms in Automatic Target Recognition. In this paper we have given a complete framework and approach for making the system of Automatic Target Recognition System we suggest the name of IVATRs (Intelligent Video Automatic Target Recognition System). This framework will be helpful for making a bridge between the theoretical models of AI techniques and their implementations with hardware. During this study our objective is to design a hybrid mechanism for the currently existing ATRs techniques. This study will also lead us to the result of predicting the behavior of targeted objects and future machines.

Lung  cancer  is  a  leading  cause  of  death  with  changing  trends  of  occurrence,  detection  and  treatment.  The objective  of  this  research  was  to  identify  impact  of  risk  factors  on  changing  trends  of  lung  cancer  in  a  case control  study. In  the  study  conducted  from  2006 to 2010  the  cases  included  newly  diagnosed  patients  of  histological  proven lung  carcinoma  attending  the  radiotherapy  department.  For  each  case,  one  control  was  identified  and  matched  with  same  sex,  age ± 5  years,  and  unmatched  for  residence,  smoking  status  and  socioeconomic  condition.  For  categorical  variables,  Chi  Square  and  Fisher’  test  and  for  numerical  variables  t  test  and  Mann  Whitney  tests  were  used.  All univariate analyses used ANOVA test.  Variables with   p  <  0•05 were entered in Cox proportional   hazards   regression   model. During  the  study  period  1524  cases  and  their  controls  were  accounted.  Change  in  trend  was  observed  in  patients  diagnosed  at  younger  age  of  57.48 ± 0.56 years  in  2010  with  adenocarcinoma   unlike  62.89 ± 1.21  years  in  2006.  Females  show  increase  in  incidence  of  lung  cancer  in  2010,  p value  <  0.001 .  The “active” smokers and years of smoking   were significantly high among cases.  The  incidence  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  declined  from 47.4%  in  2006  to  15%  in  2010  whereas  adenocarcinoma  increased,  p  value  0.001. Significant  change  in  trend  involving  younger  age  at  presentation  specially  for  female  who  also  show  increased  incidence  of  lung  cancer  has  been  observed.  This hypothesis needs confirmation through   further   studies.

Objective(s):Brucellosis, especially caused by Brucella melitensis, remains one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide with more than 500,000 human cases reported annually. The commonly used live attenuated vaccine in ovine brucellosis prophylaxis is B. melitensis Rev1. But due to different problems caused by the administration of this vaccine, a protective subunit vaccine against B. melitensis is strongly demanded. Brucella BP26, Omp31 and TF proteins have shown a considerable potential as protective antigens for brucellosis. Chimeric proteins carrying epitopes or adjuvant sequences increase the possibility of eliciting a broad cellular or humoral immune response. In silico tools are highly suited to study, design and evaluate vaccine strategies. Materials and Methods: In this study, a synthetic chimeric gene, encoding TF, BP26 93-111 and Omp3148-74 was designed.In order to predict the 3D structure of protein, modeling was carried out. Results:Validation results showed that 91.1% of residues lie in favored or additional allowed region of Ramachandran plot. The epitopes in the chimeric protein are likely to induce both the B-cell and T-cell mediated immune responses. Conclusion: The chimeric protein may be used as multi subunit for development of Brucella vaccine candidates.

In the grid-coding technique, the accurate grid junction
locations are vital to the surface computation. Noise arising from the
imaging formation and processing processes will jeopardize the computation
accuracy. The objective of this study is to make use of the
geometric property of cross ratio to improve the accuracy of grid junction
locations in grid-coded images. A method is devised to regenerate grid
junctions from the original (i.e., raw) junction data of an image. Through
a statistical error analysis, we show that the regenerated junction data
are generally more accurate than the old ones in the image taken from
a wide range of viewing angles.

In the process of evaluating the government performance, the model of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is one kind of effective quantitative analysis method, which may transform qualitative evaluation into quantitative conclusion scientifically and rationally. On the basis of conventional model, a weighted operator is established reasonably in this paper. The improved model makes the difference obviously between all influential factors of evaluation object. By the new model, the government can find effortlessly the cause of the question in evaluation object, and present objective measures for improving the government performance. A numerical example of the model improved is presented in the end. The computational results of the example validate the effectiveness of the model.

The fuzzy decision making technique is used to solve multiobjective topology optimization problems in this paper. Minimizing compliance and maximizing fundamental eigenvalue are two objectives pursued. Linear membership functions are used for material constraint as well as eigenvalue objective. The membership function for the objective of compliance is a nonlinear exponentially decaying function. Increasing the decaying rate puts more weight on the objective of compliance. The effect of different finite element types on the topology is also explored. A numerical example using two different types of finite elements is given to illustrate the approach.

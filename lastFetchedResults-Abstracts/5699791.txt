Information reuse and Integration (IRI) plays a pivotal role in the capture, representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information. Both information and knowledge are applied to enhance decision-making in various application domains. The objective of this paper is to provide a summary and analysis of research devoted to advancing the field of information reuse and integration. To this end, we identify the most popular research topics, together with the most productive researchers and institutions associated with the majority of research publications of the International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration during the past six years (2003-2008). Based on those publications, we have identified the most popular research topics, as well as the top researchers and institutions in the field of information reuse and integration.

Transistor sizing of sub-threshold standard cells for digital ultra-low power systems is a very challenging task because robustness has to be considered as an important design objective in addition to the competing resources power consumption and propagation delay. In this paper we regard this task as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) and show that the support of MOP algorithms is necessary and beneficial in the design process of sub-threshold CMOS logic standard cells. Optimization results are presented for an inverter, NAND gate, and NOR gate in a 65 nm process technology.

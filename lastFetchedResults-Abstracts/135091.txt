OBJECTIVE: Uterine activity in women with dysmenorrhea is abnormal. Vasopressin induces the contraction of myometrium and leads to dysmenorrhea. Water load is an important factor in lowering vasopressin level. This study was done to investigate about the effect of water load on intensity of primary dysmenorrhea.
METHODS: In two groups, intensity of dysmenorrhea at 0, 45, 90 and 120 minutes after onset of dysmenorrhea and during the first 8 hours in 59 women (18-25 years old) were measured. FINDINGS: In the case group (cycle with water load) the intensity of dysmenorrhea at 90th minute after starting of dysmenorrhea was significantly less than that in control group (cycle without water load). The rate of discomfort at the 45th and 90th minutes and duration of pain in the first 8 hours after starting of dysmenorrhea in case group was less than those in control group.
CONCLUSION: Physiologically water load decreases vasopressin followed by decreasing intensity of pain and discomfort. As a result, drinking more water is recommended to women with dysmenorrhea.

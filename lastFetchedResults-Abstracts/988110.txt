This paper presents a Markovian model for Flexible Manufacturing Systems
(FMSs). The model considers two features of automated 
exible manufacturing systems
equipped with the Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV), namely the reliability of machines
and the reliability of AGVs in a multiple AGV jobshop manufacturing system. Performance
measure is a critical factor used to judge the eectiveness of a manufacturing system. The
studies in the literature did not compare Markovian and neural networks, especially in
the reliability modeling of an advanced manufacturing system, considering AGVs. The
current methods for modeling the reliability of a system involve determination of system
state probabilities and transition states. Since the failure of the machines and AGVs could
be considered in dierent states, a Markovian model is proposed for reliability assessment.
Also, a neural network model is developed to point out the dierence in the accuracy of the
Markovian model in comparison with the neural network. The optimization objectives in
the proposed model are maximizing the total reliability of machines in shops in the whole
jobshop system and maximizing the total reliability of the AGVs. The multi-objective
mathematical model is optimized using an analytic hierarchy process.

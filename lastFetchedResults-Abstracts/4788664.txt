A next generation optical disk is required to have over 23 Gbyte recording capacity for over 2 hour storage of digital high-definition television (HDTV) data. Since track pitch becomes narrower for such a large capacity disk, a high resolution and high accuracy mastering system is required. To realize this objective, we have developed an electron beam recorder (EBR) and have been studying fabrication of master stampers for next generation optical disks and for future optical disks (Y. Kojima et al, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. vol. 37, p. 2137, 1998; Y. Wada et al, ibid., vol. 40, p. 1653, 2001). In this paper, we report an investigation of recording accuracy in the EBR and a trial for improvement.

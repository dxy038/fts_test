Nonlinear state feedback controllers are exhibited for locally stabilising linear discrete-time systems with both saturating actuators and additive disturbances when the output must track a certain time-varying reference level. The objective is to bring the steady-state error due to disturbances to zero by using a saturated controller and a dead-zone function. The objective is two-fold. To determine both a stabilising controller and a region of the state space over which the stability of the resulting closed-loop system is ensured, when the controls are allowed to saturate

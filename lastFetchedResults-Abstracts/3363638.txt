In this paper, an immune algorithm (IA) is developed for optimization of the harmonic performance of a three-phase inverter under the space-vector pulsewidth-modulation (SVPWM) control strategy. The presented algorithm employs the immune approach as the search method for finding the best optimal control vectors and action time of the three-phase inverter. As a result, the optimal control vectors and action time are calculated to minimize the objective function of the weighted total harmonic distortion of the output voltage waveforms. In addition, an experimental platform based on DSP and field-programmable gate array is built. This paper provides a detailed performance analysis of the method with comparison to the conventional SVPWM. The simulation and experimental results verify the superiority of the best control sequences generated by IA compared with the existing conventional control strategies.

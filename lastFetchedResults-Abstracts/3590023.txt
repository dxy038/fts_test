Replication has become a fundamental requirement for distributed systems in order to avoid network overload as well as to provide fault tolerance. The objective of this work is to show how replication can be supported in an abstract and technology independent way. The work presented in this paper is called Ambient-PRISMA. Ambient-PRISMA combines PRISMA and Ambient Calculus. PRISMA is an approach for developing aspect-oriented software architectures. Ambient Calculus is a formalism that provides primitives for specifying distribution, mobility and replication. In this way, both the advantages of PRISMA and Ambient Calculus are obtained.

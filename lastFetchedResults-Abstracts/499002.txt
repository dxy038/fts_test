Student involvement in their own assessment can add reflection and metacognition to
the learning process. Based on this idea, an assessment instrument was developed to self-assess
college studentsâ€™ mathematical problem solving tasks. The main objective of this exercise is to
improve student learning. The assessment instrument contains three items: student opinion
questionnaire, an analytic evaluation rubric, and a self assessment schedule. A peer assessment
component was also included in the assessment process to gain more accuracy. The rubric will
serve three main purposes. First, students can use the rubric as a learning tool. Second, it will
serve as a teaching tool for teachers. Third, it can be used as an assessment tool. However, the
whole purpose is to improve student learning rather than providing them with a letter grade.

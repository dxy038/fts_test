Genetic Algorithm (GA)[1] is one of the most effective methods in the application to optimization problems. Recently, Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is focused on in the engineering design field. In this field, the analysis of design variables in the acquired Pareto solutions, which gives the designers useful knowledge in the applied problem, is important as well as the acquisition of advanced solutions. This paper proposes a new visualization method using Isomap which visualizes the geometric distances of solutions in the design variable space considering their distances in the objective space. The proposed method enables a user to analyze the design variables of the acquired solutions considering their relationship in the objective space. This paper applies the proposed method to the conceptual design optimization problem of hybrid rocket engine and studies the effectiveness of the proposed method. It shows that the visualized result gives some knowledges on the features between design variables and fitness values in the acquired Pareto solutions.

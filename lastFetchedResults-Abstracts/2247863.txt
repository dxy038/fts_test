Background and Objective: Tracheal intubation is one of the most essential skills employed by all healthcare providers, nevertheless novice intubators turn out to be less successful when they initially perform the intubation. Video- laryngoscopes (GlideScopes) are new instruments able to increase the success rate of tracheal intubation training. The aim of this study was to compare the success rate of tracheal intubation following training with GlideScope and training with Macintosh laryngoscope. 
Materials and Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, a total of 30 semester-three anesthetics students of Zanjan Nursing School with no intubation skill served as participants of this study. They were assigned into two 15-person groups using convenience sampling after theoretical teaching and training on manikin. Next, they were trained to perform tracheal intubation on patients using GlideScope in one group and Macintosh laryngoscope in the other group. Then, the success rate and intubation time of 10 intubation trials done by each student were measured, recorded and analyzed through T-Test, X2 and ANOVA.
Results: The success rate and the mean time of intubation after ten times of intubation were 86.7% and 18.14sec and 60% and 19.46sec in the GlideScope and Macintosh groups respectively. The success rates of intubation from the first one to the tenth one were higher in GlideScope group than those of Macintosh group. (p < 0.05)
Conclusion: Tracheal intubation training with GlideScope, compared to the training with laryngoscope improves the success rate and time of intubation significantly.

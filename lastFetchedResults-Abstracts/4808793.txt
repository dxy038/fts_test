A new algorithm for Land Aerosol property and Bidirectional reflectance Inversion by Time Series technique (LABITS) is presented and applied to Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG/SEVIRI) data. Based on the assumptions that the surface bidirectional reflective property are not varying during one day and aerosol characteristics are constant in 2 &#215; 2 window, we inverse the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters. Preliminary validation shows good accuracy. The correlation coefficient R<sup>2</sup> is 0.84, the root-mean-square error is about 0.05, and the uncertainty is found to be &#916;&#964;= &#177; 0.05 &#177; 0.15&#964;. Comparing with MODIS products, our inversion are consistent very well. The algorithm is flexible and appropriate for aerosol retrieval over both dark and bright land surface. It is potential to retrieve AOD with a high-frequency over land and to monitor aerosolÂ´s local spatio-temporal variation from the geostationary satellite data.

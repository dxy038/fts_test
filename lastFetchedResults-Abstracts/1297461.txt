In this paper we develop a general approach to generate all non-dominated solutions of the multi-objective integer programming (MOIP) Problem. Our approach, which is based on the identification of objective efficiency ranges, is an improvement over classical ε-constraint method. Objective efficiency ranges are identified by solving simpler MOIP problems with fewer objectives. We first provide the classical ε-constraint method on the bi-objective integer programming problem for the sake of completeness and comment on its efficiency. Then present our method on tri-objective integer programming problem and then extend it to the general MOIP problem with k objectives. A numerical example considering tri-objective assignment problem is also provided.

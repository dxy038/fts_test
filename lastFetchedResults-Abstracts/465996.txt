Objective: We sought to describe sexual function in women before and after surgery for either prolapse or urinary incontinence, or both. Study Design: Women completed questionnaires, and vaginal dimensions were measured before and at least 6 months after surgery for prolapse or incontinence. Comparisons were made with signed-rank tests or the McNemar test. Results: Eighty-one (49%) of 165 women were sexually active before and after surgery; their mean age was 54.0 Â± 9.9 years. Mean frequency of intercourse did not change. Dyspareunia was reported by 6 (8%) women preoperatively and 15 (19%) women after surgery; dyspareunia persisted postoperatively in 1 woman, developed in 14, and resolved in 5 (P = .04). Dyspareunia occurred in 14 (26%) of 53 women after posterior colporrhaphy (P = .01) and in 8 (38%) of 21 women who had Burch colposusupension and posterior colporrhaphy performed together (P = .02). Vaginal dimensions decreased slightly after surgery; however, this did not correlate with any change in sexual function. Preoperatively, 66 (82%) women were satisfied with their sexual relationships, compared with 71 (89%) who were satisfied postoperatively. Conclusion: Sexual function and satisfaction improved or did not change in most women after surgery for either prolapse or urinary incontinence, or both. However, the combination of Burch colposusupension and posterior colporrhaphy was especially likely to result in dyspareunia. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:1610-5.)

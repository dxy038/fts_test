Different network technologies have been deployed to link the backbone infrastructure to the access network. The investigation of the performance of such combined communication systems can provide improvement to the network design procedures. More specifically, the interconnection of PLC (Power Line Communication) and Satellite is a current and emergent practice that allows communication access to be available in remote locations or for even those that were not still contemplated. In this paper, our main objective is to analyze the performance of a joint PLC and Satellite system according to some parameters of communication networks such as latency, file transfer rate, etc. We conducted all the experiments at CELG, the electricity company of the state of Goia&#769;s (Brazil), demonstrating the feasibility and the advantages of the considered telecommunication system.

In this paper, we Use the knowledge of information entropy and mutual information in rough set theory, a new comprehensive evaluation method is proposed which is aimed to improve the decision-making precision of analytic hierarchy process. This method begins with constructing an objective judgement matrix by attribute significance defined by information entropy, and then getting a combinatorial judgement matrix with the objective judgment matrix and the subjective judgment matrix derived from AHP method, therefore establishing an optimization model which can determine the combinatorial judgement matrix. Finally, guiding decision-making by the combinatorial matrixÂ´s weight value determined by the optimization model. An illustrative example is given to show the higher decision precision, feasibility and effectiveness of this comprehensive method.

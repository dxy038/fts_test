Background and Objective: Ferula szowitsiana is one of the Iranian native medicinal plants that contains various components such as ? pinene, B pinene, limonene, sabenine and myrecene. In several studies, the influence of these components on seizure has been shown. So, in this study the effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Ferula szowitsiana on kindling as a chronic model of seizure in rats was investigated.

Materials and Methods: Twenty male rats were categorized into two groups of kindling and kindling-extract (i.p. administration of 400 mg/kg of the extract). For kindling induction, daily intraperitoneal administration of 32 mg/kg of PTZ for 12 days was used. Finally the average of seizure scores was presented as meanÂ±SEM.

Results: Ferula szowitsiana hydroalcoholic extract in addition to the significant decrease in severity of seizures in kindling-extract group compared with kindling group (P < 0.05), that was visible from day 6, it also delayed kindling process for 2 days.

Conclusion: Ferula szowitsiana hydroalcoholic extract is able to reduce the severity of PTZ induced chronic seizure in kindling method. In order to understand its mechanisms in detail, more investigation is needed

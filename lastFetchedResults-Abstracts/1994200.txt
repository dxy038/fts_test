All the students were assessed by equated Quantitative Electro Encephalograph (QEEG), and The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT), then they were equated according to the gained grades and placed into two groups. One of the group was chosen as experimental accidentally and the other as control. In this experimental study, students received neurofeedback for 20 sessions while control group received no experiment.

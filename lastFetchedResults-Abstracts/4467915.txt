Most partsÂ´ shapes are composed of definitive geometric features in product manufacturing industry; one important objective of model reconstruction is to recover those features. This paper proposed a new frame of reverse engineering process: firstly, geometric features are recognized and extracted: regular geometry feature parameters were found by LSF (least-squares fitting) method, to free form features, features-matching algorithm was used to found surface construction information, and simultaneously these features were adjusted according to constraint relationships between features to obtain an optimal fitting of the measured data points. In the second step, these features parameters were adjusted according to constraints relationship between features to obtain an optimal fitting of the measured data points. Finally, the whole model was reconstructed. Because of geometric feature parameters and corresponding relationship were found, so the reconstructed models can be randomly changed by change feature parameters or relevant constraints to meet our requirement of making product innovative design. The proposed approach was illustrated with application examples.

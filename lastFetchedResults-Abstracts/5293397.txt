In this paper, we deal with H<sub>infin</sub> filtering problem for a class of two-dimensional (2-D) discrete time-invariant systems with state delays described by local state-space (LSS) Fornasini-Marchesini (FM) second model. Based on the bounded real lemma of 2-D state-delayed systems, H<sub>infin</sub> filtering design is developed, such that the filtering error system is asymptotically stable and has H<sub>infin</sub> performance gamma via LMIspsila feasibility. Furthermore, the minimum H<sub>infin</sub> norm bound gamma can be obtained by solving a linear objective optimization problem. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of our result.

Efficiency is a critical issue of electric vehicles (EVs) popularization. An optimal energy saving regulator of modular permanent magnet synchronous motor (M-PMSM) on EVs based on iso efficiency contours is studied in this paper. According to motor efficiency which depends on different torque and speed combinations, use different numbers of modules for the economic operation of EV. Simulation shows the controller can achieve maximum efficiency in full speed range. The bidirectional switching process from dual module mode to single module mode or conversely is smooth and reliable. The control system has outstanding dynamic performance.

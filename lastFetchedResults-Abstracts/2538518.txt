Background and Objective: Aloe Vera plant is used in the treatment of many diseases due to its moisturizing, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory and other effects. However, owing to this plantrsquo;s various compounds, its consumption over pregnancy may be harmful.

Materials and Methods: 2.4 g/kg of Aloe Vera extract was injected intraperitoneally to 40 mice. The first experimental group received the extract on days 3, 4, 5, 6, of pregnancy while the second experimental group received this extract on days 7, 8, 9, 10 of pregnancy. Simultaneous with these experimental groups, the control and the sham groups were considered for comparison. All mice were dissected on day 15 of pregnancy; fetuses were removed from uterus and the results were analyzed by oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Results: In the first experimental group, the weight of the placenta and fetus, CrownRump of fetus and placental diameter showed significant decrease (p 0.001). Likewise, in the second experimental group, there was a significant decrease in the weight of the placenta and fetus (p 0.001) and in placental diameter (p0.001), There was no significant change in CrownRump of fetus compared to the control group. Moreover, abnormalities such as percutaneous bleeing , Cshaped body, syndactyly , andnbsp; polyp were seen in both experimental groups.

Conclusion: The results of this research elicit that Aloe Vera extract can be teratogen and harmful during pregnancy.

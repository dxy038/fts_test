User judgment about the quality is an important aspect in quality evaluation. Current approach to evaluate quality of service is based on measuring it from network related parameters such as delay, jitter, and loss or from objective estimations by evaluating degradation of speech. However, the user´s view is more meaningful than network view or objective estimation, since the end user is the final judge for evaluation of quality. Therefore involving user´s real opinion is an appropriate parameter to improve the performance of multimedia communication networks. Evaluation of user satisfaction depends on user conditions and is varying from user to user. This research attempts to evaluate voice quality from user´s feedbacks which are calculated from his/her vocal behaviour. The idea behind this novelty is that quality degradations affect the user´s mental state including user emotion and CL where such effects are assessable from user speech.

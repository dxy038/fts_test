Static synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs) as a flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) controller can improve the power system parameters if they have been optimally allocated. In this paper, a novel approach is introduced to optimize the placement of STATCOMs according to a new objective function including voltage profile of different system points (VP) and transmission capability indices. Using equivalent impedance modeling of voltage source converters (VSCs) and sensitivity analysis in order to calculate the required indices help improve the speed of calculations and the convergence rate of optimization problem solving. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to solve the optimization problem. The proposed method is applied on a test system. The test results can clarify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

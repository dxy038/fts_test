We propose to develop a model-based systems engineering process that results in high-confidence designs for small satellite systems in the pico-/nano-class, i.e. &lt;; 50kg. This objective will be achieved through the integration of formal methods and model based systems engineering to develop an agile framework for high-confidence designs for these small systems. We propose, Reliable and Formal Design (RFD) process whose results are correct by construction, formally verified, and responsive to system requirement changes. This paper develops an intelligent framework that ties requirements, models, and simulations in a cogent manner. Furthermore, this papers provides a formulation for consistency and traceability, where the latter enforces a condition on the relationship between abstraction layers, that is, the function that refines any layer of abstraction into a successive layer must have a dual. An example of this refinement is illustrated using PVS to express the logical requirement formulation and for providing type checking proof.

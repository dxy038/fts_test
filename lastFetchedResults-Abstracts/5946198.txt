This paper solves a unit commitment (UC) problem of the interconnected power system. The UC provides an approach to decrease the cost and improve reliability of the network. The UC is a dynamic process, and the generation plan is always changing according to different load and network topology. The problem is solved by ADP which solves the dynamic problem with a two-stage neural network method. One stage is to search the optimal solution and the other stage is to evaluate the solution and obtain the objective function. Finally the UC of one sample power system is solved by ADP method

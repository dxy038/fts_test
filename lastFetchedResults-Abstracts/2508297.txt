Background: The time and frequency features of motor unit action potentials
(MUAPs) extracted from electromyographic (EMG) signal provide discriminative
information for diagnosis and treatment of neuromuscular disorders. However, the
results of conventional automatic diagnosis methods using MUAP features is not convincing
yet.
Objective: The main goal in designing a MUAP characterization system is obtaining
high classification accuracy to be used in clinical decision system. For this aim, in
this study, a robust classifier is proposed to improve MUAP classification performance
in estimating the class label (myopathic, neuropathic and normal) of a given MUAP.
Method: The proposed scheme employs both time and time–frequency features of
a MUAP along with an ensemble of support vector machines (SVMs) classifiers in
hybrid serial/parallel architecture. Time domain features includes phase, turn, peak to
peak amplitude, area, and duration of the MUAP. Time–frequency features are discrete
wavelet transform coefficients of the MUAP.
Results: Evaluation results of the developed system using EMG signals of 23 subjects
(7 with myopathic, 8 with neuropathic and 8 with no diseases) showed that the
system estimated the class label of MUAPs extracted from these signals with average
of accuracy of 91% which is at least 5% higher than the accuracy of two previously
presented methods.
Conclusion: Using different optimized subsets of features along with the presented
hybrid classifier results in a classification accuracy that is encouraging to be used in
clinical applications for MUAP characterization.

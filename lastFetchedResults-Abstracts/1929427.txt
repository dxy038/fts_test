The energy and environmental implications of a refrigeration cycle are largely conditioned by the choice of the condensing system. The dry and adiabatic fluid cooler works as a standard fluid dry cooler enhancing its capacity with adiabatic pre-cooling of the air intake. The objective of this study was to experimentally optimize the thermal performance of a dry and adiabatic fluid cooler. The experimental study has shown how the efficiency of the evaporative section decreases when air flow velocity increases. With respect to the product of the global heat transfer coefficient and the area (UA), we have seen how it increases by increasing the air velocity through the outside of the pipes and when the water flow inside increases. A model has been set to search for the optimal operating velocity. The average and maximum differences between the modeling and experimental outlet water temperatures are 0.30 °C and 0.92 °C respectively. The effect of ambient temperature and relative humidity on the outlet water temperature is also shown. For an ambient temperature of 30 °C and 50% relative humidity, the outlet water temperature of the dry and adiabatic fluid cooler is 7.5 °C lower than a dry system.

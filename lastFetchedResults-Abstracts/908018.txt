Objective: It was the goal of the trial to study the impact of electronic healthcare technology into treatment. Methods: One hundred and twenty-four children/adolescents (females 56%, age 13.5 ± 2.8 years, height 1.64 ± 0.13 m, weight 85.4 ± 23.0 kg, body-mass index (BMI) 31.3 ± 5.2 kg/m2, BMI-standard deviation score (SDS) 2.50 ± 0.5) were included. To assess physical activity and eating habits, a mobile motion sensor integrated into a mobile phone with digital camera was used. Results: The children/adolescents had a significant weight reduction of 7.1 ± 3.0 kg. BMI/BMI-SDS decreased (p < 0.01). Intensity (14.1 ± 6.4 activity units) and duration of physical activity (290.4 ± 92.6 min/day) were assessed with sensors. Time walking: median 45.5 (range, 2.5–206.5), running 8.0 (range, 0–39.5), cycling 27.7 (range, 0–72.5), car driving 23.7 (range, 0–83.0) min/day. Comparing self-reported physical activity (walking 292.9 (range, 9.6–496.1), running 84.8 (range, 8.4–130.2) min/day) with assessment with sensors there were significant differences (p < 0.01). Duration of physical activity documented by children/adolescents was higher than the assessment with motion sensors (walking 292.9 vs 45.5 min, p < 0.01, running 84.8 vs 8.0 min, p < 0.01). Sensor derived energy intake was higher than recommended (469.14 ± 88.75 kcal vs 489.03 ± 108.25 kcal, p = 0.09). Performing multivariate analysis the following parameters showed associations with weight reduction (R-square = 0.75): body weight (β = −0.95, p < 0.01), C-reactive protein (CRP, β = 0.15, p = 0.07), physical activity, time spent in activities measured with sensors (β = −0.18, p = 0.04), stress management (β = 0.16, p = 0.06), body fat mass at onset of the trial (β = 0.45, p < 0.01) and body shape (β = −0.25, p = 0.01). Conclusion: The innovative mobile movement detection system is highly accepted by children and adolescents. The system is able to augment existing weight reduction and stabilization strategies.

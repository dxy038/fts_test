In this paper, we propose a MAC scheme for excessive data transmission by selecting available wavelength from the farthest node in order to reduce the number of transmission interruptions in WDM bidirectional ring network. The proposed MAC scheme searches available guest wavelengths in the following order; at first the wavelength which is assigned to the farthest node, then the wavelength which is assigned to the node located between the farthest node and the destination node, and lastly the wavelength which is assigned to the node located between the farthest node and the source node. The source node can transmit the data packets immediately because the data transmission by the guest wavelength assigned to the farthest node is hardly interfered. We compare the performance of the proposed MAC scheme with that of the conventional MAC scheme with respect to transmission interruption probability and mean packet delay by computer simulations. As a result, we find that the proposed MAC scheme can reduce transmission interruption probability and mean packet delay

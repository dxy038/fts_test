In the first six months of 1971, the United Nations executed surveys using a number of the recently developed geophysical sensors on behalf of the United Nations Development Program in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Lesotho. The Ethiopia and Kenya surveys had the objective of direct exploration for and inventory of geothermal resources and involved coverage of some 39 000 km2 and 1550 km2, respectively, of thermal scanning in the 3 to 5 micron and 8 to 14 micron ranges. The Lesotho survey, experimental in nature, had the objective of exploration for diamondiferous kimberlite pipes and involved some 2600 km2 of aerial survey, utilizing true color, false color, and multispectral photography, scanning in the ultraviolet and 3 to 5 micron and 8 to 14 micron infrared spectra, infrared radiometry, and aeromagnetics. A preliminary evaluation of the results indicates a degree of success that will dictate expanded use of these methods by the United Nations in the future.

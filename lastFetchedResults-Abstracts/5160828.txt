Based on the traditional theory and algorithms of vehicle routing problem, the multi-objective VRPSDP mathematical model is established in considering the minimum of the number of vehicles and the transportation costs. The genetic algorithm is used as the solving algorithm of the model in this paper, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the chromosomes in the iterative process, the chromosome encoding and the genetic arithmetic operators, which are more suitable for solving the problem of the vehicle operating route are devised. Simulation experiments are done in the application of the modified Solomon R101 case, the optimal objective function value and the optimal program of arranging the vehicle routes are respectively obtained by the basic GA and the improved GA. According to the comparative analysis the convergence process of the optimal solution on two genetic algorithms, it is validated that the model is reasonable and the solving algorithm is effective.

A new technique to optimize the performance of the analysis of open objects with the Method of Moments is presented in this work. The objective is to convert these objects, which should be simulated with the Electric Field Integral Equation, to objects made of two parallel near layers that can be considered as a closed volume and, therefore, analysed with the Combined Field Integral Equation. The conversion of objects is made automatically in the meshing process, where a detection of open and closed objects has been implemented to identify the surfaces to be replicated in the parallel layer. The results of the approximation are equal than results of the simulation of the original objects analysed with EFIE, but in some specific cases, the times required for the simulation are minimized, as it is shown in the results section.

Objective: Two types of stem cells are found in the bone marrow: hematopoietic stem cells and marrow stromal cells (MSCs). Is it possible to induce the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells into neural cells in vitro and subsequently transplant them into the brain? This might help repair neural lesions observed in some neurodegenerative diso ders such as Parkinson's disease (PD).
Materials and Methods: In this study, cultured MSCs were incubated in serum free meÂ­dium containing 10 8 M selegiline for 24 hours and cells were cultured for another 48 hours in a minimal essential medium (a-MEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Then selegiline-treated cells were immunostained for neuronal markers such as NF-200 and TH.
Results: Cell counting results showed that Selegiline at doses of 10 6, 10~7 and 10~8 M increased the mean percent of viable cells. The most effective dose of Selegiline for dif- erentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) was 10 8 M. Molecular studies indcated that the expression of BDNF, GDNF, NGF, NT3, and NT4/5 genes were increased in Selegiline-treated cells compared to non-treated group.
Conclusion: BMSCs can be directed to a neural fate in vitro and can be considered as a cell source in neurological disorders for autograft therapy

Due to the proliferation of Internet and wireless communication networks, mobility of software components is pervasive in current applications. However, most of the existing Architecture Description Languages (ADLS) lack operators to express mobility primitives. In this paper, we propose a generic rewrite theory for mobility in CBabel, a Declarative Architecture Description Language. Rademaker et al. have associated a rewriting logic semantics to the different constructors of CBabel. We exploit such semantics to extend CBabel with mobility primitives by defining a rewrite theory called mobility-primitives. Our objective is two folds: We propose a rewrite theory for mobility in CBabel. Then, we generalize it to any Architecture Description Language that can be translated to rewriting logic. Such generalization will be obtained by introducing the parameterization notion of Full Maude to the mobility-primitives rewrite theory.

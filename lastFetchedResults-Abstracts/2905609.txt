Three typical models of Liu and Jordon´s isotropic (extended by Klein), Hay´s anisotropic model and Reindl´s anisotropic model to estimate monthly-average daily total radiation on vertical surfaces with azimuth form -90&#176; to 90&#176; are investigated by detail. Based on the measurement of global, beam, diffused, and ground reflected radiation on the horizontal surfaces, total radiation on south-facing, east-facing and west-facing vertical surfaces for Beijing (39&#176;48´N and 116&#176;28´E) during the whole year (March of 2010 to February of 2011), the objective in this investigation is to perform a statistical comparison, such as, mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), correlation factor(CORR), to recommend one that is applicable for estimating the solar radiation on vertical surface and optimization design of building photovoltaic system for Beijing.

An advanced elimination algorithm based on the dynamic PID control concept for treating drift rate effects of MEMS-Based inertial devices, such as accelerometer and gyroscope is proposed in this investigation. Effects of drift rates of inertial devices strongly influence the performance of the relative motion sensing products that are designed by MEMS-based inertial devices, e.g., small regions of variation of drift rates of accelerometer and gyroscope will cause a serious effect in pure MEMS-based inertial navigation system (INS) with a worst tracking error &gt;100 m within a period of time 50 second, and this worst character also largely reduces the compensation role of INS to GPS. The design objective of this proposed method is to offer a simple structure, stable and precise drift rate model for the MEMS-based inertial devices, and then successfully eliminate the diverge character in integration: single integration int for gyroscope and double integration intint for accelerometer.

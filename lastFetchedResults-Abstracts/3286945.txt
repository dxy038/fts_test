Input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) inverter system is very suitable for high input voltage and high output current power conversion applications. The objective of the system is input voltage sharing (IVS) and output current sharing (OCS). This paper put forward two specific implementations of compound control strategy which can realize IVS and OCS. One of two approaches is IVS control combined with the same inductor current phase angle and the other is IVS control combined with the same inductor current amplitude. In the meanwhile, a new solution dedicated to distributed configuration is proposed to achieve fully modularity and communications among the modules are realized through three buses. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the above two methods and the distributed configuration.

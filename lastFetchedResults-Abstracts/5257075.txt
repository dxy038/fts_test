The polygraph (lie detector) has been used for criminal verification in many countries for a long time. However, up to now its effectiveness has depended on the expertise of the tester. In addition, the training of a good tester will cost a lot of time. In order to make the polygraph more objective and easy to operate, we propose a novel automatic polygraph. Based on skin conductance response (SCR), pulse rate (PR) and respiration volume (RV) signals, random signal processing and pattern recognition methods were used to select tens of features. An identifier was designed to identify whether the answer is true or not. The experiments showed that the method is very effective

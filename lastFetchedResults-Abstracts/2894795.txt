In this paper, a new advanced nonlinear controller is synthetized using sliding mode approach for DC/AC converter with LC output filter. The objective of the control is generating a sinusoidal voltage with amplitude and industrial frequency fixed by the reference signal, regardless of the type of output load. In addition the inductor´s current (of the output filter) is provided by sliding observer in order to eliminate current sensor. The controller design is made based on large signal average model widely used in the literature. Simulation is carried out in SimPower toolbox of Matlab/Simulink. It´s shown that the controller meets its objectives of tracking and robustness with load changes.

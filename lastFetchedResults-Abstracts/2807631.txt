In this paper we propose a framework for automating feedback control to balance hard-to-predict wind power variations. The power imbalance is a result of non-zero mean error around the wind power forecast. Our proposed framework is aimed at achieving the objective of frequency stabilization and regulation through one control action. A case-study for a real-world system on Flores island in Portugal is provided. Using a battery-based storage on the island, we illustrate the proposed control framework.

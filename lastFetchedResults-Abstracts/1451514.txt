In this work we focus on Capacity and Flow Assignment (CFA) problem for simultaneous unicast and anycast flows. Anycast flow is a new technique to deliver packets in computer networks, in which user can download or send packets to any one of several possible servers. In our work we consider two models of CFA problem. In the first model as the criterion we assume the total average delay function with the budget constraint. In the second model as the objective we use the linear function of cost. The considered problems are NP-complete â€“ therefore, to solve larger problem instances we propose new heuristic algorithms that can be applied.

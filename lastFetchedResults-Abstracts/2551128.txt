Objective: Aging can affect adaption of the heart tissueâ€™s apoptotic system to aerobic exercise and induction of doxorubicin. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of pretreatment of aerobic training on doxorubicin-induced left ventricular apoptosis gene expression in a model of aging rats.
Methods: We randomly assigned 42 adult Wistar male rats to 6 groups (n=7 per group): control of young, control of aging, aging + saline, aging + doxorubicin, aging + aerobic exercise + saline, and aging + aerobic exercise + doxorubicin. Aging was induced by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of D- galactose (100 mg/kg). The training protocol included treadmill running with a gradual increase from 25 min/day to 54 min/day at a velocity of 15 m/min to 20 m/min, 5 days/week for 6 weeks. During the two ultimate training weeks, the animals underwent a 15-day i.p. doxorubicin regimen that consisted of 1 mg/kg of doxorubicin per day. The rats were sacrificed 48 hours after the last training and injection session. A portion of the left ventricle was analyzed by real-time PCR for Bax and Bcl-2 gene expressions.
Results: ANOVA indicated that doxorubicin injection induced a significant increase in expression of Bax and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and an insignificant decrease in Bcl-2 gene expression. On the other hand, aerobic training before and during the induction of doxorubicin prevented an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the doxorubicin-induced decrease in Bcl-2 gene expression.
Conclusion: Due to the significant decrease in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the hearts of the trained rats that underwent doxorubicin treatment, we conclude that aerobic exercise training prior to and during treatment with doxorubicin as a non-pharmacological strategy, probably protects cardiomyocytes from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.

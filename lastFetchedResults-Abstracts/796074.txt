A branch and bound algorithm is proposed for globally solving a class of nonconvex programming problems (NP). For minimizing the problem, linear lower bounding functions (LLBFs) of objective function and constraint functions are constructed, then a relaxation linear programming is obtained which is solved by the simplex method and which provides the lower bound of the optimal value. The proposed algorithm is convergent to the global minimum through the successive refinement of linear relaxation of the feasible region and the solutions of a series of linear programming problems. And finally the numerical experiment is reported to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

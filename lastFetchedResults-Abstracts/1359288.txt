Background and Objective: Ischemia in the brain of rats causes intensive neural injuries leading to learning and memory disorders in addition to pain. Ellagic acid is a polyphenol compound with antioxidant properties which is found in fruits like pomegranate, blackberry and all types of mulberry. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of 14-day prescription of different doses of ellagic acid on memory, learning and pain followed by general ischemia in the brain of rats. 
Materials and Methods: In this study, 50 Wistar rats in weight range of 200-250 g were randomly placed in five different groups. To induce ischemia, common carotid arteries were separated from both sides, blocked from both parts and cut from the middle part. Memory was evaluated using passive avoidance learning test (shuttle box) and pain threshold was assessed using tail- flick device.
Results: Ischemia caused reduction of memory (p < 0.01) and pain threshold (p < 0.001). Prescription of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg doses of ellagic acid, particularly 50 mg/kg, led to improvement of defects in memory (p < 0.01) and reduction of pain (p < 0.001). 
Conclusion: It seems that using ellagic acid can reduce intensity of neural disorders caused by ischemic hypo-perfusion due to its antioxidant property and inhibition of free radicals.

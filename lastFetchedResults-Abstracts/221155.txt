In this paper, an experimental study of the statistical
properties of wavelet coefficients of image data is presented,
as well as the design of two different morphology-based image
coding algorithms that make use of these statistics. A salient
feature of the proposed methods is that, by a simple change
of quantizers, the same basic algorithm yields high performance
embedded or fixed rate coders. Another important feature is that
the shape information of morphological sets used in this coder
is encoded implicitly by the values of wavelet coefficients, thus
avoiding the use of explicit and rate expensive shape descriptors.
These proposed algorithms, while achieving nearly the same
objective performance of state-of-the-art zerotree based methods,
are able to produce reconstructions of a somewhat superior
perceptual quality, due to a property of joint compression and
noise reduction they exhibit.

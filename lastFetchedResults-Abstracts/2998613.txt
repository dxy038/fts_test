The objective of this work is the development of a methodology for electric load forecasting based on a neural network. Here, the backpropagation algorithm with an adaptive process based on fuzzy logic is used. This methodology results in fast training, when compared to the conventional formulation of the backpropagation algorithm. Results are presented using data from a Brazilian electric company and the performance is very good for the proposal objective

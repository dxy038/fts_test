Electrochemical energy storages, such as batteries and ultracapacitors, are typically used as energy and power sources in hybrid and electric vehicles because of their good technical characteristics. Selecting and sizing the correct storage technology can be complicated without detailed evaluation of the requirements. In this research, electrochemical energy storage system requirements for a hybrid underground mining loader were evaluated with the aid of simulation results. The objective of this research is to generate a set of key requirements for energy storage system in relation to the hybrid loader performance. These requirements take into account the power and energy capacity, costs, lifecycle and safety related requirements.

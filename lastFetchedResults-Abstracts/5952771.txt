The objective of this project is to create a compilation of educational resources in remote sensing accessible through the World-Wide Web (WWW). This compilation will be useful to anyone interested in learning about remote sensing. Educators might also find it useful as a place to locate useful resources for teaching courses in remote sensing. The remote sensing web resources were organized into several categories in the authorsÂ´ web pages. These categories include: (1) Remote Sensing Missions, (2) Remote Sensing Applications, (3) Notes on Remote Sensing and (4) Interesting Images. The authors hope to provide a one-stop web page for accessing educational resources in remote sensing on the World Wide Web

Objective: Very few reports are available in the literature to clarify the natural long course of hearing change in an individual patient with chronic otitis media (COM). We reviewed hearing change in patients suffering from perforated COM without an operation. Methods: Eighty-seven ears of 70 patients had COM with tympanic perforation and were observed without an operation. The mean follow-up period was 10.7 years (5â€“22 years) and the mean age at the first examination was 51.3 years. To minimize the effect of aging, 23 patients with normal ear drums on the other side were further analyzed. Results: All 87 ears tended to show deterioration of hearing gradually under long observation. In 23 patients, hearing deterioration was 0.13 dB/year in the control side and 0.61 dB/year in the COM side (P<0.02). Although elevation of bone conduction hearing level tended to be larger at high frequencies than at low and middle frequencies, there was no significant difference between COM and normal ears. Conclusions: Air conduction hearing levels deteriorated with the passage of time and surgery is recommended at the early stage of COM to prevent progress of hearing loss.

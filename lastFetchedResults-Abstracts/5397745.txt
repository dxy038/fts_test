This paper introduces a new method to improve at the same time the comprehension of the discomfort for partially sighted and the efficiency of visual aids. It presents an objective and non invasive analysis allowing to understand the patient-signal interaction. This system interacts with a sensory input: eye movements. Analysis in real time of eye movements permits to specify patient adaptation and cognitive behavior relating to a difficulty to identify visual signal. This personalized method will permit to adapt all visual information to patient need with an image processing commanded and controlled by the eyes. The final objective is to create self-adaptive visual aids by synchronizing image processing to patient eye movements.

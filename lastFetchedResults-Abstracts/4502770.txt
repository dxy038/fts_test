Designing the converter for an induction cooker, the main difficult lies in the variability of the load, due to the wide range of vessels available in the market. Such issue is equivalent to the problem of identifying the vesselÂ´s properties. In this paper an identifying method of such properties is proposed with the objective of system-level simulation and design. The method is based on a combination of analytical electromagnetic calculations, and Fourier-series-based waveform synthesis.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of an experimentally induced acute inflammation on serum adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in the dog, and to compare their evolution with other well-established acute phase proteins (APPs) such as C-reactive protein (CRP), and haptoglobin (Hp). Therefore levels of adiponectin, IGF-1 and a profile of APPs were measured in healthy dogs after intravenous administration of E. coli LPS (0.02 mg/kg) and compared with dogs injected with saline solution (0.2 mL/kg). Adiponectin and IGF-1 were both decreased in response to endotoxins in the dog. Significant positive correlations were found between adiponectin and IGF-1 (r = 0.31; p &lt; 0.05). Adiponectin had also a significant negative correlation with CRP (r = −0.39; p &lt; 0.05) and Hp (r = −0.27; p &lt; 0.05), whereas IGF-1 had significant negative correlation with CRP (r = −0.52; p &lt; 0.001).

sults obtained in the present study indicate that adiponectin and IGF-1behave as negative acute phase proteins after acute inflammatory stimulus in dogs.

Background and Objective: Adipokines including vaspin and chemerin play various biological roles, which are related to body mass index (BMI) changes, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of eight-week intense sprint exercise on plasma levels of vaspin and chemerin in female Sprague-Dawley rats.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 32 rats were randomly divided into two groups: 12 rats in control group and 20 rats in experimented group. For eight weeks, experimental group did sprint exercises based on an exercise program five days a week, while the control group had no training program. After eight weeks, an independentt-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used for data analysis.

Results: The results showed that there was no significant difference between chemerin serum levels in rats that had undergone intensive exercise program as compared to the control group (p=0.18). On the other hand, vaspin serum levels significantly decreased (p=0.0001). In addition, no significant correlation was observed between vaspin and chemerin levels (p=0.28).

Conclusion: According to theresults of the present study as well astheimportance of vaspin and chemerin level changes, it seems that the training time must be more than 8 weeks and the exercise intensity should be tailored to the individual's fitness level. Otherwise, subjects are not able to perform the exercise program properly.

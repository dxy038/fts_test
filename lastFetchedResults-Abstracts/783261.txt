Objective To study, in a geographically
defined area, associations between the neighbourhood
social environment and individual socioeconomic
status on the one hand, and treated incidence of
schizophrenia and level of subsequent service use on
the other. Method A combined data set of (i) patients
with a case register diagnosis of schizophrenia and (ii)
population controls was subjected to multilevel analyses,
including neighbourhood exposures (neighbourhood
socioeconomic disadvantage and social
capital) and individual level confounders. Separate
analyses were conducted for inpatient and outpatient
psychiatric service consumption as indexed by the
case register. Results Neighbourhood socioeconomic
disadvantage and neighbourhood social capital did
not impact on the treated incidence of schizophrenia,
but quantity of inpatient service consumption was
higher in neighbourhoods with higher level of social
control (i.e. where it is more likely that neighbours
intervene in neighbourhood-threatening situations).
In addition, most indicators of lower individual
socioeconomic status were associated with higher
treated incidence, while treated incidence was lower
when individual educational status was low. Conclusion
Residents of high social control neighbourhoods
may seek greater levels of resolution of psychiatric
disorder in patient-residents, and by consequence
may induce greater levels of inpatient service consumption
in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.
Individual-level indicators of social disadvantage are
associated with higher risk of treated psychotic disorder,
with the exception of lower educational status,
which may confer a lower probability of treatment
given the presence of psychotic disorder

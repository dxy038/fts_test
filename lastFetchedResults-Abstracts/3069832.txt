A bidirectional DC model of hot-carrier-induced nMOSFET degradation using exponential interface state profile is proposed. A single physically based exponential expression to describe localized distribution of the interface states along the channel is employed. The saturation voltage as a function of a position along the channel due to localized interface states is taken into account. Several short-channel effects including vertical and lateral field degradations, saturation velocity, parasitic source-drain resistances, and channel length modulation are included. The predictions of the model agree well with the experimental data.

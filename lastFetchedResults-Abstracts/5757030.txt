Concerns the use of panospheric imaging (PI) in armoured vehicle design. The Vehicle Concepts Group (VCG) at the Defence Research Establishment Suffield (DRES) is proposing a proof-of-concept research project to demonstrate the viability of an armoured vehicle viewing system using panospheric imaging. The objective of the proposed research is to show that an economical and robust system can provide a 360 degree by 270 degree panospheric field of view to all members of the armoured vehicle crew. Imagery is presented to each crewman through a &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; crew helmet, with the specific view being appropriate to the orientation of the individuals head. In effect, each member of the crew will have the sensation of being able to &#8220;see through the walls&#8221; of the armoured vehicle. This paper describes the mechanical and electronic architecture of the proposed viewing system, and some of the operational considerations constraining the design. The particular merit of a panospheric viewing system (PVS) for automated motion detection, target acquisition, and gun lay is briefly discussed

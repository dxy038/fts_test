This paper describes the generation of dynamic compact thermal models (DCTM) for multi-source semiconductor devices by RC-network optimization. Several state-of-the-art non-linear optimization algorithms are compared with respect to their convergence behavior and accuracy of the generated network models and practical aspects like the numerically efficient solution of the RC-network equations, best-choice of the objective function, and exploitation of device symmetry are discussed. The applicability of the methods presented herein is demonstrated for some multi-chip semiconductor devices.

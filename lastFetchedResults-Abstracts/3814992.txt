We present a new configuration of a thin-film-filter (TFF)-embedded planar-light-circuit platform for a bidirectional transceiver module to enhance a tolerance of the insertion loss to the positional deviation of the TFF, by using a wide multimode waveguide structure that guides a reflected light from the TFF to a photoreceiver. It is experimentally shown that the new scheme has a merit in a high tolerance to the positional deviation of the TFF, and that it maintains a considerably high optical isolation by a proper arrangement of waveguides.

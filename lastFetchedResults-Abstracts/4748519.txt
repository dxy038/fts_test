In this paper an observer based on super-twisting algorithm is proposed to observe the states dynamics of a heavy vehicle and estimate its tire forces. For this application, a particular manoeuvre of cornering is chosen and a nonlinear dynamic model of tractor semi-trailer combination vehicle is developed for this case. The objective of vehicle dynamics observation is to improve the handling performance, and manoeuvrability, in order to obtain a safer and easier driving. In this study, some simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed observer

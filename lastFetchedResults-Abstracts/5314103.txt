Function points are generally used for measuring software functional size from a user perspective. The paper is concerned with the problem of counting function points from source code using the function point analysis proposed by the International Function Point User Group (IFPUG) 1994 standards. The paper presents the Automated FP counting scope and objective, the presentation of an existing semi-formal model and the required extensions for the definition of four IFPUG rules. Then the authors propose reverse engineering techniques to address those four rules

Within the provincial logistics planning, several very important issues are usually deled subjective and arbitrary. In view of this, this paper presents an objective method for the comprehensive evaluation and classification of provincial area logistics by principal component analysis (PCA). The first step is to establish evaluation index of the regional logistics development and then to calculate the data of selected samples by PCA. Secondly, these results from the calculation are used to explain and classify the entire provincial logistics. Finally, the comprehensive index system of Heilongjiang province is calculated according to the five factor scores. These results show that PCA can simplify the complicated problem in provincial area logistics and lead to an objective, reliable and convincing conclusion.

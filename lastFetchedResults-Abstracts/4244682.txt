A wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission system is developed which integrates current personal digital assistant (PDA) technology and general packet radio service (GPRS) technology. This PDA-based system is comprised of a designed ECG signal acquisition module, a pocket PC (Legend 5100) and a GPRS communication module. The specific objective of this system is to facilitate accurate and reliable monitoring and transmission of patientÂ´s ECG signal. This system is able to acquire ECG signals, display the ECG waveform on the LCD screen of the PDA and wirelessly transmit them to an authorized remote medical ECG management server. The transmission function of this system is tested and the results show that this system is able to accurate and reliable transmit the ECG signal

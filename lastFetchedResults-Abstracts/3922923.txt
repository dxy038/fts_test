This paper presents the design, fabrication method, and measurement results of a low-loss ohmic-contact radio-frequency microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switch. A novel bidirectional electrostatic actuation mechanism has been developed for a dual single-pole double-throw switch that could be used for an X-Ku-band low-temperature cofired ceramic switched-line-type phase shifter. A high-aspect-ratio deep reactive-ion etching process and a thick gold-plating process were used to develop low-insertion-loss air-suspended MEMS waveguides and low resistive ohmic contacts. A typical insertion loss of 0.56 dB, a return loss of 19.4 dB, and an isolation of 51.4 dB were obtained at a Ku-band frequency of 12 GHz.

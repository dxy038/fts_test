An adaptive sliding mode control strategy for speed tracking problem in variable speed wind turbine systems is presented in this work. The proposed adaptation strategy consists on updating the sliding gain and the turbine torque, which is considered unknown by the controller. The adaptation algorithms for the sliding gain and the torque estimation are carried out using the sliding surface to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional sliding mode control. The objective is to track a speed profile to operate the wind turbine in maximum power extraction. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control system.

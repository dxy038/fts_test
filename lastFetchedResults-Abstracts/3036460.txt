The diagnosis and monitoring are important to minimize the outage period and maximize the annual output of a PV system. The objective of this research is to develop diagnosis technologies for PV systems, especially for the arrays, which can be integrated into the power conditioners. Among the various methods for the failure detections, the electrical methods are found to be most promising as the result of our literature investigation. Based on this, we proposed the electrical method for detection of failed modules, which applies the high frequency reaction measurement with the time domain analysis, and it was shown that we could find out the locations of the impedance mismatches in PV array. For further analysis, we showed the numerical model of PV array.

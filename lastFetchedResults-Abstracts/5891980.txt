The fast modulation capability of the laser makes it suitable for transmitting data at Mb/s rates. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the modulation capability of a multimode laser and present the results of a simple FSK transmission experiment using the laser diode. Measurements indicate that the circuit response of the laser diode module and circuit board is linear up to a 200 MHz peak, while the intrinsic laser has a flat response up to 100 MHz and a distinct peak beyond 1 GHz. A switched VCO provided an alternating sequence of 100 MHz and 140 MHz tones that was used to modulate the laser diode

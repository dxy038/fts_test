To upgrade the robot intelligence adopted in a variant task environment, we have to integrate various sensors for environmental information therefore we have to develop sensory data processing techniques or find a negotiated solution from disparate sensory data. We propose a multisensor system architecture for the prototype of general configuration of sensor system design, especially for robotic assembly environment. The utmost objective is to provide the user (assembly system designer) with an environment without extra consideration of sensory module configuration or information flow

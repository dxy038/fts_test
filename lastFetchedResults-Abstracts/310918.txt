Objective. The purpose of this research was twofold: (1) to study the impulsive acceleration of the calcaneus at heel strike in subjects with neutrally aligned (i.e., normal) feet and (2) to explore how the acceleration may differ in subjects with pes planus (i.e., flat) feet. The component of the acceleration vector aligned with the long axis of the tibia was quantified.

Design. Subjects with either foot type were instrumented and calcaneal acceleration was quantified during comfortable cadence locomotion.

Background. Aberrant peak acceleration has been associated with osteoarthritis. While tibial acceleration has been quantified, calcaneal acceleration has not. Additionally, foot morphology, or foot type, has demonstrated an effect on foot function and thus there may be differences in calcaneal acceleration between foot types.

Methods. Six subjects with neutrally aligned feet and six with pes planus feet were selected via a clinical exam. Accelerometers were attached to the posterior aspect of the medial surface of the calcanei bilaterally and 10 walking trials were collected.

Results. The average baseline-to-peak acceleration for the neutrally aligned and pes planus feet was 4.79 g (SD, 2.14 g) and 5.24 g (SD, 3.28 g), respectively; the peak-to-peak acceleration was 5.03 g (SD, 2.74 g) and 6.75 g (SD, 3.89 g). There were no significant differences (P>0.05) between foot types.

Conclusions. The calcaneal acceleration at heel strike for neutrally aligned and pes planus feet was not sensitive to foot type.

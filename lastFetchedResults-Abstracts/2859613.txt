The paper presents fast method of unit commitment on balancing market, which also provides system security both in steady and all N-1 contingency states. Two types of generating units were modelled: thermal steam-turbine unit and pumped-storage unit. Unit parameters were specified accordingly to available data from Polish power plants and Transmission System operator (TSO). The day-ahead balancing market was chosen because the most frequent on this market the technical requirements of the system are checked. The mixed integer linear optimization was proposed as an optimization technique, as the most promising from the literature survey. The objective linear function includes energy bids, reserve bids and start-up costs for each time interval, each market participant and each commissioned unit. The 636-bus network based on the frame of the Polish power system network, was used in the calculations. The model included 52 generator nodes with 117 units which are dispatched in the optimization process.

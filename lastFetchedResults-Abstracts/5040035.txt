This paper proposes the application of fault-tolerant control (FTC) using fuzzy predictive control. The FTC approach is based on two steps, fault detection and isolation (FDI) and fault accommodation. Fault detection is performed by a model-based approach using fuzzy modeling. Fault isolation uses a fuzzy decision making approach. The model of the isolated fault is used in fault accommodation with a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This paper uses a fuzzy predictive control scheme, where fuzzy goals and fuzzy constraints are described in a fuzzy objective function. The criteria (goals or constraints) have an associated weight factor, which are chosen by the decision-maker. Two faults were simulated, and the respective fuzzy models were identified. The fuzzy FTC scheme proposed in this paper was able to accommodate the simulated faults.

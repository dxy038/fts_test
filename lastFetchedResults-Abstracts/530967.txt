Background: Erythropoietin (EPO) was first known as a factor for red blood cell proliferation and differentiation. New studies show the effects of EPO on immune system. Objective: In this study, the effects of pretreatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on the anti-human leukocyte antibody (anti-HLA) titer were determined. Methods: Three groups of rats were sensitized with human lymphocytes. Two of the groups were given 20 or 100 IU/Kg rHuEPO after two sensitizations with human lymphocytes. Control group did not receive rHuEPO. Microlymphocytotoxicity method was used to detect anti-HLA antibodies. Results: Treatment with rHuEPO caused a significant decline in anti-HLA antibody titer compared to control group. Also, pretreatment with rHuEPO suppressed antibody response after repeated antigenic stimulation. Conclusion: Such results could be due to the effects of rHuEPO on the number or the activity of the B and the T cells. Moreover, the dose of rHuEPO and the length of treatment might affect anti-HLA antibody titer

The objective of this research is to study the temperature variation in thin dielectric materials. The thermal wave model is being used as the classical Fourier law of heat conduction breaks down when a dielectric material of sub-micron geometry is heated rapidly. The first part of the work reviews the temperature distribution due to thermal wave in semi-infinite bodies. The main emphasis of this paper is to accurately determine the temperature profile in a finite plate made up from a dielectric material. The boundary conditions of the first and the second kind are selected for this study. Using the classical Laplace transform technique, analytical solutions are obtained for finite bodies with different boundary conditions the first kind and the second kind. Due to complexity of the problem, a symbolic algebra provided the solution for examining the thermal behavior of dielectric materials during rapid heating.

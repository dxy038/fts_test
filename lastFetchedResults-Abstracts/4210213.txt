Simulation is one of tools that has been used widely in several manufacturing areas and organizations as well as in automotive industries. Using a valid simulation model may give several advantages in creating better manufacturing design in order to improve the system performances. This paper presents result of implementing a computer based simulation model to design Manufacturing Process Re-engineering for performances improvement. The basic problem is that the current manufacturing system performances have to be improved to deal with the business environment. Projects objective is to design four improvement alternatives design using valid computer simulation model. Three approaches applied as the foundation in creating improvement alternative of the real system are Line Balancing, Facilities re-layout and process enhancement, and manufacturing process. Simulation models were developed using ARENA version 7.1 while Statfit and Microsoft Excel were used for statistical analysis. The case study was taken from the Job Shop Manufacturing line of Body Welding and Metal Finish operations of truck assembly line. The result derived from simulation model of current system and four proposed simulation models that are based on three approaches are analyzed and presented to be considered as new strategy in improving the truck assembly line.

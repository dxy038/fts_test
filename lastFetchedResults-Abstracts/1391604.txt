This paper deals with the problem of dynamic loading of a piezoelectric sandwich plate. The objective of the analysis is to obtain a closed form approximate analytical solution for the equilibrium equations of the loaded plate considering time variant damping, and to discuss the shear force effect for the problem. The solution to the problem is obtained using a hybrid WKBâ€“Galerkin method.

The objective is to obtain an embedded system using a microcontroller that will communicate with other devices over a specific protocol (SENSLOG) over TCP/IP for sensors applications. The protocol has been designed for this application, but the commands are generic. They can be used for any type of sensing. We must take into account that this program will run in a microcontroller and it will communicate with another program running in a PC. The protocol is based on commands, like SMTP. From the PC we will send commands to the microcontroller to do specific tasks, and if it is necessary, the microcontroller will answer to the PC. Some of the functions designed for this protocol are: to control two digital output for general purpose, to read the value of the ADC input and send it to the PC, to modify other program variables with the new value that arrives (physical address, IP address, TCP port, margins of sensor , etc), reset and restore default values.

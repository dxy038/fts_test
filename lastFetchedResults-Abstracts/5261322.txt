A hierarchical synthesis methodology for analog and mixed-signal systems is presented that fully in a novel way integrates topology selection at all levels. A hierarchical system optimizer takes multiple topologies for all the building blocks at each hierarchical abstraction level, and generates optimal topology combinations using multi-objective evolutionary optimization techniques. With the presented methodology, system-level performance trade-offs can be generated where each design point contains valuable information on how the systems performances are influenced by different combinations of lower-level building block topologies. The generated system designs can contain all kinds of topology combinations as long as critical inter-block constraints are met. Different topologies can be assigned to building blocks with the same functional behavior, leading to more optimal hybrid designs than typically obtained in manual designs. In the experimental results, three different integrator topologies are used to generate an optimal system-level exploration trade-off for a complex high-speed DeltaSigma A/D modulator

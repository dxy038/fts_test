Cloud computing is an increasingly popular computing paradigm, now proving a necessity for utility computing services. Each provider offers a unique service portfolio with a range of resources. Resource provisioning for cloud services in a comprehensive way is of crucial importance to any resource allocation model. Any model should consider both computational resources and network(data) resources to accurately represent and serve practical needs. We propose a new model to tackle the resource allocation problem for a group of cloud user requests. This includes provisioning for both data center computational resources and network resources. The model is implemented with the objective of minimizing the average tardiness of connection requests. Four combined scheduling algorithms are introduced and used to schedule virtual machines on data center servers and then schedule connection requests on the network paths available. Of the four methods, the method combining Resource Based Distribution technique and Duration Priority technique have shown the best performance getting the minimum tardiness while complying with the problem constraints.

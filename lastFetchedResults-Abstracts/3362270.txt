Considering the inevitable uncertainty in practice, based on an evolutionary multi-objective robust optimisation, this study presents a hierarchical synthesis method for inductive power transfer (IPT) systems to automatically obtain the robust Pareto-optimal designs including an optimal compensation schematic selected from a topology collection which combines typical IPT compensation types. First, for several compensation circuits, useful formulae are presented to ensure that capacitive and inductive reactance cancels each other in not only primary but also secondary side. Some robust design considerations are also given. Then for a given compensation, a bi-level evolutionary multi-objective robust optimisation is proposed to obtain the robust Pareto-optimal designs that provide corresponding systems with desired output voltage, optimal efficiency, bifurcation-free operation, large distance between the primary and secondary side and acceptable robust performance against parameter uncertainty. Thereafter, among all robust Pareto fronts of individual schemes, robust Pareto front of topology collection is extracted out on which designer can choose the final design. Finally, this synthesis method is used to design practical IPT systems. The nominal designs are obtained using traditional optimisation in comparison with robust solutions to demonstrate the superiority of proposed approach. Experimental results verify the optimal and robust performance of the designed systems.

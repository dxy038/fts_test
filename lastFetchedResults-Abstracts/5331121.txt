The objective of this paper is to propose an analysis approach to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the grid-connected PV power generation system. The grid-connected PV power generation system will be introduced first. The dynamic relationship between the power flow and the DC bus voltage will be analyzed. Mathematical equations for the DC bus voltage dynamic variations, which are based on the constant current adjustment control strategy, will be derived. Computer simulation results will be used to verify the validity of the proposed analysis technique. The proposed DC bus voltage regulation method can reduce the size of the DC bus capacitor, improve the power quality of AC mains and increase the reliability of the PV power generation system.

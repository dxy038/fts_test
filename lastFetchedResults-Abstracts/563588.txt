Background and Objective: Short storage life of loquat fruit and its high susceptibility  to water loss and browning are the main factors limiting its marketability.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cellophane-film packaging and cold storage on the keeping quality and storage life of loquat fruit (Eriobotrya japonica).
Materials and Methods: Samples of sorted loquat fruit were placed in packages either coated with cellophane film (experimental) or non-coated (control) and stored for 28 days  at  7?C  and a relative humidity of 85% Â± 5. The following variables were determined in the experimenrtal and control samples: weight loss, outside tissue browning, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, vitamin C, total phenol, antioxidant capacity, and flavonoid (quercetin and catechin) contents. 
Results: In the experimental sample the browning index was lower and general quality appearance more desirable at the end of the storage period, while the control sample  lost marketability after a short time. In addition, weight loss of the sample packaged with cellophane film was significantly lower than that of the control sample. Furthermore, the increase in the soluble solid content and decrease in titratable acidity were statistically significantly higher in the control sample compred to  the cellophane-film packaged sample during storage. In both the experimental and control samples the ascorbic acid content, total phenol and antioxidant capacity in loquat fruit  were lower at the end of the storage period;  in the experimental sample the reductions were smaller. Finally, the magnititude of reduction in  the flavonoid (quercetin and catechin) contents at the end of the storage was lower in the fruit sample packaged with cellophane film. 
Conclusion: Packaging with cellophane-film, with stotage at low temperatures, can be a new method for extending storage life of loquat fruit.

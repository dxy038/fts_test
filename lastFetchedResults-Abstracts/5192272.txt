Since the scalability of logic circuits is becoming larger and more complex, the auto-design is becoming more and more difficult. In order to improve automatic design and performance evaluation of logic circuits in efficiency and capability of optimization, multiobjective simulated annealing (MSA) based increasable evolution approach is designed to evolve logic circuits automatically with an extended matrix encoding method, which can be able to reflect the potential performance of a circuit and reduce the risk of deleting a circuit with a good developing potential during evolution is devised. In the process of evolution, each individual is renewedly associated to a corresponding objective in terms of a novel adaptive evaluation method at each generation. In experiments, complicated arithmetic circuits are designed to assess the performance of MSA against other algorithms. Results indicate that the proposed method could design logic circuits efficiently.

Compared to other localization algorithms, the SemiDefinite Programming (SDP) approach has proved to deliver accurate results even in noisy backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a novel design for underwater localization systems using SemiDefinite Programming. The objective is to provide marine scientists with a cost-effective efficient way in conducting relevant research. Two designs, fixed-position and magnified-range, are proposed. Both schemes have shown a high accuracy and an outstanding performance according to simulation results. Future research directions are discussed at the end of this paper.

Water column samples have been collected in the outer channel of the Ferrol Ria (NW Spain) during four occasions over a tidal cycle. The objective was to study the exchange of dissolved and particulate Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn and particulate Al, Fe and Si between the ria and the adjacent coastal waters. This study provides the first extensive dataset on dissolved and particulate metal concentrations in the water column of a Galician ria. Typical concentrations of dissolved Cd (96 ± 31 pM), Cu (8 ± 4 nM), Pb (270 ± 170 pM) and Zn (21 ± 10 nM) were similar than in other European Atlantic shelf and coastal waters. The fraction of metals in the particulate phase followed the trend: Pb > Cu   Zn > Cd. The outgoing water from the ria was enriched in dissolved and particulate Cu, Pb and Zn compared with incoming waters, whereas Cd concentrations were similar for both waters. The suspended particulate matter was composed of a mixture of marine and continental material. The latter end-member was found to arise from the metal-rich ria bed sediments, which is diluted by the dominant metal-poor marine end-member. The net output flux of Cu from the channel is balanced by the freshwater inputs to the ria, and the net Zn flux gave a positive output to coastal waters. For Pb, the net flux to the coastal waters is less than that input from the rivers, as a result of its particle reactivity and deposition in sediments. On the contrary, a net input flux of dissolved Cd from coastal waters was observed, highlighting the oceanic source of this metal in the Galician rias. Results from the budget calculations are in agreement with the differential geochemical behavior of these elements in coastal waters.

The importance of Web search engines cannot be emphasized any further. However, we do need to work out a comprehensive procedure for evaluating them. It is in this respect that the present work is put forward. We propose to combine the subjective as well as objective measures of Web search quality. For objective evaluation, we have resorted to the conventional vector space approach of information retrieval. For subjective evaluation, on the other hand, we watch the actions of the user on the search results presented before him in response to his query, and infer the feedback of the user there from. We show our results pertaining to 7 public search engines and 15 queries.

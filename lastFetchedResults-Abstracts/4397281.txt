It is necessary to select a proper robotic system, otherwise it will reduce the quality of the system that affects the company´s production. It leads to the productivity and profitability reduction. Several factors should be taken into account for the selection of a effective robotic system. It is considered to be capital intensive because of their investment decisions and generally they are provided by group of experts from various operational backgrounds in a company. In spite of this knowledge, in the literature many of the models for the selection of the robot consider that there is only one decision maker. In this research, a model for robot selection includes the inputs from number of decision makers. Fuzzy techniques method´s different form is the base for this model. For the selection of robots, both the objective and subjective factors are considered. The aim of this research is to define how the fuzzy models are utilized in the selection of robotic system.

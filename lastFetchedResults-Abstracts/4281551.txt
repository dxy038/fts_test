The paper proposes a method to examine multi-objective reconfigurability of an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) supply chain to flexibly adopt dynamically changing environmental restrictions and market situations. A discrete event simulation technique is applied to evaluate economic, environmental and delivery performance of a supply chain. Multiple-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) enables us to refine optimal reconfiguration rules from a large number of alternatives available in operational level. Simulation results show that the proposed method is able to evaluate reconfigurability to cope with growing environmental restrictions, while considering side effects on economic and delivery performance due to the reconfiguration

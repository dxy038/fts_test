Objective (s): Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) is one of the major public health problems, and since in most patients with chronic disease, quality of life is lower than the general population, and improving and maintaining quality of life in these patients requires serious family support, this study was to determine the effect of a family-centered empowerment model on quality of life in dialysis patients referring to a teaching hospital in Zahedan, Iran.
Methods: This quasi-experimental study was performed on 100 hemodialysis patients referring to the dialysis department of a teaching hospital. Patients were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received the family-centered empowerment model in four steps: perceive threat, self-efficacy through problem solving, self-esteem through educational participation and evaluation in four sessions. The data collected by Kidney Disease Quality of Life -Short Form questionnaire at baseline and one and two months after intervention by both groups. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 22 using Chi-square, independent t-test, ANOVA with repeated measures. 
Results: There was a significant difference between intervention group and control group in the mean score of specific dimensions (P = 0.01) and total quality of life (P = 0.005) in one and two months after the intervention and the mean score of the general dimensions of quality of life in two months after the intervention (P = 0.006). The repeated measures analysis of quality of life showed that changes in quality of life score in the two groups were not the same and this indicated that the increase in the quality of life score in the intervention group was significantly higher than the control group (P  < 0.001). 
Conclusion: The implementation of the family-centered empowerment model could improve the quality of life of patients in hemodialysis patients.

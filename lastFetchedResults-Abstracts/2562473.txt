Background and Objective: Dewatered sewage sludge is a by-product of wastewater treatment process which can cause health and environmental problems if not properly managed. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of composting of Yazd WWT dewatered sludge with windrow method using different treatments.

Materials and Methods: In this study, the dewatered sewage sludge was mixed with two treatments of agricultural wastes (straw) and green waste (leaves), respectively. The mixture was done based on weight ratio of 20:1 and 10:1 (agricultural waste: dewatered sludge, and green waste: dewatered sludge) to achieve a ratio of C/N:20. The windrows were built with a length of 2 m, width of 75 cm and height of 1.5 m. Composting process was controlled by measuring the temperature, humidity, volatile solids, ash, pH, EC, organic carbon and estimating the C/N ratio. The results were compared with those of the Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran.

Results: After 100 days of composting, C/N ratio was 13.08&plusmn;6.25 in the treatment with green waste and reached to 15.46&plusmn;5.35 in the treatment with agricultural waste. The amount of volatile solids decreased to 19.8&plusmn;14.01% and 20.71&plusmn;16.06% in the treatments with green waste and agricultural waste, respectively. The amount of EC had an increasing trend in both treatments.

Conclusion: composting with both treatments was led to an improvement in indicators of organic fertilizers in dewatered sewage. However, the windrow containing green waste reached to the mature compost standards sooner than the windrow containing agricultural waste.

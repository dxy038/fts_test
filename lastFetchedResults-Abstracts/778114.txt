Owing to the incremental demands for
electrical energy, distributed generation (DG) sources are
becoming more important in distribution systems.
Locations and capacities of DG sources have profoundly
impacted on the system losses in a distribution network.
In this paper, a novel Strength Pareto Evolutionary
Algorithm (SPEA) is represented for optimal location and
sizing of DG on distribution systems. The objective is
minimizing network power losses, better voltage
regulation and improves the voltage stability within the
security constraints in radial distribution systems. Two
different systems, 33 and 69 bus systems, are used to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methodology. The results are compared with other
evolutionary methods like GA and COA through some
performance indices to indicate its flexibility.

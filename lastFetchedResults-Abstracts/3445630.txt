The integrated starter alternator is an AC alternator with an electronic rectifier in which the functions of the starting engine and the generation of electric power are fulfilled by one electric machine on a vehicle, instead of two separate electric machines as in a traditional automotive vehicle. The objective of this article is to provide a guideline to ISA engineers and other automotive engineers as well as people who are interested in the mild-hybrid electric vehicles. The differences and similarities in the machine design of two ISA systems namely the crankshaft ISA and belt-driven alternator starters (BAS) are also addressed in this article

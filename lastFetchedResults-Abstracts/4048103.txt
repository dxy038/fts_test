The UIE/IEC flicker characteristics of a three-phase power system which includes resistance welders are evaluated in this paper. Welder operation produces cyclic flicker which leads to customer complaints. An adaptive VAr compensator (AVC) has been installed to reduce flicker. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the AVC and to set the stage for the analysis of alternative control strategies, a detailed computer model of the given power system, including the AVC, has been developed. The model also includes a simulation of the UIE/IEC flickermeter to determine the effectiveness of the AVC in an objective manner. The simulated system response is compared with actual system measurements revealing excellent agreement. The modeling methodology set forth provides an efficient and convenient means of evaluating complex flicker resulting in a simple measure of human irritability

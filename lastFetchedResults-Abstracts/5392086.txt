Shielding telecommunication, electronic and mobile systems from undesired electromagnetic radiation is a problem of great interest. The objective of a modelling work is to have the optimal solution with the least cost giving the most perfect isolation on a wide frequency band. Two solutions are developed. The first consists of isolation using crossed lines and the second consists of isolation using multilamina shielding. The propagation through each is discussed. A comparison is based on the criteria of optimisation of the shielding effectiveness in each case. Generally, these solutions are easy to achieve and can be used to reduce the electromagnetic perturbation in telecommunication systems.

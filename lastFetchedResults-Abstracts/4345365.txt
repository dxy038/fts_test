We investigate the problem of robust joint transmitter and receiver power allocation for uplink multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmissions. The channel model is assumed to have Rayleigh flat fading. The objective of power allocation is to minimize the total MSE each of which has limited transmit power. The problem is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem. In addition, we investigate robust joint transmitter and receiver power allocation with imperfect channel state information (CSI). The CSI error is assumed to be unknown but bounded by a constant. This problem is formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem with bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints. Numerical results indicate that, with imperfect CSI, the BER performance improvement obtained by taking robustness into account in the joint power allocation process.

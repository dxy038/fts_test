This paper deals with the control of a class of perfectly modelled linear hybrid systems which consist of two, in general coupled, subsystems one being continuous -time while the second one is digital. The discrete -time substate is jointly defined by the digital substate and the samples of the continuous substate while being driven by the sampled input. The control objective has a double nature and it consists of the achievement of separate continuous-time and discrete-time model-matching objectives with respect to two predefined stable reference models .

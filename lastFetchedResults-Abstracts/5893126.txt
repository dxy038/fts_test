The objective of this paper is to find out an optimal allocation of resources in emergency department (ED) via system simulation to smoothen the flow of ED. The construction of model that based on actual situation can demonstrate the waiting time and system time of patients in ED. Then, study the model and apply compatible with National Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale (NEDOCS) and OptQuest in Simul8 to increase the performance in ED and management of treated patients and thus increase the degree of satisfactions of patients. The results analysis shows that the overall performance in ED can be increased by 8% by new human resources allocation studied.

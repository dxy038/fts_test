Solution approaches to chance constrained programming (CCP) have been recently developed and applied in many areas for optimization under uncertainty. Due to the nonlinear model with multiple uncertain variables as well as multiple output constraints, CCP has not been directly applied to optimal power flow (OPF) under uncertainty. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce the CCP approach to OPF under uncertainty and analyze the computational complexity of the chance constrained OPF. Second, the effectiveness of implementing a back-mapping approach and a linear approximation of the nonlinear model equations to solve the formulated CCP problem is investigated. Load power uncertainties are considered as multivariate random variables with correlated normal distribution. Based on both the nonlinear and the linearized model, results of a five-bus system and the IEEE 30-bus test system are presented to demonstrate the scope of chance constrained OPF.

This paper proposes two sets of topologies for single-phase to three-phase four-wire ac-dc-ac power conversion. All proposed configurations are characterized by reduction in the number of switches. The first set includes five configurations using ten power switches, while the second one includes six configurations using eight power switches. Such configurations are conceived for supplying three-phase four-wire loads and to guarantee bidirectional power flow between grid and load. Besides collecting different configurations, this paper proposes a synchronization technique, which can be applied for configurations with shared leg. The overall control strategy for providing dc link voltage control, grid current control, and PWM generation are presented. Simulated and experimental results are presented as well.

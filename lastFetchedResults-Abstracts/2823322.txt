In this paper, iterative receiver analysis and design for non linear satellite channels is investigated. To do so, an EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart-based optimization is applied using two major assumptions: the equalizer outputs follow a Gaussian Mixture distribution since we use non-binary modulations and partial interleavers are used between the Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code and the mapper. Achievable rates, performance and thresholds of the optimized receiver are analysed. The objective in fine is to answer the question: Is it worth optimizing an iterative receiver for non linear satellite channels?

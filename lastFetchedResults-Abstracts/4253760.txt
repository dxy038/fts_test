A base-station antenna, which features both low sidelobe and variable beam tilt characteristics, is developed. A novel design objective pattern with many sidelobe ripples is proposed in synthesizing low sidelobe characteristics. A simple array group feed scheme is then proposed to realize a prescribed beam tilt angle, maintaining low sidelobe characteristics. The optimum group number is derived.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

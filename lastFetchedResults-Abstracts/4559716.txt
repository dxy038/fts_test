The authors present a conceptual multistate topology of a sinewave modulated DC low-frequency AC power conversion, conditioning and processing system, which incorporates a phase-shifting PWM series resonant inverter coupled cycloconverter cascade circuit (cycloinverter) with a high-frequency AC (HFAC) transformer link. It has instantaneous sinewave-modulated voltage regulation and compensation strategies, depending upon load disturbance and input DC voltage fluctuations, in addition to an instantaneous power regenerating regulation scheme. A feasible breadboard model using MOS-gate power transistor modules is demonstrated and experimentally tested for a high-power density AC miniuninterruptible power supply. This series resonant cycloinverter with an HFAC link, which includes the control function of a bidirectional power flow, is evaluated as an AC power supply system for telecommunication and space-station/aerospace energy utilizations.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

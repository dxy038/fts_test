Abstract 
Objective:The aim of this study was to determine family 
function and family structure ofparents who have son with 
disability based on the Circumplex Model of Marital and 
Family system in Tehran in 1390. 
Materials & Methods:In a descriptive study, 200 parents 
(100 families) who had a son withdisability, from elementary 
public school in Tehran was selected via multi-stage cluster 
sampling. Each parent completed the two parts questionnaire, 
demographic variables and family Adaptability and Cohesion 
Evaluation Scales III Olson & et al 1985 (FACESIII). 
Adaptability and cohesion dimension of family function and 
family structure perceived with parents were determined upon 
circumplex model. 
Results:Mothers rated their families more cohesive and less 
adaptive than fathers. Mother’s cohesion was (40.12) while 
father’s cohesion was (39.66), adaptability of mothers was 
(27.14) and adaptability of fathers was (27.89). Cohesion and 
adaptability scores in mothers and fathers were not 
statistically significant. It means understanding of both 
mothers and fathers about cohesion and adaptability is similar 
to each others. Most of the family structure perceived with 
parents were balanced and mid-range. There were no 
relationship between family structure and family function with 
type of disability of children. 
Conclusion:Adequate adaptability and cohesion in family is 
one of the most criteria for the healthy family function in the 
circumplex model and many other structural theories of 
family. Scale and model of circumplex model can be useful 
for family function and family structure assessment, cure 
planning and evaluation of outcome of family therapy.

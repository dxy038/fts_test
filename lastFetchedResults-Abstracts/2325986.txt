Context and objective: In recent decades, criminology theories have changed
all areas of criminal science and especially criminal procedure. Considering
the fact that police are known as the first role-playing institution and link
bridge between people and judicial system, the question is whether such an
institution is affected by criminology findings or not. In this article, after
describing the characteristics of traditional police and criticizing it from the
perspective of criminology theories, modern police and criticisms made on it,
will be discussed.
Methodology: The study has been conducted in descriptive-analytical method
and by means of library resources
Findings: During criminal law developments, such as other criminal
departments, have faced various developments. Such developments influenced
by criminology findings, have made fundamental changes in this institution in
long years. Like criminal justice system, police have tried to influence public
opinions only by emphasizing the immediate arrest of offenders and prevent
crime commission; but, inefficacy of the suppressive approach of criminal
law and police was followed by extensive criticisms of criminology schools
of thought, especially social reaction school of thought. Such criticisms made
wonderful changes in these areas. Modern police which is the product of these
criticisms emerged in two types: partnership-oriented and control-oriented.
Results: Iran has been influenced by international developments and
criminology findings in the domain of police duties and authorities and moved
toward society-oriented police which can be powerful arm of judicial system.
The impact of these developments on criminal procedure in ???? is tangible.

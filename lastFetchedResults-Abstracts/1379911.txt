Topologically optimized granular-solid structures from additive manufacturing processes have impending applications as lightweight load bearing structures. To facilitate application, a procedure for characterizing optimal structural performance is devised for the design optimization of ‘end-use’ functional structures. An approach capable of realizing this objective is presented and demonstrated for horizontal prismatic beams produced from Nylon-12 granular-solid polymer, by Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). It combines topology (or layout) optimization, calibration of material parameters, and finite element (FE) modelling. The metamorphic development (MD) method forms the basis of an adaptive growth and degeneration optimization by material distribution approach. Experimental measurements are used to calibrate a bimodulus constitutive Drucker–Prager (D–P) model. Simply-supported three-point bending (3PB) tests are used to assess the fidelity of optimized beams on the basis of numerically predicted performance.

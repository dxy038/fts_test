The objective of this work is to reduce the cost and improve the quality of terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) modules by developing automated high-throughput (5 MW/yr) processes for interconnecting crystalline silicon solar cells. A new automated processing system was developed for high-throughput, high-yield solar cell interconnection. The results of extensive processing evaluations with a range of different commercially produced cells are reported. Process yields typically exceeded 98%. No degradation in cell performance was observed. Modules made from cell strings fabricated with the new assembly system were subjected to accelerated environmental testing per IEC 1215 and IEEE 1262 standards. Testing consisted of thermal cycling, thermal and humidity-freeze cycling, and damp heat soaking. All modules passed these qualification tests, with an average power loss of only 2.3%

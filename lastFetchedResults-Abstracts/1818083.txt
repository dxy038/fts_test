RGD-CAP, a member of the fasciclin family, is expressed in the periodontal ligament (PDL). Since the PDL is continually subjected to mechanical forces from such orofacial functions as mastication, biting, speech and swallowing, the mechanical stimuli is thought to be associated with the expression of RGD-CAP. Furthermore, the adhesive functions of RGD-CAP may contribute to the maintenance or regeneration of PDL architecture. The objective of this study was to examine whether mechanical stimuli modulate the expression of RGD-CAP in the human PDL, and to examine the effects of recombinant RGD-CAP on the adhesion of PDL cells. During experimental tooth movement, the expression of RGD-CAP was significantly enhanced in the PDL. In vitro experiments with cultured PDL cells showed that the expression of RGD-CAP mRNA was significantly enhanced by mechanical tensile force of 15.4 kPa for 48 h. The induction of RGD-CAP mRNA, meanwhile, was completely inhibited by cycloheximide which is an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Furthermore, neutralising antibody against TGF-β also suppressed the mechanical induction of RGD-CAP. The adhesion of cultured PDL cells onto plates coated with recombinant RGD-CAP increased significantly compared with the controls. These findings suggest that RGD-CAP, induced by TGF-β expressed in response to mechanical stimuli, plays an important role in modulating the homeostasis of PDL.

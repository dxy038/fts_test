Objective
We sought to determine the levels of risk factors required to exceed threshold values of intermediate (≥ 10%) or high (> 20%) predicted 10-year risk for coronary heart disease using the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) Risk Assessment Tool.
Methods

Continuous risk factor values were entered into the risk assessment tool to examine levels of predicted 10-year risk. Both individual risk factors and the joint effects of varying multiple risk factors were systematically examined.
Results

Women only exceed 10% risk at ages ≥ 70 with single risk factors of HDL-cholesterol levels < 30 mg/dL or systolic blood pressure > 170 mm Hg. Women ≤ 65 only exceed 10% risk if they are smokers with low HDL-cholesterol levels. In contrast, single risk factors can cause men over 45 to exceed 10% or 20% predicted 10-year risk. Combinations of only modestly elevated risk factors cause many men to exceed 10% risk at ages ≥ 45, and to exceed 20% risk at ages ≥ 55.
Conclusions

Because such high-risk factor levels are required for men < 45years and women < 65 years to exceed ATP-III risk thresholds, additional means for risk communication may be needed for individuals with elevated risk factors in these age ranges.

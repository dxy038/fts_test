A genetic algorithm (GA) based approach for reliability placement of phasor measurement units (PMUs) in smart grid is proposed. The algorithm combines two conflicting objectives which are maximization of the reliability of observability and minimization of the number of PMU placements for ensuring full system observability. The multi-objective problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem and genetic algorithm approach is employed for solving the large scale bus systems. The optimization model is solved for IEEE 14, and 30 standard bus systems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by comparing results with exact algorithms for smaller problem sizes. The system reliability of observability is improved compared to traditional optimal PMU placement. The proposed approach achieves significant cost savings compared to available reliability based models in literature.

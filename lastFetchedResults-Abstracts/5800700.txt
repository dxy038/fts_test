Regression Testing is performed on already tested programs to ensure that modifications have not revealed defects into the unmodified portions of programs. Regression Test Suites are always growing due to addition of Test Cases. Many broken and redundant test cases are also part of regression test suites. Running the all regression test suite is always not feasible; therefore optimization of regression test suites is required to meet the constraints. In this work we proposed multi-objective optimization of regression test suites with Fuzzy Logic (Sugeno Model) for Black Box based testing methods. Proposed approach was implemented on two published case studies. Results indicates that optimization can be achieved by using Fuzzy Logic that is a safe technique for optimization and we can reduce the execution time and size of regression test suites up to 50%.

The work presented in this paper is part of the cooperative project Security for Future Networks (SecFuNet), which aims to develop a security framework for Cloud Computing. This framework introduces, among many services, authentication and authorization controls for Cloud Computing environments. The objective is to develop a highly secure identification scheme based on Authentication and Authorization Infrastructures. A particularly innovative aspect of SecFuNet is related to the global Identity Management (IdM) system. The proposed scheme is important for the security of the entire framework. The identification system is based on secure microcontrollers. One of the ambitious goals of SecFuNet is to demonstrate and experiment these proposals of IdM in order to reach a standard solution for identifying users and nodes in the SecFuNet architecture. The SecFuNet identity model addresses two kinds of elements: users and nodes. For each of them an identity platform is provided dealing with OpenID Server, and grids of secure elements.

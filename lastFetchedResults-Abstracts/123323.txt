Patients and methods: In this cross-sectional study during 3 yr the samples of malignant colorectal cancer presented in Gorgan endoscopy and pathologic centers were collected. Data evaluated by statistically method.
Result: There were 101 cases of malignant colorectal cancer. 61 cases were male and 40 cases were female. The mean age was 56Â±13.65 yr .13.9% of patient were <40 yr.

The most common symptom was abdominal pain, constipation and rectal bleeding. The time interval between onset of symptom to diagnosis of disease in 58 cases was>6 mth. Family history of cancer in 36 cases was positive. Right colon cancer in young patient was significantly more than older (p<0.05). Positive family history of cancer in right colon cancer was significantly more other than. Positive family history of cancer in young patient was more than other (p<0.05).

The main purpose of evaluation model of teaching quality is to help improving teaching. The rationality and fairness of conventional models have been doubted, as evaluation results are obtained using subjective weights. Therefore, a more scientific and reasonable evaluation model is needed. This paper introduces an evaluation model of teaching quality based on genetic algorithm. Objective weights obtained in this model guarantee the objectiveness and fairness of the evaluation result. Experimental results show that evaluation results of a same teacherÂ´s teaching in different classes are almost the same. This proves that the proposed model has good reliability.

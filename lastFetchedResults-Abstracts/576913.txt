Introduction & Objective: Children are excitable, restless and excited in response to pain. Most children predict pain by injecting and prevent it with non-adaptive behaviors combined with stress before the injection; they usually spent a lot of time for accepting injection.   
Materials & Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental study. 72 patients to the age group 5 to 12 years old in 14 months were randomly assigned to three groups. One group was control and two groups experimental. Control group received verbal routine education by nurses and experimental groups received a touch therapy and play with bubbles instrument. Tool collection was oucher scale. Data was collection with spss version 16. 
Results: 54.7% mails and 66.6% at age 5 -8 years old participated in the study. The mean intensity of pain was in the control group (18.9), touch therapy group (11.2) and bubbles instrument (10.7). There was a statistically significant reduction in pain of experimental groups (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant between experimental groups at reduction in pain (p > 0.05 (but there was a statistically significant between experimental groups and control group at reduction of intensity of pain (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: The use of distraction techniques is a useful method for reduction in pain intensity catheter insertion in children.

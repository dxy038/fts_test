In this paper, we study the minimum failure resource allocation (MFRA) problem of allocating virtual machines (VMs) across multiple optically interconnected data centers (DCs) with the objective of minimizing the total failure probability based on the information obtained from the optical network virtulization. We first describe the framework of resource allocation, formulate the MFRA problem, and prove that MFRA is NP-complete. We then provide ILP formulation to obtain the optimal solution for small scale problems and two heuristic algorithms, named Minimum SRG Cover (MSC) and Reliable DC Selection (RDS), to solve large scale problems. Numerical results show that both heuristics achieve results close to optimal solutions for small scale problems. Numerical results also show that although RDS has higher time complexity, it outperforms MSC especially when the requested VMs are small.

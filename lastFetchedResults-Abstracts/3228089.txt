Objective of this paper is to investigate whether the noise in attitude dynamics model and measurement model is Gaussian white noise process or not. This is important because if the assumption regarding the noise is wrong, this will lead to unreliable and inaccurate estimation. The residual between the standard model and the real data is computed and is analyzed using autocorrelation function via Minitab software. The result shows that the error in the attitude dynamics model is not Gaussian white noise, while the error in measurement model is Gaussian white noise.

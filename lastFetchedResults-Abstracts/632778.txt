This paper provides a closed-form optimal solution to the multi-objective model of the fair allocation of the gains obtained by cooperation among all players. The optimality of the proposed solution is first proved. Then, the properties of the proposed solution are investigated. At the end, a numerical example in inventory control environment is given to demonstrate its application and to compare obtained results with the ones of an existing method.

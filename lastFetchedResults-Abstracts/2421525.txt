The purpose of current article is survey of influence of psychodrama on treatment of ornithophobia. Psychodrama was introduced for the first time by Moreno in 1921 as one of innovative psychotherapy methods.     
This method is often used for treatment of psychological disorders with emotional disorders such as depression and interpersonal problems. Though in this research, researchers have used psychodrama to treat the Ornithophobia as an anxiety disorder. The research started with this important problem that whether psychodrama can be effective for treatment of Ornithophobia. This experimental research has tried to answer the mentioned problem. 
Ornithophobia was initially diagnosed in the patient using criteria of DSM IV-TR and then rate of the patient's fear was measured by a researcher-made test and a behavioral test –patient's encounter with a bird. This rate of the patient's fear and its changes was checked via two other tests, one of them in the middle of treatment and the other at the end.  Analyses in the first and second tests were respectively quantitative and quantitative-qualitative (heart pulse and observation on changes in face and behavior of patient). Treatment intervention which was psychodrama in this survey lasted eight sessions (2 hours per session), two sessions per week, and generally a month. 
Results of the tests and changes in the patient's behaviors (encountering with bird and touching it without symptoms of anxiety) showed that psychodrama was effective to treatment of the patient. 
This result is similar to former researches surveying the effectiveness of psychodrama on treatment of other psychological disorders. The result of this research shows that psychodrama can be used for treatment of animal’s phobia too. Although more researches with more number of subjects must be conducted in order to help psychotherapists to use this method with more confidence for treatment of their patients.

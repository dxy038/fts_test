This paper addresses the question of theoretical
versus practical performance of algorithms and data structures.
It describes an experiment the first author has been using in
his data structures course to achieve the primary objective of
comparing theoretical behavior of algorithms with their actual
performance. It also presents enhancements in performance evaluation
experiments and a general methodology that can be used
to develop experiments in senior or first-year graduate courses
in data structures, algorithm analysis, software engineering, and
operating systems.

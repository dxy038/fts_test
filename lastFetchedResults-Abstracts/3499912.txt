A knowledge-based expert system for generator maintenance scheduling is presented. In the proposed system, generator maintenance scheduling (GMS) is considered as a constrained optimization problem. For different system operation conditions the objective function varies. An operation index is presented to determine an appropriate strategy for a decision-making process. The Taiwan Power Company (TPC) implementation is described. Tests for TPC cases in 1986 and 1987 are presented using the developed prototype GMS expert system. The results can meet TPC GMS requirements, which were still based on manual approaches and other conventional methods. The solution feasibility is discussed

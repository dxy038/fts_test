Objective(s): Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are one of the most widely used nanomaterials recently. Despite the wide application of nanomaterials, there is limited information concerning their impact on human health and the environment. This study aimed to find the effects of Ag-NPs (40 nm) on blood serum, liver and kidney tissues of homing pigeons (Columbia livia).Materials and Methods: Columba livia, in vivo model used in ecotoxicity experiments were gavaged 3 times daily with 75 and 150 ppm of Ag-NPs within 14 days. A group of 30 Pigeon were randomly divided into three groups: Ag-NPs exposed and control groups (n=10). Data analysis was counducted by performing one-way variance (ANOVA) in SPSS.v.16.0                                                                         Results: The results of this study illustrated that in the enzyme activity of Glutathione S –transferase (GST), Aspartate amino transferase (AST), Alanine amino transferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenas (LDH) there is a significant difference between treatment groups with Ag-NPs and the control group. Also, lipid peroxidation (LPO) analysis and catalase activity CAT) suggest Ag-NPs cause the main damage to the liver tissue. On the other hand: Ag-NPs have toxic and harmful effects in both concentrations (75 and 150 ppm), and cause LPO induction, oxidative stress and increase of biomarkers of liver necrosis in under treatment pigeons.Conclusion: The results of this study show that the organism’s exposure to Ag-NPs cause toxicity that is dose-dependant. in this study, the highest damage was observed in the liver. However, this issue will have to be considered more extensively in further studies.

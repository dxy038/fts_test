As the worldÂ´s aging population intensifying, the health of elderly becomes increasingly important. So we present a health perception and management system in order to improve the health services of elderly. RFID is chosen to achieve the data transmission obtained by the health sensors because of their mobility. The proposed system can provide an objective basis of medical diagnosis for doctors and a convenient website for the elderly to know their health and living surroundings. Furthermore, it can detect the emergencies of the elderly in time and make a necessary tip immediately.

A PV grid-connected power system with a small battery bank has been set up in a rural district of North Thailand in order to demonstrate a 2-mode operation concept. The objective is to gain experience on the PV grid-connected concept without battery storage. However, due to the evening peak demand and a rather weak distribution grid which is typical in rural areas, a small battery bank is still required to enable maximum energy transfer to the grid, for the time being, before moving fully to the no-battery operation mode. The analyzed data seem to indicate possible a performance improvement by re-arranging the number of PV modules and the battery in the string

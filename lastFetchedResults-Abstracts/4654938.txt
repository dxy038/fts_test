In this paper we present an approach especially designed to solve the real world problem of Anesthesiology Nurse Scheduling (ANSP) at a French public hospital, where the anesthesiology nurses are one of the most shared resources. We propose a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to solve the ANSP. We compare our technique with previous results obtained using Integer Programming and Constraint Programming. The objective is the same for all methods: to maximize fairness of the schedule.

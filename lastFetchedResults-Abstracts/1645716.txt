Inroduction & Objective: Peptic ulcer, from histological point is known as mucosal necrosis factor. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Alfalfa hydroalcoholic vegetive arial organs extract on gastric ulcer induced by acetic acid in Rat.
Material and Methods: In this experimental study, 60 wistar rats weighting approximately (200-250g) were randomly divided into 4 groups; control, sham (normal salin), experiment 1 (extract of dose 250 mg/kg body weight) and experiment 2 (extract of dose 500 mg/kg body weight).

Results: Results showed that the hydroalcoholic extract of Alfalfa caused a significant increase in gastric ulcer healing in experimental groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.05). Average number of neutrophils and macrophages during the fourth day and average number of fibroblast  in the fourth and seventh days showed a significant increase and in other days had decreased compared to the sham and control groups (P < 0.05).

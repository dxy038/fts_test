For dc-dc boost converters, this paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm, which directly manipulates the switch, thus not requiring a modulator. The proposed control scheme is implemented as a current-mode controller, implying that two control loops are employed, with the inner loop being designed in the framework of MPC. Two different objective functions to be minimized are formulated and investigated. As a prediction model, a hybrid model of the converter is used, which captures both the continuous and the discontinuous conduction mode. The proposed control strategy achieves very fast current regulation, while exhibiting a modest computational complexity. Simulation and experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

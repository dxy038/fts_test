Fourier transformed spectroscopy (FTIR) for evaluation internal structures of
biological macromolecules has been recently developed as a quick and non
destructive method. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of
stage of maturity of alfalfa hay (early bud, late bud and early flower) on FTIR
vibration spectroscopy of lipid molecular structures. Structural characteristics of the CH2 and CH3 asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands in typical infrared
molecular spectrum in alfalfa samples (n=60) were revealed using principle
component and cluster analysis. These analysis methods distinguished differences
of lipid molecular structures between alfalfa hay at early bud and early flower
stage while no differences distinguished between alfalfa at early bud and late bud
or at late bud and early flower stage. These results indicate molecular structure of
lipids in alfalfa hay affected by stage of maturity from early bud to early flower

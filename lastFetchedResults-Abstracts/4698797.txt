To improve the emergency management of traffic accidents on expressway network, a path selection method for emergency rescue is proposed in this paper. This method is mainly made up of the following three modules: data collection, rescue path selection and results generation. In the data collection module, the real-time information related to the decision of path selection is collected. In the rescue path selection module, considering the travel time uncertainty, a nonlinear integer programming model is established with the objective to minimize the travel time of emergency resources. Subsequently, the results generation module is introduced to solve the computationally difficulty of the model and generate the optimal solution. Finally, an example on Hangzhou expressway network is performed to demonstrate the applications of the path selection method to real-world problems.

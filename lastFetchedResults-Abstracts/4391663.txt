This paper provides a short overview on imagery interpretability rating scales, for both still imagery and motion imagery. The paper presents historical developments, the differences between subjective and objective imagery interpretability ratings and how these ratings became related to each other. For imagery based on visual, infra-red and radar, the possibilities and limitations are discussed. Motion imagery brings specific features and problems with it. The attempt is made to forecast the possible use of interpretability rating scales in future intelligence work.

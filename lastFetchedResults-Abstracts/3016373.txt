A SAW resonator design for NSPUDT substrates like Langasite with cut angles (0&#176;,14&#176;,22-24&#176;) has been developed. It consists of a natural single phase unidirectional transducer (NSPUDT) combined with a bidirectional split finger transducer within reflection gratings. The resonance frequency of the two port resonators is around 400 MHz depending on the used crystal cut The measured frequency response shows excellent agreement with a P-matrix based simulation of the devices. The NSPUDT resonators processed on different Langasite (La<sub>3</sub>Ga<sub>5</sub>SiO<sub>14</sub>) and Langatate (La<sub>3</sub>Ta<sub>0.5</sub>Ga<sub>5.5</sub>O<sub>14</sub>) wafers exhibit an insertion attenuation as low as 2.8 dB and loaded Q-values of up to 15000.

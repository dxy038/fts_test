The present paper seeks through objective analysis and logical inference to investigate the Islamic viewpoint about friendship in the light of the narrations of Infallible Imams (pbuh). Concerning the philosophy of friendship, which is compatible with the narrations, two civil and ontological patterns have been propounded, according to which, friendship is regarded as a necessity for leading a desirable social life and for man’s movement towards perfection and eternal felicity based on monotheism. These two patterns refer to the function a friendship which has a supportive intended to serve physical, material, mental and social needs and a friend which has a guiding function leading to monotheism and servitude of God. The narrations, emphasizing the necessity of investigation for selecting a friend points out to a number of methods and criteria for achieving this purpose and to the actions necessary for the permenance and promotion of friendship. Also, a hierarchy of friendship relationships is defined by the narrations, the highest of which is one’s friendship with prophets and Infallible Imams (pbuh) and friends of God.

Objective
As acute liver failure (ALF) and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) continue to
increase in prevalence, we will see more cases of hepatic encephalopathy.
Primary care physician are often the first to suspect it, since they are familiar
with the patient’s usual physical and mental status. This serious complication
typically occurs in patients with severe comorbidities and needs multidisciplinary
evaluation and care.
Hepatic encephalopathy should be considered in any patient with acute liver
failure and cirrhosis who presents with neuropsychiatric manifestations, decrease
level of consciousness (coma), change of personality, intellectual and behavioral
deterioration, speech and motor dysfunction.
Every cirrhotic patient may be at risk; potential precipitating factors should
be addressed in regular clinic visits. The encephalopathy of liver disease may
be prominent, or can be present in subtle forms, such as decline of school
performance, emotional outbursts, or depression.
“Subtle form” of hepatic encephalopathy may not be obvious on clinical
examination, but can be detected by neurophysiologic and neuropsychiatric
testing.

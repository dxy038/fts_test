With market segmentation and outsourcing widely recognized in real life, contractors who are responsible for multiple projects have to pay attention to how to do projects scheduling with various capacitated resources supplied by partners, wherein the objective of minimizing activities cost is meaningful. This problem is modeled as an integer programming model. A Parallel Schedule Schema is proposed to find some feasible solution and two priority rules related to the factors of activities cost are designed. Numerical test on an illustrative example shows that parallel schedule schema with these priority rules is feasible and the results with priority rule of related resource cost of activities are better than those with another priority rule.

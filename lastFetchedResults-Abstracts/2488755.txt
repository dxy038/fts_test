Objective: Detection of chromosomal translocations has an important role in diagnosis
and treatment of hematological disorders. We aimed to evaluate the 46 new cases of de
novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients for common translocations and to assess the
effect of geographic and ethnic differences on their frequencies.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) was used on 46 fresh bone marrow or peripheral blood samples to detect
translocations t (8; 21), t (15; 17), t (9; 11) and inv (16). Patients were classified using
the French-American-British (FAB) criteria in to eight sub-groups (M0-M7). Immunophenotyping
and biochemical test results of patients were compared with RT-PCR results.
Results: Our patients were relatively young with a mean age of 44 years. AML was relatively
predominant in female patients (54.3%) and most of patients belonged to AML-M2.
Translocation t (8; 21) had the highest frequency (13%) and t (15; 17) with 2.7% incidence
was the second most frequent. CD19 as an immunophenotypic marker was at a relatively
high frequency (50%) in cases with t (8; 21), and patients with this translocation had a
specific immunophenotypic pattern of complete expression of CD45, CD38, CD34, CD33
and HLA-DR.
Conclusion: Similarities and differences of results in Iran with different parts of the world
can be explained with ethnic and geographic factors in characterizations of AML. Recognition
of these factors especially in other comprehensive studies may aid better diagnosis
and management of this disease.

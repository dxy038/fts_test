This paper considers the schedule reconfiguration of multi - mode resource - constrained projects. Before a project starts, we assume that an optimal schedule of the project is obtained under the objective of minimizing the resource usage and hiring costs. This initial schedule serves as a baseline for the execution of the project. However during the project execution, the project can be subjected to several disruptions that may disturb the baseline schedule. Therefore, a reconfiguration must be performed to adjust the project schedule based on the observed disruptions. We develop a heuristic algorithm to calculate the update and reconfiguration strategy based on total cost minimization.

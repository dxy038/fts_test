In this paper, we present a voice conversion (VC) method that utilizes conditional restricted Boltzmann machines (CRBMs) for each speaker to obtain time-invariant speaker-independent spaces where voice features are converted more easily than those in an original acoustic feature space. First, we train two CRBMs for a source and target speaker independently using speaker-dependent training data (without the need to parallelize the training data). Then, a small number of parallel data are fed into each CRBM and the high-order features produced by the CRBMs are used to train a concatenating neural network (NN) between the two CRBMs. Finally, the entire network (the two CRBMs and the NN) is fine-tuned using the acoustic parallel data. Through voice-conversion experiments, we confirmed the high performance of our method in terms of objective and subjective evaluations, comparing it with conventional GMM, NN, and speaker-dependent DBN approaches.

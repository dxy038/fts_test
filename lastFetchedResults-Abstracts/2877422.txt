This paper reports how OptBees, an algorithm inspired by the collective decision-making of bee colonies, performed in the test bed developed for the Special Session &amp; Competition on Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization at CEC-2014. The test bed includes 30 scalable functions, many of which are both non-separable and highly multi-modal. Results include OptBeesÂ´ performance on the 10, 30, 50 and 100-dimensional versions of each function.

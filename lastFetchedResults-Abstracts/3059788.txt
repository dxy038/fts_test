The development of a humanoid robot within the scope of the collaborative research centre 588 has the objective of creating a machine that closely cooperates with humans. This development area presents a new challenge to designers. In contrast to industrial robots - for which mechanical rigidity, precision and high velocities are primary requirements - the key aspects here are a lightweight construction, prevention of hazards to users, and a motion space that corresponds to that of human beings. In order to meet these requirements, the robot must have manlike appearance, motion spaces and dexterity. Additionally, its kinematics should be familiar to the user, its motions predictable, so as to encourage inexperienced persons to interact with the machine. The design of the body of a mechatronical robot, which is intended to imitate the mechanical and sensory properties of humans, can only be realized in an intense iterative process. This article gives insight into the development processes of exemplary mechanical constructions, presently worked on at the University of Karlsruhe (TH). The design of single body parts and their improvement are presented. Details - why these improvements lead to a higher performance of the complete system - are discussed. This is a status report on current development in this area.

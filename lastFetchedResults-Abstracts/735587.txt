Purpose
Physicians lack objective outcome data to define the medically appropriate length of stay (LOS) for patients hospitalized with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH), resulting in wide variations in resource utilization and quality of care. A clinical practice guideline with the ability to assign relative risk for adverse events is proposed.
Methods
A comprehensive scoring system was derived from the literature by using four variables; hemodynamics, time from bleeding, comorbidity, and esophagoduodenoscopy findings. The discriminatory ability, potential safety, and impact on resource utilization of the clinical practice guideline was measured in a retrospective, observational study.
Results
Seventy percent of UGIH patients (349 of 500) achieved low-risk status according to the guideline, and, were therefore potentially suitable for early discharge from the hospital. If low-risk patients were discharged based upon the guideline, mean (± SD) hospital LOS would have been decreased from 4.8 ± 2.4 days to 2.7 ±1.4 days; mean reduction was 2.1 bed-days per patient (95% CI 1.8 to 2.3, P<0.001). LOS would have increased in 4% of cases. Adopting the guideline's recommendation of early discharge would have resulted in a 0.6% (95% CI 0.07 to 2.1) complication rate, with no worsening of quality of care, as judged by implicit review.
Conclusions
The proposed clinical practice guideline may safely reduce hospital LOS for selected low-risk patients with acute UGIH. Moreover, it also may reduce premature discharge of high-risk patients prone to life-threatening events.

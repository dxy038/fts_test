The existing maternity data management in government maternity clinics lags behind most other industries in new technology adoption. No electronic system exists to share maternity data between hospitals and clinics. The existing systems continue to rely on hardcopy logbooks to record maternity data. Therefore, maternity data management system utilizing cloud computing (E-Maternity) is proposed in this paper to enhance the existing service handling and management of maternity and baby development data in government maternity clinics. The main objective of E-Maternity is to provide a convenient method to manage the maternity data and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of existing services. Existing pregnancy related applications are discussed, and the architecture of the proposed system is presented. Furthermore, the system requirements and design of the proposed system are presented.

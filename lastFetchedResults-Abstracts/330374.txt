Objective:  The purpose of this study was to measure the viscosity of resin formulations and investigate the relationship between diluent percentage and temperature.

Methods: Resin formulations were prepared using UDMA and either TEGDMA or HEMA, or HPMA, as diluents at different percentages. Viscosities were obtained with a Bohlin Rheometer at 23°C for all formulations, and at 37 and 60°C for selected formulations.

Results: The viscosity of the formulations exhibited Newtonian behaviour and decreased as the percentage of the diluent monomer increased, especially up to 40% of diluent. Linear regressions relating log(viscosity) and mass percent diluent, were obtained in the range 20–80% diluent. Viscosity also decreased as the temperature increased. Activation energies were calculated from Arrhenius plots, and ranged from 16.2–23.4 kJ mol−1.

Significance: The viscosity of the resins controls the flow properties and thus has a significant effect on the deployment of the respective monomers.

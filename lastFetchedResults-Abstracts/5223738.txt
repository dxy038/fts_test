In 2002 advanced control systems completed a state of the art fully integrated distribution automation system. The project objective was to reduce outage restoration from an average of 58 minutes to less than 20 seconds over a wide network area, while also supporting various optimization functions and simulation. The solution included a fully integrated system including the master, substation RTUs, feeder FTUs, line switches, system software, and communications in a turnkey project. The suite of automation applications developed by ACS and the various integration options enable any utility to tailor essentially a standard set of products to be implemented as a fully integrated and highly functional real-time operational system. ACSÂ´ approach integrates a GIS as a source database with the real-time closed loop functions, dispatcher analysis functions, and management functions. The scope of the new system can originate from a standalone localized feeder automation nodes to a fully integrated operations control center at the enterprise level. This paper describes the approach and experience gained in implementing automatic network reconfiguration from its operation to maintenance for a large Pacific Basin Project.

In this paper, the application performance characteristics of high-frequency isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter (IBDC) based on SiC-DMOS and SiC-SBD samples provided by ROHM SEMICONDUCTOR Inc. are analyzed. The paper gave the basic design procedure of SiC-based converter, and established the mathematical model of power losses by analyzing the switching characteristic of the converter. On this basis, the power loss and efficiency characteristics of the SiC-based converter were analyzed and the related experimental results were presented. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the SiC-based converter has better performance than the Si-based converter; it will have a wide application prospect in the future smart electricity network.

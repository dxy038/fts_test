Introduction & Objective: High platelet counts are occasionally seen in patients suffering from advanced cancers. The aim of this study was to compare the preoperative platelet counts and the frequency of thrombocytosis in cases of more advanced esophageal carcinoma with those of lower stages of the disease.
Materials & Methods: In a cross-sectional study, platelet counts were measured before surgery in 140 patients with primary esophageal carcinoma. Thrombocytosis was defined as platelet count >/=400x10(9)/L. Differences between thrombocytosis frequencies were analyzed using the chi Square or fisher's exact tests, and pretreatment platelet counts were compared using Kruskal- Wallis one-way analysis of variance and Mann- Whitney U-tests.
Results: In patients with advanced disease, pretreatment platelet counts were significantly more than patients in lower stages and thrombocytosis were more common among patients with advanced disease.
Conclusions: Preoperative thrombocytosis was found more frequently in patients with advanced stages of esophageal carcinoma.

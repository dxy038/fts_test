Usage of wireless portable handheld devices has seen tremendous growth and the trend is expected to continue due to an increasing activity on social networks. A large percentage of communication activity on these devices involve either sharing or downloading of multimedia content. These devices require efficient usage of both bandwidth as well as battery and yet do not compromise the quality of multimedia content. To achieve this goal we have proposed a multi-objective cross-layer optimization framework, which not only achieves optimal network lifetime and utility but also provides optimal video quality. We introduce the notion of distortion margin to achieve a certain level of performance robustness that can be exchanged with other performance parameters including lifetime and bandwidth utilization. The appropriate choice of the objective function, required to implement distortion margin, is obtained by applying sensitivity analysis. A distributed implementation is presented that achieves an optimal performance tradeoff among the contending objectives as verified by the performance evaluation results.

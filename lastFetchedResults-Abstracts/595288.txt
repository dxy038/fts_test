Objective: to evaluate the results of locally made interlocking nail in closed tibial diaphyseal fracture.Material and Methods: This observational hospital based study on 30 patients was done from March 2004 to February 2006 at Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar. Adults with type A or B close diaphysial fracture of tibia located at 7 cm below the knee joint and 4 cm above the ankle joint of less than one week duration were included while open and pathological fractures were excluded from the study. Frequency distribution was analyzed with the help of Microsoft Excel and presented in graphs.Results: Average age of patient was 35 years. Male were 26(86.66%) and female were 4(13.33%). There were 12(40%) type A and 18(60%) type B fractures. Twenty seven (90%) factures were due to motor vehicle accident and 3(10%) were due to fall. The average healing time was 19 weeks with no mal-union. Fifteen (50%) fractures healed in 16 weeks, 9(30%) healed in 20 weeks, 5 (16.66%) healed in 24 weeks and 1 (3.33%) healed in 30 weeks time. Knee pain was observed in 21 cases. One (3.33%) patient had 10o restricted dorsiflexion while 1(3.33%) patient has 5o restricted eversion and inversion. Three (10%) patients had 10o restricted knee flexion while 1 (3.33%) patient had 20o restricted knee flexion. One nail (3.3%) got infected & was removed. Conclusion: Interlocking nail of tibia with reaming has favourable results in managing tibial diaphyseal fracture in our set up.

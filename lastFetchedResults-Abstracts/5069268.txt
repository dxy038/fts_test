The traditional set covering models did not consider the equity of users that carried by each set. We developed a new method to solve that for the Integrated Delivering System (IDS) in medical service in Taichung city. This method requires grouping the clinics in equal market share in a way that satisfy the equity conditions given. It uses Voronoi blocks as market share for each clinic within the study area and calculates the house and clinic ratios as the equity conditions. For each scan, the selected block merges with one of the adjacent blocks using five conditions with different weights. This process continues until the objective functions are met. This model opens up a new way of thinking for set covering by grouping the block objects to obtain optimal result. The result is workable and can be reproduced by computer program if the same data set existed.

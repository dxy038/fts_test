It is the general premise of this paper that
multi-scale modeling with multi-physics balance and constitutive
representations of the thermal, electrochemical,
mechanical, and chemical phenomena that make a fuel cell
work is an essential foundation for design and manufacturing.
It is further claimed that such modeling enables a
systems-to-science engineering approach that will accelerate
technology greatly, reduce cost, improve durability,
and bring fuel cell systems to life in our society. It is the
objective of this paper to identify and provide a few
foundation stones of understanding for such an engineering
foundation for fuel cell technology, especially that part of
the foundation that relates to multi-scale modeling of
materials.

This paper presents a proposal for Isolated Bidirectional battery charger. The charger in study has capacity to supply power 1.34KVA in a line of 400V<sub>DC</sub> and battery charging capability up to 5A at 192V<sub>nom</sub>. For isolation of the batteries and improve energy efficiency in the conversion was used Planar transformer coupled to the switching transistors IGBTs for low losses. To control the energy flow in both directions was used Full-Bridge Converter suitable for the power level required at 400V bus. The charging of the batteries can be integrated into a network-smart grid, composed of renewable energy sources like photovoltaic and / or wind, or be used in UPS systems "double conversion", whose load is less fault tolerant power.

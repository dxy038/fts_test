Nutrition education with regard to increasing or decreasing consumption of nutrients to improve health may not produce the desired effect if consumers incorrectly perceive their intake of individual nutrients. The objective of this study was to determine if the elderly are cognizant of their nutrient intake. Subjects (n=16), averaging 68 years of age, recorded their food intake for one day. Subjects examined their food record and estimated intake of seven nutrients (vitamin A, calcium, iron, cholesterol, saturated fat, total fat and fiber) as a percentage of the Recommended Dietary Allowances or the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The elderly accurately perceived their calcium intake. They estimated 89% and consumed 91% of the recommended level. However, subjects underestimated total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. They consumed 21%, 65%, and 30% more total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, respectively, than estimated. Iron and vitamin C intakes were both significantly (P≤0.05) underestimated, while fiber was significantly (P≤0.05) overestimated. Internet-based nutrition analysis software may provide a cost-effective way to evaluate the degree to which the elderly and other population groups comprehend the nutritional quality of their present diets.

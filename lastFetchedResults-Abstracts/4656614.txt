A wideband interference cancellation using adaptive antenna arrays is the objective of this paper. A comparison between the performance of the adaptive interference canceller with least mean square error (AIC-LMS) and the higher order statistics (AIC-HOS), fourth order cumulant based algorithm is presented. The performances of both algorithms are compared through computer simulations. The effects of the number of interference sources, and the change of the direction of arrival and the frequency band of the interference sources on the performance of the adaptive interference canceller are evaluated. It is found that the AIC-HOS algorithm exhibits a better adaptation speed and greater detection capability of the desired signal than that of the LMS one.

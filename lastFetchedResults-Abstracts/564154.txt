In his Critique of Judgment, Kant defines ideal beauty as “expressing a rational idea in one entity”. He confines ideal beauty to the human being, and in such expression, pays attention to the ideas and ends of practical reason (morality), and more than that, he focuses on the product of the culture of discipline which is the result of human use of “objective purposiveness” in nature. The question is whether such a consideration contradicts Kant’s claims about judgment of taste and its subtleties. 
The author in this article, after describing the concepts of ideal of beauty and culture of discipline in Kant, tries to show that although the ideal of beauty is not produces on the basis of subjective teleology, and therefore, should not be called beautiful, or at least is not a pure beauty, it has a relation to the common idea of beauty, and hence can be considered beautiful and an object for aesthetic studies.

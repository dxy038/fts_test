The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of crossbreeding Awassi ewes with either Charollais or Romanov sires, on
pre-weaning lamb production as reflected by reproductive performance and milk production in the ewes. Two hundred and five, 3- to
6-year-old multiparous ewes of three breeds were allocated to three groups [Awassi (A; n = 56), F1 Romanov×Awassi (RA; n = 78)
and F1 Charollais×Awassi (CA; n = 71)]. Upon lambing, ewes and their offspring were placed in a large pen in which they remained
until the end of the trial. Body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS) of the ewes and the BW of the lambs were recorded
weekly from birth to weaning at 70 days of age. Milk production was recorded weekly from parturition to weaning. Pregnancy rates
were not influenced by breed-type. Multiple births and the fecundity of ewes were greater (P < 0.05) in the RA group, compared
to the A and CA groups—while the weaning percentage was similar between the breeds. Lamb birth and weaning weights were
similar, while the kg lamb born per kg ewe lambed was greater (P < 0.05) in the RA group, compared to the CA group. The CA
ewes recorded a higher BW (P < 0.01) and BCS (P < 0.01) than the other breed groups. Awassi ewes produced more milk (P < 0.01)
throughout the observation period. Milk ash percentage was higher (P < 0.05) in the CA group, while the percentage of crude
protein and dry matter was similar for the different groups. Results of the present study indicate that crossbreeding of Awassi ewes
with Charollais and Romanov breeds decreased milk production in the progeny, without affecting lamb growth. The crossbreeding
of Awassi with Charollais resulted in improved BW and BCS, while the crossbreeding of Awassi ewes with Romanov resulted
in improved reproductive performance of the crossbreds. Crossbreeding Awassi ewes with exotic rams can thus be conducted to
increase the number of lambs produced per ewe.

This paper proposes a method to determine the optimal allocation of distributed superconducting magnetic energy storage system (D-SMES) capacity for enhancing the transient stability of power system. A kind of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is adopted to find the optimal allocation when a certain number of D-SMES devices are deployed in the certain location of the system. The index of trajectory of generator speed after large disturbance is adopted to indicate the stability of power system. Then, the simulation with the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) three-machine nine-bus power system is evaluated.

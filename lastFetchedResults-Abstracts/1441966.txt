A dynamic formulation for the analysis of thick elastic plates that is based on Reissner's theory is presented. The main objective is to include in the formulation the contribution of a new term of additional translational inertia that is commonly disregarded, and study its influence on the responses of thick elastic plate theory. Moreover, the boundary element method (BEM) formulation used to carry out time-domain analysis employs the static fundamental solution of the problem, while for the time marching the Houbolt's acceleration operator is considered. Thus, a system of equations is solved for the boundary and the domain simultaneously. To verify the importance of the new terms, the present methodology is compared with responses found in the literature.

In this paper, proper capacitors on/off status and suitable load tap changer (LTC) positions for the 24 hours in the next day will be proposed. To reach this goal, a modified Simulated Annealing (SA) method is designed to reach a dispatch schedule for the capacitors and LTC using a multi-objective fuzzy representation of the problem. The dispatch schedule is refined in each optimization step of SA using goal programming method. To demonstrate the effectiveness and application of the proposed method, reactive power/voltage control is performed on a distribution substation in IEEE 33-bus test system. Results from the example show that a proper dispatch schedule for capacitors and LTC can be reached by the proposed method.

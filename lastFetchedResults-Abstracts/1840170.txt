To analyze the clinical significance of copy number gain and loss at chromosome region 5q21∼q23, 105 nonpapillary renal cell carcinomas (RCC) were examined by interphase cytogenetic analysis using the dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. DNA probes for D5S23 (5p15.2), cCI5-243 (5q21.2∼q21.3), and cCI5-215 (5q22.3∼q23.2) were used, and the signals for cCI5-243 and cCI5-215 were compared with those for D5S23 as the numerical control. Aneusomy (three or more copies) of chromosome 5 was found in 22 tumors (21.0%). Aneusomy was significantly correlated with loss at 5q21∼q23, while disomy with gain at 5q21∼q23 (P&lt;0.05). Aneusomy was also significantly related to poor disease-specific survival (P&lt;0.01). Gain and loss at cCI5-243 were seen in 34 (32.4%) and 59 (56.2%) tumors, respectively, while gain and loss at cCI5-215 occurred in 55 (52.4%) and 45 (42.9%) cases, respectively. The frequency of gain at cCI5-215 was significantly correlated with a smaller tumor diameter (7 cm or less, P&lt;0.05), while loss with a larger one (&gt;7 cm, P&lt;0.05). Both loss at cCI5-215 and aneusomy of chromosome 5 were significantly related to poor disease-specific survival (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, alterations of chromosome 5 (including allelic loss of 5q22.3∼q23.2) could be a useful genetic marker for predicting the patient prognosis of RCC.

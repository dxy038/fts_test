Modular design technologies play a vital role in the success of mass customization. A method based on SA (simulated annealing) algorithm for developing modular product family is presented in this article. Combining the functional, physical and assistant characteristics, the fuzzy relationship among components is quantitatively described. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is then used to distribute weights for the establishment of fuzzy relationship matrix. A simulated annealing technique is further applied to optimize the objective function typified by maximizing the sum of similarities among components, so as to obtain the optimal modular product family. Finally, a case of speed reducer is given to validate the process of modularizing product family.

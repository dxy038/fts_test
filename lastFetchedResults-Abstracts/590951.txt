Objective:The present survey aims to study the effect of teaching the meta-cognitive program of Panoura and Philippou on the improvement of problem- solving performance, the studentsâ€™ meta- cognitive knowledge and skill of students with a disability of math learning.
Method: Methodology has been empirical.  The statistical population of this survey was all the students of the4th grade of elementary schools in Najaf Abad in 2010-2011who had a disability of math learning. To do this survey, 20 students with a disability of math learning were selected and assigned to an experimental and  a control group (n1=10 and n2=10). The tools used included a meta-cognition questionnaire of Panoura and Philippou, the checklist of math disorder diagnosis of Tabrizi, Raven intelligence scale and a math academic performance test. Intervention related to teaching the meta-cognition program of Panoura and Philippou was applied on the experimental group. The data obtained have been analyzed by using a statistical method of co-variance.
Results: The results of co- variance analysis showed that there is a significant difference (P  0.01) between the average grades in pre-test and post-test. 
Conclusion and recommendations: Altogether, the findings of this survey indicate that teaching the meta-cognitionprogram of Panoura and Philippou is effective on problem- solving performance and the metacognition knowledge and skill of students with a disability of learning.  It is suggested that the use of teaching Panoura&Philippou'smeta -cognitive program can be considered as a useful method for program- solving problems in student's with math learning disability.

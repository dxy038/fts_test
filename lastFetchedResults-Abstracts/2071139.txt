This objective study was to determine the
prevalence of brucellosis-positive cattle and identify the
possible associated risk factors in dairy cattle herds. The
study design, serum samples and information regarding farm
properties were as used within the context of the National
Program for Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Control and
Eradication, for studying bovine brucellosis in the state of
Maranh?o. In total 736 animals originating from 96 herds
were enrolled in the study. Of the analysed samples 3.94% of
animals tested positive for Brucella, the resulting herd
prevalence was 30.43%. The variables considered to be risk
factors for infection were: number of animal movements,
pasture used in common with other farms, abortion residues
left in the field, animals over 64 months of age and
acquisition of cattle with the purpose of fattening. Brucellosis
presents prevalence low and that factors relating to the
characteristics of the farm properties and management of the
animals are associated with the disease.

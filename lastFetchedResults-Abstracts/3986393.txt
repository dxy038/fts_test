Total-liquid ventilation (TLV) is an innovative experimental method of mechanical-assisted ventilation in which lungs are totally filled and then ventilated with a tidal volume of perfluorochemical liquid by using a dedicated liquid ventilator. Such a novel medical device must resemble other conventional ventilators: it must be able to conduct controlled-pressure ventilation. The objective was to design a robust controller to perform pressure-regulated expiratory flow and to implement it on our latest liquid-ventilator prototype (Inolivent-4). Numerical simulations, in vitro experiments, and in vivo experiments in five healthy term newborn lambs have demonstrated that it was efficient to generate expiratory flows while avoiding collapses. Moreover, the in vivo results have demonstrated that our liquid ventilator can maintain adequate gas exchange, normal acid-base equilibrium, and achieve greater minute ventilation, better oxygenation and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction, while nearing flow limits. Hence, it is our suggestion to perform pressure-controlled ventilation during expiration with minute ventilation equal or superior to 140&amp;nbsp;mL&#183; min<sup>-1</sup>&#183;kg<sup>-1</sup> in order to ensure PaCO<sub>2</sub> below 55 mmHg. From a clinicianÂ´s point of view, pressure-controlled ventilation greatly simplifies the use of the liquid ventilator, which will certainly facilitate its introduction in intensive care units for clinical applications.

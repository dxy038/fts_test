The effect of perlite loading on the thermal
resistivity, solar reflectance and indirect tensile strength of
Nanostructured Cementitious Binder is studied. The main
objective of this research is to constitute structural lightweight
surface compounds and to improve their thermal
resistivity and reflectivity with suitable mechanical performances
as a surface compound. Portland White Cement
(PWC) was partially substituted by nano clay. An optimum
blend of type I PWC, and nano clay was determined based
on indirect tensile strength. The perlite dosage was added
to the optimum cement-nano clay blend at different ratios
(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70%) by weight. Superplasticizer
with different ratios was used to study the
performance of the 70% perlite mixture. The mixes were
prepared using water of consistence. The wet compounds
were molded in PVC molds and left for 24 h, then demolded
and cured in humid air (20 Â± 1  C & 100% RH)
for 28 days. The molds are 50 mm in diameter and 27 mm
height. The thermal resistivity and indirect tensile strength
of the different compounds were evaluated for the cured
samples at 7 and 28 days. It was found that the 2% nano
clay improved the indirect tensile strength of the neat
PWC. As expected the addition of the perlite has reduced
the indirect tensile strength but increased the thermal
resistivity of the compound by 250%. The increase of
perlite loading has not affected the solar reflectivity of the
compound. Sokalan HP 80 polycarboxylate ether superplasticizer
was successfully used to recover about 50% of
the loss in the indirect tensile strength of the newly
formulated Nanostructure Perlite Cementious Surface
Compounds (NPCSC) containing 70% perlite loading

In this paper, an auxiliary power supply scheme using photovoltaic power generation for an air conditioning system and a novel control strategy are proposed. The proposed auxiliary power supply system employs a boost power converter, a bidirectional power converter and photovoltaic arrays. The boost power converter, controlled by a predictive control strategy, provides maximum power tracking (MPT) state on the photovoltaic (PV) arrays as well as power generation facility function on the AC utility grid. Furthermore the bidirectional power converter controls the power flow balance between the loads and two different power sources according to the condition of the load power and the supplied power from photovoltaic arrays. It is shown that the maximum power tracking of the PV arrays, the unit power factor of AC utility grid and the descent input DC voltage regulation of the air conditioning system are achieved by the proposed predictive control strategy. The controller design procedure for the proposed approach is detailed. Simulation results on a laboratory prototype system are also discussed

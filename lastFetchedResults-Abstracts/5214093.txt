This paper addresses the issue of generating capacity adequacy in power systems with considerable share of wind generation. It shows on a hypothetical example derived from the WECC system (western US interconnection) how different percentages of wind penetration affect this adequacy. For this purpose, the popular LOLP-loss of load probability (or more accurately, LOLE-loss of load expectation) is used as an objective, probability based, index. It is compared to reserve margin, another popular, deterministic index. Two systems with the same reserve margin or largest unit reserve can have very different risks of being unable to serve the load. It is shown that this discrepancy exacerbates as wind penetration increases

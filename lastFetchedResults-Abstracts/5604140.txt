We propose a network-coding based scheme to protect multiple bidirectional unicast connections against adversarial errors and failures in a network. The end nodes of the bidirectional connections are connected by a set of shared protection paths that provide the redundancy required for protection. Suppose that n<sub>e</sub> paths are corrupted by an omniscient, computationally unbounded adversary. Under our proposed protocol, the errors can be corrected at all the end nodes with 4n<sub>e</sub> protection paths. More generally, if there are n<sub>e</sub> adversarial errors and n<sub>f</sub> failures, 4n<sub>e</sub> + 2n<sub>f</sub> protection paths are sufficient. The number of protection paths only depends on the number of errors and failures being protected against and is independent of the number of unicast connections.

The objective of the study was to decrease weaning age of calves kept under rural condition in order to reduce the cost of feeding calves in Shahrood area (located in Semnan province). One hundred forty-four calves were randomly assigned to a 3 2 factorial arrangement including 3 weaning age (60, 75  and 90 days) and sex (male and female). All calves were fed with a controlled diet from birth till 3 months of age and were fed ad-libitum from 3 to 6 months of age. Those calves belonged to treatments with weaning at 60 and 75 days, had received a starter diet till 3 months of age too, and the other calves consumed milk till 3 months of age. All the calves had open access to alfalfa. The calves were fed from 3 to 6 months of age with similar diet to evaluate the effects of the first period on the next growth. Consumption of milk, starter diet and alfalfa were calculated for each calve during the first period, and all the calves were weighted from born until 6 months of age monthly. Average daily weight gain of calves was not significant between first, second and the third months but was significant for fourth months, while the calves were weaned at 60 and 75 days of age showed higher weight gain in comparison with those were weaned at 90 days of age. Average daily weight gain of calves was decreased in third treatment during fourth month but was compensated in fifth and 6th months. As differences for average daily weight gain of calves were not significant between treatments from birth until six months of age, So, it could be suggest that in rural condition, it is possible to wean calves at the age of 2 months instead of 3 months or more, by using a starter diet from two weeks of age

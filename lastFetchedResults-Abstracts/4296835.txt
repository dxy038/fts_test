This paper describes aspects of the power electronics control of wave energy conversion. The objective of the power converter is to drive a switched reluctance linear machine which works as direct-drive power take off (DDPTO) system for a point absorber. FEM analysis and simulations of the electrical machine were taken into account in the design of the converter control strategy. Finally, laboratory testing will be described in the paper.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment efficiency of a gravel contact oxidation
treatment system which was newly constructed under the riverbed of Nan-men Stream located at the Shin Chu City of
Taiwan. The influent and effluent water samples were taken periodically for the analyses of pH, temperature, dissolved
oxygen, total suspended solids, five-day biological oxygen demand, NH;-N. The results showed that the average
removal rates of five-day biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids and NH:-N were 33.6% (between -6.7%
and 82.1%),56.3% (between -83.0% and 93.4%) and 10.7% (between -13.0% and 83.3%), respectively. The calculated
mean first order reaction rate constant for five-day biological oxygen demand was 4.58/day with a standard deviation
of 4.07/day and for NH:-N was 2. I5/day with a standard deviation of 5.68/day. Therefore, it could be said that this
gravel-contact-oxidation system could effectively remove biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and NH;N
in river water at a relatively short hydraulic retention time, although its pollutant treatment efficiency was not quite
stable. However, to reach better or more stable treatment efficiency, aeration might sometimes be necessary to increase
the dissolved oxygen in influent river water. And, longer hydraulic retention time of the system might also be required
to increase NH:-N removal efficiency.

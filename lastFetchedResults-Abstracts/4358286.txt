Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) acts a main role in future cognitive radio networks. The spectral environment is dynamically change to utilize the bandwidth optimally by allocating unused spectrum to the secondary users. The spectrum employment is developed by OFDMA. It overcomes the frequency selective evaporation. The joint subchannel allocation and power control strategy help to increase the energy through allocating the subchannel of each source. Optimal allocation of spectral efficiency acts a main role for achieving high data rate in wireless communication. A good usage of energy is important for wired communication as well as wireless communications. OFDMA systems maximize the total throughput of the system. An efficient resource allocation scheme can maximize the energy efficiency of all transmitters. The main objective of this paper is multiple user gain multiple resources through OFDMA based Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) with extended resource usage time. Pricing factor is differing from one user to another user. So, the priority based frequency allocation must be important to considered. Secondary users (SUs) could access the spectrum under pre-defined conditions. When the primary userÂ´s (PUs) spectrums are free that time only secondary users may access the spectrum. Each user have separate transmitter. The proposed system linear pricing technique used to avoid the spectrum competition between the secondary and primary transmitter. A distributed algorithm provides the plan for frequency distribution. Consider this entire concept then design the simulation model. To analyze the simulation result frequently then the problem delay is founded. The value of delay presents the performance of entire transmitter. Finally, the simulation result brings out the higher energy efficiency of each transmitter.

Economic dispatch (ED) is one of the most important issues in power system operation. The main objective of ED is to determine each power plant generation in order to minimize the total operation cost while satisfying demand and generation constraints. In recent years, due to increasing environmental concerns and regarding to the role of pollution produced by fossil-fuelled power plants, environmental economic dispatch (EED) problem has been introduced, that minimizes operation cost and emission of power plants, simultaneously. In this paper, the economic and emission objectives are combined using pollution penalty factor and the problem is modeled as a single objective optimization problem. To solve this problem, an accurate and fast meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called modified shuffled frog leaping is employed and applied. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, it is tested on 6 and 11 unit test systems and the obtained results are compared with those of other existing methods. The results show the superiority of the proposed approach.

During the creation process of various diagnostic devices or tools (either software or hardware), it is important to analyze the subject of diagnostics and determine the objective of diagnostics. In our case, the electronic interlocking system ZSB 2000, respectively the CAN communication fieldbus, is the analyzed system. The objective of our analysis was to learn the functional, operational and technical characteristics of the CAN bus used within a real system and use this acquired knowledge to make diagnostics of communication system failures that ensures the transfer of information between a process and control level of ZSB 2000. This paper describes the designed prototype of diagnostic instrument that can be used only by service personnel. The designed diagnostic instrument allows you to diagnose the operational and failure states of controlled objects that are connected to the bus called Elementbus and as well of the failures of the bus. The designed diagnostic instrument is intended for working directly in the terrain (on railways).

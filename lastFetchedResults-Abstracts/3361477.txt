The papers in this special section cover the advances in multi-objective design and optimization based on genetic algorithms, surrogate, polynomial regression, and particle swarm optimization techniques. Design of novel trans-rotary magnetic gear, hybrid machines for dc generation, and two degrees of freedom split-stator induction machines highlight new magnetic configurations and their performance evaluations. Multiphysics analysis of magnetothermal and magnetostructural behavior of Switched Reluctance Machine (SRM) and brushless doubly fed machines shed light on analytical and practical aspects of design in electromechanical converters. Finally, control of torque undulation, loss minimization, low speed high torque operation, and advanced digital control of adjustable speed motor drives conclude this unique collection of papers.

patients is the main reason for morbidity and mortality in these patients.
About one-third of patients with HIV infection
have concomitant tuberculosis. Lack of appropriate infection control on many
social and economic communities will impose. Comprehensive study on the effects
of anti-tuberculosis drugs in patients with HIV infecting
less done, also due to the importance of reducing morbidity and mortality,
reduce the cost of disease, identifying drug pharmacokinetics, the importance
of completing treatment tuberculosis, this study was performed to evaluate the
effects of anti- tuberculosis drugs on HIV infection
and to identify the drug pharmacokinetics and so more complete tuberculosis
treatment.Methods: A historical cohort study was performed on
patients referring to the research center for HIV/AIDS,
consultation center, department of infection diseases of Imam
Khomeini Hospital
in Tehran, Iran. A
total number of 75 cases with HIV
negative versus HIV positive patients
with pulmonary tuberculosis and positive sputum smear in accordance with
inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected.Results: In this study, the frequency of peripheral neuropathy 27(73%),
arthralgia 31(83.8%), vomiting 18(48.6%),
headache 26(70.3%), dizziness 20(54.1%),
renal toxicity 4(10.8%) and of skin rash 10(27%)
in patients with HIV virus infection were
significantly more than HIV- negative patients.
Hepatotoxicity, fever and anemia were not significantly more common in patients
who infected with HIV virus. Conclusion: The HIV patients, who have not received antiretroviral
drugs during tuberculosis treatment, may show higher incidence of
anti-tuberculosis drugs complications.

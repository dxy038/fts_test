We have recently described the synthesis and antifungal activity of a series of 1,4-benzothiazine and 1,4-benzoxazine imidazole derivatives that mainly showed in vivo activity against a murine experimental model of candidiasis but that very often lacked in vitro activity. Here, we report a docking study of a representative set of our molecules in a 3D model of CYP51 of Candida albicans (CA-CYP51). The model was constructed on the basis of the sequence homology relationship with the recently reported crystal structure of the CYP51 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT- CYP51).

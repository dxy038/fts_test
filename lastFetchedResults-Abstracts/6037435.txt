Through the stress analysis of the node ball clamping device, we got the equation about clamping force (generalized force) and the contact angles. In order to get this device clamped more reliable under the practice constraints, we optimize the design. In the design we set the maximum external loads of this device was the objective function, put the contact angles as the design variable through adaptive genetic algorithm to optimize the design. And finally, we got the reasonable contact angles for the node ball clamping device.

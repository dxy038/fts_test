Milk proteins are often used by the food industry because of their good emulsifying properties. In addition, they can also provide oxidative stability to foods. However, different milk proteins or protein components have been shown to differ in their antioxidative properties, and their localisation in emulsions has been shown to be affected by the emulsification conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of homogenisation equipment (microfluidizer vs. two-stage valve homogeniser) on lipid oxidation in 10% fish oil-in-water emulsions prepared with two different milk proteins. Emulsions were prepared at pH 7 with similar droplet sizes. Results showed that the oxidative stability of emulsions prepared with sodium caseinate was not influenced by the type of homogeniser used. In contrast, the type of homogenisation equipment significantly influenced lipid oxidation when whey protein was used as emulsifier, with the microfluidizer resulting in lower levels of oxidation.

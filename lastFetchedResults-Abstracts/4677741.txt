The aim of this paper is to propose a novel indoor positioning technique operated without any infrastructure by use of radar sensors. In this paper, the system which utilizes relative velocity measurements from Continuous Wave (CW) based radars is described as well as a combination of a radar and a gyro sensor. The former configuration results in 2.1 m error for 21 m total trajectory length and the latter has 11.6 cm error which can be improved down to 6.8 cm error for the same trajectory. The results are very promising for our objective application, infrastructure independent indoor localization for first-responders and robots.

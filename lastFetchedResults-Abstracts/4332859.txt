Since monosodium glutamate wastewater (MGW) contains rich nutrient and no harmful components, MGW is thought to be the potential nutrient resource for agricultural application in China. The objective of this work was to exam the effect of modified monosodium glutamate wastewater (MMGW) on the growth and fruit quality attributes of tomato grown in different media (inorganic and organic media) by a greenhouse pot experiment, as compared to tomato complete nutrition solution (CNS). MMGW decreased the fresh weight yield significantly may be due to the lake of some necessary elements cultivated in inorganic media, compared with that in CNS treatment; while there is no difference in quality parameters between MMGW and CNS treatment. In organic media, MMGW increased the yield significantly compared with that irrigated with CNS; also the fruit quality was improved in MMGW treatment. In conclusion, MGW can be modified to instead of CNS for tomato plant in proper media which can supplement enough elements MGW lacked. However, because of MGW complicated characteristics resulting from different technics process and materials for monosodium glutamate production, MGW should be carefully treated to avoid potential hazards before they are reused.

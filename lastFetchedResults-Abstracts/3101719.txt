Student evaluation plays an important part in university custom relationship management. This paper aims to explore an objective and effective mean of assessing student. Firstly, an indicator system for evaluating college student performance is designed based on characteristic of student. Secondly, an intelligent evaluation model is build using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and case based reasoning (CBR). Furthermore, an intelligent evaluation system based on the proposed AHP-CBR model is designed. This system has the advantage of taking into consideration the qualitative and quantitative factors, integrating subjective and objective assessment.

A description is given of the design, function, and application of a series of brushless motors and controllers being offered to the participants of the GM-sponsored Sunrayce, a competition of solar-powered electric vehicles. The motor and controller, when purchased together, provide single bidirectional speed control, automatic overspeed protection, motor and controller overtemp protection, and maximum voltage regeneration limit. Unique characteristics of the motors and controllers and how the motor drive interfaces to the vehicle control are described. The drive system can be tailored to a variety of power ranges and control schemes.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

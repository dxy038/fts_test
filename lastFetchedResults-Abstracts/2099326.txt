To evaluate variables influencing in vitro immune response induction, pig monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) were treated with putative type-1 and type-2 antigens (Ags, killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL)) and recombinant porcine cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-γ and TNF-α). Responses were measured as moDC cytokine mRNA expression. Treatment of moDCs with HEWL increased IL-13 but not IL-12, IFN-γ or IL-10 mRNA, suggesting a DC2 phenotype. Addition of TNF-α, IFN-γ or IL-12 to HEWL-treated moDCs increased IL-12p35 and reduced IL-13 mRNA; suggesting a DC1 phenotype. Mtb increased moDC IL-12p35, IFN-γ and to a lesser extent IL-13 mRNA. This DC1 bias was enhanced by TNF-α, IFN-γ or IL-12, which increased IL-12p35 and to a lesser extent IL-10 mRNA but reduced IL-13 mRNA. Addition of IL-10 to Mtb-pulsed moDCs reduced IL-12p35, IFN-γ and IL-13, but increased IL-10 mRNA, suggesting diversion from DC1 to DC2. Thus porcine moDCs treated with Ag and/or cytokines alter moDC cytokine expression confirming their likely ability to initiate and steer acquired immune response.

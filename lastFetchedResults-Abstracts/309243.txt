The objective of this study was to identify culturally grounded meanings of the concepts of comfort, presence, and involvement in the context of the childbirth experience. This was an exploratory study using a descriptive, qualitative design. The sample was made up of Black and White American women more than 18 years of age, who had given birth within the past 72 hours, and spoke English as their primary language. The analytical protocol followed was content analysis—i.e., the systematic reduction and simplification of data. To increase the validity and reliability/reproducibility of the analytic strategy, the researchers independently reviewed the process of data reduction to ensure conceptual clarity and consistency in the classification and elucidation of data. The conclusion reached was that differences exist between Black and White American women as regards descriptions and expectations about the concept of comfort and involvement during the labor and birth experience. These findings have implications for individual nursing practice behaviors as well as for the development of unit-based policies and prenatal education. Copyright © 2000 by W.B. Saunders Company

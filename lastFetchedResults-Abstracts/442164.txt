Background. Since 1991 we have performed a multistage palliative approach to biventricular repair of pulmonary atresia or critical pulmonary stenosis with intact ventricular septum in infants with a detectable right ventricular infundibulum.
Methods. A total of 25 patients (19 pulmonary atresia and 6 critical pulmonary stenosis) underwent initial palliation consisting of a transarterial pulmonary valvotomy and a polytetrafluoroethylene shunt between the left subclavian artery and pulmonary trunk. Among the 23 survivors, 15 underwent balloon valvotomy. Six of these patients later required additional palliative surgery that consisted of repeat pulmonary valvotomy, adjustment of an atrial communication, and resection of the hypertrophied muscles in the right ventricle.
Results. Of the 25 patients, 23 (92%) survived. In all, 20 patients underwent definitive operations: 18 (90%) biventricular repair (12 pulmonary atresia, and 6 critical pulmonary stenosis), one bidirectional Glenn, and one Fontan procedure. The actuarial probability of achieving a biventricular repair at 36 months of age was 69%. In 18 patients right ventricular endâ€“diastolic volume significantly increased but tricuspid valve diameter did not change.
Conclusions. The multistage palliation procedure to promote right ventricular growth makes a definitive biventricular repair of pulmonary atresia or critical pulmonary stenosis with intact ventricular septum possible in the majority of infants with a patent infundibulum.

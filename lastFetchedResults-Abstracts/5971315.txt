The objective of this research is mainly in estimating sea ice concentration from Phased-Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) polarimetric data. This paper shows the results of estimating sea ice concentration from PALSAR data acquired from 2008 to 2010. The AMSR-E sea ice concentration data are also used to verify the result of sea ice concentration derived from PALSAR data. The difference in two sea ice concentrations was found especially in AMSR-E low concentration area. The high resolution backscattering and scattering entropy images give us an idea that there is some difficulty in AMSR-E to detect thin sea ice in the Sea of Okhotsk.

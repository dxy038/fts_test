The objective of this study was trying to use USEPA´s integrated exposure uptake biokinetic model (IEUBK model), which had been widespread utiLized at abroad but lacked of studying and application in China, to assess the ecological risk of soil lead in former industrial sites of CHongqing, China. In this paper, concentrations of soil lead in five typical kinds of former industrial sites were determinated. Lead levels in other media, such as air, drinking water, diet and pregnant women´s blood were also investigated. Based on these data, a benchmark of soil lead of Chongqing was estabLished by IEUBK model and the ecological risks of lead in five typical kinds of former industrial sites were assessed. The study shows the benchmark value of lead in soil is 144.26mg/kg, below which the children Living in CHongqing, aged 0-84 months, would have a lower probabiLity (&#8804;5%) to suffer from blood lead level beyond 10&#956;g/dL, an action level of Centers for disease control and prevention of USA (US-CDC). Furthermore, the highest ecological risk of lead in five different former sites performs a sequence as the etallurgy´s &gt;; the machine´s &gt;; the Chemical´s &gt;; the pharmaceutical´s &gt;; the rubber´s. Except pharmaceutical plants´ and rubber plants´ former sites, majority types of sites have very high risks beyond 90%, 18 times of model´s defaulted setting level(&#945;=0.05). That means some further remediation steps must be taken into account.

This paper focuses on the comparison of different approaches for complexity assessment of selected manufacturing process structures. Our objective in this study is to test their ability to uncover assumed differences in structural complexity among observed manufacturing process structures. The obtained results of this theoretical study show that all proposed indicators can be used for structural complexity analysis of manufacturing process structures and subsequently for manufacturing process simplification procedure.

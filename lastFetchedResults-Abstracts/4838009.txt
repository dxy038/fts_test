We propose to extend block-based video-coding by an adaptive color space transform. The presented technique enables an encoder to switch between several given color space representations with the objective to maximize the overall rate-distortion gain. Simulations based on the current draft of the H.264/MPEG4-AVC 4:4:4 extensions demonstrate that our technique provides a rate-distortion performance equal or better than that obtained when using any of the individual color spaces only.

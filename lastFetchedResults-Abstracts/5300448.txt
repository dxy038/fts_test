Many countries begin to issue E-driving license and E-passports containing biometric data for their citizens. The ICAO specification for cryptography in E-passport is proven to be insecure and has many threats. The European Union has EAC mechanism for E-passports. But, even this solution presents many threats especially in security and privacy. Biometric template recognition is the challenging problem in the real world application. In this paper, a new method for the secured exchange between an E-passport or E-driving license and the Inspection System is provided. The main objective of this proposed method is to create an elliptic curve points from finger print using MATLAB environment. First, Minutiae from finger prints are extracted. From those minutiae, elliptic curve is generated by using elliptic curve cryptography generation algorithm. Thus, elliptic curve based on biometric data to validate the identity of the user was created. This analysis confirms that our solution corresponds to the security goals defined in the paper.

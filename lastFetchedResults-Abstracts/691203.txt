Iron is the 4th abundant elements of the earthâ€™s crust which high sub standard quantity of it in water distribution systems causes improper effects .The main objective of this research is to use Pumice stone for eliminating or decreasing of soluble Iron in water and to study in detail the effect of its factors. Three levels of Iron concentrations were prepared (0.3 , 1 and 5 mg/L) and poured in a batch system in two Levels 10 and 20 g of Pumice stone. The pH were set at three levels (3.5 , 7 and 10) .The remaining Iron concentration was measured in each step of process by taking a sample in every 10 minutes using spectrometry method. The results showed that adsorption rate had a direct relation with adsorbent and soluble pH. Also in this method the used Pumice stone can be reused and regenerated. Iron absorption data can be presented by freundlich isotherm model. According to the results obtained, Pumice stone can be used with high efficiency in  adsorption process of Iron from water and wastewater. Also low cost and easy accessibility of Pumice stone along with its possibility for reused and regeneration   are other advantages of this stone for  full-scale application.

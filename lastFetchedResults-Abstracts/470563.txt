Objective
The objective of the study was to determine the incidence of ureteral obstruction during vaginal surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and the accuracy and efficacy of intraoperative cystoscopy.
Study design
The study was a retrospective review of 700 consecutive patients who underwent vaginal surgery for anterior and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse with universal intraoperative cystoscopy.
Results
Thirty-seven patients (5.3%) had no spillage of dye from 1 or both ureters intraoperatively. The false-positive and negative cystoscopy rates were 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Thus, the true incidence of intraoperative ureteral obstruction was 5.1%. Intraoperative cystoscopy was accurate in 99.3% of cases, with a sensitivity and specificity of 94.4% and 99.5%, respectively. Suture removal relieved ureteral obstruction in 88% of cases. Six subjects (0.9%) had true ureteral injuries.
Conclusion
Vaginal surgery for anterior and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse is associated with an intraoperative ureteral obstruction rate of 5.1%. Intraoperative cystoscopy accurately detects ureteral obstruction and allows for relief of obstruction in the majority of cases.

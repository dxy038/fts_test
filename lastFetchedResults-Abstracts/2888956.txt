In resonance based target recognition, studies have mainly been focus on exploiting the natural resonant modes embedded in an ultra wideband transient signature measured at a specific aspect and polarization state. The information that carries in polarimetric and aspect dependency nature of the scattering phenomena has not been well exploited. The objective of this paper is to investigate the pros and cons for different possible approaches to handle the multiple aspects, full polarimetric, and wideband scattered data, aiming for a more robust target recognition procedures and outcomes.

This paper presents the thermal analysis of a building brick containing phase change material (PCM) to be used in hot climates. The objective of using the PCM is to utilize its high latent heat of fusion to reduce the heat gain by absorbing the heat in the bricks through the melting process before it reaches the indoor space. The considered model consists of bricks with cylindrical holes filled with PCM. The problem is solved in a two-dimensional space using the finite element method. The thermal effectiveness of the proposed brick-PCM system is evaluated by comparing the heat flux at the indoor surface to a wall without the PCM during typical working hours. A paramedic study is conducted to assess the effect of different design parameters, such as the PCM's quantity, type, and location in the brick. The results indicate that the heat gain is significantly reduced when the PCM is incorporated into the brick, and increasing the quantity of the PCM has a positive effect. PCM cylinders located at the centerline of the bricks shows the best performance.

Due to the mutual interference and sharing of wireless links in TDMA ad hoc networks, conflicts will occur when data message are transmitting between nodes. The broadcast scheduling problem (BSP) is aim to schedule each node in different slot of fixed length frame at least once, and the objective of BSP is to seek for the optimal feasible solution, which has the shortest length of frame slots as well as the maximum node transmission. In this paper, we propose a two stage hybrid algorithm based on fuzzy Hopfield neural network to solve this BSP in ad hoc. In the first stage, we use a modified sequential vertex coloring algorithm to obtain a minimal TDMA frame length. Experimental results, obtained from the running on three benchmark graph, show that our algorithm can achieve better performance with shorter frame length and higher channel utilizing ratio than other exit BSP solutions.

The matrix converter is made up of a matrix of bidirectional switch elements. The output voltage control is achieved by switching between the allowed switching states using a predetermined sequence. Filters can be used to remove the unwanted high frequency components due to the switching. This paper proposes a matrix converter system for a double fed induction generator (DFIG) system, which is used to replace the conventional AC/DC/AC converter system.

The objective was to determine the effects of potassium lactate (0% or 1.5%; KL), sodium chloride (0.3% or 0.6%), and sodium acetate (0% or 0.1%) on injection-enhanced (8.5% pump), beef strip-loin steaks. All treatments contained 0.3% phosphate and 0.058% rosemary. Steaks were packaged in a high-oxygen modified atmosphere (80% O2/20% CO2) and were evaluated on d 2, 9, and 14 for surface shininess/gloss, shear force, and descriptive sensory attributes. As time in MAP progressed, oxidized, stale, and rancid flavours increased (P &lt; 0.05) and surface shininess/gloss decreased (P &lt; 0.05). Brown-roasted and beef flavours were most intense (P &lt; 0.05) on d 9. Using KL increased (P &lt; 0.05) brown-roasted and beef flavours and limited rancid flavour. Sodium acetate decreased (P &lt; 0.05) shear force. Adding more salt increased salty and rancid flavours (P &lt; 0.05). Sodium acetate and KL both improve sensory attributes of injection-enhanced beef.

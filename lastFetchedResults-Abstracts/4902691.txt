Our objective is to improve legibility of robot navigation behavior in the presence of moving humans. We examine a human-aware global navigation planner in a path crossing situation and assess the legibility of the resulting navigation behavior. We observe planning based on fixed social costs and static search spaces to perform badly in situations where robot and human move towards the same point. To find an improved cost model, we experimentally examine how humans deal with path crossing. Based on the results we provide a new way of calculating social costs with context dependent costs without increasing the search space. Our evaluation shows that a simulated robot using our new cost model moves more similar to humans. This shows how comparison of human and robot behavior can help with assessing and improving legibility.

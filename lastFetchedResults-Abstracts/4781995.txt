Single-channel spectral subtraction algorithms are commonly used to suppress late reverberation. A binaural extension of such methods, apart from suppressing reverberation without introducing processing artifacts, should also preserve the signalÂ´s binaural localization cues. Here, three state-of-the-art spectral subtraction dereverberation algorithms are extended into a binaural context utilizing three alternative bilateral gain adaptation schemes and are compared to an extension derived from a Delay and Sum Beamformer. Objective results for several experimental conditions reveal the most prominent binaural extensions.

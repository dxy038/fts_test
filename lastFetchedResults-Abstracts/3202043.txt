Battery energy storage system (BESS) is one of the key technologies for smart grid and load shifting is one of the fundamental functions of BESS. BESS load shifting performance is determined by the availability of accurate load curves and optimization approaches. In this paper, a real-time control strategy based on load forecast and dynamic programming methods is presented. The predicted load curve is updated on-line through regress forecasting. The proposed optimization model is solved by using dynamic programming technique. The objective is peak shaving and prolonging the battery lifetime, and the constraints considered include battery state-of-charge (SOC), cycling times per day, converter capacity and step power. The above control strategy was successfully applied to the 5MW*4hour lithium-Ion BESS demonstration project in Biling substation, China Southern Power Grid. The simulation results based on the actual load data of Biling substation demonstrate the effectiveness.

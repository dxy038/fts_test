Traffic signal using at crosswalks directly effects on the safety of pedestrian and vehicles delay. Considering the importance of non- compliance traffic signals by some pedestrians and the effect of this problem on traffic signal setting has been discussed in this paper. First the relationship between duration of pedestrian green phase and pedestrian violation introduced. The problem developed a traffic signal optimization strategy that considers both vehicles and pedestrian. The objective of the method is to minimize the average vehicle delay under constraint of pedestrian green phase. The new algorithm is introduced to solve the problem. Finally, numerical example is solved by this algorithm to show the efficient of algorithm.

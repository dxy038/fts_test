This paper addresses the problem of single microphone frequency domain speech enhancement in noisy environments. The main characteristics of available frequency domain noise reduction algorithms are presented. We have confirmed that the a priori SNR estimation leads to the best subjective results. According to these conclusions, a new approach is then developed which achieves a trade-off between effective noise reduction and low computational load for real-time operations. The obtained solutions demonstrate that the subjective and objective results are much better than existing methods

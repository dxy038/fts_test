A recently enforced international regulation states that a crude oil tanker must have on board and implement a volatile organic compounds (VOCs) management plan that is approved by the administration. There are few thorough investigations that have simultaneously considered the various aspects of VOC recovery from the loading of crude oil into oil tankers. The current study investigated a compression-assisted refrigeration condensation system for VOC recovery during crude oil loading operations. System performance and the profit with different operation conditions showed rather a complicated relation than just a trade-off. The optimum process configuration and the ideal operational conditions of compression pressure and refrigeration temperature were determined through process simulation combined multi-objective optimization based on economic and environmental cost-benefit assessments. Although the installation of the system requires rather expensive initial costs, the system was found to be economically beneficial in the long term if the optimal system parameters were implemented. The method presented in this study can be applied to systems optimization processes with different factor values and considerations.

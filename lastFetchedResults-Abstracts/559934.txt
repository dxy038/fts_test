The meaning of life is one of the most important subjects in philosophy that John Cottingham in “on the meaning of life” discusses this. The question of the meaning of life is important in his view because just human being asks “what is the meaning of life” because of his certain existential situation. In Cottingham’s view, the characteristics of the meaning of life are profundity or seriousness, achievement, self-awareness and autonomy, moral life i.e. moral objective values, success and theism or religious life. Cottingham holds that moral life can satisfy human needs and flourish his talents. But our human nature is purely result of genetic mutation in simply human view. Therefore moral judgments do not have objective value because they depend on this nature. Moreover, human being would not be successful in his projects and activities because of his vulnerable and fragile nature. We can reach conclusive reason for objective moral judgments and values and being hopeful for successful and meaningful life only if we rely on religious and spiritual worldview which that benevolent god desires us to be moral. In Cottingham’s view, Understanding and accepting religious and spiritual worldview depends on exercising religious practices. in my humble opinion, Cottingham cannot explain how theism support successful life because he does not use the concept of life after death.

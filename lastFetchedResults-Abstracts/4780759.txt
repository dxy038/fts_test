This paper describes a pattern synthesis method for a circular array antenna using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and cubic spline interpolation (CSI). Being an indispensable part of a high speed space-division communication system, the array antenna operates in a wide frequency band (200-400 MHz) and has stable patterns with 60-degree half power beam width (HPBW) in the whole frequency band. Firstly, by establishing a versatile objective function, the complex excitations of the circular array at the selected seven frequency points are determined via the PSO algorithm. Then, the complex excitations of the circular array at arbitrary frequency points in the whole working frequency band are calculated effectively using the CSI method. A uniform circular array with 6 broadband dipole elements is examined. The broadband patterns with 60-degree HPBW and the accuracy of the interpolation method are demonstrated.

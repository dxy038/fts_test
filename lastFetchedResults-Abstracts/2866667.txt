Heat conduction is natural phenomenon which is governed by three dimensional, transient partial differential equation. The partial differential equation can be solved by many numerical method such as finite difference method, finite volume method, finite element method etc. These methods require heavy computation to solve the system of algebraic equations. Graphics processing unit (GPU) can be used to handle the computation of CPU as a co-processor so the GPU will save a lot of time for computation. The dominant proprietary framework for GPU computing is CUDA, provided by NVidia. It can be used to solve computation intensive task. The objective of this work is to develop a heat conduction code on CUDA platform, which will solve the system of algebraic equations using GPU framework.

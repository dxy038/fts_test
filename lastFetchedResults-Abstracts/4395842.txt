Based on the traditional transmission expansion planning(TEP) model,this paper uses chance-constrained programming method which combined with Monte Carlo simulation and Latin hypercube sampling(LHS) to handle dependencies among the input random variables. It can use to study the impact of wind speed correlation on the planning scheme. By defining the safety index,this paper develops a multi-objective transmission system planning model which includes the transmission investment and the safety index as its objective functions,and in this way the security/reliability and economics associated with transmission system planning schemes could be well compromised. The model developed is solved by the artificial fish swarm algorithm and the feasibility and effectiveness are demonstrated by the improved Garver 6-bus system.

We deal with portfolio selection problem with interval objective function coefficients. Considering the problem as a multiple objective problem including uncertainties, two kinds of efficient solutions that are efficient or Pareto optimal for at least one or all coefficients within given intervals can be regarded as optimistic or pessimistic solutions respectively. We investigate the properties of efficiency conditions by means of two kinds of preference cones

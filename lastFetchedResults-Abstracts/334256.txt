Objective
The objective of this study was to demonstrate the reliability of cardiac-gated computerized tomography (CGCT) in diagnosing aortic atheroma in patients with ischemic stroke.
Materials and Methods
Two radiologists each read 32 CGCT studies and estimated aortic atheroma and interreliability/intrareliability measures.
Results
The intraobserver intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were 0.95 and 0.87 for the diagnosis of aortic atheroma with CGCT. The interrater ICC was 0.93.
Conclusion
This prospective study demonstrated that CGCT is a reliable imaging modality with good interreader and intrareader reproducibilities

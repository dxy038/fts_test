This paper introduces a new biorobotic system using human neuroblastoma cultures and centre of area learning for basic robotic guidance. Multielectrode Arrays Setups have been designed for direct culturing neural cells over silicon or glass substrates, providing the capability to stimulate and record simultaneously populations of neural cells. The main objective of this work will be to control a robot using this biological neuroprocessor and a new simple centre of area learning scheme. The final system could be applied for testing how chemicals affect the behaviour of the robot or to establish the basis for new hybrid optogenetic neuroprostheses based on stimulating optically genetic-modified neurons.

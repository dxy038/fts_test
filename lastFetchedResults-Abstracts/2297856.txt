Protected area zoning is an approach towards decreasing conflict between the possible uses of land and providing an opportunity for policy making. GIS data processing and spatial analysis along with decision analysis techniques, were used in this study to define zones for Ghamishloo Wildlife Sanctuary according to I.U.C.N. category IV in Isfahan Province of Iran. We used multi-criteria evaluation and multi-objective land allocation for zoning the sanctuary, which covers an area of about 866 km2. First, we prepared a land use map of the area using classification of the IRS 6 (AWiFS) data of May 2005. For zoning this region, nine major criteria including wildlife habitat, vegetation cover, soil, distance to historical places, water resources, road, scenic beauties in the landscape, and also to residential areas, and to the core zone were considered. We used the analytical hierarchy process to derive weights of the criteria and then applied a weighted linear combination technique to combine the factors. The degree of suitability was defined by applying Fuzzy membership function. The wildlife sanctuary was divided into four zones including conservation, recreation, rehabilitation, and cultural zones, consisting of 69%, 21%, 9.5% and 0.5% of the area, respectively. Finally, multi-objective land allocation (MOLA) function was used for allocation of the sanctuary's land area to the zones which produced reasonable results.

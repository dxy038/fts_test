This paper describes research work on the integration of optical parameters in the selection of a strategy of measurements for the vision system. The approach is based on the feedback interconnection between two dynamical systems: First, a state estimator where the observation equation is a nonlinear map between the state variables of the object and the position in the image plane. This mapping depends on external variables and internal or optical parameters of the sensor. Second, a controller of the vision system with the objective of minimizing some function of the covariance of the state estimation error. A detailed description of this active estimator is presented in the case of a receding horizon observation interval

This paper aims to present an easy, quick, and accurate way of implementing value engineering (VE) studies by introducing an integrated computerized system for the VE technique and life-cycle cost as a checkout system. The VE computer program was designed using a database computer program, FoxPro Window. The computerized version of the VE study consists of several interactive panels, representing the systematic approach (job plan) of a VE study, through which all the information and data of the VE study will be input. The program will help the user to come up with the best selected idea, based on certain calculations that will be done automatically by the VE program. Moreover, the VE case studies that will be investigated by the program will be stored, and thus the program will also serve as a data bank for these case studies as references for future studies. The objective of this paper is not to create a smart VE system, but it can be considered a major step toward this objective.

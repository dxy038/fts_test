The main objective is to propose an integrated framework architecture that facilitates coordination and collaboration among different managerial levels in a manufacturing facility. We are deploying an object-oriented approach as the conceptual modeling methodology. Our thesis is that local decisions (at the operation level) can benefit from the timely accessibility of appropriately aggregate decisions that are imposed by top management. In turn, the manufacturing system as a whole can benefit from timely dissemination of appropriate aggregate decisions pertaining to improvements of the overall productivity, and profitability of the manufacturing system. We report on the development and implementation of framework for integrating tactical and operational decisions. The developed framework is user-friendly, generic in nature and will be of interest to practitioners and managers for the manufacturing industry to assist their decision-making.

The main objective of load frequency control (LFC) is to return the steady-state frequency error to zero. Frequency aberrance from the nominal value and supplying active power consumers are the main reasons of the change of water entered to turbine. In this paper the state equation and transfer function of the load-frequency control with hydro-turbine is described. Small signal stability together with the effects of parameters such as inertia constant, water starting time and constant speed on the dynamic behavior of the power system have been investigated. Also, the application of transient droop compensation (TDC) in response to water turbine by eigenvalues analysis and behavior dynamic simulation of the power system is shown. Also, using transfer function, PID controller for load-frequency control in power system is designed and the change of the gain controller is investigated. The simulation results reveal that the response of the proposed controller is better than the response of the conventional integral controller.

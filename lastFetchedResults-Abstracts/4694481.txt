We define biomimetics as the coherent abstraction in devising, prototyping in design of organic, inorganic and hybrid nano- and microsystems using biological analogies through nanobioinformatics paradigm. Complex nano- and microscale biosystems exist in nature in enormous variety and sophistication. We apply complex biological patents to devise, analyze and examine distinct systems. One cannot blindly copy biosystems due to the fact that many complex phenomena and effects have not been comprehended, and nanosystem topologies have not been examined. The attention is concentrated on examining existing biosystems, devising novel paradigms, exploring new operating principles, examining functionality of different subsystems and nanodevices, researching novel structures, studying advanced architectures and characterizing distinct materials. Different nanosystems and nanodevices can be devised and designed through biomimetics based upon basic physical laws and nanobioinformatics. Our ultimate objective is to provide the focused study of biomimetics and systematic design through nanobioinformatics. The synergetic paradigm reported is demonstrated devising and controlling complex systems.

Background-The pathogenesis of cataract has been found to be influenced by a number of factors including oxidative stress. Human body contains natural antioxidants, including the enzymes glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase which help it withstand stress. Some environmental and nutritional factors can affect antioxidant systems. Objective-This study was undertaken to assess the status of total antioxidants, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the Iranian population whose lifestyle is both nutritionally and environmentally different from other populations on which such studies have been conducted. Methods-Forty-five patients with senile cataract and 35 controls were selected and matched. The levels of the above-mentioned enzymes and chemicals were measured in erythrocytes and plasma and compared by Student’s t-test (p<0.05 for significance). Results-The level of GPx erythrocyte activity in patients and controls was found to be 51.24±13.46 μ/gHb and 40.87±7.04 μ/gHb respectively ( p<0.0001). SOD levels were 1239.83±275.96 μ/gHb in patients and 1126±201.72 μ/gHb in controls (p=0.045). Total antioxidant status of the patients and controls were 1.39±0.27 mMol/L and 1.64±0.36 mMol/L respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion-Even though the relationships of these factors to cataractogenesis is still unknown, we believe that a better knowledge about their role could strengthen our understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and perhaps the treatment of cataract. Still, it is safe to assume that educating people on consumption of a diet richer in antioxidants (like vegetables) is beneficial in preventing diseases like cataract.

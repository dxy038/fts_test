The development of high power amplifiers and systems in the millimeter wave bands necessitates the extension of RF testing techniques beyond the traditional techniques used for single-moded systems. The objective of this paper is to describe the many techniques in use for the measurement of these overmoded systems, and to provide examples from the authorsÂ´ efforts in the development of high power 94 GHz radar based on B.G. Danly et al. (1999) and B.G. Danly et al. (2002).

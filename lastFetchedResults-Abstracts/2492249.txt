Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a promising way, nowadays, to
predict the air
ow in enclosures. As a result, the objective of this study is to assess
the potential of CFD technique to predict the air
ows driven by buoyancy in heated
real-scale rooms. The numerical model is validated using experimental data for fullscale
test rooms; therefore, the experimental set-up is rst presented. This is followed
by the numerical model description, focusing on its principal elements: computational
domain geometry, discretization, turbulence model, radiation model, and thermal boundary
conditions. In addition, a simplied approach is proposed to integrate a heat source in
CFD models: Term source homogeneously spread all over the volume of the heat source.
Comprehensive experimental-numerical comparisons are presented in terms of heat transfer
to the walls of the test room, heat source behavior, and plume development. The results
show that the model developed in this study leads to realistic predictions. Finally, the
simplied CFD description of heat sources developed here can be extrapolated for other
congurations - dierent power, heat emission (convection/radiation), dimensions, and
shape. Consequently, this method can be applied in detailed studies dealing with thermal
comfort, indoor air quality, and energy consumption for heated rooms.

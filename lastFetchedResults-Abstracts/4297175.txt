Taipei Water Source Special District is the first protected district of water quantity and quality which was established according to Urban Planning Act in 1974. It supplies five millions people in Taipei Area with residential water use. Taiwan is deficient in water resources so how to manage effectively and protect the raw water from pollution is an important issue. Monitoring the conditions of land use (LU) is the key work to achieve the purpose of water resources protection. In this study, we use the idea of GRID to integrate the heterogeneous data into a uniform communication interface in order to construct a thorough analysis mechanism. We could monitor the real condition of vegetation, terrain and landscape through the analysis of LU and changes of land cover (LC) which detected from satellite images and aerial images. It is an objective and effective analysis mechanism to minimize the negative impact from nature and artificiality in protected district and achieves sustainability.

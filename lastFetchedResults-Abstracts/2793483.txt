This paper proposes a framework for developing Question Answering System for restricted domain using advanced NLP tools. The proposed model basically works over the concept of Information Extraction rather than the old technique of information Retrieval used by the search engines. The main objective of the model is to extract the exact and precise answer for the given question from a large dataset. This framework is simple and easy to implement against the previously developed complex architectures. The Framework is divided into four modules namely: Question Processing Module, Document Processing Module, Paragraph extraction module and Answer extraction module. The paper also proposes various algorithms separately for Definition Type, Descriptive Type and Factoid Type of questions for extracting most potential answer from the large dataset.

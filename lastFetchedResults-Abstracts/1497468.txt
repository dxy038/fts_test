Taiwan is a high energy-importing nation with approximately 98% of our energy supplied by imported fuels in 2004. The energy conservation and/or energy efficiency improvement is becoming vital energy issues in the country. In this regard, cogeneration system or combined heat and power system used for the utilization of waste heat from energy and industrial sectors is thus becoming attractive due to the energy, economic and environmental policies for pursuing stable electricity supply, sustainable development and environmental pollution mitigation in Taiwan. The objective of this paper is to present an analysis of cogeneration system utilized as sustainable energy in the industrial sector in Taiwan. The description in the paper is thus summarized on an analysis of electricity supply/consumption and its sources from cogeneration system during the past two decades (1984–2004) and then centered on new/revised promotion legislation/regulations especially concerning cogeneration system in the measures of environmental protection and economic/financial incentives. Finally, we preliminarily present the results of environmental benefit analysis in the greenhouse gases reduction. Based on the data in 2004, it was found that the reduction benefits of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide were estimated to achieve 3.488×107 and 650 metric tones, respectively.

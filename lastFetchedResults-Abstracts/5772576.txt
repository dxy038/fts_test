Many real-time systems are in fact isochronal, where both early and late responses are harmful to the system or lead to lower quality of service. Task scheduling problems in real-time systems proved that are NP-hard problems. Therefore, heuristic search strategies can be applied to these problems. In this paper, a simulated annealing algorithm is proposed for static task scheduling in non-overloaded isochronal soft real-time systems. The main objective of proposed algorithm is maximizing the total accumulated utility of jobs. Experimental results indicate that simulated annealing approach is suitable than genetic algorithm for static task scheduling in isochronal soft real-time systems.

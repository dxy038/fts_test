Background: Removable orthodontic appliances could increase the prevalence of Candida albicans and stomatitis in mouth of treated patients.

Objective: To examine the effect of good oral hygiene on prevention of Candida albicans increase in children under treatment with removable orthodontic appliances.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 30 children aged between 8-12 years old who were treated with removable orthodontic appliances and 30 healthy children in the same age range as control group were selected. One month after giving instructions on oral hygiene, samples were taken from patients' oral mucosa. The specimens were assessed by colony formation and germ tube tests. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square test with 95% confidence to compare the study groups.

Findings: There were significant differences between two groups regarding the redness, soreness, and inflammation which were more frequent in orthodontic patients (p=0.03). Colony formation was significantly higher in orthodontic patients than control group (P<0.00l). In addition, germ tube was more obvious in samples of orthodontic patients than control group (P=0.045). Conclusion: Despite the practice of good oral hygiene, application of removable orthodontic appliances leads to an increase in prevalence of Candida albicans.

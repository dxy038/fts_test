AWG-STAR is a star-shaped network that utilizes a uniform-loss cyclic frequency arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) as a wavelength router to obtain full-mesh interconnection between surrounding wavelength-division-multiplexing nodes. In this paper, we describe a temperature control-free AWG-STAR network that employs a coarse wavelength-division-multiplexing AWG-router. The center wavelength and transmission band of the AWG-router are designed based on the light source wavelength shift that results from changes in operating temperature. The system employs bidirectional transmission to avoid coherent crosstalk from adjacent channels. A cost-effective and small-scale full-mesh network is realized for metropolitan areas.

Generally smart grid is a modern technology of power system which can convert the whole power system in to digital format. In brief, a smart grid is the use of sensors, communications, computational ability and control in some form to enhance the overall functionality of the electric power delivery system. A system becomes smart by sensing, communicating, applying intelligence, exercising control and through feedback. For an ideal power system, this permits several functions which can optimize in the combination of the use of bulk generation and storage, transmission, distribution, and consumers. It can fulfill the goal which can ensure reliability and optimization of the use of Energy. It will also keep the environment free from pollution, save the assets, minimize the cost, easy operation against all hazards, maximum possibility to keep out from danger, provides power quality for 21st century needs. The focus of this paper is to familiarize with smart grid perspective to Bangladesh. The conception of smart grid is almost new is Bangladesh. The whole power system network in Bangladesh is very elaborate and complex but primitive. To reduce this complexity and improve the performance of the system, smart grid can be a better solution. Load-shedding is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. It can be solved by smart grid technology. As it can automatically detect, calculate and distribute electricity as per load requirements, it reduces the system loss and at the same time a certain amount of electricity from the grid would always be available at each consumer side even at the time of load shedding. Bangladesh can be greatly benefited by using this technology. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the necessity of smart grid for the perspective of Bangladesh which may be an effective solution to overcome the recent power crisis.

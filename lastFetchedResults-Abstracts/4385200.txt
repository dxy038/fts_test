This paper analyzes the thermal performance of a data center on a rack level, by utilizing racks stocked with 1U servers. Eleven different rack models covering a wide range of server arrangements with void spaces are presented and modeled in a raised-floor configuration. The objective is to investigate the thermal performance of semipopulated racks with different server arrangements. The inlet and outlet temperature profiles of the models are presented and the overall effect of each model on the thermal performance of a specific rack is discussed. Findings point toward the detailed modeling of semipopulated racks to investigate the main locations of the temperature spikes adjacent to the rack inlet and outlets as well as the recirculation zones.

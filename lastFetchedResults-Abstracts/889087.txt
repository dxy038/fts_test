To test the hypothesizes, Structural Equation Modeling was exploited. The results of the study showed that: There is a meaningful relation between performance of management accounting's techniques and cognitive dissonance, framing bias and mental accounting bias. There isnâ€™t any meaningful relation between performance of management accounting's techniques and ambiguity aversion bias

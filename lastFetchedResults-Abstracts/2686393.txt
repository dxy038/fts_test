This paper studies the precoder design of bidirectional networks in which each node is equipped with multiple antennas. In contrast to the conventional model of bidirectional relay networks, this paper considers a more general scenario, i.e., a multi-user multi-relay network. First, by assuming that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, we investigate the precoding design for the relays and users to minimize the sum mean squared error (MSE) and the maximum of single userÂ´s MSE, respectively. Then, we consider a more practical scenario where CSI estimation error is taken into account. By means of alternating optimization approach, we decompose the main problem into several decoupled subproblems with tractable solutions. It is shown that, in both the perfect and imperfect CSI cases, the proposed precoding algorithms outperform the existing solutions in terms of MSE and bit-error-rate (BER) performance.

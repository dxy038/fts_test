Man-machine collaborative equipment monitoring is absorbing more and more research focus for its requirements in modern collaborative producing enterprises for low-cost products and short time to market. In this paper, we propose an architecture For Web based collaborative equipment monitor. In this architecture, the architecture is viewed as a global workflow of monitoring resources, and the resources are configured by Web middleware, which can dynamically construct distributed sensors and instrument to carry out the distributed collaborative producing cases. Based on the collaborative architecture, the monitor data can propagate among the configured modes as workflow asynchronously. The monitor resources are distributed in the collaborative enterprises and the arranged as the virtual address on the Web, so producing cases can reconfigured based on the requirements and resource services, and the objective data and the processing results can be transferred sequentially to the other monitoring units configured on the Web. Finally, a Web based man-machine collaborative platform will be presented and a monitoring example will be given. The application case shows that the proposed ways can accelerate the collaboration of production for different enterprise and improve the producing efficiency.

A fully differential high-Q bandpass filter that uses lossy integrated inductors is presented. The circuit is implemented in a 0.8 &#956;m BiCMOS technology and realizes a center frequency of 750 MHz with a Q-factor that is tunable from 10 to 490 while dissipating 80-100 mW from a single 5 V supply. Since the objective of the prototype was to explore the proposed Q-enhancement technique, the dynamic range is limited to 25 dB for Q=20

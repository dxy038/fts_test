A multi-objective flight controller design method for an airplane with multiple operating points (MOP) is proposed via Lyapunov theory, which takes account of handling quality requirement and robust stability simultaneously. A handling quality criterion for all flights that correspond to multiple operating points is derived by linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Based on parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions combined with a descriptor system approach, a robust stability condition for the flight control system is obtained. At last, a flight controller is designed by solving a set of LMIs and the adjusting range of the parameter that influences the sensitivity of output responses and feasibility of LMIs is obtained by introducing convex optimization algorithms. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

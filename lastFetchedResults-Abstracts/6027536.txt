This paper discusses a microgrid system consisting mainly of a switched-reluctance generator (SRG), a buck-boost DC/DC converter, a battery energy storage system, a bidirectional DC/DC converter and a three-phase grid connected inverter. Maximum power point tracking strategy is carried out to improve energy conversion efficiency of SRG subsystem and the output power of SRG is delivered to buck-boost converter to generate constant DC voltage. The batteries are divided into groups and connected to DC bus via charging circuits. The state-of-charge of each battery connected is monitored and managed online by DSP TMS320F28335. A bidirectional DC/DC converter is also connected to DC bus, in parallel with charge/discharge circuit, to supply power for DC load or grid through a three-phase inverter. Operation performance of the established microgrid is confirmed by simulation results.

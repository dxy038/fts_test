An algorithm for designing an infinite-impulse-response (IIR) stable filter using a finite-impulse-response (FIR) given filter, with the objective of reducing the delay and order, is described. The design is in the time domain using the least-squares-inverse algorithm, which is briefly described. In this method, the numerator of the approximated filter is part of the FIR filter itself and no calculations and minimization are needed to find the numerator coefficients (except finding the FIR roots). An error analysis between the given FIR and approximated IIR filters is provided. This error analysis enables the designer to fix a design parameter, often unnoted, keeping the energies of the approximated and original filters equal. Results and two illustrative examples are presented

Neuroimaging technologies, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIR), could provide performance metrics directly from brain-based measures to assess safety and performance of operators in high-risk fields. In this paper, we objectively and subjectively examine the cognitive workload of air traffic control specialists utilizing a next-generation conflict resolution advisory. Credible differences were observed between continuously increasing workload levels that were induced by increasing the number of aircraft under control. In higher aircraft counts, a possible saturation in brain activity was realized in the fNIR data. A learning effect was also analyzed across a three-day/nine-session training period. The difference between Day 1 and Day 2 was credible, while there was a noncredible difference between Day 2 and Day 3. The results presented in this paper indicate some advantages in objective measures of cognitive workload assessment with fNIR cortical imaging over the subjective workload assessment keypad.

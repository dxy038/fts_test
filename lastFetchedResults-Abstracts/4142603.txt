The problem of velocity filtering a record of seismic data with the objective of extracting a desired signal by attenuating the coherent interferences traveling at different velocities is considered. A two-dimensional (<e1>N</e1>-input (<e1>N</e1>-<e1>M</e1>+1)-output) processing scheme is used where the (<e1>N</e1>-<e1>M</e1>+1) output traces are generated from the <e1>N</e1>-input traces by multichannel processing of overlapping subsets of <e1>M</e1>-input races. Each output is generated by using a vector of multichannel arrays filters designed to attenuate multiple coherent interference and random noise. The two-dimensional frequency-wavenumber expression corresponding to the proposed multiple-input-multiple-output processing scheme is derived so that it can be implemented using the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform. Two illustrative examples are included

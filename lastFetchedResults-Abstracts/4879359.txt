The convoluted nature of thermal infrared radiation and poor understanding of the physical mechanisms of human emittance, make objective image acquisition and processing protocols prerequisite for meaningful diagnostic specificity. A longitudinal dataset of clinical thermal infrared images was objectively processed to facilitate visualization of osseous stress pathology in the lower limbs.. This paper details processing of 500+ thermal infrared images acquired during a recent three month clinical study into osseous stress pathology in the lower limbs of Australian Army basic trainees. The use of thermal chroma-keying in segmentation and multitemporal image calibration is demonstrated. The `OpenSURF´ implementation of the scale and rotation-invariant interest point detector and descriptor are shown to be performant in registration of multitemporal clinical thermal infrared image data. Thermal `signs´ observed in longitudinal images appear to be revealing detectable changes in osseous stress pathophysiology.

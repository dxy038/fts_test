The relationship between capital structure and product market competition is a field got much concern from economic scholars recently, but research works got so far seem to neglect their bidirectional relationship. Considering this deficiency, I take Chinese A-stock listed companies as research objects, and use a systemic equation model to test the bidirectional relationship between companiesÂ´ capital structure and their product market competition intensity. The test results indicate that both debt ratio and product market competition intensity have statistically significant negative effects on each other.

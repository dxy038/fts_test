The objective is to study the effect of time jitter on GSM based passive radar performance. This will be done by studying the jitter influence on the complex ambiguity function (CAF) of GSM signal. The performance of the system depends crucially on the clutter cancellation performance as has been demonstrated in [1]. Moreover it has been shown that the exact reconstruction of the reference signal is a key factor for eliminating the clutter as good as possible. In reality and due to the influence of the oscillator jitter in the analog-to-digital converter the reproduction of an identical reference signal is merely impossible. Thus the synthesized (clean) version of the reference is not coherent with the measured data and may not give satisfying results. This investigation gives bounds on requirements to the oscillator such that the incoherence between the synthesized and the measured reference signal becomes acceptable.

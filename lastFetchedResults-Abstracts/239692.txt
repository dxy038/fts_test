The objective of this paper is to analyze the most up-to-date data available on total greenhousegas
emissions of a LNG fuel supply chain and life-cycle of city gas 13A1 based on surveys of the
LNG projects delivering to Japan, which should provide useful basic-data for conducting life-cycle
analyses of other product systems as well as future alternative energy systems, because of highly
reliable data qualified in terms of its source and representativeness. In addition, the life-cycle
greenhouse-gas emissions of LNG and city-gas 13A in 2010 were also predicted, taking into account
not only the improvement of technologies, but also the change of composition of LNG projects. As a
result of this analysis, the total amount of greenhouse-gas emissions of the whole city-gas 13A chain
at present was calculated to be 61.91 g-CO2/MJ, and the life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of LNG
and city-gas 13A in 2010 could be expected to decrease by about 1.1% of the current emissions

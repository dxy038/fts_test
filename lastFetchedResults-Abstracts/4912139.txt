The main objective of the research project reported in this paper is to design an assistive device that will help patients with eye-implant to have natural eye movement. The patients lose their eye for various reasons. The loss of an eye can be solved by the ocular implant. The artificial eye can be made like a real eye cosmetically. But the problem is that it is static and does not have the natural movement of an eye. We design an ocular assistive system to enable the artificial eye have the natural movement of a real eye. This paper starts with the literature review of the eye movement detection methods and followed by the description of the experimental system we designed and constructed. The paper is concluded with further considerations

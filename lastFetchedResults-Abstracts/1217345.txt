Background and Objective: Hemodynamic instability is the
most common acute complication of hemodialysis. Lowering
the dialysate temperature has been proposed to prevent this
event. The efficacy of this method for all patients is under
question. Therefore in this study the effect of cool dialysis
on patients who underwent hemodialysis and who were
susceptible to hemodynamic instability was investigated.
Subjects and Methods: Thirty-one patients who were
hypotension-prone during hemodialysis were enrolled in
this cross-over study. Each patient was hemodialyzed
twice, once using cool and once using standard temperature
dialysate solution. The wash-out period was one week. Except
temperature, other condition were maintained all the same.
Systolic blood pressure(SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP),
heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were
measured hourly and their changes from baseline values were
calculated. Oral temperature and the number of hypotensive
episodes were recorded. SPSS 17 was used for data analysis.
Results: SBP changes (in 2nd and 3rd hours), DBP changes
(in 3rd hour) and MAP changes (in 2nd, 3rd hours) were
significant with following P < 0.01, 0.01, 0.01,  < 0.01, 0.001
respectively. Percentage of hypotensive episodes during
standard and cool dialysis were 57.1 and 7.1 respectively
(P=0.013).
Conclusion: It seems cool hemodialysis can reduce
hemodynamic instability during hemodialysis especially in
patients who are susceptible to this complication.

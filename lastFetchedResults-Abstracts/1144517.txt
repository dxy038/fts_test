The main objective is to analyse the effects of the imposition of common velocity on the acoustic–structural interface via the Component Mode Synthesis Method (CMS). The original contribution of this analytical study is to show the importance of including kinematic compatibility on the structural-acoustic problem. Some background information about the method is provided as a basis for assisting the understanding of the process. Following this, the formulation of the structural-acoustic problem in terms of ‘components’ is described. The results obtained using CMS are compared to those obtained using both a one dimensional wave approach and standard modal analysis. Finally, conclusions are drawn based on the analysis of the results and the extension to three-dimensional acoustic systems discussed.

Water quality aspect with regard to dissolved oxygen was studied for a 24 kilometer
stretch of Malaprabha River in Karnataka State, India. Main objective of the research was to simulate
the predicted dissolved oxygen depletion due to the waste load allocation in the river with the
ambient observed values of dissolved oxygen, and to ascertain the application of mathematical
modeling for predicting the dissolved oxygen in a mixing zone. The entire river stretch selected for
the study was divided in to four stations and water samples were collected from each station, and
analyzed for different parameters. Station S1 was purely the upstream of the sewage discharge point
and hence reflected the water quality of the river without pollution. Station S2 and downstream
stations were the part of mixing zone where the discharged sewage at S2 kept spreading. Dissolved
oxygen levels at these four stations were calculated through mathematical modeling, considering all
variables that affect dissolved oxygen variation. Further, this predicted dissolved oxygen found
with the application of mathematical modeling was then simulated with the actual observed values
of dissolved oxygen in these four stations. The results were highly encouraging, with the predicted
values almost agreeing with the observed values. Thus the application of such mathematical modeling
may be useful for a river stretch where water pollution due to the discharge of effluents is expected,
and will help the engineers in arriving at a proper waste-load allocation for the river.

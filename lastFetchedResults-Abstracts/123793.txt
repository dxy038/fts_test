Introduction: Gastric cancer is the most common cancer in Guilan province.
Objective: This study was performed to evaluate the relation between gastric cancer and lifestyle habits. Materials and Methods: This is a hospital-based case-control study of matched pairs. Study subjects included 144 cases and 398 controls (from ophthalmology ward). All subjects were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. An average of approximately two controls were matched to each case based on age(Â±3 years). Sex, and time of hospitalization (2WK). Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to evaluate results, and a multivariate analysis of the data was performed by using a logistic regression model.
Results: A significantly elevated risk of contracting gastric cancer was observed in cigarette smokers (OR: 2.8. CI: L.2-S.S). Furthermore, a statistically significant positive dose-response trend in gastric cancer was demonstrated based on age at which smoking was initiated, the duration of the habit, and the number of cigarettes smoked per day. We did not find any significant association between other factors (dietary habits and socioeconomic factors) and gastric rancer.
Conclusion: Cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for gastric cancer in this region.

The main objective of this work is to study phase equilibria of pure and binary systems by application of the Monte Carlo molecular simulation method. The Gibbs ensemble method has been applied for this purpose. At first, vapor-liquid phase equilibrium of pure water and normal hexane was studied. For water molecules, the phase equilibria was studied using SPC-E, COMPASS and AMBER force fields and for the normal hexane, AMBER, CHARM-27 and TraPPE-UA force fields were used. Finally the simulation in the Gibbs ensemble was used for liquid-liquid-vapor phase equilibrium calculations for mixture of water and normal hexane. Results are in very good agreement with experimental data in pure cases while for the binaries the results fairly comparable to experimental data.

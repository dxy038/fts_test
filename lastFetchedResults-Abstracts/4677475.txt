Among the several components of distribution systems, protection devices present a fundamental importance, since they aim at keeping the physical integrity not only of the system equipment, but also of the electricians and the population in general. The correct application of the protection devices demand an elevated amount of time, being extremely laborious due to the great number of devices, besides the very dynamic behavior of distribution networks and the need for constant expansion. This article presents a computational tool developed with the objective of automatically determining the adjustments of all protection devices in the distribution networks so as to obtain the best technical application, optimizing its performance and expediting the making of protection studies.

Cup to disc ratio (CDR) is very important indicators in glaucoma detection. This paper proposes a method for glaucoma detection using digital fundus images with color multi-thresholding segmentation. The objective of this paper is to segment the optic cup and optic disc using color multi-thresholding segmentation and extracted feature such as cup to disc (c/d) ratio. Three ophthalmologists analysis was used as a reference to the automated segmented fundus image for a cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) measurement to discriminate glaucomatous from normal eyes. The performance of the optic cup and optic disc using color multi-thresholding segmentation has been evaluated and compared to each other. The results presented in this paper indicate that the features are clinically significant in the detection of glaucoma.

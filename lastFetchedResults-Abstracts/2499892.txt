Background & Objective: One of the most complicated and costly problems associated with drinking water providing, is called as corrosion. Corrosion processes can cause pitting problems, reducing lifetime of water utilities and loss of water which can lead to high cost. Therefore the aim of this study is to determine the corrosion and scaling indices of rural drinking water resources of Khorasan Razavi.
Material &  Methods: In this cross sectional study to evaluate water quality characteristics in the Khorasan Razavi resources, 879 samples were taken during 2013 were analyzed based on standard manual method book. Five indices including Langlier, Ryznar, Puckorius, Larson-Skold and Aggressiveness Index were programed in Excel software then scaling potential and corrosiveness of rural water of Khorasan razavi was studied.
Results: The results indicated that values of Langlier equals 0.33 )±0.14(, Ryznar equals 7.36 )±0.37(,Puckorius equals 7.4 )±0.6), Larson Ratio is equal to 2.1)±1.4( and Aggressiveness Index equals 12.03 )±0.18(.
Conclusions: In comparison of five stability indices, it was found that drinking water in the study area is corrosive. Thus essential actions for reducing corrosion and corrosion by-products, health and economic loss are required.

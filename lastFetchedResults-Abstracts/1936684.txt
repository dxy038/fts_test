Successful purpose-grown willow production systems require regular monitoring of willow growth to apply timely management techniques for increased productivity and timing of harvest for maximizing profit. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a novel method of estimating above-ground willow biomass, involving measuring light attenuation through the willow canopy, to calculate a ‘stem area index’ for relating to harvested willow biomass. Two different willow clones, with contrasting growth form, were used: single stem (Charlie) and multi-stem (SV1). Given the strong correlations (r2 &gt; 0.97; p &lt; 0.05) between the measured stem area index and harvested willow biomass, regardless of growth form, it appears that this simple mensurative technique is a promising alternative for estimating above-ground biomass in short-rotation willow plantations.

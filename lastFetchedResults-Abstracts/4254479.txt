A new state of the art frequency analysis tool (FAPS) for modelling electric traction systems has been developed by TNEI as a joint development with Alstom Transport and SNCF. The objective is to significantly improve the harmonic modelling and frequency domain characterisation of electric rail networks. The sufficiently accurate modelling of both passive and active components is key to the creation of a practical system simulation tool and a number of simplification assumptions about the electromagnetic behaviour of rails are necessary in order to provide a practical tool for large system analysis. A high-resolution finite element (FE) analysis was carried out to evaluate the validity and applicability of these assumptions as part of this development process.

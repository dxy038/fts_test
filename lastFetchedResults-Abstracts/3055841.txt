In this paper, we present an optimal bit allocation algorithm for multiple video objects (MVOÂ´s) in MPEG-4 video coding. We combine the rate-distortion models for texture and shape information to achieve the accurate rate control. To optimize the bit allocation for multiple video objects, we use the dynamic programming (DP). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the MPEG-4 verification model not only in terms of buffer stability but the objective quality.

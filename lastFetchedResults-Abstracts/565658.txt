Recently, due to growth in sport branches and increase in constraints and complications in sport competitions, mathematical models and operations research approaches have been significantly used for preparing sport schedules .Football leagues are also among such these competitions. In this paper, the scheduling problem of Iranian football league in which the goal is to minimize breaks and carry over effect is investigated. A new criterion, so-called “breaks for most popular teams” is introduced that has never been taken into account in literature. Final schedule will be obtained through three stages with different objective for each stage in which graph theory and simulated annealing algorithm have been used to solve the problem. Finally, comparing the results of the proposed algorithm with those in the literature shows effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

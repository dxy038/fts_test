Multiuser detection (MUD) is a key technique for combating multiple access interference (MAI) in CDMA systems. We propose a simple and effective multiuser receiver, which we refer to as the objective function based multiuser detector (OFMUD). This is a successive multistage joint detector based on the statistical optimization of an objective function. Two objective functions are considered in this paper. The first one is based on a maximum likelihood solution, and the second one is based on the least squared error solution. A key feature of the proposed detector is that among all the K user bits, we update the estimate of one and only one bit (the one that is most likely to be wrong) in every stage. Analytical and numerical results show that significant performance improvement can be achieved compared with the conventional DS/CDMA receiver. At the same time, the near-far problem is alleviated. In addition, it is shown that the proposed receiver can outperform the popular multiuser parallel interference cancellation receiver in most cases with a smaller computational cost

Engineer educational program is theoretically the same throughout the world. The light differences are in the credits and didactic means. If it seems the same in the theory undergone through lectures and practice through laboratory training, the educational program differs from one place to another when it is developed or applied in the field. The staff organizes field sessions in order to illustrate, develop, show and apply the knowledge given in classrooms and laboratories. This is covered principally in the neigh boring area and often for the illustrating needs it is necessary to move to particular places to show or to practice a specific demonstration. That hydrogeology educational program is given during five years at the University of TLEMCEN, Department of Earth Sciences. During the fourth year, there is a credit - which is totally devoted to the field (field credit: 30 days - continuous or not) and its content has been adapted to the particularities of this region. Our objective, in this paper, is to show the field sessions realized with our students in our area which presents different aspects in groundwaters, superficial waters, thermal sources and sewage waters and , if any, their different treatments.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fungal infection of external ear canal is a common and chronic disease that causes some complications. The objective of this study was to survey the fungal infections of external ear canal in Babol during 1999-2000.
METHODS: This study was done on all patients in different ages with diagnosis of fungal infections of external ear canal. Biopsy was done by otoscope and then examined in mycology laboratory. Direct tests and culture were performed on samples for isolation of colony of fungi.

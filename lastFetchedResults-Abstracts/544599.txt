Objective: many peoples such as chemical veterans due to exposing in chemical gas may be have an dysfunction in their respiratory system which disrupt exercise and daily activity. This investigation was performed to study the respiratory parameters in different body positions (standing, chair-sitting, supine and side-lying) in chemical veterans.
Methods; 10 chemical veterans (age 42.7±5 yrs; height 174.8±5.4 cm; weight 80.8+6 kg) participated in this study. Respiratory parameters such as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Tidal Volume (TV), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), Minute Ventilation (VE), Breathing Frequency (FB) and FEVl/FVC ratio were measured by spirometer in different body positions. ANOVA with repeated measure was used to show the mean difference in each parameter between body positions.
Results: The results showed that lung volume in standing position tend to higher value compare to other positions although these differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05).
Conclusions: Small changes observed in respiratory parameters of chemical veterans in various body positions may be clinically important and suggests that standing is the best position for physical activity and exercise and as possible avoid from exposure in other positions that may reduce lung function.

This cytogenetic study deals with cell material obtained from 15 pleural fluids from 11 patients with breast cancer and 27 ascitic fluids from 16 patients with ovarian cancer; in addition, 8 pleural, 5 ascitic, and 1 pericardial fluid from patients with tuberculosis, liver cirrhosis, and heart insufficiency, were studied. Using mainly direct methods, as well as short-term cell cultures, the chromosome spreads were GTG-banded. Cancerous biopsies showed a plethora of numerical and structural chromosome anomalies and exhibited broad aneuploidy. Chromosomes participating more often in numerical and structural aberrations were 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 17. This study provides further cytogenetic evidence for the involvement of these chromosomes in breast and ovarian malignancy.

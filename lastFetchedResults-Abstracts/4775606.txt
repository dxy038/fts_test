In this paper we address the problem of batching orders in a parallel-aisle warehouse, with the objective to minimize the travel distance of picking all of the batches. This study develops an order batching approach based on genetic algorithms (GAs). Unlike to previous batching methods, in this paper it pays attention on the selection of seed orders. And it obviously reduce the distance of picking compared with other approach.

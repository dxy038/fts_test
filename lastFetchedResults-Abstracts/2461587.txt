In magnetic confinement fusion, the operation of next generation devices will be significantly different compared to present day machines. The duration length of the discharges will require abandoning the traditional paradigm of processing and storing the data after the shot. In fact most information will have to be made available in real-time. The significant issues of machine protection will require more sophisticated and at the same time more robust feedback control schemes. Another very important issue emerged in the last years of JET operation, and which is expected to become more severe in ITER, is the large amount of data to be analysed, which cannot be handled in the most efficient way with traditional methods.

er to prepare for the operation of ITER, some tests are being performed at JET. The capacity of the real-time network has increased in the last years, and many more systems, mainly diagnostics have been connected to it in order to test their reliability and to assess the quality of the information they can provide for feedback control. To reduce the amount of data, a prototype of real-time adaptive data acquisition techniques is being implemented, to adjust the acquisition frequency to the time resolution of the phenomena to be analysed in the plasma. Lossless data compression techniques have been refined and various intelligent signal processing methods have already been implemented to allow an easier and more objective first screening of the data. To allow scientists from wide and diffuse communities to participate in the scientific and technical programme, various innovative tools for remote participation and experimentation are also being actively investigated.

The paper presents a fully automated procedure to optimize the performance of the on-board generator used in electromagnetic Maglev trains. The procedure utilizes FEM analyses to determine the mathematical model of the generator and then calculates the generator output characteristics by means of step-by-step numerical simulations. On the basis of these characteristics, a suitable objective function is defined. The function is minimized, iteratively changing the geometrical configuration until a stop criterion is satisfied

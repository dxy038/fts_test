Background: Well-being means the harmony in all dimensions of an individual.  Dimensions of psychological well-being include independence, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relationship, purposeful life, and self-acceptance.
Objective: The present study was aimed to determine the factor structure of the three-question version of the Ryff psychological well-being scale. 
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which 330 students of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences were selected based on a multistage random sampling. The participants responded to questions of the short version of Ryff psychological well-being scale. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and factor analysis.
Findings: Factor analysis showed that the multidimensional model of psychological well-being scale in its three-question version acceptably fitted with the data. Also, the factor analysis of this scale yielded four factors while two questions were deleted due to absence of load on any factor.
Conclusion: The results obtained in this study were different from that of six-dimension model and only four factors extracted. However, due to presence of appropriate reliability, this scale could be a suitable tool to measure the psychological well-being among students.

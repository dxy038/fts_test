For achieving the high gain characteristics of LLC resonant converters in both of the power flow directions for bidirectional power transfer applications, a bidirectional LLC resonant converter with auxiliary switches is proposed. Auxiliary switches are connected in the primary and secondary sides of the proposed converter, respectively. A 800W prototyped bidirectional LLC resonant dc-dc converter for interfacing the 400V<sub>DC</sub> buses is built and tested to verify the validity and applicability of the proposed converter.

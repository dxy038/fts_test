The objective of this paper is to study the representer method for the inverse problem of combined parameter and state estimation in single-phase Darcy flow in porous media. A variational formulation is posed for the generalized inverse problem in the sense of weighted least-squares. An iterative representer-based algorithm is derived to approximate the Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations. It is proved that the linearized problem can be solved exactly by an extension of the representer method which inherits the same well-known properties of this technique. Implementation of the numerical algorithm for synthetic numerical experiments shows improved estimates of the poorly known prior guess.

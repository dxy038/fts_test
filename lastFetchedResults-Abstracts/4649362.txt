Cloud computing has several differences from distributed computing in that the former is a special form of the latter. Whereas redundant functions and data are needed in distributed systems for reason of dependability, cloud applications should not support such functions and data, because cloud computing infrastructures support dependability on behalf of the applications. This paper addresses resource allocations for applications on cloud computing rather than applications on typical distributed computing. The approach proposed in this paper is to enable redundant architectures, e.g., master-slave architectures, to be dynamically transformed into less redundant architectures with the objective of minimizing the costs associated with them and meeting customer demands and application requirements in a self-adaptive manner.

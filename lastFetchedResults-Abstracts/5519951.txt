The current state of high-security facilities protection problem is governed by variety of factors, including application of physical protection systems. On the other hand efficiency of such systems is often determined based on expert opinions rather than precise analysis. In this paper we present a mathematical model of physical protection system, which can be used to estimate intruders detection probability and possibility of suppressing their actions. This model enables one to perform an objective analysis of the systemÂ´s efficiency of solving problems that it has been designed to face.

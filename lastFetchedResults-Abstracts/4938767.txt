Network traffic signal control in oversaturated scenarios has to be disposed systematically. Three main components, network control objectives, control strategies and network flow models, are critical in it. This study selects the cell transmission model (CTM) to describe traffic flow characteristics and develops an optimal control model using one kind of network throughput performance indices, system dispersal time (SDT), as the control objective. Signal timing plans are calculated by gene algorithm optimization with common cycle strategy and these timing plans are evaluated by VISSIM at last. By regularization method analysis, the dispersal trajectory characteristics are derived out. Results show that a proper non-maximum cycle length will disperse congested network vehicles rapidly and a better fixed signal timing strategy will always try to disperse the congested vehicles in the congestion prophase

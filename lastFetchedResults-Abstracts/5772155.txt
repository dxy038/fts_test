The objective of this study is to describe townscapes from a semiotic viewpoint, and to construct simulation systems in order to realize meaningful townscapes. A townscape, a stage of human life, can be read as a text. It consists of various signs such as properties, formal elements, and systems. We are able to find abundant meanings including image, atmosphere, orientation, identity, and cultural symbol. Therefore it is necessary to describe not only signs but also relations among signs, and to grasp the multi-modal semiosis of townscapes. It is possible to find many signs and relations. In this study, we regard the traditional townscapes in Japan as dynamical systems with semiosis in order to regenerate beautiful townscapes. Then we introduce the object system developed in the area of artificial intelligence, and describe the complex network of various signs in townscapes. It is possible to detect relation designs of townscapes and evaluate them using simulation systems based on the object system.

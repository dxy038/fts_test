The objective of this research is to improve the ranking of the power transformer condition based on their severity which will then facilitate the maintenance engineer to prioritize maintenance work on more critical transformer. It describes a hybrid methodology to fuse power transformer condition´s evidence by using Weibull function and Yager Combination Rule. Field transformer data were collected and mathematical algorithms were developed to model degree of belief assigned to power transformer condition´s propositions. The ranking of the power transformers based on this methodology is compared with the ranking of power transformer by single evidence. Different sets of failed transformers data were collected to evaluate this approach. Finally, we demonstrate the interpretation of power transformer condition based on Yager´s combination rule.

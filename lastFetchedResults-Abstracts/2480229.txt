Based on Allamah Tabatabaei's view, 'expediency' has a real existence. However, having a real existence does not mean having an external reality. Rather, 'expediency' is one of philosophical concepts with a real origin of abstraction. Various explanations have been put forward for the reality of expediency. Among them is the idea that expediency is an existential and continuous entity and a requisite of the nature of things; it is the foundation of conventional concepts, and the same as divine precept and action. It is the sign of the wisely done actions, and a criterion for inherent goodness. Careful examination of Allama Tabatabaie's works, suggests four modes of existence for expediency: real objective existence, an existence beyond objectivity and subjectivity, subjective existence, and conventional existence. Based on Allamah Tabatabaie's view, expediency has weak and strong existential grades. Here, we have explained gradation in expediency based on instances of expediency that are: the reality of things, goal, action, and society. We have, then, found the context for the realization of expediency in the two worlds of ‘creation’  and 'legislation'.

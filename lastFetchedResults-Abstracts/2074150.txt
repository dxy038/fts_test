In human societies, particularly in the area of politics and security, power
that is linked to the basic concepts such as sovereignty and survival of
vital values, has an important position. The power with features such as
“legitimacy”, “influence” and “efficiency” is called authority. Governments
always strive to maintain and expand their sources and methods of production
and reproduction of authority at national level. Considering the importance
of national authority, the recognition of its components and explanation
of influence and position of each component is necessary. Present study,
which is developmental- applicable research, by employing case study
technique and also explanation of the most important component of national
authority, i.e. security defense, is attempting to make clear its role in the
consolidation and development of national authority of Islamic Republic
of Iran. Hence,opinions of Imam Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamenei, the
supreme leader, as founders of Islamic republic of Iran were reviewed as
well. Results of present study indicated that the security defense component
has a special status in national authority’s material and objective aspects but
main base of its influence is relying upon spiritual dimension.

In this paper, a control design of Digital Signal Processor based a power factor corrected(PFC) converter and a bidirectional converter for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) is discussed. In order to design current and voltage controllers of the PFC converter and the bi-directional converter for PHEVs, small signal models are used. Design procedures of current controllers for the PFC controller and the bi-directional converter are explained and analyzed by using small signal models and bode plots. The suggesting design procedures of controllers for the PFC converter and the bi-directional converter are verified, and validated throughout simulations and a DSP based prototype.

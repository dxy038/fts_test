This work addresses issues relevant to the project CLES (Cognitive and Linguistic Element Stimulation) which aims to develop a serious game for diagnosis and training of children with cognitive disabilities. In this context, our objective is to propose a system capable of generating adaptive scenarios taking into account the user´s profile. A scenario here is a suite of pedagogical activities allowing the learner to achieve his/her pedagogical goal(s). The system is intended to be as generic as possible i.e. capable of being utilized with a variety serious games. Therefore, we´ve identified and separated different types of knowledge represented by the system namely, the domain concepts, the pedagogical resources and the serious game resources.

In this paper, a detailed analytical modeling based on Maxwell equations is presented for analysis and design of permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor with Halbach array. In order to mitigate thrust ripple, the main design parameters of the analyzed machine are optimized by using genetic algorithm in an appropriate objective function. The results show an enhancement in the motor performance. Finally, we have used 2-D nonlinear time-stepping transient finite-element method to demonstrate validity of the analytical analysis and design optimization.

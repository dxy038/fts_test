Electric and plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles are soon likely to be integrated as bidirectional energy storage elements with the electric grid or local microgrids. This paper discusses the interfacing of a plug-in vehicle with a lab-scale microgrid, and how this integration was successfully achieved with a power electronics converter that utilizes a power-following droop controller. Simulations, which are verified with experimental results obtained with two electric research vehicles and a lab-scale microgrid, demonstrate that for both single and three-phase cases the imbalances created by vehicle charging and discharging meet, or nearly meet the required power quality and phase imbalance standards. The power-following droop control is validated as an effective way of supporting the microgrid during transients as well as maintaining, in the long term, a desired charging rate. Fast charging is also briefly introduced as part of the future work.

Meshkin Chai catchment area is a part of the northern slopes of Sabalan heights, Gosheh-dog and Meshkin-Ahar depression. Neo-tectonics activities in this region have caused the intensification of instability in slopes (landslide, Debris flow and etc). Therefore recognizing neo-tectonic situation is necessary for environmental planning and avoidance of any construction in the active fault region. The objective of this research is to evaluate the Neo-tectonics activities in the river basin of Meshkin-chai. For obtaining the results, we have used quantitative methods such as Drainage Basin shape Index (Bs), Drainage Basin Asymmetry Index (Af), Transverse topographic Symmetric Index (T), Mountain-front Sinuosity Index (J), Hypsometric Integral (Hi), Hypsometric Curve (Hc), Width of the valley bottom to its height (Vf), Stream Sinuosity Index (S), Stream Length Gradient Index (SL), Relative Active Tectonic Index (Iat).The analysis of the obtained results Shows that all of the study regions are active from  the view point of tectonics activities. Tectonic activities in sub basin of Meshkin Chai are more than Bino-Chai and Kor-Kor chai sub basins.

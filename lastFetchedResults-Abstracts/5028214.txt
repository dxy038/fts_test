The Technology Foresight programme was announced in the 1993 White Paper `Realising Our PotentialÂ´ on science, engineering and technology. It brings together industrialists and scientists from private enterprise, the Universities, and Government. The objective is to consider how the UK can best take advantage of the markets and technologies likely to emerge during the next 10-20 years, and identify the investments and actions necessary to exploit them. The focus is on quantitative (wealth creation including job creation/maintenance) and qualitative (quality of life) issues. Results of Foresight will inform spending decisions made by Government and industry. It will also help small and medium sized businesses which do not have the resources to undertake their own research

A servomotor design that is powered and controlled through only one wire is presented. A traditional servomotor needs both a power cable and a control cable connecting the motor to a control amplifier. Cables are bulky, heavy, and expensive and, more importantly, difficult to install and maintain in many applications. Particularly for multi-axis applications, like robots and machine tools, cable harnesses become thick and long, and are difficult to run through a stack of many axes, this is a major burden and bottleneck in electromechanical drives. The objective of this research is to eliminate such bulky cables by integrating and consolidating power cables and signal cables into a single wire, and transmitting control signals through the signal wire. Signals are coded by using a CDMA protocol and are superimposed on the single wire that supplies a DC voltage to each motor. In the paper first the principle of reduced-cable smart motors is described, followed by the architecture of the signal transmission system using direct sequence spread spectrum. A prototype system is designed, and the signal transmission line is simulated to verify the principle.

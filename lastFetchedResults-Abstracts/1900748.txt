The present article focuses on the results of a comparative study of Nezami's narratives in Haft Peikar and some historical works. The main concern of this study is to determine the extent that Haft Peikar’s narratives are adaptable with the historical facts. Also, the most important objective of this study is to determine Nezami’s exploitation from historical texts and also, distortions he has made to narrate the historical events.
The results obtained from content analysis method showed that some sections in Haft Peikar have been produced based on historical texts, while others are the results of the poet’s own literary reflections as well as distortions he has made over- using his poetic imagination- into historical accounts.

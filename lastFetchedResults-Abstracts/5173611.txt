A new type of prediction model has been established by using entropy theory to predict changes of financial status of the listed companies. This model can be applied to enterprise ranking according to the financial status. Furthermore, the objective weight is assigned to each index in this model to remove weakness appeared in the case of subjective weight. Both financial indexes and corporate governance indexes data are applied to the demonstration analysis of the listed companies in metal and nonmetal industry. It proves that this entropy theory based-prediction model becomes very feasible and reliable to evaluate the financial status of the listed companies.

There is a great need to deploy technologies like Speech Recognition, IVR, SMS and web applications in the health sector that will provide patients (especially out-patients) with real-time management of illnesses, reactions or side effects to prescribed medication, update patients on scheduled doctor patient appointments and make prescription reminders, provide survey data for medical research, facilitate access diagnosis from a physician and general medical assistance using a combination of a web services, speech recognition, IVR and SMS.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic enteropathy caused by hypersensitivity to gluten. Most studies have shown more prevalence of CD in the patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1). The prevalence of CD among DM1 children is unknown. The aim of this study is to survey the prevalence of celiac disease in type 1 diabetic children in East Azarbaijan.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 135 children with diabetes mellitus type 1 referring to Tabriz children hospital endocrine department and clinic from 2006 to 2008 were selected. The serumic level of A-tTG-A-IgA and AEA-IgA were measured by ELISA method and serum IgA level was measured by nephelometry for screening of celiac disease. In the case that A-tTG-A either AEA was high, distal duodenal biopsy was preformed. FINDINGS: Twenty eight of 135 patients with diabetes mellitus type 1, were serologically positive for celiac. Four of 28 (14.28%) seropositive paitients were A-tTG-A positive, ten (35.71%) of them were AEA positive and fourteen (50%) were A-tTG-A and AEA positive. Confirmed celiac prevalence based on biopsy was 6.8%. CONCLl SI ON: Celiac disease in diabetic patients (DM1) is common. Screening of celiac disease with serologic tests in diabetic patients is necessary for the purpose of early diagnosis and prevention from severe complications of celiac disease.

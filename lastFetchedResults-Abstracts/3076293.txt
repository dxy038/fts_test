The requirement to modularize the cell phone and other handset devices was initially driven by the objective of simplifying the platform level development of the radio frequency section and of improving the high volume manufacturability. To facilitate the high paced demand for miniaturization and integration of the RF portion of the wireless subsystem, Amkor Technology and Intel Corporation have started to engage in using SiP (system in package) technology for new RF products. This initiated the development of a complete design chain flow involving package development using integrated and overmolded RF shielding, RF circuit design with integrated components, specialized testing, and assembly processes. Both parties have aligned their efforts to continually optimize their respective RF-SiP designs. Both partiesÂ´ system engineers, circuit designers, RF silicon engineers, layout specialists, RF test engineers, and manufacturing teams have engaged to work together in an optimized design environment. The SiP design team was challenged with miniaturization, cost reductions, performance enhancements, high volume manufacturability, and shortened design cycles. This paper provides an overall RF subsystem high level overview and it discusses in detail the frequency domain response of embedded passive filters in a multilayer low cost organic substrate. It also illustrates how the measured data is combined with accurate full wave 3D simulation, for enhanced tool calibration and design optimization.

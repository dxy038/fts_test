In this work, we present the design process of the shelf antennas used in an RFID-based Library Management System (LMS). The objective of our design is to maximize tag readability and reduce interference to nearby shelves. The designed shelf antenna must ensure readability of tagged books placed on the particular shelf avoiding identification of books residing at neighboring shelves. At the same time, the antenna design should maintain the induced SAR on library users below the existing exposure guidelines.

In this formulation, the objective function and operating constraints include the corona
power-loss term. The objective function consists of three terms: cost of investment of new
transmission lines, ohmic power loss of new and existing lines, and corona-power loss of new
lines. This combination of terms results in a non-linear objective function. The non-linear
programming or the non-convex optimization technique is used to solve such large-scale
practical problem. The new formulation has been applied to the 28-bus Jordanian high-voltage
transmission network in order to test and justify its applicability.

In the present paper, a non-diagonal multi-input multi-output (MIMO) Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) controller design methodology is applied to control the lateral and yaw motions of a car equipped with four-wheel steering. The overall objective is to track the sideslip angle and yaw-rate with the aim of achieving satisfactory performance specifications for the vehicle lateral dynamics, regarding the rejection of external disturbances on yaw rate and sideslip angle, minimizing the interaction as much as possible and taking into account the model uncertainty.

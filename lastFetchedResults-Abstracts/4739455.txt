In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to analyze supply chain coordination consisted of a manufacturer and an outsourcer in green remanufacturing. On condition that allowing manufacturer delay in payment, we build an objective function of optimal profit of supply chain in different outsourcing degree. And further research several parameters such as time of delay-in-payment, cost of products from outsourcer to manufacturer to explore their influence to optimal profit . Find the best coordination strategy to supply chain about those parameters. Numerical examples are illustrated the efficacy of the developed model and the procedure developed for solving the problem.

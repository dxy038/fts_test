This paper shows some experimental results on wind erosion of sand particles, placed inside a rectangular box with the upper surface exposed to the flow. Data presented were achieved from a wind tunnel simulation. Results include erosion rate, free-surface profile change, vertical deformation rate, and also flow topology for several loose boundary geometries. Some visualization tests illustrate the path of particles, depicturing how the eroded bed evolutes.

in objective of this work is focused on the achievement of data useful for the benchmark of numerical models dealing with wind erosion phenomenon, in situations where the free-surface changes due to the removal and/or deposition of granular particles. Practical cases related with the present work include situations where coal particles are removed from stockyard piles, or dust is released during transportation of a granular material in open containers.

This paper presents a subject-independent facial action unit (AU) detection method by introducing the concept of relative AU detection, for scenarios where the neutral face is not provided. We propose a new classification objective function which analyzes the temporal neighborhood of the current frame to decide if the expression recently increased, decreased or showed no change. This approach is a significant change from the conventional absolute method which decides about AU classification using the current frame, without an explicit comparison with its neighboring frames. Our proposed method improves robustness to individual differences such as face scale and shape, age-related wrinkles, and transitions among expressions (e.g., lower intensity of expressions). Our experiments on three publicly available datasets (Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+), Bosphorus, and DISFA databases) show significant improvement of our approach over conventional absolute techniques.

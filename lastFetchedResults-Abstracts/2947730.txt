Focuses on inexact strategies and planning. As an example and implementation, we integrate geographic information system (GIS) and fuzzy decision support system (DSS) technology to explore route planning in Taipei city, Taiwan. The first objective is to build a useful route-planning GIS in Taipei. We have proposed functions such as spatial querying and landmark location. In the second objective, we incorporate inexact information into spatial information, such as distances and traffic jams, and propose an inexact strategy to help with making decisions in these route-planning systems

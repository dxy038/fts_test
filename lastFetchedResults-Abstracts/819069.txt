Abstract

Background and Objective: Enterococci are the gram-positive bacteria existing in the intestines of humans(as a normal flora), indairy products and in our environment that they have emerged asan importantcauseofopportunistic nosocomial infections in recent years. In this study, we aimedat investigatingand comparing theefficiency of MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy method through biochemical and molecular methods for detecting Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.

Material and Methods:the  clinical samples (N=75)  collected for biochemical, molecular and mass spectroscopy investigation were examined by Esculin hydrolysis, Catalase, Pyrrolidonylaminopeptidase, 6.5% NaCl, Motility, 0.04% Tellurite, L-Arabinose and Sorbitol. Then, they were assessed by using Allele specific PCR and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and Biotyper software. 
Results:thirty samplesof Enterococcusfaeciumand 42of Enterococcusfaecalisare detectedand in three sample both of them recognized. In biochemical analysis, two isolates of E. faeciumare Arabinose negative and one of  E. faecalisis Telliurite negative. Also in PCR results, two of the samples do not have any clear bonds. In mass spectroscopy analysis, allstrains are correctly detected and well defined.

Conclusion: According to the results of present study, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a reliable and accurate method that can easily and quickly identify Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, with a sensitivity of 100%. This procedure can be compared tomolecular and biochemical methods, based on the exactness and rapidity of performance.  
Key words: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, MALDI-TOF, mass spectrometry,

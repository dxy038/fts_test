The main objective of this research is to detect the most important factors affecting national coherence. Examining the related resources and summing up the arguments, it follows that there are miscellaneous factors that have an effect upon the national coherence and solidity.  This research addresses 12 factors of the most important of these.
Also, one can conclude that in a society, the stronger the economical development, the cultural development, the political development, the national identity, the popularity of this state, the political participation, democracy, nationalism, the equality of the citizens, the political consent of the elites, and the official language, the stronger the national coherence and solidity in that society will be.  Another conclusion that can be made from this research in an implied manner is the desirability of the state of national coherence and unity in the community of Iran. The community of Iran is formed by different clans or miscellaneous religious and linguistic groups such as Farsis, Azeris, Baluchs, Lors, etcâ€¦, which have been sharing a common Iranian identity, culture and customs. Considering the fact that the twelve factors affecting the national coherence of the Iranian community are in a rather good condition, and are in a developing state, compared with many neighboring societies, on the one hand, and regarding the political background of national unity and Iran on the other, one can conclude that the level of national coherence in Iran is rather high.

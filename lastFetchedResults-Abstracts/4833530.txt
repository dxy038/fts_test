The main objective of this advanced seminar is to provide a comprehensive and clear overview of the concepts and core research challenges in mobile sensor databases at this point in time. To this end, this seminar starts by introducing emerging applications and projects that produce and manage MSD. We then discuss about the state-of-the-art techniques and their limitations for the key research areas in MSD: data models, querying and indexing, data mining, and uncertainty management.

A planning method for unraveling manipulation of deformable linear objects is proposed. In manipulation of a linear object, its raveling must be avoided. It takes much time to unravel it once it is raveled. Therefore, it is important to generate unraveling plans efficiently. First, a manipulation process of a linear object including its unraveling is represented as a sequence of its crossing state transitions. Then, possible manipulation processes can be generated once the initial and the objective crossing states are given. Second, qualitative actions to realize manipulation processes are determined. Third, a method for unraveling a linear object as far as possible when its crossing state can not be identified completely is proposed. Finally, an example of unraveling process generation is demonstrated

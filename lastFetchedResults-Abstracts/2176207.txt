The objective of this study was to characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil and extracts of Ptychotis verticillata. The antioxidative activities of this species were also evaluated to suggest it as a new potential source of natural antioxidants. Analysis of the chemical composition of P. verticillata essential oil from Morocco was carried out using GC and GCâ€“MS. The oil was dominated by phenolic compounds (48.0%) with carvacrol (44.6%) and thymol (3.4%) as the main compounds. Plant phenolics constitute one of the major groups of components that act as primary antioxidant free radical terminators. The amounts of total phenolics and flavonoids in the solvent extracts (diethyl ether and ethyl acetate) were determined spectrometrically. Furthermore, the antioxidant activities of the essential oil and extracts were determined using a DPPH test system. The DPPH scavenging activity of extracts increased in the order ethyl acetate &gt; ascorbic acid &gt; diethyl ether &gt; essential oil. Finally, a relationship was observed between the antioxidant activity potential and total phenolic and flavonoid levels of the extract.

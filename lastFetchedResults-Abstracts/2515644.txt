Background and Objective: Oral Lichen Planus (OLP) is a chronic and precancerous disease. The imbalances between   the levels of free radical and antioxidants may play an important role in the onset and development of several inflammatory oral pathologies such as Lichen Planus. Melatonin as an antioxidant can play a role in scavenging free radicals and prevent OLP conversion to cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate melatonin level in patients with OLP. 
Subjects and Methods: In this analytical study twenty two patients diagnosed with OLP, were recruited as patients group, and twenty age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were recruited as control group. Melatonin levels in whole unstimulate saliva (WUS) was determined by ELISA test. Statistically analyzed was carried out with LSD and Duncan test.
Result: The mean saliva melatonin levels in patients with OLP was lower than those of healthy control group, but it was not statistically significant (P=0.3). The mean saliva melatonin levels in patients with reticular type of OLP compared with control group was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) but in  erythematose/ulcerative type was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrated that the level of melatonin was decreased in patients with Licben planus, and supports the notion that more attention to treatment of this much neglected disease need to be made. These findings also suggest that the low level of this antioxidant may lead to more destructive injury and put the patients at risk of development of oral cancer..

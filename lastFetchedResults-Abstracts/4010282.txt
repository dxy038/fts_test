This paper proposes a single-phase to three-phase drive system composed of two parallel single-phase rectifiers, a three-phase inverter, and an induction motor. The proposed topology permits to reduce the rectifier switch currents, the harmonic distortion at the input converter side, and presents improvements on the fault tolerance characteristics. Even with the increase in the number of switches, the total energy loss of the proposed system may be lower than that of a conventional one. The model of the system is derived, and it is shown that the reduction of circulating current is an important objective in the system design. A suitable control strategy, including the pulsewidth modulation technique (PWM), is developed. Experimental results are presented as well.

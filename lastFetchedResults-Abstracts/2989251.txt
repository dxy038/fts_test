High-voltage research, which is usually directed at equipment for service, has to take into account the final aim of satisfactory performance in the power system. The adoption of a test standard for research is not sufficient, if it is not proven that the simplifications made to convert the system stresses into test conditions are also valid for the research objective. High-voltage testing is, in most areas, well specified by standards. Its quality, therefore, is guaranteed, if the requirements in these standards are correctly observed. Contrary to the field of research quality, therefore, testing quality is matter of quality management and only this area is addressed by the relevant standards

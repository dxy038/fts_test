The problem of human will and option and its relationship with divine destiny and its stages within the intellectual structure of transcendental wisdom are of special importance. Divine destiny indicates that the entire universe with its two scientific and objective stages is attributed to God. In terms of comparison with the general worlds of existence, if we consider the divine destiny as the same stage of rational forms which is beyond the natural and mental forms, this form will be taken as a stage of the divine science stages which is called scientific destiny and in a higher stage, it is led to the divine innate science. And if we consider the causal system of the universe and attribute it to its complete and existence-giving cause, the destiny will become objective. Therefore, the human choice could be discussed at the two above-mentioned levels. The main question of the study is that how is it possible to provide a bilateral relationship between human choice and the necessity of existence which is the objective destiny insofar as accepting one of them does not lead to the rejection of the other. The response to this problem is proposed in two levels of theosophico-philosophical and monotheistico-mystical in transcendental philosophy. This study intends to shed more light on this topic with an analytico-descriptive method.

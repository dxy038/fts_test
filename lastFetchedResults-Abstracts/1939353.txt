Inroduction & Objective Studies have shown that stress has different effects on the body's endocrine system. Exposure to stressful conditions causes changes in thyroid hormone. With respect to the role of probiotics in reducing stress, the purpose of this study the effects of probiotic Bacillus brevis native Iranian thyroid hormones T3, T4 in male rats under chronic restraint stress.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 32 male Wistar rats aged 4 weeks and weighing approximately 110-130 gr. After adaptation for 10 days, animals randomly divided into 4 groups. Negative and positive control groups daily-received 1 ml of PBS buffer with pH: 7.2 while positive control received chronic restraint stress (CRS) for 15 minutes each day. Two Trial Groups were daily gavage with 1 ml of PBS with Bacillus brevis (2×109 cfu/ml). Trial group 2 received CRS for 21 days of experiments. Animals killed at the end of experiment and blood samples took from their hearts. The levels of T3 and T4 hormones assayed in the serum samples using ELISA methods.
Results: Results obtained from this test to compare 2 groups of negative and positive control showed that stress caused a significant reduction in levels of 0.05367± 0.001333 to 0.0444± 0.001288 is (PValue=0.0008). While T4 level in experimental group 1 compared with negative control group no significant difference was observed. (PValue = 00.0845). Levels of hormones T4 test group 2 compared with the positive control group increased (PValue  > 0.001). The amount of hormones T4 trial group 2 significantly greater than groups 1 so that the amount of hormone secretion from 0.05071 ± 0.0008921 to 0.0637 ± 0.01190 is reached(PValue  > 0.001). Therefore probiotics stress hormone T4 levels significantly increases the T3 no significant differences between groups were observed on.
Conclusion: Probiotic Bacillus brevis T4 hormone levels in rats increases in stress conditions. The results of this study can be a contributing factor in the use of Bacillus brevis thyroid hormone levels may play an important role.

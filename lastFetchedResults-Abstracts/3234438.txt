The Personalized Electronic Health Record System for Monitoring Patients with Chronic Disease (PEHRS-MPCD) is designed to permit tracking and monitoring of the symptoms of patients with chronic disease and provide healthcare professionals with data on patients´ lifestyle changes, medication (drug) changes, diet changes and symptom changes. The current method of assessing the symptoms of patients with chronic disease uses an episodic approach that includes phone calls to the patient, paper surveys of health status and on-site examinations. A preventative approach that can actively involve the patient, monitor multiple conditions and provide real time information about a patient´s health condition is proven to be effective in chronic disease care. PEHRS-MPCD is designed to continually monitor patients. The goal of the application is to continuously gain and provide patients´ information to themselves and healthcare professionals in-order to improve the efficiency of the diagnosis and timely intervention which would yield better quality of care and quality of life for the patient. This personalized electronic health record system (PEHRS-MPCD) will be objective in providing feedback about patient lifestyle changes and choices, and in channeling this information to healthcare providers. PEHRS-MPCD would (a) allow for relevant data to be entered by the patient, (b) make relevant data available to patient´s care provider, at real-time and at doctor´s visit, (c) generate reports and graphs for the data and (d) provide secure storage of the data. PEHRS-MPCD is a work in progress as a lot of its functionalities and user interface design are still being amended. This paper describes the purpose, need and design of the application.

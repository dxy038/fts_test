The objective of this research was to develop a new computer-based system for psychomotor skill assessment. The focus was on the simulation of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) reproduction test incorporating a haptic interface. Various system functions were created to support customized testing protocols that are based on specific user requirements, facilitate semiautomated scoring of tests, and produce quantitative test output. Advanced technologies of pattern recognition were reviewed and adapted for the system development. This approach yielded an application for recording freehand drawings and recognizing and normalizing drawing strokes for semiautomated scoring according to a standard. The new simulator system was validated by comparison with traditional paper-based tests in which participants were asked to use their nondominant hand to simulate a minor motor impairment. Results demonstrated the simulator to be sensitive to functional differences between dominant and nondominant hand use. The computerized scoring software also appeared to be valid for generating ROCF scores, which were consistent with manual scores determined by a trained rater for the same drawing stimuli.

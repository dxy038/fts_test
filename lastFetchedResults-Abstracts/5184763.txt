This paper proposes an algorithm of objective association rules used in data mining, which is suitable for mining some potential rules related to the given object from large data warehouse. The basic principle of algorithm is that the association rules were formed according to this especial information, which is mined with binary logic "and" operation from many attribute-values of database, where data have been expressed by binary. The theory of algorithm is quite simple. It is feasible and efficient to execute the algorithm. It is a practical significance to apply to the algorithm in some applicable domains to search especial objective association rules.

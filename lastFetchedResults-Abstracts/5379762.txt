First, a multiple objective programming model is presented based on dynamic multiple attribute decision-making with interval numbers, and then the attribute weight vectors and the integrated values are computed in order to judge weather there is dominant alternative. Finally, the method is applied to a practical example and the results show that the method is rational and effective

The concept of small medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) was created and implemented by the South African Government in an attempt to improve the economy of South Africa, reducing the unemployment rate and eliminating poverty. In recent years however, the sustainability of theses entities are at an all time low, as popular literature reveals that fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) retail SMMEs make ineffective use of their accounting resources, resulting in critical decisions business decisions being made, without understanding and correctly interpreting their financial performance and positions respectively. As a result, it is perceived that these SMMEs make ineffective use of their financial performance measures. The key objective of this paper is to establish what financial performance measures sourced from accounting resources are regarded as being critical for the sustainability of FMCG retail SMMEs during the current dispensation of an economic depression in South Africa.

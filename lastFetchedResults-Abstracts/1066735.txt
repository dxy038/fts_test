This paper describes the application of a networked version of TOPMODEL, TOPNET, as part of the Distributed Model Intercomparison Project (DMIP). The model implementation is based on a topographically derived river network with spatially distributed sub-basins draining to each network reach. The river network is mapped from the US National Elevation Dataset Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using procedures that objectively estimate drainage density from geomorphic principles. Rainfall inputs are derived from NEXRAD (radar) for each sub-basin. For each sub-basin, the wetness index distribution is derived from the DEM. The initial model parameters for each sub-basin are estimated using look up tables based on soils (STATSGO) and vegetation (1-km AVHRR). These initial model parameters provide the spatially distributed pattern of parameters at the scale of each sub-basin. Calibration uses a multiplier for each parameter to adjust the parameters while retaining the relative spatial pattern obtained from the soils and vegetation data. Parameter multipliers were calibrated using the shuffled complex evolution algorithm [J. Optim. Theory Appl. 61 (1993)] with the objective to minimize the mean square error between observed and modeled hourly streamflows. We describe the model and calibrated results submitted for all basins for the time periods involved in the DMIP study. We were encouraged by the relatively good performance of the model, especially in comparison to streamflow from smaller interior watersheds not used in calibration and simulated as ungaged basins. The limited resources used to achieve these results show some of the potential for distributed models to be useful operationally.

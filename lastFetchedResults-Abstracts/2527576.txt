Introduction and Objective: Nicotine is a nitrogenous organic compound which constitutes the major material of cigarettes. This toxic alkaloid is extracted from tobacco plant. Ritalin or Methylphenidate is a medicine from amphetamines group and structurally similar to cocaine with a widely usage. The objective of this study is surveying the vitality of sperm and fertility of the females received the gametes of the males used Nicotine and Ritalin. This study conductednbsp; in Islamic azad university Tehran medical science branch.(1392). Methods: In this experimental study a total number of 120 male mice and 54 female mice were selected and the male mice were randomly divided into 11 experimental groups and one control group. In two experimental groups Ritalin was used 2 and 10 mg/kg of body weight, in three experimental groups nicotine was used 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of body weight and in other experimental groups nicotine and Ritalin were used together as gavage for 40 days. At the end of the treatment period, three male mice from each group were selected and each was kept with a female in a separate cage. After 10 days the female mice were euthanized and by counting the fetuses and the corpora lutea, the percentage of fertility in females which is an indicator of the male mice were estimated. Also the remaining males were euthanized and after removing the testes for determining the percentage of aliv sperm using eosin nigrosin, the numbers of stainmed sperms were specified. The data were calculated statistically by ANOVA and Tukey Test and the criterion of statistical derivation was considered p0.05. Findings: The results of this study showed that percentage of fertility in the experimental group reciving nicotine [400 micro;g/kg/day] with nicotine comparing control group (95.42plusmn;4.68) with the experimental group [400 micro;g/kg/day] (63.10plusmn;38.37) the groups reciving Ritalin [2mg/kg/day] (64.96plusmn;18.51) and [10mg/kg/day] (18.53plusmn;16.72) compared with the control group (95.42plusmn;4.68) showed a significant reduction. These results confirm more reduction of fertility percentage in Ritalin consumption than nicotine. Morever in the other 6 groups consuming the combined form of nicotin with the doses of 100,200 and 400 micro;gr/kg/day and Ritalin with the doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg/day, fertility percentage should a significant reduction compard to the control group. Although this reduction in the group consuming nicotine at the dose of 400 micro;gr/kg/day and Ritalin at the dose of 10 mgr/kg/day (10.00plusmn;20.03) was more intense than the control group.nbsp;

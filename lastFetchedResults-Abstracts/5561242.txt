This paper describes a computer-aided heart sound analysis and classification system (CHACS) based on neural networks and time analysis. In this system, two subsystems in both time and frequency domains are proposed. In the first subsystem, a multilayer perceptron neural network is adopted to classify heart sound patterns. In the second subsystem, a set of heuristic rules is used to characterize heart sounds. The individual classification results of these two subsystems are combined to give the final suggestion. Using this system, heart sounds can be selectively stored, retrieved, enhanced, and replayed. Besides, the CHACS provides an online display of the heart beat rate and allows an objective and reliable classification of heart sounds. Experimental results show that a classification rate of 95.6% is obtained

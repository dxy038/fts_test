Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) is a research field that studies methodologies and technologies for capture and re-use of product and process engineering knowledge. The objective of KBE is to reduce time and cost of product development, which is primarily achieved through automation of repetitive design tasks while capturing, retaining and re-using design knowledge. Published research on KBE is not very extensive and also quite dispersed; this paper is an effort to collect and review existing literature on KBE. A total of 50 research contributions have been analysed. The main objectives of this analysis are to identify the theoretical foundations of KBE and to identify research issues within KBE, pointing out the challenges and pitfalls that currently prohibit a wider adoption of KBE while suggesting avenues for further research. Key findings include (a) the necessity for improved methodological support and adherence, (b) better transparency and traceability of knowledge, (c) the necessity for a quantitative framework to assess the viability and success of KBE development and implementation projects, and (d) the opportunity to move towards mass customization approaches through distributed deployment of KBE in the extended enterprise.

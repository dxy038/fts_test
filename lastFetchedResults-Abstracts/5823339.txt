Statistical process control (SPC) has become one of the most important applications of statistics in the electronics industry. It covers a variety of tools, and it can be considered that the seven Ishikawa (&#8220;old&#8221;) tools, also known as the seven quality control tools, are among the most useful and famous tools. The main goal of the use of these tools in manufacturing processes is to determine if a process being analyzed is within the established parameters (in control process) or not (out of control process). The typical property of the statistically controlled process (in control process) is that values of an investigated production parameter are between regulating limits. Through time, constant improvement has been accepted as the main objective of companies for all fields, but this improvement always retains SPC and its seven Ishikawa tools as a base. One of the latest strategies used is a six sigma strategy, which works with a base of quality statistical tools and techniques combined with well-focused management. The development of the six sigma strategy follows certain general steps established by Motorola that are analyzed from a general point of view and with reference to its relationship with SPC

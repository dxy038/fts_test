As two main branches of CAE technology, the appearance and application of optimization design and virtual prototyping (VP) caused the CAE technology at that time to achieve the unprecedented new heights respectively. The collaborative simulation technology can support VP from three levels, namely, the tools teamwork between CAD/CAE softwares, the coupling simulation analysis collaboration of multi-disciplinary fields, and the long-distance collaborative simulation &amp; cooperation design. They can also be regarded as pre-processing technology of modern generalized optimization design. Because VP and the collaborative simulation technology have the advantages of being highly efficient to simulate, analyze &amp; calculate and of multi-disciplinary collaborative work, it is very convenient to apply them to modern generalized optimization design to do multi-disciplinary &amp; multiple-objective optimization design. However, because VP and the collaborative simulation technology are not mature enough, the consequential data losing and systematic error caused by them will be inevitably brought into the modern generalized optimization design whose basis is collaborative virtual prototype technology.

Generally, the ground is compressed by natural stresses. Any disturbance such as tunneling, changes
the stress distribution and causes some deformations. If such displacements exceed threshold
values, they will sometimes develop important problems related to serviceability of the buildings
on surface and subsurface structures.
This paper includes comprehensive investigations and analysis using a finite element software
named Plaxis. The objective of this paper is to study the relationship between deformations and
ground surface settlements by means of parameters like soil density, elastic modulus, tunnel diameter
and depth of tunnel axis. According to the results, it is observed that these parameters have
significant effects. It also shows that to what extent these parameters affect the soil behavior. Also
by estimating surface settlements of the second line of City of Tabriz subway in the location of
BH-10 borehole, it can be concluded that ground surface settlements, to a large extent, are dependent
on contraction, as a significant parameter.

A cross-sectional survey of Oncomelania quadrasi, the intermediate host for Schistosoma japonicum, was conducted between 2004 and 2005 in 50 villages of the Province of Samar, the Philippines. The villages were classified as rain-fed (25) or with some man-made irrigation system (25). The primary objective was to identify all snail colony sites in the 50 villages and to compare snail population density and S. japonicum infection prevalence between the two types of villages. The presence of snail colonies was surveyed along streams, springs, various canals and swampy areas or grass land. A total of 198 colony sites were identified out of the 845 sites surveyed. Of these, a sufficient number of O. quadrasi snails were identified to measure density and infection in 147 sites. Density of O. quadrasi was remarkably uniform across habitats and there were no significant differences across habitats and between village type. The prevalence of infected snails showed more variability among habitats. Indeed, there was an interaction between the type of habitat and the type of village with irrigated villages being associated with a prevalence proportion ratio of 5.76 (1.31, 25.42) as compared to rain-fed villages among streams and springs. No such association was found among other habitats. The results suggest that once a suitable habitat exists, O. quadrasi populations establish and reach a plateau density. These results are discussed in light of possible ecological measures of control.

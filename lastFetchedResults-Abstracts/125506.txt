Introduction: Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) is characterized by impaired renal function, which is progressive & irreversible. Most of these patients will need hemodialysis (HD) in future. Treatment of CRF with Hi) has many economical & psychiatric problem for patients & society. Objective: The present study was carried out to investigate the reasons of chronic renal failure in hemodialysis patients in Guilan Province.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 414 Patients under HD were evaluated in 10 center in Guilan.
Required data were obtained from doctor's note, sonography, ECG, renal biopsy & history taking include: age, sex, how long form 1St` dialysis & causes of CRF Results: In this study '414 cases including 213 (51.4 %) male & 201 (4816 %) female were studied. Mean age of patients was 48.9Â±15.9 in initiation of HD. Results showed that the most common causes of ESRD in this region were hypertension (26,1%), glomerulonephritis (10.9%), diabetes mellitus (10.1%) renal stone (8.7%) and polycystic kidney (6.8%).
Other cases such as congenital disease, lupus, Alport syndrome, trauma, bleeding during labor hemorrhagia and drugs were 10.1% and 23.4% were unknown.
Conclusion: The most common causes of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in this region was hypertension (26,1%) and also In this study, glomerulonephritis and diabetes mellitus were second and -third causes of ESRD. Also nephrolithiasis, as a cause of CRF was more common in this region. This can be related to probable high-risk prevalence of nephrolithiasis in this region.
Causes of CRF between two sexes or age >40 and <40 were different significantly. (p<0.05).

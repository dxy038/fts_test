With the basic objective of giving a feasible path in online path planning problem for unmanned air vehicles, smoothness requirement should be considered for further to satisfy more special applications. The paper emphasizes this realistic requirement, and presents an integrated solution based on a leader-follower decision idea. In the solution, global and local optimization strategies are analyzed, and then an improved leader-follower decision model is constructed to optimize the flight path in aspects of convergence to target, obstacle avoidance and smoothness. Discrete decision rule set are also introduced into the solution to improve the smoothness. Simulations based on typical scenarios are carried out under the guidance of the solution to verify the feasibility, especially the advantages in optimizing the global and local smoothness of flight path.

Summary
critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a rather frequent clinical event in elderly patients. Atherosclerotic plaques or cardiopathies (atrial enlargement and fibrillation, ventricular thrombosis) are the most frequent clinical situations related to peripheral embolization. Rapid diagnosis followed by suitable treatment allows us to obtain good results even in elderly patients. The decision about the treatment of acute CLI is related to the clinical and functional condition of the patient. Anamnesis must inquire about recent ischemic or hemorrhagic events in the cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal and urinary apparatuses, or the presence of disorders of coagulation and fibrinolysis. An objective clinical examination and a multidimensional assessment must evaluate the degree of functional impairment and provide the basis of a therapeutic strategy (cost/benefit ratio). Diagnostic examination in the frail elderly patient (FP) involves only the ultrasonographic method, to localize the level of thromboembolic occlusion, which is followed by angiography in the non-frail patient (NFP). In the case of proximal occlusion (of the iliac or femoro-popliteal arteries), the elective treatment in both groups of patients is thromboendarterectomy, plus transcutaneous angioplastics or by-pass in NFP, followed by prostacyclin or heparin infusions. Distal occlusion (below the popliteal artery) in FP is treated only with prostacyclin or heparin, whereas in NFP, fibrinolysis is the elective treatment, followed by prostacyclin or heparin. In the cases of distal gangrene, before amputation is performed, a “limb salvage” operation must be considered. After the acute phase of medical or surgical treatment, vasoactive or antiplatelet drugs are employed in FP, whereas in NFP the use of coumadin is the preferred treatment to counteract the rethrombosis and prevent new embolizations. Antiplatelet therapy could be selected when coumadin is contra-indicated.

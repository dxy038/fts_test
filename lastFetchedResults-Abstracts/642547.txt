Objective
This cross-sectional study examined possible associations of intakes of calcium and dairy products to body mass index (BMI; kilograms per square meter) in young Japanese women.
Methods

Subjects were 1905 female Japanese dietetic students who were 18 to 20 y of age. Dietary intake was assessed over a 1-mo period with a validated, self-administered diet history questionnaire. BMI was computed by using self-reported weight and height. BMI among quartiles of energy-adjusted intakes (per 1000 kcal) of calcium and dairy products was compared while controlling for intakes of protein, fat, and dietary fiber, self-reported rate of eating, and other non-dietary variables.
Results

Mean BMI ± standard deviation was 20.8 ± 2.6 kg/m2. Mean estimated intakes were 268 ± 93 mg/1000 kcal for calcium and 80 ± 63 g/1000 kcal for dairy products. Intakes of calcium and dairy products were not significantly associated with BMI (adjusted means in the lowest and highest quartiles were 20.7 and 20.8 for calcium, P for trend = 0.48, and 20.6 and 20.6 for dairy products, P for trend = 0.81). These results were also observed after excluding 481 energy under- and over-reporters for calcium (20.4 and 20.5, respectively, P for trend = 0.73) and dairy products (20.3 and 20.4, respectively, P for trend = 0.73).
Conclusions

Intakes of calcium and dairy products may not necessarily be associated with BMI among young Japanese women who not only are relatively lean but also have a relatively low intake of calcium and dairy products.

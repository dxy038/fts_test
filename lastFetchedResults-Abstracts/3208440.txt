In this paper we present the ongoing research project Kodin-Kfz. Kodin-Kfz is the abbreviation for &#8220;Kollaboratives Diagnosenetzwerk fu&#776;r die Kfz-Servicearbeit&#8221; (Collaborative Diagnosis Network for Car Services). The main objective of this project is to connect motor mechanics within an internet-based community to collaboratively solve technical problems in a diagnostic context that could not be solved with traditional menu-guided diagnosis routines.

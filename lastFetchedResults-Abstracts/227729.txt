The paper presents a three-phase AC/DC converter to achieve power-factor correction,
harmonics elimination, DC-bus-voltage regulation and neutral-point-voltage compensation. The
proposed converter can achieve bidirectional power-flow capability. Therefore the converter can be
applied for active power-filter operation. Two legs are adopted in the proposed converter to achieve
three-level pulse-width modulation (PWM) and control the line currents to be sinusoidal waves in
phase with supply voltages. Three control loops, DC-link-voltage control, neutral-point-voltage
compensation and line current control, were used in the control scheme to achieve DC-bus-voltage
regulation, to balance neutral-point voltage and to draw the sinusoidal line currents. The
mathematical model of the converter was derived and the control scheme is provided. The
effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified through computer simulation and
experiments.

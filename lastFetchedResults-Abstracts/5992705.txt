Multiview video (MVV) can provide viewers a complete 3D perception by its multiple-viewpoint feature. In order to support smooth viewpoint switching, virtual view synthesis is required. However, color and illumination information varies between views according to the light field conditions. This mismatch leads to ghost effects and wrong reflection phenomena. In this paper, a hybrid color compensation method is proposed. With the proposed inter-view color correspondence estimation, a smoothly changing color/illumination field is established between reference views. Furthermore, the reflection on mirrorlike materials can also be detected and optimized by the proposed hybrid reflection model. As a result, virtual view frames with better perceptual quality are generated. In the objective test, the proposed algorithm also provides 0.26-0.42 dB PSNR gains.

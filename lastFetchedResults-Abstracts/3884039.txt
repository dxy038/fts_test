We consider the problem of blind multivariate signal equalization. Assuming that the input signals are i.i.d. and statistically mutually independent, we propose both a generalization of some available equalization criteria and a generalization of some source separation criteria to the convolutive case. Hence, we obtain a new generalized class of objective function for blind equalization.

A computer configuration design problem where the objective is to configure a parallel processor to do processing in a cost effective manner is examined. The application envisioned is a specialized on-line service that rents time on its machine. The combinatorial optimization problem involved is examined analytically and a heuristic algorithm for its solution is provided. Lessons learned in this work appear in the conclusion

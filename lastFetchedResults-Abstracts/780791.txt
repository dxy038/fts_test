The objective was to examine the usefulness of Dutch versions of the Masculine Gender Role
Stress (MGRS; Eisler & Skidmore, 1987) Scale and the Feminine Gender Role Stress
(Gillespie & Eisler, 1992) Scale in The Netherlands. Undergraduate students (N = 2,239) completed
both gender role stress scales.Asubgroup (n = 508) also completed questionnaires about
masculinity–femininity and daily hassles.With regard to both gender role stress scales, results
of confirmatory factor analyses supported the original 5-factor structures and revealed no
cross-sex differences on the factor models. Reliability and homogeneity indexes were all well
within acceptable to satisfactory limits. Further evidence of construct validity was found in (a)
medium to large correlations with daily hassles, (b) sex differences on the FGRS scale, and (c)
small to medium correlations with masculinity–femininity. The major discrepancy with previous
studies was that for Dutch female and male students, the MGRS scale was not sex specific.
Taken together, this study sustained the utility of both gender role stress scales for use in The
Netherlands

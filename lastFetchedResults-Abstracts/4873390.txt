The objective of this research is to study the effect that a measurement perturbation has on the signal in the transform domain. Each measured frequency component is modeled as the error-free frequency component scaled in amplitude and phase. The errors are independent, though identically distributed, from frequency to frequency. Analytical expressions for the first and second moments of each time-domain signal component have been derived and verified experimentally. Further, the results of this research have been applied to determine the expected antenna pattern when the current values are perturbed and the expected antenna pattern is shown to agree with known results

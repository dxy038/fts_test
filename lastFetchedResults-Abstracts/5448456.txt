A new decentralized routing strategy using <i>H</i> <sub>infin</sub> optimal control is introduced in this paper. For each node a local state feedback control is designed such that the proposed global objective function which is the worst-case queuing length is minimized. By taking advantage of <i>H</i> <sub>infin</sub> control theory, a robust routing performance in the presence of unknown fast time varying network delays is achieved. The resulting optimization problem is then recast as a linear objective minimization problem involving linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. The physical constraints are also expressed as LMI feasibility conditions. Simulation results are presented to illustrate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed routing strategy.

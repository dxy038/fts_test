Evolved from conventional Flexible Macroblock Ordering (FMO) that is coded out of raster sequence in spatial domain, this paper presents Wavelet-domain slice group partition and unequal error protection for H.264/AVC video communication. In detail, this paper develops Wavelet-based FMO (WFMO) algorithm to adaptively allocate macroblocks into 4 slice groups based on Reverse Biorthogonal (rbio) Wavelet transform, and then adopts unequal Reed-Solomon error correction to enhance the robustness of the packet carrying the slice group of most significance and psychovisual sensitivity. Experimental results show H.264/AVC codec with proposed rbio WFMO can achieve the best subjective and objective video quality under various packet loss conditions (except for a few 0% packet loss cases), against H.264/AVC codec without FMO and with conventional FMO. On the other hand, a DaVinci embedded platform implementation of H.264/AVC surveillance camera featuring WFMO is accomplished. Implementation results demonstrate it is reliable under error-prone network environments and feasible for embedded real-time applications.

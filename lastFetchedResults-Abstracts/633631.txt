The study was conducted among the two farmer groups in Bhaktapur and Kavre districts of Nepal. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the differences in belief, attitude and practices felt by the farmers after participation in the IPM FFS. The study has been based on data collected through personal interview with the farmers, focus group discussion, personal observation in the farmers field, discussions with the leader farmers, agro-vet owners, farmer facilitators of the FFS and also on secondary data collected from related publications of various organizations. The study has revealed that FFS is being an effective tool in increasing IPM knowledge and techniques of ecological pest management among the farmers. Integrated Pest Management through Farmer Field approach has not only been a means to sustainable management of pests thereby ensuring sustainable yield of crops but also the IPM based crop management has positive effect on household food security, income and empowerment of farmers. This justifies the potential of IPM FFS as an effective mechanism for increasing the knowledge and techniques of sustainable pest management vis-Ã -vis being a driving force for socio-economic changes in the lives and livelihoods of the smallholder farming communities.

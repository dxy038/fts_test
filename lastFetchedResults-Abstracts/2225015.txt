Abstract Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has been shown to cause a reduction in Health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Objective: This study examines the extent of different clinical symptoms in PCOS patients on HRQOL. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken to ascertain the factors related to HRQOL in 200 PCOS patients in Kashan, Iran. Main outcome measures were modified polycystic ovarian syndrome questionnaire (MPCOSQ) and clinical information of PCOS. Major clinical PCOS features including obesity (BMI), excessive body hair (hirsutism score), acne, menstrual cycle disturbances and infertility. Results: Findings showed that the most common HRQOL concern was menstrual irregularities and infertility, followed in descending order by hirsutism, weight, emotion, and acne. Multivariate analysis revealed the menstrual irregularities as a significant predictor of menstruation (p=0.005), emotion (p=0.02) and infertility (p=0.02) subscales of the MPCOSQ. Having of infertility, predicted scores on the infertility subscale (p < 0.0001). Hirsutism score was a significant predictor of hirsutism (p < 0.0001) and emotion (p < 0.0001) subscales. Weight subscale concerns was predicted by BMI (p < 0.0001), also, acne was found to be predicted score of acne subscale (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Worsened HRQOL in women with PCOS was related to more menstrual irregularities and infertility than to obesity. The finding suggests a potential for poorer compliance with weight management protocols among affected PCOS patients

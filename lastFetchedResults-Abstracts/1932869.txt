The objective of this experiment is to study the effects of novel elemental nano-selenium in the diet on testicular ultrastructure, semen quality and GSH-Px activity in male goats. Forty-two 2-month-old bucks were offered a total mixed ration which had been supplemented with nano-Se (0.3 mg/kg Se) or unsupplemented (the control group only received 0.06 mg/kg Se-background), for a period of 12 weeks (from weaning to sexual maturity). Results showed that the testicular Se level, semen glutathione peroxidase and ATPase activity increased significantly in the nano-Se supplementation group compared with control (P &lt; 0.05). The semen quality (volume, density, motility and pH) was not affected by added Se in diets, however, the sperm abnormality rate of control bucks was significantly higher than Se supplemented bucks (P &lt; 0.05). The testes of 5 goats in each group were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and showed that in Se-deficient bucks the membrane was damaged, and showed the occurrence of abnormalities in the mitochondria of the midpiece of spermatozoa. In conclusion, selenium deficiency resulted in abnormal spermatozoal mitochondria, and supplementation with nano-Se enhanced the testis Se content, testicular and semen GSH-Px activity, protected the membrane system integrity and the tight arrayment of the midpiece of the mitochondria. Further studies are required to research the novel elemental nano-Se with characterization of bioavailability and toxicity in small ruminants.

Hybrid energy systems are increasingly being applied in areas where grid extension is considered uneconomical. Their costs can be minimized through proper equipment sizing and load matching. This paper reports the results of optimization of hybrid energy system model for remote area in India. For this purpose, the Jaunpur block of Uttaranchal state of India has been selected as remote area. The model is developed with the objective of minimizing cost function based on demand and potential constraints. The model has been optimized using LINDO software 6.10 version. From the economic analysis, the capital cost, cost of energy for different types of resources, optimized cost of hybrid energy system are determined. In order to consider the fluctuation in the discharge and power generation from SHP, the EPDF has been varied from 1.0 to 0.0. The EPDF is electric power delivery factor and also called optimizing power factor and is maximum equal to 1.

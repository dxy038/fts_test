Influence of cold forging, and subsequent heat treatment and diamond turning on optical quality of anodized film on 6060 (AlMgSi) alloy was investigated and compared with microstructural changes. Heat treatment of the samples was carried out either prior to forging, post-forging, or both. The surface of the forged material was then diamond turned to a mirror like finish. The diamond turned samples were subsequently anodized in a sulphuric acid bath. The microstructure of the samples was analysed using optical microscopy (LOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).

/brightness measurements were carried out using CIE Lab system. An optical method was used to measure the thickness of the oxide film and roughness of the surface was measured before and after anodizing using stylus, a mechanical instrument, and bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF), an optical instrument. Results indicated that the post-forging heat treatment had a great influence on the appearance of the anodized layer, which was also a function of the deformation introduced prior to heat treatment. The effect was assumed to be attributed to the change in microstructure, especially the distribution and the amount of the intermetallic particles such as elemental Si and Mg2Si. Roughness of the oxide film was also found to be a function of the heat treatment and deformation condition.

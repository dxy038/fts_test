Background and Objective: Recently, electron beams are widely used for superficial and skin lesions treatment. Since the accelerator devices, create electron beams with finite energies, the treatment area is limited to a specified depth. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of combination of electron beams with different energies and different contribution in order to produce PDD curve with a more uniform central dose distribution for the shallow superficial lesions treatment (up to cm 3). The results were compared with using a single electron beam energy. 
Subjects and Methods: at First, percentage depth dose (PDD) was measured by using a Varian accelerator devices for energies 4, 6, 9, 12 Mev of electron beams and field size 20 Ã— 20 cm2. Then, PDD curve was converted to dose curve. 4 Gaussian function was fit to dose curve using MATLAB software and the best combination was selected by combining different proportions of each of this functions. 
Results:  percentage of the build up dose increased to about %90-%95 maximum dose and also percentage of the surface dose increases to about %90 maximum dose by combination of electron beams with different energies and different contribution.
Conclusions: low energy electron beams Combination cause optimization of the dose distribution PDD curve. Furthermore, we can produce electron beam with arbitrary energy by this method.

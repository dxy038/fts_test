A wind-solar hybrid system is a reliable alternative energy source because it uses solar energy combined with wind energy to create a stand-alone energy source that is both dependable and consistent. Solar power or wind power alone can fluctuate, when used together they provide a reliable source of energy. The perfect solution is to combine these two forms of energy sources to create a constant energy flow. Main objective of this paper is to optimize stand-alone solar-wind hybrid power system and to maximize use of renewable energy generation system while minimizing the total system cost.

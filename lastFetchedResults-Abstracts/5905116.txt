This paper proposes an interactive fuzzy decision making method for solving the bilevel programming problem with a common decision variable in the upper level and lower level. In this interactive algorithm, the fuzzy theory is used to introduce the fuzzy goals for objective functions of both decision makers, and then an overall satisfactory solution is efficiently obtained by considering the satisfactory degrees of the both levels and the overall satisfactory balance between the two levels. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

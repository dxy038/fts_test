Background and Objective: Pleuropulmonary complications, such as pleural effusion (PE) are encountered with an increased frequency among patients with end stage renal disease. Subjects and Methods: In the cross-sectional and prospective study we evaluated 253 patients who had received long- term hemodialysis between 2007 September and 2008 October for better understanding the incidence and causes of PE in this population. Results: The incidence of pleural effusion was 25 % (n= 63, mean age 48.09 Â± 1.39 years, male to female ratio approximately 1.1). 66.6 % of the patients (n= 42) had transudative PE and 33.4% (n= 21) had exudative PE. Transudative PE resulted from heart failure in 64.3% (n= 27), hypervolemia in 33.3% (n= 14) and cirrhosis in 2.4% (n= 1). Parapneumonic effusion (n= 6), TB (n= 5), uremic pleurisy (n= 4), malignancy (n= 2), unknown (n= 2) and SLE (n= 1) accounted for causes of exudative PE.
Conclusion: Pleural effusion is a common complication in hospitalized patients receiving long-tern hemodialysis. Since heart failure, hypervolemia and uremic pleurisy were the most common causes of pleural effusion, this problem should not be considered an obstacle in renal transplant recipients

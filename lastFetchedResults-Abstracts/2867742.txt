The urban rail transit vehicles fed by energy storage devices have been developed in recent years which have the benefits of contact line free emergency rescue operation, energy consumption reduction and so on. However, the operation characteristic of the system is quite different to that of contact line fed mode. This paper is subject to the research of emergency traction of urban mass transit vehicle fed by on board storage battery. Firstly, the system characteristics in emergency traction mode are thoroughly researched based on the coupled electrical-thermal-mechanical analysis model. Then dynamic efficiency optimization control scheme will be developed for different optimized objective. Finally, simulation results will be given out with the emergency traction of a 6-car metro vehicle as research object.

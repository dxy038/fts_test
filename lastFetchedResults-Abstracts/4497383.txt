This paper presents a novel and efficient way of E-learning, E-experimenting and E-assessment for a basic level course on embedded systems for undergraduate students. In a country like India where the total number of students in electrical sciences in a given semester is close to 500,000 an automated and animated laboratory in embedded systems is very useful. In this virtual web based laboratory a student can perform experiments, simulations and experimental validation of results. 3D animation sequences are provided in each experiment, to facilitate a real world experience of microcontroller programming, interfacing and real time processing. The learning is a three stage process comprising of learning, experimenting and self-assessment to achieve the objective.

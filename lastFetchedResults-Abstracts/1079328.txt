The objective of this study is to elucidate the full-scale characteristics of an oxidation ditch (OD) retrofitted with a membrane bioreactor (MBR). Domestic wastewater entering an oxidation ditch at a flow rate of 86 m3/d was directed to a MBR retrofitted into the original secondary sedimentation tank. The MBR contained flat sheet membranes. The data collected for 2 months during the start-up of the system showed that pH was maintained at 7.2 and 6.7 in OD and MBR, respectively. Dissolved oxygen (DO) in MBR remained stable at 7.8 mg/L, while fluctuated in OD. The mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) in the OD remained steady at a concentration about 1000 mg/L, but it was gradually building up from 500 mg/L to 2400 mg/L in the MBR during this period. Measurements of carbohydrate and protein were made by extracting the extra cellular polymeric substances (EPS) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) from the mixed liquor obtained from both OD and MBR. Carbohydrate was predominant in the EPS and the ratios between carbohydrate and protein converged to fixed values from the fourth week; in this case the ratio was 4.5 for OD and 5 for MBR. The variation in EPS contents showed similar trends in both OD and MBR. The integrated treatment facility removed ammonia, COD and BOD at 100, 91.6 and 97.0 % respectively. However, efficiency of nitrate and phosphate removal has not been realized yet.

Since there is eavesdropping and MITM attack during establishing encryption key between two Bluetooth devices, a secure key agreement scheme is designed based on elliptic curves cryptography and interlock protocol. This scheme can defend two kinds of attacks mentioned above. It provides bidirectional authentication for two devices and key integrity verification by exchanging the keyspsila Hash-value. Then security of the scheme is theoretically analyzed and efficiency of it is compared with that of other schemes in relative papers. The results demonstrate the scheme proposed in this paper is secure and efficient.

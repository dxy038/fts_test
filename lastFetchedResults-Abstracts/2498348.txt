Objective(s): We aimed to investigate the influence of transient receptor potential channel 3 (TRPC3) on lipopolysaccharide-induced (LPS) preterm delivery mice. Materials and Methods: Mice were randomly assigned to the four groups: an unpregnant group, a mid-pregnancy group (E15), a term delivery group, and an LPS-induced preterm delivery group (intraperitoneal injection LPS at 15 days). Uterine smooth muscles were obtained through caesarean section; TRPC3 expression was measured by real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. A specific inhibitor of TRPC3 (SKF96365) was injected into the LPS-induced preterm delivery group to determine whether the delivery interval was prolonged. Results: TRPC3 was primarily expressed in the uterine smooth muscle layer. In addition, the LPS-induced preterm delivery group had an obviously higher expression level of TRPC3 mRNA and protein compared with the unpregnant and E15 groups, which were close to term delivery. More importantly, SKF96365 prolongs the delivery interval of LPS-induced preterm delivery mice. Conclusion: Enhanced expression of TRPC3 may be associated with LPS-induced preterm delivery in mice. The specific inhibitor of TRPC3 (SKF96365) may be helpful for clinical treatment of preterm delivery.

Our goal is to develop a tool for the assessment and rehabilitation of executive functions by customizing a virtual reality VR system. The specific objective of this study was to conduct a pilot study using a virtual version of the Multiple Errand Test (VMET) in a healthy population. Results are presented which provide support for the feasibility of using the VMET for a subsequent randomized clinical trial.

Study objective: We developed and tested a protocol for compounding a large volume of injectable atropine from powder. The resulting protocol could be used by hospitals to rapidly use large amounts of stockpiled atropine. Methods: The protocol required 2 g of solid (powdered) atropine and 1 L of normal saline solution. The solution was filtered and mixed. One hundred syringes were filled by using a standard syringe-batching system. Modifications, including hand filling, were studied to reduce the time required to synthesize one hundred 3-mL syringes. Results: A single pharmacist was able to reconstitute one hundred 6-mg atropine syringes in 29 minutes using the batching system. The quickest method for a single pharmacist filling syringes by hand was 34 minutes. The cost to the hospital for 5 g of powdered atropine was $11 versus $5,000 for prefilled syringes. Conclusion: Large quantities of atropine syringes can be compounded from a powdered form in a timely manner. Additionally, there is a significant cost advantage to using powdered atropine as a hospital stockpile. [Ann Emerg Med.2003;41:685-688.]

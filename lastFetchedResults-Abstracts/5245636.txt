In this paper authors propose a rapid and new method to design and optimize the electric motor control using field programmable gate array (FPGA). The elaborated designing algorithm takes advantage of the unification of ISE Xilinx digital designing environment with Matlab/Simulink simulation and testing environment, through system generator toolbox. This results in a faster and efficient design flow. A software and hardware operational system was realized using programmable logic circuits to control a brushless DC (BLDC) motor. The system is able to operate independently or to communicate bidirectional and in real time with Matlab/Simulink environment. A hierarchical control system design method is achieved too, based on parameterized models; system generator toolbox library is extended with specific electric motors control blocks (PWM, PID, commutation blocks, etc).

This paper takes a kind of 3-TPS Parallel Machine Tool (PMT) as the objective of research. The positive and inverse kinematics equations of constraint chain are established through the kinematics analysis to the constraint chain of this machine, the inverse kinematics equation that has unique solution is also further obtained after the joint angle ranges in the machine were determined. Then the expressions about Jacobian matrix and its inverse matrix of constraint chain are also solved in this paper. The analysis results of this paper have laid a theoretical foundation for dynamics analysis, precision analysis, control system design and prototype manufacturing of this Parallel Machine Tool.

The ability to produce near net shape components with good surface finish is made possible by means of squeeze casting, a hybrid metal forming process combining features of both casting and forging in a single operation. The primary objective of this paper is to analyze the influence of the process parameters on surface roughness in squeeze casting of LM6 aluminium alloy using Taguchi method. In Taguchi method, a three level orthogonal array has been used to determine the S/N ratio. Analysis of variance and the ‘F’-test values are used to determine the most significant process parameters affecting the surface roughness. The results indicated that the squeeze pressure and the die preheating temperature are the recognized parameters to cause appreciable improvement in the surface finish of the squeeze cast components.

In drive system of an Electric Vehicle (EV) power train, the battery and power converters are most important parts. In this paper a noval drive system is proposed for Electric Vehicle(EV) power train. Here we used a real time electric circuit based battery model as a power source of drive system unlike conventional ideal battery source. To convert fixed DC to three phase AC, a new topology of DC to AC matrix converter (MC) has been proposed. which is able to perform bidirectional power flow and multi quadrant operations. which is essential in EVs. The vector control based Direct torque control (DTC) technique is used to generate switching sequence for the DC to AC MC. The complete drive system is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink enviroment.

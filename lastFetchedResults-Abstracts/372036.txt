Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) can be molded and self-hardens in vivo to form resorbable hydroxyapatite with excellent osteoconductivity. The objective of this study was to develop an injectable, macroporous and strong CPC, and to investigate the effects of porogen and absorbable fibers. Water-soluble mannitol was used as porogen and mixed with CPC at mass fractions from 0% to 50%. CPC with 0–40% mannitol was fully extruded under a syringe force of 10 n. The paste with 50% mannitol required a 100-N force which extruded only 66% of the paste. At fiber volume fraction of 0–5%, the paste was completely extruded. However, at 6% and 7.5% fibers, some fibers were left in the syringe after the paste was extruded. The injectable CPC scaffold had a flexural strength (mean±sd; n=5) of (3.2±1.0) MPa, which approached the reported strengths for sintered porous hydroxyapatite implants and cancellous bone. In summary, the injectability of a ceramic scaffold, a macroporous CPC, was studies for the first time. Processing parameters were tailored to achieve high injectability, macroporosity, and strength. The injectable and strong CPC scaffold may be useful in surgical sites that are not freely accessible by open surgery or when using minimally invasive techniques.

Objective
Electronegative low density lipoprotein (LDL) subfractions are cytotoxic to endothelial cells. To continue our study of homozygotic familial hypercholesterolemic (FH)-LDL, we report the effects of FH-LDL subfractions (FH-L1 to FH-L5) on the angiogenic processes in cultured endothelial cells.
Methods and results
Subconfluent bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were treated with LDL subfractions (20 Î¼g/ml), and the effects on angiogenic functions, including cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, tube formation, secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined. The electronegative FH-L4 and FH-L5 inhibited cell proliferation while the other FH-LDL subfractions and LDL from normocholesterolemic subjects (N-LDL) had negligible effects. Like Cu2+ ox-LDL, FH-L5 strongly inhibited endothelial cell viability and FH-L4 had a milder effects. Similarly, FH-L4 and FH-L5 but not the other subfractions retarded cell migration, induced cell apoptosis, and perturbed tube formation by BAEC in matrigel. FH-L5 inhibited secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by BAEC without affecting their endogenous levels. In contrast, FH-L5 increased the VEGF expression in endothelial cells.
Conclusions
Our results show for the first time that FH-L5, a circulating LDL subfraction from hypercholesterolemic patients, modulates various angiogenic processes, thereby dysregulating endothelial function in a way that may be atherogenic.

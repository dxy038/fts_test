A parasitic aware radio frequency computer aided design (RF CAD) tool based on an Inclined Planes system Optimization algorithm (IPO) is introduced. Also, in comparison to IPO, RF CAD tool was implemented with Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO). This CAD tool optimizes three structures of Cross-Coupled LC voltage controlled oscillator (LC VCOs) (i.e. CMOS alone, NMOS alone, PMOS alone VCOs) for 2.4GHz central frequency based on IEEE 802.11 in a commercial 0.18um RF CMOS technology, simultaneously. Parasitic aware RF CAD tool casts RF circuit synthesis as weighted multi-objective optimization quandary. Two major objectives fitness (i.e. phase noise and power consumption) are evaluated by harmonic balance (HB) analysis in HSPICE RF. Then results are sent to optimization core which is implemented in MATLAB. At the end, this CAD tool presents optimal parameters for final design.

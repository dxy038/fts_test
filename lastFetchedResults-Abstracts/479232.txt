Background: Diabetes mellitus, a state of chronic hyperglycemia, is associated with high risk of atherosclerosis, renal diseases and nervous system and ocular damage. Garlic as a medicinal plant has shown to have diverse biological activities, including antidiabetic actions.
Objective: Garlic and its preparations are affected in cardiovascular diseases which have been caused by diabetes. Since the pervious studies have focused on the therapeutic role of garlic in diabetes, we have decided to investigate the preventive effect of garlic juice on the changes of serum lipids.
Methods: Forty male Wistar rats (250 Â± 20 g) were divided into five groups as follows. 1) Control group (N), 2) Normal+Garlic group (N+G) received garlic juice for 6 weeks, 3) Diabetic group (D) was injected with STZ [60 mg/kg BW, i.p.], 4) Diabetic+Garlic_before group (D+Gb) received garlic juice for 3 weeks before STZ injection and continued for another 3 weeks, 5) Diabetic+Garlic_after group (D+Ga) received garlic juice for 3 weeks; after injected with STZ. Garlic juice was given by gavage (1ml/100g BW/day). At the end of experimental period, food intake measured by metabolic cages and serum levels of glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides were assessed by enzymatic methods. 
Results: D+Gb & D+Ga groups in comparison with D group showed significant increases (p<0.05) in the body weights and significant decreases (p<0.0001) in food intake. D+Gb group in comparison with D+Ga group, showed significant increase (p<0.05) in the body weights and significant decrease (p<0.001) in food intake. In D+Gb & D+Ga groups, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides levels in comparison with D group showed significant decreases (p<0.0001). In D+Gb group, glucose levels have no significant difference with N and N+G groups, but in comparison with D+Ga group showed significant decrease (p<0.05). In D+Gb group, serum level of cholesterol in comparison with N and N+G groups (p<0.01) and serum level of triglycerides in comparison with N and D+Ga groups showed significant decreases (p<0.001). 
Conclusion: These results suggest that garlic juice could influence in prevention against increases of cholesterol and triglycerides in diabetic rats.

In this paper we consider the problem of collective motion for a set of mobile nodes. The objective of nodes is to move toward a target. Adaptive network can be used for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a reduced-complexity diffusion adaptive network solution. The idea is to use a selective cooperation, by choosing the best nodes at each iteration, to reduce the number of communications. As our simulation results show, we can achieve proper steady-state performance while reducing the communication overhead.

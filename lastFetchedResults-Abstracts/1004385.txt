 In this research, the production of plum pastille-like with starch and gelatin was studied. Thirteen formulation of plum pastille-like were prepared according to a second-order composite rotatable design (with five central points). Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize product formulation with: gelatin concentration ranging from 3.85 to 6.925 % (w/w), and starch concentration ranging from 0 to 3.85 % (w/w) as independent variables. The dependent variables were texture objective evaluation and total acceptance obtained from sensory analysis. The texture and flavor attributes of the samples were identified and evaluated by a trained descriptive panel. The thickeners strongly affected texture and flavor attributes of the samples. The resulting polynomial equation (R2=0.9325) revealed that a formulation with 5.38% gelatin and 3.85% starch had a maximum total acceptance.

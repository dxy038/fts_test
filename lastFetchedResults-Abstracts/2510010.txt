Background: The scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), as the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) receptor, is a key component in the reverse cholesterol transportation. The objective of this study was to assess the association between exon1 (G&rarr;A) polymorphism of SR-BI gene and lipid profiles among the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) population.

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 774 adults (322 males and 452 females) aged 20&ndash;70 years, who were randomly selected from among TLGS population. Anthropometrical and biochemical variables for participants were measured. Selected SR-BI gene polymorphism was determined with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using the Alu restriction enzyme.

Results: according to the results of current study, in the Tehran population, the allele frequency of SR-BI (G&rarr;A) polymorphism was 0.159 for an allele (minor allele) and 0.841 for G allele. Allele frequencies were in conformity with Hardy&ndash;Weinberg equilibrium. The result of this study showed that Subjects with the less common allele (allele A), after adjusting for age, have lower HDL-CandHDL3concentrations (p=0.046, p=0.041 respectively).

Conclusion: lipid disorders are caused by the interaction of environmental and genetic factors; therefore, exon1 (G&rarr;A) polymorphism of SR-BI gene could not be the only cause for the abnormality in the HDL-C levels. In future, this polymorphism may be use as a molecular marker for diagnosis.

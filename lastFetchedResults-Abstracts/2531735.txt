Background: Heavy metals (HMs) are one of the most important polluting substances emitted to the environment during cement production. Tehran Cement Factory located in the southeastern of Tehran, Iran, closer to agricultural lands cultivates alfalfa, barley, and maize as feed. The objective of the study was to determine the concentration of HMs in agricultural soils. Methods: Thirty six soil samples were collected from two regions of Aminabad (close to the cement factory) and Varamin (far from cement factory) in 2015. The samples were taken from a depth of 0-15 cm and analyzed to determine their HM (zinc, lead, cadmium and chromium) by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Other relevant parameters of soil were evaluated, such as; pH, EC, TOM. Results: The concentration of HMs in both regions was as follows: Pb> Zn > Cr > Cd. Generally, the soil alfalfa, barley and maize, there was no significant difference. Conclusion: These data provide information on HM accumulations in agricultural soils and allow us to identify sources of pollution. In the industrial area due to the proximity to cement factory, concentration of zinc, lead, chromium, pH and EC were more than non-contaminated areas.

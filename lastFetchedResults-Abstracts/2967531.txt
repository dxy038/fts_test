Transmission over mobile fading channels requires some diversity scheme to obtain better error rates. The objective of this paper is to present systems that combine coded modulation with built-in time diversity, an optimized constellation and multiple transmission antennas. The transmission systems are simulated over fast-fading channels that present Doppler effects. A gain of 12 dB is attained in comparison with other proposed systems

Objective: The author is trying to describe the relationship between thinking and language through cognitive science approaches such as cognitive linguistics, semantics, modularity of mind, and psychology of language. Method: This is a review article. Results ^Conclusion: In spite of some theoretical and methodological controversies, these approaches have a same opinion about the interaction between mind and the environment. Psychological motivations are the beginning point of thinking in this interaction. Then, speech production begins. In this process the language not only makes an external form for the thought, but also makes it complete. The approaches differ with each other in terms of the degree of independence or interactions of the language and the brain (modular approach), interaction between environmental factors and cognitive functions (language representation), and complex and multidimensional connection between language and brain (neuroscience).

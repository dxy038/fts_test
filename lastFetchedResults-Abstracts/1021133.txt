     Background and Objectives: Fractures of the tibial shaft are the most common fractures. The preferred treatment of these fractures is closed reduction and interlocking IM Rod that is not available in all medical centers; hence the open methods are used. The objective of this study was to present a simple and easily available method for closed reduction of these fractures.
     Materials and Methods: In a prospective study, 30 patients with tibial shaft fractures underwent closed reduction and interlocking IMR fixation on a radiolucent table with a side post. The patients were followed up for union, range of motion, infection, alignment, and return to preinjury activities and ability to use the Iranian lavatory.
     Results: The mean age of the patients was 32.30±11.70 years. In a group of patients underwent surgery within first 48 hours, the mean duration of union was 62.7±13.5 minutes and for operations performed after 48 hours it was 68±15.62 minutes. In 3 patients there was limited knee flexion. There was neither neurovascular injury nor deep infection. The mean time for union was 5.93±1.45 weeks and return to normal daily activities was possible at 9.83±2.13 weeks. There was delayed union in 10%, shortening in 10% and malrotation in 16.7% of the patients. Our method was successful in 100%. Ultimately, 96.7% of the patients were satisfied by surgery and were able to do preinjury activates.
     Conclusion: The post at the side of table provides a very effective way for closed reduction of tibial shaft fractures.

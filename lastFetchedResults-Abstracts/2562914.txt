Background and Objective: Resistance to beta lactam antibiotics resulted from betalactamases enzyme production The aims of this study were to determine the antibiotic resistance pattern in Klebsiella pneumonia isolates and frequency of blaCTX-M-15 and blaAMPC in clinical specimen isolated from hospitals in Isfahan City.
Subjects and Methods: In this cross-sectional study we evaluated 80 Klebsiella pneumonia isolates from September 2014 to September 2015, isolated from patients at Alzahra and Gharazi hospitals in Isfahan city, Iran. Samples were identified using routine microbiological and biochemical tests. The antibiotic resistance pattern of isolates to 10 different antibiotics has done by disk diffusion method and ESBL producing strains were characterized by phenotypic method, combination disk and frequency of blaCTX-M-15 and blaFOX genes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection. 
Results: The antibiogram result showed that, the highest rate of resistant (55%) was related to Co-trimoxazole and the lowest rate of resistant was related to Imipenem (7.5%), among 80 specimens, 31 isolates (38.75%) were detected as ESBL producing by phonotypic and double disk tests, and results of PCR showed that, 17 isolates (32.7%) were consist of blaCTX-M-15 gene and 9 isolates (17.3%) were consist of blaFOXM gene. 
Conclusion: Our data showed the high rate of ESBL enzymes among Klebsiella isolates.  Therefore, for infection control and preventing of distribution of resistant among clinical isolates, correct management of treatment is necessary.

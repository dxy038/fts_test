A method has been introduced here to convert a multi-objective programming problem into an equivalent goal programming problem by appropriately fixing priorities and goals. The conversion method introduced in this paper, uses the concepts of conflict among objectives and the theory of fuzzy sets. The method is applied in a real life urban scheduling problem of a State Transport Undertaking in India to highlight the method proposed here.

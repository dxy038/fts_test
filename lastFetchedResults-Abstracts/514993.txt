Background: Cisplatin is an antineoplastic drug and at high doses is hepatotoxic. Oxidative stress has been proven to be involved in cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. Because of antioxidant potential of turnip (Brassica rapa. L)  root, the objective of this study was to examine the protective effect of turnip root ethanolic extract (TREE), on cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity in rat.
Materials and Method: Forty male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four equal groups. Group 1 was used as control; groups 2 and 4 were orally treated with TREE (200 mg/kg) for 15 consecutive days. Groups 3 and 4 received a single intraperitoneal dose of cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg) on the 10th day of the experiment. At the end of experiment, serum levels of aspartate and alanine transaminases, lactate dehydogenase and total bilirubin, albumin and total proteins were assessed. Malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were assayed in liver homogenates. Finally, the biochemical findings were matched with histopathological verifications.
Results: In group 4, TREE significantly (p=0.0001) decreased the elevated levels of serum biomarkers of hepatic injury and total bilirubin; and significantly increased the reduced levels of serum albumin and total proteins (respectively p=0.001, p=0.032). In this group, TREE significantly (p=0.0001) decreased the lipid peroxidation and elevated the decreased values of hepatic antioxidants. Histopathologically, the changes were in the same direction with biochemical findings.
Conclusion: Because of anti-oxidant potentials of TREE, it may have a protective effect against cisplatin induced hepatotoxicity in rats. [ZJRMS, 2012; 13(9): 8-15]

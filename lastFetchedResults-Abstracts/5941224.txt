This paper deals with the application of unsupervised fuzzy clustering to high dimensional data. Two problems are addressed: groups (clusters) number discovery and feature selection without performance losses. In particular we analyze the potential of a genetic fuzzy system, that is the integration of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a fuzzy clustering algorithm. The main characteristic of the integrated approach is the ability to handle the two problems at the same time, suggesting a Pareto set of trade-off solutions which could have a better chance of matching the real needs. We exhibit the high quality clustering and features selection results by applying our approach to a real-world data set.

When designing sandwich structures, different types of periodic cellular cores have been considered trying to achieve higher overall bending stiffness and strength to weight ratios as a main objective. Although most of them have proved to offer advantages in certain specific applications, there is a common drawback for all: complexity of the manufacturing process reflected in higher manufacturing costs. This article aims at investigating the out-of-plane shear elastic properties Gxz and Gyz of a novel cellular core named ExpaAsym, produced by a potentially simple manufacturing method: sheet material expansion. Numerical analyses are carried out in order to study the way in which the out-of-plane shear elastic properties modify in terms of several geometric parameters that define the topology of the structure. The numerical results are validated through experimental tests.

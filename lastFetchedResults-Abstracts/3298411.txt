In this paper, self-triggered consensus control problem is investigated for a class of multi-agent systems. Each agent computes its next update time instance at the predefined time. This control strategy extends substantially the existing work on event-triggered control, because in the self-triggered deployment the agents have no need to maintain the track of the state error that triggers the actuation between continuous update instants. A distributed self-triggered control procedure is presented for a special first-order multi-agents and is shown to achieve the rendezvous objective. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is illustrated by a numerical example.

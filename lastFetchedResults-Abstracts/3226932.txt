A 3&#215;5 planar array of dipoles is analyzed taking mutual coupling into account. Multi-objective fitness function considering the Directivity (D), Half Power Beam Width (HPBW) and Front to Side Lobe Level (FSLL) of the antenna is examined and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to optimize the planar array using the obtained fitness value. The array is simulated with self developed MOM structure code using MATLAB (7.8.0) and verified using MININEC (14.0) software package. Finally, the optimized results are compared with different types of Yagi-Uda array, optimized using various optimization techniques, to evaluate the performance of the planar array.

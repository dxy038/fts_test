Objective(s): This study aimed to compare the diagnostic values of 11C-choline and
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography
(PET/CT) in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).
Methods: This prospective study was conducted on 10 patients (6 males and 4 females), aged
42-69 years, suspected of having CCA based on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
results. 11C-choline and 18F-FDG PET/CT studies were performed in all patients over 1 week.
PET/CT results were visually analyzed by 2 independent nuclear medicine physicians and
quantitatively by calculating the tumor-to-background ratio (T/B).
Results: No 11C-choline PET/CT uptake was observed in primary extrahepatic or intrahepatic
CCA cases. Intense 18F-FDG avidity was detected in the tumors of 8 patients (%80). Two
patients, who were 18F-FDG negative, had primary extrahepatic CCA. Ki-67 measurements
were positive in all patients (range; 14.2%-39.9%). The average T/B values of 11C-choline
and 18F-FDG were 0.4±0.2 and 2.0±1.0 in all cases of primary CCA, respectively; these values
were significantly lower for 11C-choline (P < 0.005). Both FDG and 11C-choline PET/CT detected
metastatic CCA foci in all 8 patients (two patients had no metastases).
Conclusion: As the results suggested, primary CCA lesions showed a poor avidity for
11C-choline, whereas 18F-FDG PET/CT was of value for the detection of most primary CCA
cases. In contrast to primary lesions, metastatic CCA lesions showed 11C-choline avidity.

Introduction: Different studies show that educational programs about BSE increase knowledge, competency and BSE rate. Students prefer computerized assisted instruction (ASI) to traditional methods. CAI is an important instrument in education of BSE.
Objective: In this study, researchers try to determine the effect of education by using compact disc (CD) and booklet on learning outcomes (knowledge, Health Belief and BSE).
Materials and Methods: This study has a Quasi- Experimental design; the sample consisted of 20 midwifery students and 30 nursing students in Nursing and Midwifery faculty in Rasht. CD was given to nursing students and booklet for midwifery students. Their knowledge, health belief and BSE times were compared in 2 groups. Data were gathered through filling questionnaire, subjects answered a three part questionnaire which covered: Sociodemographic data, knowledge (10 statements) and health belief (based on Champion health belief models). Computer experts provided CD based on education items by using macromedia flash (version 5) and windows.
Results: Result showed that 73.9% of the nursing students and 80% midwifery students were in 18-19 year age group. The knowledge, Health belief and BSE between two groups was compared by student. Results showed that there was no significant difference in two groups (by using paired T test) (P<0.000). After education, knowledge level in two groups was significant (P<0.01) but health beliefs and BSE times by using T student and Krasskul wallis were not significant.
Conclusion: Research findings indicated that education in both methods increased the knowledge but it had no effect on health and the times of breast self-examination. Further more, it revealed that belief and times of self-examination stemmed from the internal feelings.

Purpoe
To decribe viual field parameter at baeline examination of 80 participant in a longitudinal cohort tudy of birdhot chorioretinopathy and to identify relationhip between thee parameter and viual acuity, ymptom, clinical finding, and reult of laboratory tet.
Deign
ingle-center cro-ectional tudy.
Method
tandardized Fatpac, full-threhold Humphrey 30-2 (Carl Zei Meditec, Dublin, California, UA) viual field tudie were performed for both eye of all patient. A tandardized protocol identified foveal threhold and mean deviation, pecified categorie of total deviation, and aigned viual field pattern decriptor. Thee parameter were compared with bet-corrected viual acuity (BCVA), ymptom, color confuion core (CC), cataract, vitreou inflammatory reaction, retinal vaculiti, birdhot leion characteritic, and ocular coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorecein angiography parameter.
Reult
Each viual field parameter wa cloely related to the other, although mean deviation could be abnormal in the preence of a near normal foveal threhold. Mean deviation wa related to BCVA, but the correlation wa moderate (the pearman correlation, âˆ’0.55; P < .001). It wa alo related to CC and the ymptom of blurry viion, poor contrat enitivity, and nyctalopia. The mot common viual field pattern were multiple foci and arcuate defect. Among clinical and laboratory finding, viual field parameter were mot cloely related to abence of the third highly reflective band on OCT (P < .001).
Concluion
Patient with birdhot chorioretinopathy may have a variety of viual field abnormalitie, even with normal BCVA. Abnormalitie eem to be aociated with retinal damage. Automated viual field teting may provide objective meaure for monitoring dieae activity.

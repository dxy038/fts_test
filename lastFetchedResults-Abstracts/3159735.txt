The major objective of privatization is to increase the efficiency of ports while reducing the financial demands on the public sector by generating increased revenue for the government. This paper attempts to review the experience of ports in Myanmar in regard to privatization and improvement of relative efficiency among those ports. The Myanmar Port Authority has constant return to scale. Because of its better efficiency it can facilitate its operation without adding more inputs. Myanmar International Terminal Thilawa (MITT) is the most efficient port amongst all ports in Myanmar and it exhibits a decreasing return to scale. On the other hand, the other port, Myanmar Integrated Port Limited MIPL is the least efficient port. This study concludes that the form of ownership does not positively correlate with increased efficiency.

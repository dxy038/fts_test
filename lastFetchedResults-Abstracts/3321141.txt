Using jointly functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) is a growing field in human brain mapping. However, EEG signals are contaminated during acquisition by imaging artefacts which are stronger by several orders of magnitude than the brain activity. In this paper, we propose three methods to remove the imaging artefacts based on the temporal and/or the spatial structures of these specific artefacts. Moreover, we propose a new objective criterion to measure the performance of the proposed algorithm on real data. Finally, we show the efficiency of the proposed methods applied to a real dataset.

Taking into account the process piloting for the respect of the instructions of production or the interpretation of the great number of information, which moves quickly, is essential. The diagnosis and the supervision of the systems constitute fields of research all the more active since the diversity and the complexity of the problems do not cease growing. Thus, it is imperative to develop new techniques to facilitate control. Our study lies within the general scope of the supervision by approach expert system whose objective is the development of a model of simulation able to generate information reproducing the behaviour of the system under normal operation and in the presence of dysfunctions. The approach suggested within the framework of our application is founded on the use of a generator of expert systems G2. The dynamic simulator associated with G2 is used like support for this realization. The application relates to the field of the industry of cement and, more precisely, the process of clinkerisation and this in order to be able to test and validate the developed diagnosis strategies, and to apprehend overall their effects.

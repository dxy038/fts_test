The objective of this project with United Parcel Service, UPS, is to design a small sort configuration module, which is expected to maximize handles saved. ldquoMaximizing handles savedrdquo is defined by UPS as the minimization of the number of times a worker in the small sort packaging area has to handle each package. Based on the historical data which UPS has given us, we had a very specific direction for the design of the module. The modeling tool is being created in Excel and will have levels of user input to determine how the model will sort the packages by destination. The simulation is being created in Arena and has the purpose of giving a general understanding of the time taken to sort packages. The gain for UPS from these two deliverables will be a better understanding of their entire system and why certain decisions are being made.

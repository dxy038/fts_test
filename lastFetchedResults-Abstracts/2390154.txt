Geological, facies, geomorphological and allostratigraphic map of the Eberswalde fan delta area are presented. The Eberswalde fan delta is proposed as a sort of prototype area to map sedimentary deposits, because of its excellent data coverage and its variability in depositional as well as erosional morphologies and sedimentary facies.

sent a report to distinguish different cartographic products implying an increasing level of interpretation.

ological map – in association with the facies map – represents the most objective mapping product. Formations are distinguished on the basis of objectively observable parameters: texture, color, sedimentary structures and geographic distribution. Stratigraphic relations are evaluated using Steno’s principles. Formations can be interpreted in terms of depositional environment, but an eventual change of the genetic interpretation would not lead to a change in the geological map.

omorphological map is based on the data represented in the geological map plus the association of the morphological elements, in order to infer the depositional sub-environments. As a consequence, it is an interpretative map focused on the genetic reconstruction.

lostratigraphic map is based on the morphofacies analysis – expressed by the geomorphological map – and by the recognition of surfaces which reflect allogenic controls, such as water level fluctuations: unconformities, erosional truncations and flooding surfaces. As a consequence, this is an even more interpretative map than the geomorphological one, since it focuses on the control on the sedimentary systems.

ical maps represent the most suitable cartographic product for a systematic mapping, which can serve as a prerequisite for scientific or landing site analyses. Geomorphological and allostratographic maps are suitable tools to broaden scientific analysis or to provide scientific background to landing site selection.

The experimental analysis focused on a corpus of literary works - novels and short stories (107 books) - comprising about 12.7 million words, obtained by bringing together two different collections of writings of similar length. The main objective was to identify the common words occurring in each of the books constituting the corpus as a whole, in each of the sub-corpora organized per author and also in each sub-collection of texts.

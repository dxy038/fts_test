Indirect current control (ICC) of boost type voltage source converters (VSCs) using separate compensation of line IZ voltage drop is presented. A separate bi-directional VSC is used to produce the compensation voltage. This simplifies the ICC regulator scheme as the power flow is controlled through a single modulation index. Experimental verification is provided for bidirectional control of the power flow

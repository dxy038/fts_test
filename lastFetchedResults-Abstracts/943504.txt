Background and purpose: Nowadays, tuberculosis (TB) is still growing as one of the biggest
human killers in all ancient years, in spite of there are effective drugs and diagnostic tools. In recent years,
the incidence rate of this disease has increased. This study was conducted to evaluate the epidemiologic
status of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and its associated risk factors in Qom province during 2002-2010.
Materials and methods: This study was performed as a descriptive-analytic study, on TB
patient's diagnosing during 2002 to 2010 in Qom Province. The data obtained from TB patient's
documented files. Data analysis has been done by SPSS software, and with T-test and chi-square.
Results: A total of 1035 Pulmonary TB patients (744 positive smears and 291 negative smears)
were diagnosed during 2002-2010. Lowest incidence rate were observed in 2002 (9.59 per 100000) and the
highest rate were observed in 2008 (13.6 per 100000). Mean age of injured population was 47.43 Â±20.92
Disease incidence rate during years of study hasn't increasing or decreasing significant trend (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, more attention to case finding in the age group
65 and upper years and foreign refugees (afghan) is recommended. It seems to be necessary some
workshops for general physicians about case finding, early diagnosing of patients, and also general health

This paper focuses on the study of the influence of a mixed-mode crack on the coupled response of a functionally graded magnetoelectroelastic material (FGMEEM). The crack is embedded at the center of a 2D infinite medium subjected to magnetoelectromechanical loads. The material is graded in the direction orthogonal to the crack plane and is modeled as a nonhomogeneous medium with anisotropic constitutive laws. Using Fourier transform, the resulting plane magnetoelectroelasticity equations are converted analytically into singular integral equations which are solved numerically to yield the crack-tip mode I and II stress intensity factors, the electric displacement intensity factors and the magnetic induction intensity factors. The main objective of this paper is to study the influence of material nonhomogeneity on the fieldsâ€™ intensity factors for the purpose of gaining better understanding on the behavior of graded magnetoelectroelastic materials.

In this paper, the mathematic model of the optimum design parameter for automated pharmacy was put forward, and used a comprehensive learning multi-objective particle swarm algorithm optimize. The simulation experiment is given, which aimed at actual pharmacy case. The result of this paper provides that the algorithm can figure out multi-objective for the automated storage and retrieval system of the pharmacy.

This paper considers the general, no-wait and no-idle flow shop scheduling problems with deteriorating jobs, respectively. By a deteriorating job, we mean that the processing time is a decreasing function of its execution starting time. The normal processing time proportional to its decreasing rate is assumed and some dominant relationships between machines can be satisfied. It is shown that for the problems to minimize the makespan or the weighted sum of completion time, polynomial algorithms still exist, although these problems are more complicated than the classical ones. When the objective is to minimize the maximum lateness, the solutions of a classical version may not hold.

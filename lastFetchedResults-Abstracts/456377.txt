Background: The remarkable anti-atherosclerotic effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor have not been demonstrated in diet induced severe hyperlipidemia in rabbit model. Objective: We have investigated the effect of pitavastatin, a newly developed statin, on atherosclerosis in rabbits. Methods and results: Oophorectomized female NZW rabbits were fed 0.3% cholesterol chow for 12 weeks with or without pitavastatin (0.1 mg/kg per day) (Gp.NK and HCD). The level of serum cholesterol was decreased in Gp.NK compared with Gp.HCD (772.8±70.2 versus 1056.9±108.3 mg/dl), whereas no significant alterations were observed in triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol. NO dependent response stimulated by acetylcholine and calcium ionophore A23187 and tone related basal NO response induced by NG-monomethyl- -arginine acetate were all improved by pitavastatin treatment. Pitavastatin treatment increased the level of cyclic GMP in the aorta of cholesterol fed rabbits. In the aorta, the expression of eNOS mRNA was significantly up regulated and O2− production was slightly reduced in Gp.NK animals. Atherosclerotic area was significantly decreased in aortic arch and thoracic aorta from Gp.NK compared with those from Gp.HCD (15.1±5.3 versus 41.9±10.2%, 3.1±1.1 versus 7.9±1.2% in Gp.NK and Gp.HCD aortic arch and thoracic aorta). Anti-macrophage staining area, the MMP1 or 2 and the nitrotyrosine positive area were decreased in Gp.NK. Conclusion: Pitavastatin retards the progression of atherosclerosis formation and it improves NO bioavailability by eNOS up-regulation and decrease of O2−.

In the last years, among the several available renewable Distributed Energy Resources (DER), a growing attention has been paid to small wind turbines (i.e., &lt;; 200 kWp). In particular, during the last years the Italian market has been growing up very rapidly (since only 7-10 years ago it simply was not existing while nowadays the total installed power has reached 8 MWp). In such a new market often operations related to commissioning and installing a small wind turbine have to be faced and validated for the first time. The objective of this paper is to summarize the experience of the authors in the application of traditional project management tools in this field to facilitate investors, project managers and stakeholders facing this market for the first time and to offer them a reference timeline in order to plan all financial and field activities.

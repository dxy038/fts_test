Background: Tuberculosis is still one of the most important causes of mortality and
morbidity in many countri es and is the second only to human immunodefi ciency virus as
a cause of death worldwide resulting from a single infectious agent. In 1993, the World
Health Organization declared tuberculosis a global public health emergency. Conventional
methods for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections are
time consuming, as MTB culture requires 3-8 weeks for growth . To determine the
sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBM C), we have evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood
samples with PCR techniqu e in adults with new cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary
tuberculosis. Setting : Department of Infectious disease of Imam Khomeini Hospital ,
2004- 2005, Tehran, Iran.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated MTB DNA extracted from 3m]
citrated peripheral blood samples from 95 adults with new cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary
tuberculosis. DNA extraction was performed using a commercial PCR kit with
IS1081 primers. For prevention of cross contamination and reduction of false positives, all
steps were performed under laminar hood.
Results: The 95 patients, 59 of whom were male, had a mean age 44.44 years (SDÂ±20.26);
69 cases had pulmona ry and 26 had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. PCR was positive in 32
(33.7%) patients and negative in 63 (66.3%) cases. The overall sensitivity and accuracy of
the PCR assay was 44.1% for pulmonary , 19.2% for extra-pulmonary and 10% for
disseminated tuberculosis , respectively.
Conclusion; The low sensitivity of the IS1081 primer MTB -PCR assay on PBMC may
pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosi s. However, further studies are
needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

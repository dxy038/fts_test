This paper presents an extension called the Complex Business Processes for Stream Processing (CBPsp) to the Solution Manager Service (SMS) framework to support the definition and enactment of complex business processes for event stream processing. The critical care of an infant involves multiple caregivers performing complex activities, thus a system that is capable of presenting complex business processes to produce context sensitive real-time support is required. The proposed system CBPsp, supports the integration of heterogeneous sequential business processes and distinct data types to produce meaningful business objective driven outputs in real-time. Two research contributions are delivered. The first contribution is the real-time integration of synchronous and asynchronous streams in a loosely coupled model based on Service-Oriented Architecture principles. The second contribution is the definition and enactment of complex business processes along with their meaningful business objectives at the point of analysis within data stream management systems.

The objective is to optimize WMN (Wireless Mesh Network) routing protocol OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing). Although OLSR has link quality extensions, which makes calculating a routing table based on link quality. However when the extension is deployed into the Wireless Mesh Network in the underground coal mine, we find it brings too much cost both in calculation and bandwidth. The optimized protocol makes it possible to find best route using less cost in the underground coal mine. Based on NS2´s simulation, we find the improvement of OLSR routing protocol´s packet delivery success rate is higher than OLSR based on link state and average end-to-end packet delay is lower, which proves the protocol´s feasibility.

We address the question if it is possible to completely dissociate a diatomic molecule in an electronically excited state. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer the entire population from the initial vibronic ground state to the excited state and pump further energy into the system. In constructing the control fields, local control theory is employed and different schemes are conducted. The NaI molecule serves as a numerical example, where a competing pre-dissociation channel is fully taken into account. As a main result, it is demonstrated that the objective can be fulfilled with a high efficiency.

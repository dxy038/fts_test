In 2006, NASAÂ´s Origins Program will launch the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), a 10 meter baseline optical interferometry instrument, into an earth trailing orbit. This instrument will be comprised of three collinear optical interferometers whose prime mission objective is to perform astrometric measurements of unparalleled accuracy. NASA has assembled an integrated Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)/Industry team to formulate a reference design to meet the SIM Science objectives. Unique technical challenges have proved to be a formidable task in numerous aspects of the system definition, from component development to system-level integration and test. Parallel activities to develop and test the necessary enabling technologies for SIM are coupled with the ongoing Flight design. The SIM Project has taken a multi faceted approach to dealing with its numerous technical challenges. Key working groups are addressing specific, integrated areas such as thermal design, dynamics and control, and operations. In addition, detailed integrated models of optical systems, structural dynamics and thermal control systems are being implemented in a large integrated modeling effort in order to validate the system level performance requirements. The implementation of enabling technologies from picometer and nanometer technology testbed programs are crucial to developing a detailed design and mitigating or retiring risk early in the Project development cycle. This paper describes the current SIM Reference System Design, the key required technologies, the requirements development process and the approach to an integrated systems development

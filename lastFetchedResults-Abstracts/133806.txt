Background: The perinatal mortality incidence and perinatal complication rate are increased after 40th week of gestational age.
Objective: This study was performed in order to compare the different method: emergency induction and expecting management of post mature pregnancy.
Methods: : This research was done on 108 primigravid women with 40 weeks gestational age which refer to the fatemieh hospital.They were randomly divided into two groups, emergency induction (48) and expecting management (60). Patients in expecting managemant were controlled twice a week with NST and ultrasound to measure the amount of amniotic fluid . Also patients in emergency induction were induced with oxytocin after admission.
Findings: Results revealed that there were no significant difference (in infant convulsion, apgar score < 7 in five minutes and fetal mortality) between 2 groups. The rate of cesarean section, macrosomia and birth weight were the same. There was no significant difference in cesarean rate in both groups.
Conclusion: Based on the results, selecting the emergency induction as treatment method in postterm pregnancies not only dosen't cause prenatal and more surgical complications but also is economical.

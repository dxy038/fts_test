In this paper we present a design, development and evaluation of a tool to facilitate the reminiscence of life-logged data intended for persons with dementia. Using off-the-shelf technologies such as a smartphone it is possible to effectively record and log a person´s daily activates such as places visited and persons interacted with. We developed a reminiscence tool that visualizes life-logging data. The system was evaluated with six healthy participants aged between 24-46 years of age. They recorded approximately 2.5 hours of life-logging data that was later loaded into the developed tool. During the subsequent evaluation, the participant´s gaze was tracked using eye-tracking hardware. Results show that the tool was easy to use and navigate through, facilitating the objective identification of events that may be useful for reminiscence.

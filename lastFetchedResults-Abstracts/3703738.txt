HOME is a new computerized microscope designed to assist pathologists and cytotechnicians in routine examinations. The HOME workstation is composed of a standard light microscope fitted with objective and stage encoders, and a built-in high resolution computer display which superimposes dialog, drawing, and messages onto the optical microscope image. The software runs under Windows 3.X and provides interactive facilities such as accurate localization and relocation of zones of interest, morphometric measurements, patient data access, and quality control processes.

Control of an inverted pendulum has been a benchmark example in demonstrating and motivating various controller design techniques. The problem to maintain the robust performance of an inverted pendulum with uncertain or unknown parameters is more challenging. In this paper, the method of mu synthesis with regional pole assignment is used to design a controller for an inverted pendulum with parametric uncertainties by solving a multi-objective controller synthesis problem. Simulation results show that the controller has favorable performance in robustness and disturbance rejection

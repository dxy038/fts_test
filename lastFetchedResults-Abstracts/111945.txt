The objective of this study was the production of rice husk flour (RHF) and wood flour (WF) filled polybutylene succinate (PBS) biocomposites as alternatives to cellulosic material filled conventional plastic (polyolefins) composites. PBS is one of the biodegradable polymers, made from the condensation reaction of 1,4-butanediol and succinic acid that can be naturally degraded in the natural environment. We compared the mechanical properties between conventional plastics and agro-flourfilled PBS biocomposites. We evaluated the biodegradability and mechanical properties of agro-flour-filled PBS biocomposites according to the content and filler particle size of agro-flour. As the agro-flour loading was increased, the tensile and impact strength of the biocomposites decreased. As the filler particle size decreased, the tensile strength of the biocomposites increased but the impact strength decreased. The addition of agro-flour to PBS produced a more rapid decrease in the tensile strength, notched Izod impact strength, and percentage weight loss of the biocomposites during the natural soil burial test. These results support the application of biocomposites as environmentally friendly materials.

Combined heat and power systems such as micro turbines with capacities in the range of tens of kilowatts to hundreds of kilowatts have been employed for many years, mostly in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. Despite their relatively small individual capacities as compared to centralized conventional utilities, their operation may lead to significant energy efficiency improvements for the electricity and heating of residential and commercial customers. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a method to analyze the impact of micro turbines on electricity and thermal energy production, costs, and emissions for residential customers. Then, we illustrate this method using a case study for Masonic Village in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.

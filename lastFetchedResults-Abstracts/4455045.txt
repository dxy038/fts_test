Recent advances in robust control theory allow for the analysis of stability robustness of power system controls over a wide range of operating conditions. The primary objective of this paper is to apply the robustness procedure to a power system where the loads are represented by induction motors. Uncertainty in the induction motor model is attributed to variations in system conditions as well as in its parameters due to the aggregation of several induction motors into an equivalent induction motor. Numerical results for a test system are obtained and compared with those using nonlinear time simulations

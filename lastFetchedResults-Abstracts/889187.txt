Background: Employing non-fluorescent quenchers in Real-time PCR is appropriate for gene expression examination.
Objective: The objective of this study was to compare Real-time PCR fluorescent and non-fluorescent quenchers in standard amplification plots of delta-6 desaturase gene in PANC-1 cell line culture. 
Methods: This analytical study was conducted in the Reference Laboratory affiliated to Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in 2012.  Human pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) were cultured in 75 cm2 flasks, 3x106 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and were treated with specific intracellular signaling drugs. Changes in expression of delta-6 desaturase gene were examined with fluorescent and non-fluorescent quenchers using Real-time PCR in equal conditions, separately. Data were analyzed using student T-test and gene expression results were analyzed using ??CT method with the assumption of 100% efficiency.
Findings: Employed quenchers showed different absorption of the fluorescence emitted by the reporter and caused different results in Real-time PCR. Using non-fluorescent quencher, the amplification plot was more precise and its baseline was lower. Therefore the signal to noise ratio (S/N) was decreased. Also, the Threshold cycle (Ct) value was lower because of increased Tm (melting temperature) and decreased non-specific bindings.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, non-fluorescent quencher is more appropriate compared to fluorescent quencher and can be a better alternative for current quenchers especially in allelic discrimination and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) studies.

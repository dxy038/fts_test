The paper presents the design and realization of an optimization model for the jobshop planning and execution problem. The computational model is realized in using the IBM ILOG OPL application. The computation of optimized planning and scheduling is performed using the constraint programming technique. The model contains the input data (client orders and resource status), the objective function (makespan minimization) and the set of constraints related to the real execution of products and to the limitations of the production system. The proposed model, implemented in ILOG OPL, is integrated into a centralized Scheduling System which transfers the planning and scheduling results to the shop floor automation layer of the Manufacturing Execution System (MES).

Objective: To determine the frequency of thyrotoxicosis in 50 consecutive patients presenting with anxiety as chief complaint, who have been previously treated with anxiolytics and anti-depressants.Material and Methods: This prospective analytical study was conducted in the medical OPD of Hayatabad Medical complex Peshawar from Jan 2004 to June 2004. Patients with symptoms of palpitations, sweating, tremors, anorexia and weight loss and those experiencing periods of intense fear and who were previously treated with anxiolytics were included in the study. All those patients who had diagnosed thyroid disease, were being treated for thyroid disease or had undergone thyroid surgery or radioablation of thyroid gland were excluded. In addition patients who had anxiety with concomitant medical disease, as tuberculosis, hepatitis, diabetes or hypertension etc and those on anti-arrythmic drug amiodarone and interferon therapy for hepatitis were also excluded from the study.After a detailed history and clinical examination, thyroid function tests, E.C.G was performed in all patients.Results: Out of fifty patients, 35 (70%) patients were females and 15 (30%) were males. Age range was 20-45 years, with a mean of 32.5 Â± 4.3 years. Eleven patients (22 %) were found to have thyrotoxicosis, the rest 39 (78%) were euthyroid and were labelled as primary anxiety disorder.Conclusion: Thyrotoxicosis is a common cause of anxiety neurosis in patients treated with anxiolytics. It should be excluded before a diagnosis of anxiety disorder is made.

This paper is focused on the development of an innovative device, which is based on a bidirectional converter, for the interface to the supply utility grid of combined renewable-energy-source-based generators and electric storage systems. The device can be controlled so as to ease the interface between the low-voltage grid and photovoltaic or wind generators combined with lithium-ion LiFePO<sub>4</sub> batteries, taking into account the requirements of the reference technical standards for users connection and offering different ancillary services. The operational functioning of the device, the architecture, and its electronic components, as well as laboratory and field test activities and results are described. The conversion device has been developed, and the main results that have been achieved are detailed.

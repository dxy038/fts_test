Objective: effects of Fosfomycin (FOM) nebulizer therapy were studied in patients with chronic sinusitis. Methods: about 28 patients with chronic sinusitis were administered 2 ml of FOM sodium (3% w/v) by nebulizer three times per week for 4 weeks. Levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in nasal lavage were also measured before and at the end of treatment. Results: the overall efficacy of this treatment on the basis of both subjective and objective symptoms, was ‘excellent’ for 28.6%, ‘good’ for 10.7%, ‘fair’ for 39.4%, and yield ‘no change’ for 21.4% of the patients. Both IL-1β and IL-6 concentrations were significantly decreased after treatment. Although the IL-8 level did not significantly decrease, it seems to be related to the overall efficacy. TNF-α was not detected in all of the samples. Conclusion: FOM nebulization therapy is highly effective in treatment for chronic sinusitis, and efficacy may be due to an immunomodulatory mechanism, as well as its bactericidal effect.

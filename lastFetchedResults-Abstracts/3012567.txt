The purpose of this study is to construct an interactive system which composes a musical work satisfying each user. This study makes a great importance to human subjectivity toward music, and constructs a music composition system reflecting each user´s feeling. The system uses 3 types of user evaluations toward music to generate 16-bars musical work. The interactive genetic algorithm is applied to the present system, and user evaluations are employed instead of GA´s objective fitness functions. In this paper, chromosomes, which have information on 4-bars musical work, are generated in the pool, and the GA operations based on user evaluations are executed to them. From the results of the evaluation experiments, it is found that our system composes music reflecting user´s feeling.

Summary form only given. In the area of ISDN conformance test development NIST´s objective is to produce abstract test scripts independent of any test system environment, and to place these test scripts in the public domain. NIST has promoted a cooperative effort amongst interested parties in the industry and a unified conformance effort has been established in the NIU Forum. NIST will maintain a neutral position and serve as a catalyst to the development of test suites in a timely manner. It is planned that test suites for layer 2 (CCITT Q921) and layer 3 (CCITT Q931 or ANSI´s equivalent) will be developed first. Currently, NIST is focused on three areas of ISDN conformance testing: a test suite for the layer 2 (LAPD) protocol, test procedures for the layer 1 (I430) protocol, and a TTCN to `C´ translator

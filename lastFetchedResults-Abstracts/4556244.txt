This work describes the monolithic integration of several optical structures that are needed for optical absorption or scattering measurements. The main objective is the development of a fabrication method to allow maximum integration through the use of a photosensitive polymer called SU8. A sealed microfluidic circuitry plus an optical one has been integrated monolithically on a silicon substrate with micro fabricated photodiodes. This work gives only a brief overview of the fabrication process. Further details are described elsewhere (F. J. Blanco (2003), J. M. Ruano (2004), M. Aguirregabiria). The microsystem proposed here contains a pair of silicon mesa photodiodes for light intensity measurement purposes, SU8 buried waveguides to confine light, a y-branch splitter to couple light to both photodiodes, a connector for input fibre coupling and a microfluidic circuit with an analytical chamber to allow propagation of light through the substance under analysis.

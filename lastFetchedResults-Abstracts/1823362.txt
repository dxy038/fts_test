Objective
rpose of the present study was to evaluate the biostimulative and regenerative effects of low intensity laser irradiation (LILT) (applied before or after initiation of radiotherapy) on gamma irradiated ratsâ€™ jaw bones.
s
eight male Albino rats were equally divided into two groups: group 1, in which the left side of the mandible was subjected to three successive sessions of laser (LILT) prior to whole body gamma radiation (2 Gy/3 fractions/week) and group 2, received whole body gamma radiation (2 Gy/3 fractions/week) prior to three successive sessions of laser applied to left side. The right side of both groups was used as gamma irradiated non-lased control group. Each group was then subdivided into four equal subgroups (a, b, c, d) according to the time of scarification (3, 7, 14, 21 days respectively). Specimens were subjected to histological, histomorphometric and scanning electron microscopic examinations.
s
rregular bone trabeculae and widened marrow spaces were identified in the control group. The lased sides of groups 1 and 2 demonstrated regular, thick and continuous bone trabeculae. Ultrastructurally, collagen fibres of the control group appeared irregularly arranged and more spaced compared to groups 1 and 2. Normal-sized osteocytic lacunae were seen in the lased groups, as compared to the wide lacunar spaces noted in the control group. Histomorphometric analysis showed a significant increase in the area of bone trabeculae, as well as the width of compact bone, for the lased groups.
sions
eemed to attenuate the radiation-related damage in alveolar bones.

The objective of this study was to compare effects of quin2 and EDTA in iron-driven Fenton-type reactions. Seven different assays for detection of strong oxidants were used: the DMSO, deoxyribose, benzoate hydroxylation, and plasmid DNA strand breakage assays, detection of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine in deoxyguanosine mononucleosides and calf thymus DNA, and electron spin resonance with the spin-trap (4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tertbutylnitrone (4-POBN) in the presence of ethanol or DMSO. With H2O2 and Fe3+, quin2 generally strongly increased the formation of reactive species in all assays, whereas with EDTA the results varied between the assays from barely detectable to highly significant increases compared to H2O2 and unchelated Fe3+. We found that the species produced in the reaction between Fe3+-quin2 and H2O2 behaved like the hydroxyl radical in all assays, whereas with Fe3+-EDTA no clear conclusion could be drawn about the nature of the oxidant. The effect of quin2 on the formation of oxidants on Fe2+  autoxidation, varied from generally inhibiting to slightly promoting, depending on the assay used. EDTA had a promoting effect on the amount of oxidant detected by all but one assay. None of the autoxidation systems produced DMSO or ethanol radical adducts with 4-POBN. In the presence of either chelator, H2O2, and Fe2+ DMSO and ethanol radical adducts of 4-POBN were produced. Using the Fe2+ indicator ferrozine, evidence for direct reduction of Fe3+-quin2 by H2O2 was found. Superoxide anion radical appeared to be less efficient than H2O2 as reductant of Fe3+-quin2 as addition of superoxide dismutase in the ferrozine experiments only decreased the amount of Fe2+ available for Fenton reaction by 10â€“20%. The main conclusions from our study are that the reduction of Fe3+-quin2 can be driven by H2O2 and that Fe2+ in the following oxidation step produces a species indistinguishable from free hydroxyl radical.

Objective
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is considered a candidate modifier factor for 
neuro-degenerative disorders. The most common type of ataxia is Friedreichâ€™s 
ataxia (FA). The aim of this study was to investigate different parts of mtDNA 
in 20 Iranian FA patients and 80 age-matched controls by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and automated DNA sequencing methods to find any probable 
point mutations involved in the pathogenesis of FA. 
Materials and Methods
We identified 13 nucleotide substitutions including A3505G, T3335C, G3421A, 
G8251A, A8563G, A8563G, G8584A, T8614C, T8598C, C8684T, A8701G, 
G8994A and A9024G. 
Results
Twelve of 13 nucleotide substitutions had already been reported as 
polymorphism. One of the nucleotide substitutions (A9024G) had not been 
reported before. The A9024G nucleotide substitution does not change its 
amino acid. The controls were also investigated for this polymorphism which 
was found in two of them (2.5%). 
Conclusion
None of the mutations found in this study can affect the clinical manifestations 
of FA. This survey also provides evidence that the mtDNA A9024G allele is 
a new nonpathogenic polymorphism. We suggest follow-up studies for this 
polymorphism in different populations

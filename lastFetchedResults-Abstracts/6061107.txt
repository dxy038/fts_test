Objective: To optimize the conditions for Fructus Leonuri flavonoid extraction and investigate the hypoglycemic effect of Fructus Leonuri flavonids on mice with diabetes mellitus. Methods: The conditions for Fructus Leonuri flavonoid extraction were optimized by analyzing extraction time, extraction temperature, ratio of solid and liquid, and ethanol concentration with orthogonal experiment. Effects of Fructus Leonuri flavonoids at different doses on diabetes mice were studied compared with the model group. Results: The best techniques conditions for Fructus Leonuri flavonoid extraction should be at the temperature of 60&#176;C, in 60% ethanol concentration and in 1:20 ratio of solid and liquid; Fructus Leonuri flavonoids could produce a good hypoglycemic effect. Conclusion: Orthogonal experiment can be used to optimize the conditions for Fructus Leonuri flavonid extraction; Fructus Leonuri flavonoids can produce a significant good hypoglycemic effect. This study will play a good foundation for the further research on their pharmacological effects and biological activities of Fructus Leonuri flavonoids.

The heavy snowfall in the UK during February 1991 led to most of the modern Network SouthEast rolling stock grinding to a halt.

This entailed evaluating the performance of both Class 465 vehicle types under both cold temperature and snow conditions. The author describes how the project achieved its objective of evaluating the climatic performance of both types of Class 465 Networker One in Vienna Arsenal. The project timescales were achieved and all required tests completed

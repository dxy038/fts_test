Background: In order to achieve a dynamic surveillance system for the groups at risk of tuberculosis and to improve its quality, investigating its various aspects and benefiting from the opinions of the experts and experienced individuals in this field are very important. Hence, the objective of this study was to explore the status of the surveillance system for the groups at risk of tuberculosis in Iran.

Methods: Data collection was carried out via interviews with 17 experts in the tuberculosis control program of Iran. In order to evaluate the validity and reliability of data, four criteria of credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability were used. Frame analysis was used for data analysis.

Results: Based on the interviewee's opinions, twelve major groups at risk of tuberculosis and seven challenges in the surveillance system were identified. For the majority of these at risk groups, there is no structured program and the status of case finding and treatment is similar to the public population. For some others (HIV/ AIDS patients, prisoners and people at exposure), there is a program, but its effectiveness is uncertain.

Conclusion: Results indicate that groups at risk of tuberculosis are widespread and access to some of them is difficult; hence, these groups are the main challenges of the tuberculosis control program in Iran.

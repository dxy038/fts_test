This paper presents a preliminary study which describes and evaluates a multi-objective (MO) version of a recently created single objective (SO) optimization algorithm called the &#8220;Alliance Algorithm&#8221; (AA). The algorithm is based on the metaphorical idea that several tribes, with certain skills and resource needs, try to conquer an environment for their survival and to ally together to improve the likelihood of conquest. The AA has given promising results in several fields to which has been applied, thus the development of a MO variant (MOAA) is a natural extension. Here the MOAAÂ´s performance is compared with two well-known MO algorithms: NSGA-II and SPEA-2. The performance measures chosen for this study are the convergence and diversity metrics. The benchmark functions chosen for the comparison are from the ZDT and OKA families and the main classical MO problems. The results show that the three algorithms have similar overall performance. Thus, it is not possible to identify a best algorithm for all the problems; the three algorithms show a certain complementarity because they offer superior performance for different classes of problems.

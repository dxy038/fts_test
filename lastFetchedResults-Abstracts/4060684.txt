The very fast bidirectional bus system (LAN) is analyzed. In contrast to previous studies, the assumptions that the bus is very fast is inherently embedded in the system model. The maximum throughput which can be achieved in the system, neglecting the randomized behavior of the system inputs, is calculated and bounds for the system efficiency under several conditions are derived. The system behavior is investigated under the assumption of stochastic arrivals. The model used is similar to the models used in the analysis of slotted ALOHA and CSMA; however, in contrast to those models, this model captures the correlation between events occurring in the system. The results of the analysis show that, in contrast to previously studied shared-channel systems, this system is very stable and the system throughput increases with the offered load

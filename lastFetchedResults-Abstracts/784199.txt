Purpose The aim of this paper is to report on the development
and applicability of a standardised and objective
measure of stigma of mental illness in print media. Picture
of mental illness in newspapers (PICMIN) instrument
consists of eleven descriptive and five analytical categories.
It is intended to allow comparison among countries and
different studies over time.
Methods The research team conducted a three-phase
study to develop the instrument based on the principles of
content analysis and test its inter-coder reliability (ICR). In
the first phase, keyword search and ICR assessment was
performed on articles from Croatia (75), Czech Republic
(203), and Slovakia (172). The second phase consisted of
instrument revision and training, along with ICR reassessment
on 40 articles from USA and UK. In the third,
main phase articles from Croatia (238), Czech Republic
(226), and Slovakia (158) were analysed with the final
version of the PICMIN instrument.
Results Across three countries, ICR was found acceptable
to assess mental illness representations related to stigma in
print media. Print media representations of the mental illness
in Croatia, Czech Republic, and Slovakia significantly
differed in the type of media distribution, whether headline
of the article was positioned on the media cover, in the use
of a sensationalistic style of writing, in the association of
aggressive behaviour with persons with mental illness and
in the distribution of the global impression of the headline.
Conclusions PICMIN instrument allows comparison
among countries and different studies over time.

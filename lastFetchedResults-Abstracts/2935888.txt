The precise mapping of the border between the Varzeas (Floodplain) and the Terra Firme (Uplands) along Rio Amazonas, is of fundamental importance for any environmental study of this region. Within this frame, the objective of this study is to analyse if a section of Varzeas, close to the city of Santarem (Para State, Brazil), can be mapped to an accuracy to fit the Cartographic Accuracy Standard (Padrao de Exatidao Cartografica-PEC). In this study it was verified if the border Varzeas/Terra Firme, extracted from an ERS-1/SAR scene, texturally analysed, is compatible with PEC. To confirm the results, a TM/LANDSAT scene of this region was analysed separately and registered to the ERS-1/SAR scene. The results indicate that these products present limitations to map the floodplain at the precision required by PEC

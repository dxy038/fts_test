Congestion in the transmission network prevents the implementation of the desired market transaction. This paper proposes a new, simple and effective congestion management scheme, which will meet the objective of ISO (Independent System Operator). To relieve congestion, an auction mechanism for interruptible load has been designed and integrated with congestion relief model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined for an ISO operating in a bilateral contract, for the real-time selection of interruptible load offer. The IEEE 30-Bus system and Indian 69-Bus utility Bus systems with considering transactions have been used for validation of various case studies.

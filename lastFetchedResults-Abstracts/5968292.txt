This paper reports progress of the implementation phase of the Luz Solar program-a utility initiative for rural electrification using photovoltaics. This program has been specifically designed as a larger-scale use of photovoltaics by CEMIG-Energetic Company of Minas Gerais, in collaboration with state and federal governments. The analysis is based upon 8 years CEMIG´s experience with PV, which has shown that this technology can be both reliable and cost effective in remote, rural areas-as well in urban environments. The main objective has been to find an energy delivery alternative to grid connection for dispersed rural communities. Starting from July, 2002, electric utilities in Brazil will be obliged to electrify the entire area it serves. PV will facilitate the access of lower-income people to lighting, communication, as well as education. The major conclusion of this 8-year CEMIG investment is that an adequate service infrastructure is required to make projects viable, mainly characterized by a technical network that will embrace the whole area. This network will guarantee the system´s technical performance, system design, qualified technical performance, and will also avoid a lack of ongoing and unrealized user expectations. The Luz Solar Program has benefited from the lessons learned during these solar-electricity experiences, avoiding potential failures in the sustainability model.

A continuous co-precipitation method under steady-state conditions has been investigated for the preparation of nanometer-size layered double hydroxide (LDH) particles using Zn2Al(OH)6(CO3)0.5·2H2O as a prototype. The objective was to shorten the preparation time by working without an aging step, using a short and controlled residence time in order to maintain a constant supersaturation level in the reactor and constant particle properties in the exit stream over time. The effects of varying the operating conditions on the structural and textural properties of the LDHs have been studied, including total cation concentration, solvent, residence time, pH and intercalation anion. The products have been characterized using ICP, XRD, FTIR, BET, SEM and TEM. The LDHs prepared by the continuous coprecipitation method have a poorer crystallinity and lower crystallite sizes than those synthesized by the conventional batch method. The results have shown that increasing either cation concentration or the fraction of monoethylene glycol (MEG) in MEG/H2O mixtures up to 80% (v/v) affect salt solubility and supersaturation, which gives rise to smaller crystallites, larger surface areas and more amorphous compounds. This increase is however limited by the precipitation of zinc and aluminum hydroxides occurring around a total cation concentration of 3.0×10−1 M in pure water and 3.0×10−2 M in H2O/EtOH mixtures. Crystallite size increases with residence time, suggesting a precipitation process controlled by growth. Finally, the continuous coprecipitation method under steady-state conditions has been shown to be a promising alternative to the traditional coprecipitation technique in either pure water or mixed H2O/MEG solvents.

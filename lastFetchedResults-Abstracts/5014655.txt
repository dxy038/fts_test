The University investigated co-generation as a method of controlling escalating electricity costs in the late 1980s. A combination of economic conditions served to delay implementation for 7 years. With the prime objective of minimising electricity costs a scheme was undertaken in 1996 which was capable of producing the full requirements of the site. The 3 MW(e) plant was installed in close proximity to existing boilers, in space created by the removal of redundant oil storage tanks, thereby minimising construction costs and achieving good acoustic isolation from the local environment. This paper describes the selection of the equipment and its performance during the first year of operation

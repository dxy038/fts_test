Wireless communication systems will be widely used in modern distribution networks to allow the integration of RES and the exploitation of energy storage and active demand without jeopardizing the overall system reliability. ICT is the enabling infrastructure for active distribution, but, since efficiency and reliability of power delivery may be influenced by weather conditions besides the reliability of ICT components, the optimal position and number of antennas must take into account not only the cost for radio stations but also the impact on the expected distribution reliability. In the paper, an NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm to find the optimal location of WiMax antennas is proposed. The impact of the rain-fade is explicitly taken into account with an internal sub-optimization that considers the probability of rain days that can affect the communication between the control centre and DER.

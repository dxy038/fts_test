An improved image thresholding algorithm based on the adaptive search procedure combining histogram thresholding method with relaxation factor was presented to improve the quality and efficiency of image segmentation Fisher-based algorithm. During the running time, the optimal classification was determined according to the separation judgment factor of the target categories, and the thresholds search space was adaptively determined depending on the algorithm integrated the histogram thresholding method with relaxation factor. Taking the images with multi-objective or complex background as the experimental object, the experiments indicated that the algorithm can effectively segment the images, and the computing efficiency improved prominently.

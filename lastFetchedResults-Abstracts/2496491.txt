Abstract
Introduction: Elderly people encounter with multiple disabilities, stress, anxiety and challenges, which effect on their quality of life. Self-efficacy may encourage them to improve self-care activities, challenges, life satisfaction and quality of their life.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate general self-efficacy and the related factors among elderly in residential home. 
Methods: It was a descriptive cross-sectional study. A total of 87 elderly who lives in Charmahal o Bakhtiyari rest-home nursing were recruited by census. The data were collected with General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE-10) and then analyzed using independent t-test, ANOVA and regression test. 
Results: The mean score of the general self-efficacy was 22.95Â±8.02 (from 10 - 40 score) indicating that most of the participants (69%) had low level of self-efficacy (under 25 score). General self-efficacy was associated with age, gender, educational level and satisfaction of rest-home nursing (P < 0.01), but the relationship between self-efficacy, marital status and duration of living residential home nursing was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Moreover, general self- efficacy was mostly related with sex (B=-0.541, P=0.0001).
Conclusion: The present study provided useful information about self-efficacy and its related factors among elderly living residential home. This information can be used for designing and performing appropriate nursing interventions to promote elderly general self-efficacy.

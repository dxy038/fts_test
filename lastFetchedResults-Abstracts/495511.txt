In 1903, the Iranian islands of the Greater Tunb, the Lesser Tunb, Abu
Mousa and Syri were annexed by Britain which, subsequently, granted the
Ghasemids the authority to govern them-one of the consequences of British
colonial policies in the Persian Gulf region. In 1963, however, the Syri Island
was returned to Iran. Similarly, in 1971. the three remaining islands were
reinstated.
In every research project on the temporary annexation of the islands and
their surrender to the Ghasemids, one fundamental question arises: Why did
Britain deeide to annex the islands and relinquish their control over to the
Ghasemids at the outset of the 20th century? Tn answering this question. one
must consider the colonial power rivalries in the 19th century Iran, particularly
between Britain and Russia. Our objective is to demonstrate that regional and
global developments in the former years of the 19l11 century propelled Iran into
the realm of international politics.
For more than a century, the Iranian foreign policy concentrated primarily
on the British-Russian rivalry within the framework of the theory of positive
balance. It meant that neither of the two powers could accept the political and
economic superiority of the other in their relations with Iran. For example, the
supremacy of the Russian influence in the latter part of the 19lh century created
obstacles for traditional British interests, jeopardizing [he security of India as
well as the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf This disconcerting development
generated the impetus for Britain to embark lipan the bold strategy of creating its
own exclusive sphere of influence in the Persian Gulf, thus explaining why
Britain annexed and subsequently surrendered the Iranian islands to the
Ghasemids-the Arabs with whom it had earlier signed protectorate contracts.

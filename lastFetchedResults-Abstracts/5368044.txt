Arc flash personal protective equipment is generally selected based on one of two methods: an incident energy analysis method or a hazard/risk category method. Neither method adequately addresses the deployment of arc flash personal protective equipment using risk management principles and processes. The objective of this paper is to identify and apply risk management principles and methodology found in current standards to assist with the selection of arc flash personal protective equipment and to determine when deployment of the arc flash protective equipment is warranted.

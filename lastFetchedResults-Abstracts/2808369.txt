According to the rail traffic characteristics, this article analyses the dual power rail vehicle demand background. Combined with traction and braking characteristics of rail vehicles, this paper makes the simulation of on-board energy storage system demand and determines the requirements for energy and power of traction power system with the on-vehicle energy storage systems supplying. According to the objective, this paper proposes two energy storage system solutions and energy management strategies, which finally be validated and contrasted by simulation. At last, some conclusions are given.

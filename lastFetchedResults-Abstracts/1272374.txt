Aim and Background: The analgesic effect of perioperative low doses of intravenous lidocaine has been
demonstrated in some studies. Sodium channel blockers are approved for IV administration in the treatment of
neuropathic pain states. Our objective in this study was to determine the analgesic, antiemetic and sedative effect
of perioperative lidocaine administration in strabismus surgery.
Methods and Materials: In a randomized and double blinded clinical trial, forty patients undergoing strabismus
surgery were evaluated. Twenty patients received lidocaine (bolus injection of 1.5 mg/kg) at the end of operation,
before tracheal extubation and 20 patients received saline as placebo. Postoperative pain scorr, pethidine
requirement, nausea -vomiting and sedation were assessed in the recovery room.
Findings: Patients who received lidocaine reported less pain and needed less pethidine during their recovery
state. There were also fewer incidences of nausea and vomiting in the lidocaine group. Patients in the lidocaine
group were more sedated than the ones in the control group.
Conclusions: Intravenous lidocaine has analgesic activity, besides its preventing effect on nausea and vomiting
after strabismus surgery.

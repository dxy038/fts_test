Recent research in the field of spread spectrum communications has shown the ability of transform domain excision using the wavelet transformation to improve system performance when transmitting signals in the presence of additive noise and interference. In such work, the transforms were implemented using FIR filters. The main objective of this paper is to implement the wavelet transform using IIR filters. IIR filters are well known to have sharper transition regions leading to better performance. Numerical simulation of direct sequence spread spectrum communication systems have shown that IIR filters are better in removing the jammer energy and subsequently yield better BER performance

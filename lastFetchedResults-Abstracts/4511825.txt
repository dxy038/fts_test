In skywave radar the removal of transients from the signal is a major objective since they reduce the radarÂ´s capability to detect and track targets. It is desirable to extract the transient components from the data without removing any other information. Current techniques only exploit the time localization of such signals. A natural extension would be to incorporate a frequency localization component. Wavelets lend themselves ideally to this task by virtue of their joint time and frequency localization properties. In this paper, we construct a multiresolution wavelet decomposition algorithm for HF radar data and apply two filtering techniques specifically designed to detect and remove lightning and meteor components from the signal

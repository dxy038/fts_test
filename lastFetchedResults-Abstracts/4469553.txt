In our previous work, we proposed a load distribution technique and dynamic data reallocation method for web-based MORPG system. This approach could reduce the average server latency for game players. However, each latency widely varied, which leads unfair situation for game players. In this paper, we deal with data allocation with taking into account the fairness as a combinational optimization problem. We develop an optimization model whose objective function is to minimize the difference among latency value. We exactly solve this problem and compare the results with our previous data allocation method.

In this paper a new backoff algorithm is proposed to enhance both the delay and the throughput performance of IEEE 802.11b MAC protocol. The proposed waiting time based backoff algorithm (WBA), observes the Waiting-time of each station during the backoff procedure in order to estimate the size of contention window in the network. The main objective of our investigation is to examine the performance of IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol with our proposed algorithm and compare with the standard backoff algorithm i.e. Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) algorithm. The simulation results show that the WBA algorithm outperforms the standard backoff algorithm because it has better adaptability to the network load variations.

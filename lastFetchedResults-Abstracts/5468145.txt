A DC-side commutated zero voltage switching (ZVS) PWM 3- Phi VSI topology is discussed. This topology consists of a typical six-switch bridge with the addition of a simple DC bus commutating subcircuit which can provide, on demand, the necessary for soft switching zero-volt interval across the inverter DC bus. The objective of this work is to identify a specific PWM technique which, in combination with the proposed ZVS scheme, can provide optimum overall converter switching performance. Moreover, the combination of the inverter topology and the modulation strategy proposed yields a soft switching environment at the lowest possible switching frequency.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

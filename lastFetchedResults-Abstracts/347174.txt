Objective: Previous research with healthy subjects suggests that the lower alpha band reflects attentional whereas the upper alpha band semantic processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether dyslexics show deficits in attentional control and/or semantic encoding.
Method: The EEG was recorded while subjects were reading numbers, words and pseudowords and analyzed in a lower and upper alpha and two beta bands (spanning a range of about 8â€“16 Hz). A phasic response is measured in terms of a decrease in event related band power during reading with respect to a reference interval. Tonic power is measured in terms of (log) band power during a reference interval.
Results: In the lower alpha band dyslexics show an increased phasic response to words and pseudowords at right hemispheric sites but a lack to respond to words at O1. The upper alpha band exhibits a highly selective phasic response to words at left frontal sites but for controls only, whereas dyslexics show a general increase in tonic upper alpha power. Whereas the low frequency beta band (beta-1a) exhibits a rather diffuse pattern, a highly selective finding was obtained for the beta-1b band.
Conclusions: Dyslexics have a lack of attentional control during the encoding of words at left occipital sites and a lack of a selective topographic activation pattern during the semantic encoding of words. Because only in controls reading of words is associated with a strong beta-1b desynchronization at those recording sites which correspond to Broca's area (FC5) and the angular gyrus (CP5, P3), we may conclude that this frequency band reflects the graphemicphonetic encoding of words.

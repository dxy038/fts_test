Lower-limb prosthesis quality-of-fit assessment is purely subjective in routine clinical practice, relying on patient reports of discomfort, erythema (localized pain), and palpation. Wide variations in residual limb physical characteristics and conditions preclude a rigid approach to prosthesis prescription. With relatively long life expectancy for many lower-limb amputees, clinicians measure outcome in terms of return to work and quality of life, which have important social and economic consequences. An objective quantitative metric of fit that predicts functional outcome has not been described to date. Volumetric CT scanning provides in situ static 3D determination of residual limb soft tissue changes caused by the prosthesis socket. This mapping aids in prosthesis design and evaluation

Objective:- To find sero-prevalance of HBSAg and HCV antibody among the healthy subjects reporting for screening for vaccination of Hepatitis B. Material and Methods:- The study design was cross-sectional. Data was collected from Blood transfusion units, Pathology departments, Parachinar to know the frequency of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C in healthy subjects for purpose of vaccination and screening the subjects. Detailed history was taken by panel of doctors helped by paramedical staff. Screening for HBsAg, and HCV antibodies was done by using rapid immunochromatography kits. Results:- A total of ten thousand three hundred and forty three subjects were received during a period of one year from April 2007 till April 2008.. The seroprevalence of various infectious markers was as follows; Out of the total 10343 ,280(2.707%) were found to be positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg and 50(0.43%) were found positive for HCV antibody. Conclusion:- It is concluded that HCV and HBV has become major problems in FATA like rest of the country and screening for not only blood donation but also in general should be done to prevent the disease escalation. Due to the high cost of treatment of hepatitis B and C virus infection and the unavailability of a vaccine against HCV, the main focus should be on preventive aspects.

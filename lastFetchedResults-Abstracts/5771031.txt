This paper studies an application of a bidirectional transmission system in which a single-mode optical fibre line and a free-space optics line are directly connected without any photoelectric devices. An optical wireless transmission is realized between both sides of a windowpane passing a laser beam through the pane. An automatic optical-axis alignment system has newly developed to align the laser beam by screw-driven adjustment mechanism. Up to 4 Gbit/s transmission has successfully been achieved with high quality at 1310 and 1550 nm wavelengths.

The main objective of this contribution is a new development of the continuous-time generalised predictive control (CGPC) resulting in a Youla-based CGPC design procedure for both minimumphase and nonminimum-phase uncertain SISO systems. The derived design procedure consists of two steps. In the first step nominal stability and nominal performance of the control system are established by using a fully analytical design methodology, based on a collection of closed-loop prototype characteristics with definite time-domain specifications. In the second step, the primary structure of the CGPC controller is suitably enriched by `YoulaÂ´ blocks guaranteeing that the resulting CGPC control system has the required robustness properties, i.e. robust stability and robust performance.

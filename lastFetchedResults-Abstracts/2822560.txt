This work introduces a new Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Modular Multilevel dc-dc Converter (MIMO-MMC). The proposed topology has a bidirectional structure and may be utilized in both low and high power applications ranging from approximately 100W to 10MW. The modular structure of the MIMO-MMC enables efficient component utilization through module voltage and current sharing capabilities. The topology can supply or extract regulated power from &#956; controllable voltage nodes without requiring source or load multiplexing, resulting in minimized filtering requirements. The MIMO-MMCÂ´s structure is described, and the steady state operation of the converter is theoretically analyzed. Based on the derived dynamic model of the converter, an effective control algorithm is proposed. The steady-state operation and dynamic response of the converter is investigated through both simulation and experiment.

A multi-user downlink MIMO-OFDM scheme is considered. Perfect channel knowledge is assumed at the base station and linear processing is used at both the transmit and receive sides. The objective is to optimize the mean BER of the system while satisfying a transmit power constraint and fulfilling each userÂ´s rate. FDMA and SDMA are investigated. We show how the multi-user interference induced by SDMA can be annihilated and exhibit that this multiple access technique should be preferred to FDMA.

A research project involving the development of a knowledge-based expert system for building design is currently being undertaken by the author in the Department of Architecture, University of Western Australia. The project's objective is to explore the use of portable, easy-to-use knowledge-based expert systems that use the knowledge of experienced architects to assist lessexperienced architects formulate well-resolved building design concepts.
The system, called HYPEREX (HYPEREXpert) differs from other building-related expert systems in two significant ways. First, it deals with the design of buildings as entireties rather than small, non-integrated parts of buildings. Second, it is developed from one of the simplest and most practical computer environments presently available, namely HyperCard.
The paper introduces the overall objectives and scope of the research. A generic framework for an expert system to aid in the establishment of overall building design is proposed. A means for implementing the generic framework using Hypercard, in the form of the HYPEREX system, is presented followed by an example of the application of HYPEREX to the design of primary schools.

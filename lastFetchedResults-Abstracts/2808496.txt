The electric vehicles battery swap station(BSS) as an important charging infrastructure has been built in many countries. The smart energy management system (EMS) is essential for economic operation for BSS with multi-energy. The proposed BSS-EMS is composed by charging demand forecasting module and BSS optimal charging scheduling module. An example study is carried out to validate the proposed EMS. The results indicate that the proposed multi-objective optimal charging model can significantly reduce both the charging cost and load variance approximately 40% compared to uncontrolled charging due to the charging load forecasting.

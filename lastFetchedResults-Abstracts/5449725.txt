The objective of this study is to put forth mapping potential of Orbview-3 panchromatic image in Zonguldak test-field. Panchromatic image of Orbview-3 with 1 m GSD (Ground Sampling Distance is selected for the study since OrbView-3 is a new-generation and low-cost high resolution remote sensing satellite). Zonguldak is an important test-field for geometric and semantic analysis of geospatial applications of remote sensing imageries and it is evaluated for DEM (Digital Elevation Model) generation and validation, and information content analysis for topographic mapping. The result of this study is that the information content of OrbView-3 panchromatic imagery is not satisfactory for the generation of 1:5000 scale topographic maps. However, the available information contents are able to support the 1:10000 scale topographic maps production.

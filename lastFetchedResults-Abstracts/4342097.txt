The objective of this paper is to consider the opportunities and the barriers for establishing regional power exchanges in South Eastern Europe (SEE) with an emphasis on a Regional Power Exchange in the Mini-region comprising of the following four countries: Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. The main driver for establishment of a Regional Power Exchange is to facilitate the integration of the Miniregion into the SEE regional electricity market. The final goal is to enable the Mini-region to join the Internal European Energy Market. The approach implemented in this paper includes a gap analysis of the differences between current organization of the three market timeframes in the countries of the Mini-region, the regional developments in the SEE region and the EU Target Market Model.

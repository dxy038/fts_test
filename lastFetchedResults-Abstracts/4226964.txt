In this paper a precompensator (input shaper) for controlling the position and the swing of a pneumatic pendulum system is presented. The main objective of the applied control scheme is to achieve precise final positioning and swing suppression during the system\´s movement. The suggested "input-shaper controller" is contrasted in experimental studies with several conventional control algorithms in a prototype pneumatic setup. The system\´s response reflects the efficacy of the applied scheme, where it is shown that proper tuning of the controller\´s parameters is needed.

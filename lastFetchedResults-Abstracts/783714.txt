Objective Stress plays an important role
in the etiology of mental and physical disorders. The
effect of stress on health may be moderated by how
people deal with stress. The objectives of this analysis
were to (1) estimate the population proportions using
various ways of dealing with stress in healthy people,
in people with mental disorders and substance
dependence and in individuals with general medical
conditions only, and (2) identify factors associated
with ways of dealing with stress. Methods Data
from the Canadian Community Health Survey,
Mental Health and Well-being (CCHS-1.2) were used
(n = 36,984). This was a national mental health survey
which used a probability sample and incorporated
a version of the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview. Results Participants with mental disorders
differed from healthy people in ways of dealing with
stress. Among participants with mental disorders,
women were more likely to report that they ‘‘talk to
others’’ and ‘‘eat more/less’’ to deal with stress. Men
were more likely to use ‘‘avoid people’’ and ‘‘drink
alcohol’’ to deal with stress than women. Age differences
within groups in ways of dealing with stress
were found and having a history of mental disorders
was also associated with reported ways of dealing with
stress. Conclusions Ways of dealing with stress differ
by gender and age, but there is no over-arching pattern
of maladaptive coping associated with mental
disorders that applies across illness, age and gender
categories. Healthy behaviors should be promoted as
ways to relieve stress, leading to better self-care skills

We investigate the trade-off between delay and signal quality in adaptive time-segmentation for speech coding. A variable rate sinusoidal coder with adaptive segmentation and bit allocations is proposed and implemented with specifiable look-ahead. Objective and subjective results indicate that adaptive time-segmentation is advantageous even with low delay (30 ms), and that quality only increases with the delay until approximately 100 ms.

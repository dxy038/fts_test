The objective of the proposed project is to develop a wheelchair equipped with embedded speech and vision based support system for the physically challenged people who include impairment in hands, legs and eyes (they can be able to speak and hear). It is a low cost system which includes a DSP processor enabled with speech and image processing algorithms to support and control the mechanical parts of the wheelchair in an efficient and controlled manner. The system can be implemented in old-age home, schools for physically challenged and hospitals.

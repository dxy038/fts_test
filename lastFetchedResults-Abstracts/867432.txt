In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization for multi-objective job shop scheduling problem. The objective is to simultaneously minimize makespan and total tardiness of jobs. By constructing the corresponding relation between real vector and the chromosome obtained by using priority rule-based representation method, job shop scheduling is converted into a continuous optimization problem. We then design a Pareto archive particle swarm optimization, in which the global best position selection is combined with the crowding measure-based archive maintenance. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a set of benchmark problems and the computational results show that the proposed particle swarm optimization is capable of producing a number of high-quality Pareto optimal scheduling plans.

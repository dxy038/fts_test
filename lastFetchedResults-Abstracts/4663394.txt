The goal of risk assessment of reliability performance is to provide a view of risks to reliability based on historic performance. The objective is to integrate many ongoing efforts underway providing technical analysis and feedback on risk attributes and reliability trends to stakeholders, regulators, policymakers and industry. This assessment requires advanced development and understanding of risk attributes impacting reliability performance and the corresponding metrics that provide insight to the performance of the bulk power system.

Nowadays, a new paradigm is emerging: the challenging integration of Peer-to-Peer into mobile Ad hoc networks (MANETs). In this context, this paper proposes a new distributed lookup protocol for mobile P2P networks. Its main objective is to reduce the overhead traffic and the lookup delay. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme has an improved performance in comparison with the popularly used Chord protocol and its extension, the Backtracking Chord protocol.

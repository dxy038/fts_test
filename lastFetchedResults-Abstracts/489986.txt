The objective of this study was to investigate the cffect feeding rainbow trout larvae with HUFA and vitamin C-enriched Artemia urmiana nauplii in an- one week period. For this purpose, 4 feeding treatments were applied to rainbow trout larva (with average weight of 120.43±13.5 mg) as follows. 1) artificial food 2) newly hatched Artemia 3) enriched Artemia 4) 10% enriched Artemia and 90% artificial food .After one week experiment, all groups of fish were switched to the commercial diet for an additional 3 week period to determine if any early benefits in weight gain were sustained when fish were switched to pelleted. In the first week and end of experiment, results showed that growth of larva in various treatments were significantly different (P<0.05) After 4 weeks, the larva in treatment 3 with the average weight of 657.50±57.93 mg had the highest body weight (P<0.05). The highest percentage of survival (96%) was observed in treatment 3 (P<0.05). investigate of proximate compositions of trout larvae in the first week showed that the protein and total lipids in the body of larvae had significant differences between treatments (P<0.05). The highest crud lipid was observed in treatment 1 and the crud protein in the larvae of treatment 3 and 4 was significantly different compared to other treatment groups (P<0.05).

In many financial firms, providing high-quality products at the lowest cost is one of their main objectives. Obtaining these two objectives simultaneously with each other in many cases are not possible. In this paper, an integrated bi-objective mathematical model to determine flow of products throughout dynamic supply chain in levels of production, distribution and market is presented. The goal of proposed model is to minimize purchasing, transformation and holding costs of products and to maximize purchasing high quality products. Finally, to evaluate the proposed model using ?-constraint method as an optimization approach for multi-objective problems, an example for an army organization is solved.

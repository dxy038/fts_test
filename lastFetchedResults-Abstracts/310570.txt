Objective. To provide data on the normal distribution of cartilage thickness in the knee joints of old-aged individuals.

Design. The accuracy and reproducibility of cartilage thickness measurements were evaluated with A-mode ultrasound, and the cartilage thickness distribution was examined throughout both knee joints of nine individuals aged between 62 and 94 yr.

Background. Data on the variation of cartilage thickness in the joint surfaces are relevant for the design of computer models of diathrodial joints and for surgical and arthroscopic procedures, particularly the calculation of cartilage material properties from indentation tests.

Methods. A 12.5 MHz A-mode ultrasound transducer was used, and after determining the accuracy and reproducibility of the system in comparison with CT arthrography and anatomical sections, the cartilage thickness was measured throughout the knee at 256 coordinate points.

Results. A-mode ultrasound yields results consistent with established methods. The cartilage thickness is distributed regularly in the knee-joint of older individuals. However, the absolute values are considerably lower than those previously reported for younger people, the mean (and maximal) thickness being 2.0 mm (3.3 mm) in the patella, 1.9 mm (3.3 mm) in the femur, and 1.9 mm (3.5 mm) in the tibia.

Conclusion. If the results of computer models or surgical strategies are to be applied to the demographically important group of older individuals, the typical distribution of articular cartilage thickness in this group should be taken into consideration.

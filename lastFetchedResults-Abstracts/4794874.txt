This paper presents an analytical method to analyze the motion of the steering trapezium and obtains the inner and outer steering wheel character. The effects of the steering trapezium parameter changing on the Ackerman steering characteristic studied, taking the ideal Ackerman angle as objective function and the vehicle´s available space as constraint condition respectively, under the constraint obtaining the property steering trapezium parameter. The results indicate, after optimization, the parameters of optimization improve the performance of race car´s steering characteristic which reduces tire wear and improves handling and safety.

Analysis of aggregate demand curves of the electrical system of Santa Fe province - Argentina, we see that their behavior imposes permanent increase infrastructure transformer capacity at the points of interconnection between the transmission system and the subtransmission / distribution. The objective of this work is to implement Active Demand Management techniques (ADM) applied to electrical system in the smart grid framework. This is an important resource for improving efficiency in the planning and operation of transmission and distribution networks. Both objectives require analysis aimed at determining the relationship between power flows through the lines and transformers, against the demands that define these levels. It also presents the results of the application of ADM with the main objective to have in the Control Center Operations a tool to prevent unplanned outages.

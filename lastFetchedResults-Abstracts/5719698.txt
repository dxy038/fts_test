In mobile ad hoc networks (or MANETs) devices usually rely on batteries, so the lifetime of these networks highly depends on the energy consumption of the devices composing them. In this paper, we improve the performance of the adaptive enhanced distance based broadcasting algorithm, AEDB, as well as we optimize it using a hybrid multi-objective algorithm, CellDE. The optimization is done by maximizing the coverage achieved by the broadcast process while minimizing at the same time both, the energy consumption and the broadcast time. CellDE provides a wide range of different solutions for the configuration of AEDB, outperforming all of them the performance of the protocol using the original configuration.

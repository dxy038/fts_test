Background: Gonadotropin releasing hormone conjugate (GnRH-BSA) raises
antibodies against biologically active gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) which
affects body weight, gonadosomatic indices (GSI) and sperm quality in male mice.
Objective: The objective of this experimental investigation is to develop an effective
and reliable hormonal immunocontraceptive vaccine to suppress spermatogenesis by
using GnRH-BSA conjugate.
Materials and Methods: Forty sexually mature mice, Mus musculus were divided into
two groups of twenty each. Group 1, served as control, while group 2 were immunized
at monthly intervals for four times against GnRH with a GnRH-BSA conjugate (50 ?g)
with aqueous adjuvant (Freund's adjuvant). After 30 days of each immunization, body
weight, GSI and sperm quality were observed in the immunized groups and compared
with the control group.
Results: Body weight showed alterations in immunized animals as compared to control.
However, GSI, sperm motility, sperm count and sperm morphology were significantly
decreased in immunized animals throughout the experimental investigation and these
effects were more prominent and significant in the later part of the experiment.
Conclusion: These results suggested that the active immunization against GnRH
produced bioeffective antibodies as indicated by significant reduction in GSI level and
sperm quality and induced infertility in male mice.

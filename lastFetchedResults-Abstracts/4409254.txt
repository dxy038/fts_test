Network virtualisation has received attention as a way to allow for sharing of physical network resources. Sharing resources involves mapping of virtual nodes and links onto physical nodes and links respectively, and thereafter managing the allocated resources to ensure efficient resource utilisation. In this paper, we apply artificial neural networks for a dynamic, decentralised and autonomous allocation of physical network resources to the virtual networks. The objective is to achieve better efficiency in the utilisation of substrate network resources while ensuring that the quality of service requirements of the virtual networks are not violated. The proposed approach is evaluated by comparison with two static resource allocation schemes and a reinforcement learning-based approach.

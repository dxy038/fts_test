One of the primary goals of future wireless networks is to maximize system performance under various quality of service (QoS) constraints to compensate for the exorbitant growing demand of wireless applications. However, due to interference and time varying channel characteristics, the promised throughputs are seldom reached. Good scheduling schemes coupled with link adaptation mechanisms can effectively harness the precious resource and achieve higher network performance. The objective of this paper is to integrate opportunistic scheduling policy with a link adaptation algorithm for TDMA air interface under heterogeneous traffic conditions. The performance study is carried out using simulation analysis. It is observed that, this integrated QoS framework is jointly adaptive to traffic and to transmission quality in order to improve the radio resource utilization and the achievable throughput of cellular networks

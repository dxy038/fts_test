The objective of this work is to use laboratory rapid solidification techniques to predict microstructures in AISI 304 produced during industrial processes. Two quenching methods have been employed to obtain a wide range of undercooling and microstructures: single roller melt spinning onto a copper wheel and casting into a conic mould. The experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions by using appropriate thermophysical parameters for the melt calculated with Thermocalc software while the dendrite tip temperature for ferrite and austenite phases is computed within the phase selection theory by means of a code written in MATLAB language.

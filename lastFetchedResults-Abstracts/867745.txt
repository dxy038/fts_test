We consider resource allocation scheduling with learning effect in which the processing time of a job is a
function of its position in a sequence and its resource allocation. The objective is to find the optimal
sequence of jobs and the optimal resource allocation separately. We concentrate on two goals separately,
namely, minimizing a cost function containing makespan, total completion time, total absolute differences
in completion times and total resource cost; minimizing a cost function containing makespan, total
waiting time, total absolute differences in waiting times and total resource cost. We analyse the problem
with two different processing time functions. For each combination of these, we provide a polynomial
time algorithm to find the optimal job sequence and resource allocation.

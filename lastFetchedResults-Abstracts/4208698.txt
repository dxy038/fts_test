This paper examines the feasibility of deploying a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system to support the mobile user objective system requirements. The primary goal of the study was to develop a LEO constellation that could support continuous global voice and data communications to cellular telephone-like handsets while minimizing the use of high-cost/high-risk technology. Various system trade-offs are presented that address issues such as the user-to-spacecraft link performance, spacecraft and constellation design, and ground segment characteristic

Infiltration is the most important and difficult property in evaluation of surface irrigation systems. The importance of knowing infiltration equation for interpretation of surface irrigation hydraulic and difficulties of accurate estimation of infiltration parameters led to consuming time and cost in designing irrigation systems. In fact, the objective of this study was to present a new developed method for estimating Philip infiltration equation parameters by using two points of advance phase and compare this method with Elliott and Walker two-point method, Benami and Ofen advance method, Shepard et al. and Valiantzas et al. one-point methods. For this purpose, seven data sets measured in the field under different conditions e.g. length, slope and discharge flow were used. By using Hydrodynamic model (SIRMOD software) and estimated infiltration equation parameters by different 5 methods above, advance and recession phases were simulated in order to investigate the accuracy of estimated infiltration equation parameters. The results showed that developed method in this study had the lowest error (4.8%) for border irrigation and Shepard et al. (13.9%) and developed (14.2%) methods had the lowest error for fUrrow irrigation in estimating total infiltrated volume. Benami and Ofen (19.5%), and developed (6.6%) methods had the lowest standard error in prediction of advance phase for furrow and border irrigations, respectively. Whereas in prediction of recession phase, Shepard et al. and developed methods had the best accuracy for furrow and border irrigations, respectively.

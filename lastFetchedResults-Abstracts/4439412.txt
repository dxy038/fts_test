Recordings have been performed with a CMOS-based microelectrode array (MEA) featuring 11´016 metal electrodes and 126 channels, each of which comprises recording and stimulation electronics for extracellular, bidirectional communication with electrogenic cells. The important features of the device include (i) high spatial resolution at (sub)cellular level with 3´200 electrodes per mm<sup>2</sup> (diameter 7 mum, pitch 18 mum), (ii) a reconfigurable routing of the electrodes to the 126 channels, and (iii) low noise levels. Recordings from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes forming confluent layers and microtissues are shown. Moreover, signals from dissociated rat hippocampal neurons and from neurons in an acute cerebellar slice preparation are presented.

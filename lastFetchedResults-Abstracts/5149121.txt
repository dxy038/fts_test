Image understanding concerns the issues of how to facilitate interpretation of images. The work reported here is in support of a novel approach for machine interpretation of soil chromatograms. A chromatogram image is obtained from an alkaline solution of silver nitrate and soil. The patterns in the chromatogram contain information of mineral contents in the soil. We describe a combination of different methods for feature extraction. The objective is to segment the image into three regions, and measure the colour and dimension of different bands. The extracted features are used for image matching in a case based reasoning system.

Objective The aim of this study was to determine
how adolescent, parent, family and stress factors
and parental psychopathology are associated with
self-reported emotional and behavioral problems in
Turkish immigrant adolescents.Methods Multiple logistic
models were fitted to determine the associations between
problems, assessed by the Youth Self-Report
(n=363), and determinants, derived from the Turkish
Immigrant Assessment Questionnaire and the General
Health Questionnaire-28 filled in by parents. Results Repeating
a grade,not living with both parents, remarriage
and death or serious health problems in the family were
associated with higher YSR scores. Support from the
motherâ€™s family was of major importance.The strongest
predictive power was found for family-related factors in
boys and for parent-related factors in girls. Conclusions
Cultural aspects and post-immigration issues play an
important underlying role in explaining problem behavior
in Turkish immigrant adolescents. Future research
should include additional immigrant-specific
factors, e. g., acculturation-related issues, preferably in a
longitudinal study design to gain more insight into the
complex relationship between immigrant status and
psychopathology

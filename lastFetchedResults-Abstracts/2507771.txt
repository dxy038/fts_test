Background: Effects of electromagnetic felds on healing have been investigated
for centuries. Substantial data indicate that exposure to electromagnetic feld can lead
to enhanced healing in both soft and hard tissues. Helmholtz coils are devices that
generate pulsed electromagnetic felds (PEMF).
Objective: In this work, a pair of Helmholtz coils for enhancing the healing process in periodontitis was designed and fabricated.
Method: An identical pair of square Helmholtz coils generated the 50 Hz magnetic
feld. This device was made up of two parallel coaxial circular coils (100 turns in each
loop, wound in series) which were separated from each other by a distance equal to the
radius of one coil (12.5 cm). The windings of our Helmholtz coil was made of standard
0.95mm wire to provide the maximum possible current. The coil was powered by a
function generator.
Results: The Helmholtz Coils generated a uniform magnetic feld between its
coils. The magnetic feld strength at the center of the space between two coils was 97.6
?T. Preliminary biological studies performed on rats show that exposure of laboratory
animals to pulsed electromagnetic felds enhanced the healing of periodontitis.
Conclusion: Exposure to PEMFs can lead to stimulatory physiological effects on
cells and tissues such as enhanced healing of periodontitis.

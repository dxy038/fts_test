Dome structures are elegant and economical structures used for covering
large areas. In this paper, an optimum topology design is performed using the Colliding
Bodies Optimization (CBO) method and its enhanced version (ECBO). The Schwedler
and ribbed domes are studied determining the optimum number of rings, the optimum
number of joints in each ring, the optimum height of crown, and tubular sections of these
domes. The minimum volume of each dome is taken as the objective function. A simple
procedure is dened to determine the congurations of Schwedler and ribbed domes. This
procedure includes calculation of the joint coordinates and element constructions. The
design constraints are implemented according to the provision of LRFD-AISC. First, a
comparative study for domes using dierent algorithms is carried out, and then the eect
of choosing dierent number of joints in each ring on the optimal topology is investigated
for Schwedler domes to verify the suitability of design procedure and to demonstrate
eectiveness of the ECBO.

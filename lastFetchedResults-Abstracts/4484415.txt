The passivation layer of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> on the p-type CZ silicon wafers were carried out using a thermal ALD (atomic layer deposition), with the objective of realizing an industrial version of the PERL (passivated emitter, rear locally diffused) cells. The experiments were performed on bare wafers and device-like structures which have a textured front surface, phosphorus doped emitter, and antireflection coating layer. Different lifetime characteristics were shown with surface state depending on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and SiN<sub>x</sub> deposition. In the case of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/SiN<sub>x</sub> stacked layers on bare wafer, measured maximum minority carrier lifetime and implied voltage were 600 &#956;s and 750mV, respectively. Maximum minority carrier lifetime and implied voltage for emitter sheet resistance of 100&#937;/sq are 109 &#956;s and 679mV before patterning and 88 &#956;s and 673mV after patterning, respectively.

Planning and design of infrastructures is a complicated process, which is caused by the complexity of the subject matter. The theory of complex adaptive systems offers insights that can be of use in the design process. However, translating theory into practice is difficult. Gaming is proposed as a tool to bridge this gap by simulating complex adaptive systems. The objective of the paper is to analyze whether gaming can simulate the behavior of a complex adaptive system. We use the game SimPort-MV2 as a case study. Based on this example, we conclude that games can simulate complex adaptive systems. However, we raise specific concerns about the validity of the outcome and use of the game.

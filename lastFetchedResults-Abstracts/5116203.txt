With the objective to release solutions which can be easily manageable by their final users, including older users, we worked to design methods and devices which rely on a minimal set-up for monitoring and rehabilitation of balance and mobility. A single inertial sensing unit, typically worn on the trunk, was hence engineered to accomplish for activity monitoring and event detection (including fall detection), tremor rejection, instrumented clinical tests (e.g. stabilometry, Timed-Up and Go), and sensory biofeedback (audio, visual or tactile). The sensing unit is wirelessly connected with a processing unit, which can in turn act as a gateway to remote applications or caregivers. Promising results were obtained, which may pave the way to novel intensive and pervasive neurorehabilitation strategies.

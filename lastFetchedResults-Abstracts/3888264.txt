A laboratory implementation of a fuzzy logic-tracking controller using a low-cost Motorola MC68HC11E9 microprocessor is described in this paper. The objective is to design the most optimal yet practical controller that can be implemented and marketed and which gives respectable performance, even when the system loads, inertia, and parameters are varying. A distinguishing feature of this work is the by-product goal of developing a marketable, simple, functional, and low-cost controller. The proposed fuzzy-logic controller (FLC) is inherently robust and is based on simple rules that are derived from engineering and experimental results. Several test cases have been conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The results indicate excellent tracking performance for both speed and position trajectories. For the purpose of comparison, a bang-bang controller has been tested. The FLC performs significantly better than the traditional bang-bang controller. The bang-bang controller has been shown to be relatively inaccurate and lacking in robustness. A description of the implementation hardware system is also given

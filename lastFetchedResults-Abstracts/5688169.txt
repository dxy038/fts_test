This paper proposes a novel semi-dynamic inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) scheme for multi-cell OFDMA systems. The objective of the novel scheme is to strike a balance between ICI minimization and frequency reuse factor (FRF) maximization. Firstly, we divide cell-edge users into non-overlapping user groups based on users´ geometry, and classify each group´s available bandwidth, which includes both orthogonal resource and non-orthogonal resource, into several ranks according to traffic load in neighboring groups. Then, different allocation strategies are applied correspondingly to different ranks of resource. The novel scheme achieves variant complexity and overhead according to traffic load. Simulation results show that the novel scheme can significantly enhance the cell edge throughput and reduce blocking probability, especially for networks with heavy-loaded spots in cell-edge area.

We show how integrated planning of wired and wireless infrastructures can be used to build a QoS-aware broadband infrastructure. The outset is a case study of the municipality of Hals, a rural community in Denmark, where the objective is to establish a broadband infrastructure reaching all households and businesses. Two factors are considered particularly important when designing an infrastructure: the chosen technology must allow for sufficient bandwidth, and the physical network structures must allow for independent paths between any pair of nodes. A final solution is obtained by using fiber to the home for primary connections and fixed wireless access for backup. This is implemented over 15 years, during which temporary solutions ensure sufficient QoS and reliability for all users. These temporary solutions form parts of the final solutions.

An evolutionary algorithm has been developed for the design of diesel engine in order to fulfill present-day and future regulations about pollutant emissions and greenhouse gases. The competitive goals to be achieved in engine optimization are the reduction of emission levels (soot, NOx and HC) and the improvement of specific fuel consumption. They have been taken into account by using a multi-objective approach implemented in a optimization tool called HiPerGEO. The method was applied to the design of a combustion chamber profile and numerical simulations were performed with a modified version of the KIVA3V code to evaluate the fitness values of the solutions. The method allows the optimization with respect to different engine operating conditions, i.e. load and speed values. The required computational time has been reduced by using grid technologies

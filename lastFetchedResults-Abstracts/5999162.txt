The contribution of this paper is to describe the critical path tracing (CPT) algorithm used for delay fault diagnosis. A reconvergent fanout analysis is presented, the objective of which is twofold. Firstly, to reduce the number of critical paths traced during the path tracing, in order to improve diagnosis accuracy. Next, to obtain a reliable diagnosis by considering all the lines which could be at the origin of the observed error

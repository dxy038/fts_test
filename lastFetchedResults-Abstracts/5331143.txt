In recent years, energy storage systems assisted by super capacitor have been widely researched and developed to progress power systems for the electronic vehicles. In this paper, a full-bridge/push-pull circuit-based bidirectional DC-DC converter and its control methods are proposed. From the results of detailed experimental demonstration, the proposed system is able to perform adequate charge and discharge operation between low-voltage high-current super capacitor side and high-voltage low-current side with drive train and main battery. Furthermore, conduction losses and voltage/current surge are drastically reduced by ZVS operation with loss-less snubber capacitor in high voltage side as well as the synchronous rectification in low-voltage high-current super capacitor side

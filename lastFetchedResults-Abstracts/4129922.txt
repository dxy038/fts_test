Important matters in relation to the AIEE-IRE merger were reviewed at the 30th Forum of Technical Committee Chairmen held in Chicago, October 11. Another subject of debate was the question of research needs of the emerging nations; a third was the quality of the technical papers submitted at the meetings. AIEE President B. R. Teare, Jr., spoke on the continuing education of engineers and the ways in which the new technical society could best achieve this objective. &#8220;Research Needs of the Emerging Nations&#8221; was the title of a paper by Dr. T. O. Paine. A panel headed by Dr. Ernst Weber, President-Elect of IEEE, explained how the IRE professional groups and technical committees function in respect to professional group operation and standards. The forum was called to order by Director D. E. Trucksess of the Technical Operations Department, who introduced the honorary chairman, President Teare.

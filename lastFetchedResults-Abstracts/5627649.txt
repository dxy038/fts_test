In this paper, two novel control strategies are designed and evaluated for a bidirectional DC/DC converter and a 3-stage parallel-interleaved bidirectional converter, for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) energy storage applications. The energy storage system (ESS) combines 2 parallel ultra-capacitor (UC) modules with a bidirectional DC/DC converter, a Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) battery module, and a load module (which includes the inverter and traction motor). The main focus of the proposed control strategy design is to integrate the 2 UCs into the ESS of the HEV, to find a better compromise between the dimensions of the devices, the energy efficiency sharing, the dynamics of the supply, as well as to improve the overall energy storage capability of the system.

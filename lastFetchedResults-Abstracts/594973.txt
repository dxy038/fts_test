Objective: Supracondylar humerus fracture is the most common fracture about the elbow in children. Percutaneous crossed pin fixation of Supracondylar humeral fracture is the most safe and effective method of maintaining skeletal stability in children.Material and Methods: Seventy-one patients were treated for Type III (Gartland) Supracondylar Humerus fracture at Orthopedic Department Hayatabad Medical Complex Post Graduate Medical Institute from January 1999 to December 2001 with follow-up of one year. All fractures were closed fractures.Results: There were 47 boys (66.2%) and 24 girls (33.8%). The age range was 2 years-12 years. The mean age at the start of treatment was 5.4 years. The side of involvement was left in 49 patients (69.1%) and in 22 patients (30.9%) right side was involved. Sixty-one (86%) patients had completed their follow-up. Results were evaluated by Flynn Criteria, 91.8% excellent/good results were obtained.Conclusion: This method provides the greatest skeletal stability and prevents neuro-vascular complications in children, hence giving excellent results.

This paper presents the results and analysis of a study conducted with the objective of investigating the rural household energy consumption in northwest China domestic sector and the environmental emissions associated with it. For this purpose, we used representative rural villages of Loess Hilly Region for case studie. A sample of the households was surveyed, giving due emphasis to energy consumption patterns. As measures to improve the efficiency of energy utilisation.possible alternatives of reduce emissions are considered and analysed through realistic scenarios. Results indicate that one person consumed actually 428.59 kg standard coal and one family with 4.9 persons 2.112 t/y standard coal, which may meet the basic demand of a household. Biofuel consumption with half of the total amount had a serious impact on environment, so did coal with bigger rate. Nevertheless, cleanliness energy was used little. The energy used for cooking and space heating is basic demand to keep existing, it is possessed of most in all consumption. This shows that the level of energy use is lower and the structure is reasonless.

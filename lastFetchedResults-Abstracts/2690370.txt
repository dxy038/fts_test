Energy efficiency (EE) is an important objective in uplink wireless communications due to the limited capacity of batteries in user equipment (UE). In this letter, we propose a scheduling metric to balance the tradeoff between EE and fairness. We consider the scenario in which the access point (AP) serves a subset of UEs when available resources cannot support all of the UEsÂ´ quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Based on the scheduling metric, we propose a suboptimal joint scheduling and resource allocation algorithm that maximizes the system EE. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a good tradeoff between the system EE and fairness.

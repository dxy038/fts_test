The objective of this paper is to present a method to characterize a brain tumor. The authors developed a tumor characterization technique using Marker Controlled Watershed Segmentation method and region property functions using image processing toolbox. The parameters extracted are area, major and minor axis length, eccentricity, orientation, equivdiameter, solidity and perimeter. This method is quite versatile, fast and simple to use. This can be applied to all type of 2D MR Images representing all tumors irrespective of their location in human body and their size. The proposed technique has been simulated on Matlab and results are compared with experimental data obtained from diagnostic centre.

Data manipulation, or algorithmic complexity, is not taken into account adequately in any of the most popular functional size measurement methods. In this paper, we recall some well-known methods for measuring problem complexity in data manipulation and highlight the interest in arriving at a new definition of complexity. Up to now, the concept of effort has always been associated with complexity. This definition has the advantage of dissociating effort and complexity, referring instead to the characteristics and intrinsic properties of the software itself. Our objective is to propose some simple and practical approaches to the measurement of some of these characteristics which we consider particularly relevant and to incorporate them into a functional size measurement method.

Since their inception in the 1960s, fiber sensors have been extensively developed for numerous applications, and they are deployed in increasing number every year. Several fiber sensors have had a major impact on important niche markets. In spite of this success, fiber sensors are having difficulty competing with established conventional sensor markets, and they still represent only a small fraction of the worldÂ´s enormous market. To give them a better edge, several new technologies have been explored in recent years, with the common objective of further improving sensitivity, dynamic range, and stability, as well as reducing size and manufacturing cost.

In this paper, a scheme for an integrated design of fault-tolerant control (FTC) systems for a wind turbine benchmark is proposed, with focus on the overall performance of the system. For that a key performance indicator (KPI) which reflects the economic performance of the system is defined, and the objective of the proposed FTC scheme is to maintain the system KPI in the admissible range in faulty conditions. The basic idea behind this scheme is data-driven design of the proposed fault-tolerant architecture whose core is an observer/residual generator based realization of the Youla parameterization of all stabilizing controllers with an embedded residual generator for fault detection (FD) purpose. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are demonstrated through the wind turbine benchmark model proposed in [1].

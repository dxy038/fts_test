Objective. We discuss the recently increased epidemic of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents in preventive terms and argue that this epidemic represents a failure of primary and secondary interventions.

Methods. We review the current literature regarding the characteristics of adolescents with type 2 diabetes.

Results. The common denominator in patients who develop adolescent-onset type 2 diabetes was extreme obesity with body mass index of 35â€“38 kg/m2, accompanied by family obesity, a diet rich in fat and sedentary lifestyle.

Conclusions. The current epidemic of type 2 diabetes among adolescents demonstrates that failure to prevent obesity at primary and secondary opportunities for intervention leads to the development of associated diseases with significant morbidity and potential mortality. Family education programs are needed to institute gradual, permanent changes in diet and activity.

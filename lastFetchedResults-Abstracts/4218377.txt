In this paper, an Internet based embedded network monitoring system is proposed for renewable energy systems. By using a low cost network communication module (RCM 3700) as a web server, one can achieve better network security, lower power consumption, compact size, and easier to use as compared with a PC based one. Also, Java language is chosen for designing a dynamic webpage to graphically display various real time waveforms of the controlled system for multi-user at the same time. As an illustrative example, a small scale wind power generation system equipped with an EZDSP 2812 controller is adopted for demonstration. In addition, an FPGA EC10 is implemented as a bidirectional communication interface for coordinating the asynchronous data transmission modes. Experimental results from the constructed prototype verify that the proposed monitoring system can indeed achieve the desired function.

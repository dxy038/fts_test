We present a novel concept for an audience voting system for judged sports events. It is based on wireless wearable motion sensors utilizing the natural behaviour of sports spectators -clapping and cheering. This paper describes initial results from a user study that guided our design process. We further present two preliminary prototypes focusing on hardware and design feasibility respectively. Results confirm our assumption that the system does not provide objective results, but has the potential to increase the spectator experience by giving audience members the feeling of being part of the voting process.

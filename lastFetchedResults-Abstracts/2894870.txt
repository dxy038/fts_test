Finger Braille is one of the tactual communication media utilized by deafblind people. Because there is such a small number of non-disabled people who are skilled in Finger Braille, deafblind people can communicate only through an interpreter. The objective of this study is the development of a Finger Braille teaching system between deafblind people and non-disabled people who are not skilled in Finger Braille. The teaching system recognizes the speech of a non-disabled person and displays the associated dot pattern of Finger Braille. The non-disabled person can then dot Finger Braille on the fingers of the deafblind person by observing the displayed dot pattern. In this paper, we adopted the 10 inches and 7 inches Android tablets, and designed the teaching interfaces. The results of the evaluation experiment showed that the change from the 7 inches tablet to 10 inches tablet takes the subjectsÂ´ learning level higher than the change from the 10 inches tablet to the 7 inches tablet, the subjects were proficient in the dotting of Finger Braille after dotting almost 240 characters and could dot Finger Braille accurately, using both the 7 inches and 10 inches tablets.

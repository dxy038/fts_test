Background & Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the status of World's leading universities in Ph.D. students' education and to compare it with Iranian universities applying the approach of educational status evaluation in a research based way.

Methods: Using a systematic review, all documents present in the webs and related links of universities of first 10 countries in Shanghai's Academic Ranking of World Universities were systematically reviewed; information related to Ph.D. education was systematically collected and analyzed.

Results: Reviewing 28 leading universities revealed that the educational model in educating Ph.D. students in 22 of them was research based and the rest are using course based model. Passing taught courses, as an index in course based model, is considered to be among minimum course requirements in most of the universities which are using research based model. In cases where passing such courses is voluntarily, a consultant professor plays a significant role in guiding the students in selecting and attending theoretical courses.

Conclusion: Based on the above explanation and similar to other successful countries, it seems that it is time to create various models for training postgraduate students to meet industrial needs. With revisions in educational curriculums, purposeful attempts should be made to solve possible problems and train people who meet country's developmental needs in regards with the twenty year prospect.

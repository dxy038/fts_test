This paper investigates the applicability of the CSPI reference models in different factory planning scenarios. These scenarios are taken from real industrial use cases. The CSPI reference models are put forward by the CSPI product development group within the simulation interoperability standards organization (SISO). The objective of this group is to facilitate commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) simulation package interoperability (CSPI). The approach to do this is to define and standardize use patterns of the high level architecture (HLA) which is the state-of-the-art standard for distributed simulation. An intermediate step towards this goal is the definition of the interoperability reference models discussed here. They describe typical interoperability problems encountered when connecting different COTS simulation packages. This paper focuses on the first two of these reference models and reports on experiences drawn for their implementation.

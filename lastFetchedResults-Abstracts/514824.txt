Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a widely used method for measuring the dielectric constant (Ka) and bulk electrical conductivity (ca) in soils. The TDR-measured ca and Ka can be used to calculate the soil solution electrical conductivity, (op). A theoretical model describing a linear relationship between bulk electrical conductivity, ca, and dielectric constant, Ka, in moist soil was already presented. By using this linear relationship, the pore water electrical conductivity, cp, can be estimated in a wide range of soil types without soil-specific calibration. The objective of this study was to evaluate the linear model presented previously for TDR. The previous study was on light texture soils but in this study we used clay, clay loam, loam, silty clay and silty clay loam textures. The results showed that the linear model performed well for light texture soils but not

for heavy textures. Such poor result for heavy texture is mainly due to this fact that dielectric constant pore water was lower than 80 which was proposed as default by model. This study showed that for heavy texture soils dielectric constant of pore water is smaller than light textured soils.

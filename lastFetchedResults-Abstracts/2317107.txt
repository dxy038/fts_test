For the purpose of generating meaningful stochastic ensembles of radar estimates of rainfall, a relatively simple and objective method of separating a radar rainfall image into signal and noise is described. An alternative noise field, with the same spectrum as the original noise, can then be simulated and combined with the signal field of each successive image, to generate an ensemble member for performing sensitivity studies. The method is based on identifying the appropriate wavelength in the power spectrum which defines the variance threshold used to separate noise from signal. The algorithm is explained and figures illustrate the efficacy of the procedure.

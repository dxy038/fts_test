Objective
There is probably a relationship between zinc/cupper concentration in individuals
with autism. The present review was written to estimate this probability by using
meta-analysis method.
Martials & Methods
In this meta-analysis of Fixed Effect Model, by searching PubMed, Scopus
and Google scholar databases, 11 articles were selected and verified published
in 1978 to 2012. IÂ² statistics were calculated to examine heterogeneity. The
information was analyzed by R and STATA Ver. 11.2.
Results
Due to non-uniform measurement methods of Zn/Cu concentrations, the
concentration of these elements was measured in various subgroups (plasma,
hair and general) in both study cases and controls. There was a significant
statistical difference between plasma OR=0.252 (95% CI: -0.001-0.504) and
hair OR=0.27(95% CI: 0.059-0.481, P=0.01) concentrations of Zn/Cu statuses
between controls and autistic patients. Using a Fixed Effects Model, the
overall integration of data from the two groups was significant as risk factor
OR=0.31(95% CI:0.16-0.46, P=0.001).
Conclusion
Significant correlation existed between Zn/Cu levels and the development of
autistic disorders in general analysis. Therefore, Zn/Cu levels could be mentioned
as a pathogenesis reason of autism spectrum disorders.

This paper presents a system-of-systems formalism for modeling and analyzing multi-actor policy-making to achieve a global system objective. In contrast to a single optimal solution that aggregates objectives of actors, the concept of iso-performance is employed to illuminate multiple global solutions and hence the `spaceÂ´ for actors to compromise. A case in a policymaking to reduce aviation emissions is presented to demonstrate the approach.

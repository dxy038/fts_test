We consider the problem of designing a logical optical network topology for a given physical topology (or fiber layout) and a given traffic demand matrix between the end-users. Traffic between the end-users is carried in a packet-switched form and the objective of our logical topology design is to minimize the maximum congestion on the logical connections in the logical topology. The logical connections are realized by wavelength continuous paths or lightpaths between end-users and they are routed via wavelength-selective routers. Note that a topology with lower maximum link congestion will allow its traffic demand matrix to be scaled up by a larger factor. In the logical topology each node is equipped with a limited number of optical transceivers, hence logical connections cannot be set up between every pair of nodes. In this paper we present an improved lower bound for maximum congestion on any link In the logical topology. The bound is shown to be up to 50% higher than the existing ones. An analytical model for obtaining the maximum and average logical connection loads for a given logical network and traffic demand matrix is also formulated, and it has been confirmed via simulation. Finally, two heuristic algorithms for constructing a logical topology that reduces maximum logical connection congestion are presented

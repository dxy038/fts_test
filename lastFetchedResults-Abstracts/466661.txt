Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the obstetrical intervention rates and maternal and neonatal outcomes of women with gestational hypertension. Study Design: Induction and operative delivery rates and indices of maternal and neonatal morbidity were determined in women (37-41 completed weeks) with gestational hypertension (n = 979), preeclampsia (n = 165), chronic hypertension (n = 187), and control subjects (n = 11,434) in a retrospective review of St. Joseph's Health Care Perinatal Database from November 1, 1995, to October 31, 1999. Data were analyzed by chi-square test, analysis of variance, Dunnett's t-test, and pairwise chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction. Results: The induction and cesarean delivery rates in gestational hypertension were similar to preeclampsia and chronic hypertension groups and almost double of control subjects. The length of labor and postpartum stays and the incidence of operative vaginal delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, and neonatal intensive care involvement were greater in the gestational hypertension group than in the control subjects. Conclusion: Women with gestational hypertension had obstetrical intervention rates much higher than control subjects and similar to those with preeclampsia and chronic hypertension.

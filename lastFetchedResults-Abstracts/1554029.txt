An efficient numerical method for sensitivity computation of large-scale differential-algebraic systems is developed based on the adjoint method. Issues that are critical for the implementation are addressed. Complexity analysis and numerical results demonstrate that the adjoint sensitivity method is advantageous over the forward sensitivity method for applications with a large number of sensitivity parameters and few objective functions.

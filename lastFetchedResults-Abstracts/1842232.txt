In this work, vertically oriented multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized at 600 Â°C by Electron Cyclotron Resonance Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (ECR-PECVD) on a silicon substrate from Ni catalyst nanoparticles prepared by electrodeposition. Then CNTs were coated with aluminum nitride (AlN) by Metal Organic PECVD (MO-PECVD). The objective of this work is to obtain new nano-composite film based on AlN thin film containing oriented CNTs expected to enhance the thermal transfer compared to a single AlN layer. The final issue is the realization of thermal evacuators for microelectronic devices. Cauliflower-like structures of hexagonal AlN forming a compact thin film well coating vertically aligned CNTs were obtained and structurally characterized.

This paper studies a coverage control problem for multi-vehicle systems where individual agents operate with out dated information about each othersÂ´ locations. Our objective is to understand to what extent this outdated information is still useful and at which point it becomes essential to obtain new, up-to-date information. We propose a self-triggered coordination algorithm based on spatial partitioning techniques with uncertain information and verify its correctness using tools from computational geometry, stability theory, set-valued analysis, and event-based systems.

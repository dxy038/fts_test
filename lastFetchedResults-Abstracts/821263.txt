The main objective in this paper is to create a method for one-dimensional modeling of multi-stage axial flow turbine. The calculation used in this technique is based on common thermodynamics and aerodynamics principles in a main stream line analysis. In this approach, loss models have to be used to determine the entropy increase across each section in the turbine stage. Finally, the analysis and comparisons between the calculated results and experimental data are performed.

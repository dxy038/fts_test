This paper introduces an active electrical technique for dynamic tuning of MEMS resonators. The proposed technique is based on using the resonator output current to generate displacement or acceleration signals by integration or differentiation operations, respectively. The resulting signal is then scaled to generate an appropriate tuning signal. When applied to the resonator through additional signal ports, the tuning signal electrically modifies the equivalent mechanical stiffness or mass of the resonator, thereby tuning the resonance frequency in a bidirectional fashion depending on the polarity of the scaling. This tuning scheme has been applied to a piezoelectric AlN-on-Si BAW square resonator to tune its 14.2 MHz resonance frequency by 22 kHz, equivalent to 1550 ppm. The proposed tuning technique can be applied to a wide range of MEMS resonators and resonant sensors, e.g., to compensate for temperature or process-induced variations in their resonance frequencies.

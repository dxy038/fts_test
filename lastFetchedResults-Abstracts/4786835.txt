This paper describes a system of a dynamic and interactive environment taking inspiration in the 1983 film by David Cronenberg entitled "Videodrome". The movie thereby provides a metaphor for proposing an embodied interface merging video from a physical realm into digital form in real time through an "emotion detector". The main challenge is to detect emotional states of the physical reality and translate them into the digital dimension in real time. The main objective of the project is to test possibilities to turn it into an emotive mutable and permanent membrane for an architectural surface in a near future. This paper also seeks out to reflect on the growing interest in integrating media elements into architecture and how these new emerging principles are creating non traditional material-realities

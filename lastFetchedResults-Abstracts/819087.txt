Abstract

Background and Objective: Pre-eclampsia is the most common cause of maternal and neonatal mortality.  Recent studies show that there may be a relationship between chorionic gonadotropine (HCG) and pre-eclampsia. Thus we aimed at assessing the serum level of BhCG after 28th week of pregnancy in mild pre-eclamptic and healthy pregnant women. 
Material and Methods: In this case-control study, we measured the level of BhCG in 26 pre-eclamptic and 26 normal pregnant women. The difference between groups was analyzed by Mann-Whitney test (P? 0.05).
Results: The mean   of BhCG in the case (73192 ± 42956 IU/L) and control group (34038 ± 21272 IU/L) is different significantly (P= 0.001). Considering mother’s age, gestational age and parity, there is a significant difference between the two groups (P=0.001). 
Conclusion: The results of our study show that the higher level of BhCG, the greater the risk of pre-eclampsia.

The just-in-time production philosophy has led to a growing interest in schedulingproblems considering both earliness and tardiness penalties. Most publications considering these so-called nonregular objective functions are devoted to single machine problems. In the case of multimachine problems, there are some papers dealing with parallel machine problems. However, for multi-operation scheduling problems such as shop scheduling problems, investigations have begun only recently. In this paper, inspired by recent own work (partly yet unpublished), we survey some results on multimachine scheduling problems with a given common due date, where the focus is on possible approaches for shop scheduling problems.

This study presents a topology optimization method to reduce cogging torque, applied to the design of the stator core of an interior permanent magnet motor. The proposed method uses a reaction-diffusion equation and optimization is separately performed based on two objective functions: 1) minimization of the cogging torque itself, for a number of rotor positions; and 2) minimization of the magnetic energy variation. The optimization results show that configurations having dummy slots are desirable, but the number of dummy slots differs according to the objective function used.

The objective of the study was to investigate the thermo-physical properties of meat and carrot based alginate particles as influenced by the formulation variables. A response surface methodology (RSM) was used to study the effect of sodium alginate concentration, calcium chloride concentration and dipping time in the calcium chloride solution, at five levels each, on the thermo-physical properties of the fabricated particles (9 mm in diameter and 9 mm in height). Density was similar for all conditions. Increasing sodium alginate concentration resulted in a significant decrease in the heat capacity and thermal conductivity values. These changes were primarily attributed to the lowering of moisture content of the particles resulting from the treatment. Using RSM, optimum conditions for fabricating particles having similar thermo-physical properties to real foods were obtained as 5.3% and 4.9% sodium alginate, 2.2% calcium chloride and 14.2 and 36.0 h immersion in the calcium chloride solution for meat and carrot alginate particles, respectively.

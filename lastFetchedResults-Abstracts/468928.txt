Objective
The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the maternal administration of therapeutic doses of celecoxib would not affect ductus arteriosus patency or alter renal and hepatic prostanoids in the fetal rabbit.
Study design
Pregnant rabbits received celecoxib from 13 to 20 days (celecoxib-A), from 13-28 days (celecoxib-B), or vehicle from 13 to 28 days by gavage. Fetal serum and lung tissue were analyzed for nitric oxide oxidation products. Fetal plasma, liver, and kidney were analyzed for prostaglandin levels.
Results
The ductus arteriosus was patent in both treatment groups. Celecoxib induced elevations of plasma prostaglandin E2 production. In celecoxib-B liver and kidney, the 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α and prostaglandin F2α levels were increased, and the prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 levels were decreased substantially.
Conclusion
This preliminary evaluation demonstrates that the maternal administration of celecoxib does not influence fetal ductus arteriosus patency adversely in rabbits.

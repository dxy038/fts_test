The use of the Ka-band (30/20 GHz) for broadcasting applications is envisaged for the future, in order to fulfill the needs for higher and higher data rates. A propagation experiment is being carried out in Madrid, Spain, with the objective of characterizing the propagation channel in the downlink sub-band. Propagation results can be related to meteorological data obtained from co-located instruments. Rain attenuation is the main propagation impairment in this band. Its effects are analyzed in detail.

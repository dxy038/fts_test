This paper presents a new bidirectional location based service (LBS) using terrestrial-digital multimedia broadcasting (T-DMB) and wireless communication network. We propose a new bidirectional POI (point-of-interest) application interoperable with TPEG protocol, and introduce the POI data server/client in T-DMB network and the bidirectional TTI contents server/host server in wireless communication network The receiving platform based on laptop computer is connected to T-DMB receiver and CDMA modem simultaneously, and it includes the TPEG decoder implemented by using the proposed protocol. The stability and effectiveness of the proposed protocol is verified through the field test.

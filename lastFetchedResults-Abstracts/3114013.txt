After the great deployment and success of the Wireless Local Area Networks based on access points, which communicate by using wired links, the wireless world saw the birth of new technologies like Ad Hoc networks and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), which permit the flexibility, easy deployment and low cost. The first objective of these networks is to offer a seamless connectivity to mobile users. Nevertheless, wired mobility management protocols perform poorly with these new technologies. In fact, traditional protocols do not permit to have a realistic snap-shot of the network; moreover, we need to propose new approaches to detect clientsÂ´ movements.

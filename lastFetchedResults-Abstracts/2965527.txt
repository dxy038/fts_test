The fading of wireless signals is not a random process, it is deterministic since it is the result of interference between signals following various paths to the receiver. We exploit this deterministic nature of the fading signals and propose a novel approach to communication over the fast fading channels. The key step in this communication system is the prediction of a future block of samples of the fading coefficient from previous observations. This prediction algorithm is closely tied to other important components: feedback from the receiver to the transmitter, transmitter signal optimization, and tracking at the receiver. The objective of this work is to anticipate &#8220;deep fades&#8221;, which severely limit the performance of mobile radio systems. This capability will potentially result in reduced power requirements for wireless channels

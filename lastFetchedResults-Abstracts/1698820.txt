Various interfaces in Zn coated steel are examined for their stability on the basis of two conflicting requirements of minimum deformation at a maximum absorption of shear energy. The shearing process is simulated using a Molecular Dynamics technique and meta-models of both energy and strain are constructed using an Evolutionary Neural Network that itself evolved through a multi-objective Genetic Algorithm. Simultaneous optimization of deformation and energy absorption is conducted with a Predatorâ€“prey Genetic Algorithm and the resulting Pareto frontiers are analyzed and discussed. The findings show good correspondence with existing experimental observations.

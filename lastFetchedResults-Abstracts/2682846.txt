a simulation-based optimization approach for the purpose of finding a near-optimal answer can be efficient and effective. In the present paper, first, the mathematical model for the project activity scheduling problem has been presented with a job shop approach. Then, using the Arena 14 software, the simulation model has been designed. Consequently, a numerical example has been solved via running the model and using variance analysis in order to find a near-optimal answer in terms of earliness profits subtracted by tardiness costs, with the purpose of choosing the best prioritization rule for activities in research teams. In the numerical example, the results reveal that the FCFS method has the highest value of the objective function, and possesses a significant difference from the other methods. After determining the best method, different scenarios regarding the number of resources in the workstations which possess long waiting times have been analyzed, whereby the results show that doubling the number of resources in these workstations can improve the objective function towards a positive output. In addition, the results from the present paper reveal that, contrary to other optimization methods, there is no need for an exact mathematical model in simulation and one can achieve optimal results via a conceptual mathematical model. Therefore, this issue can facilitate the solution of optimization problems, provided that they can be changed to a simulation model.Â

The reliability of a navigation system is one of the critical requirements for air or automotive navigation. In order to increase the reliability of the navigation system, failures or faults resulting from the malfunctions of the system should be detected and repaired to keep the system possessing high integrity. This leads to a need for developing high assurance GPS monitoring system which should be an absolutely necessary part of the system. The particle filter (PF) is a method based on Monte Carlo technique designed for nonlinear and non- Gaussian state estimation. In this paper, the PF is employed to GPS signal integrity monitoring. The primary objective of this research is over the safety in navigation with GPS and possibility that a GPS satellite transmits an erroneous navigation signal to the user. The monitoring system has to provide timely warnings to the user and indicates when it should not be used.

A JERS-1 OPS (Japanese Earth Remote Sensing Satellite, Optical Sensor) image was used to make a methodological surue y of the Mont-Saint-Michel foreshore (West of France). The grain objective was to test different procedures for processing multispectral data between 520 nm and 2400 nin so as to refine the information acquired from other sensors such as Spot XS and Landsat TM which have a lower spectral and spatial discrimination potential. The use of multispectral satellite data enables a rapid reconnaissance of the zone where both. sedimentological and morphological evolution occur according to the tides. The OPS sensor appears able to detect carbonate responses (Channel 6), especially in suspension in the turbid plume of the estuary water. JERS-OPS distinguished clearly between clays, vegetation, and the effect of phenomena likely to perturb their response, mainly moisture characterized by Channel 5.

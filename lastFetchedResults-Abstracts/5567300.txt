This paper addresses the design of sigma-delta modulators with arbitrary signal and noise transfer functions by presenting a genetic algorithm (GA) based search method. The objective function is defined to include the difference D between the magnitude of the frequency responses of the designed transfer functions and the ideal one, the quantizer gain &#955;<sub>critical</sub> for which the poles of the modulator start moving out of the unit circle, and the spread of the coefficients S. Stability can be improved by reducing &#955;<sub>critical</sub> while a smaller S reduces the implementation complexity. A genetic algorithm (GA) searches for poles/zeros of the transfer functions to minimize the objective function D+w<sub>1</sub>*&#955;<sub>critical</sub>+w2*S, where w<sub>1</sub> and w<sub>2</sub> are two weighing factors. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

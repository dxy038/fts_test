Background/Objective: This study was conducted to find out the association between the clinical symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and CT findings.
Patients and Methods: 50 patients with CRS were studied. Their clinical symptoms were recorded according to the sinonasal outcome questionnaire (SNOT-20) and their CT findings were graded by the Lund-Mackay grading system. The Pearson correlation coefficient was assessed between these two scores. Also we used multiple regression models for adjusted association among variables.
Results: The mean±SD of SNOT-20 and the Lund-Mackay score were 45±8.7 (range: 29- 67) and 18.5±5 (range: 8-24), respectively. The mean±SD SNOT-20 score was higher for postnasal drip (PND) and facial pain; the lowest mean scores were for dizziness and ear pain. Pearson's correlation coefficient of SNOT-20 and the Lund-Mackay grading system was 0.74 (p=0.0001). In simple regression analysis considering the Lund-Mackay score as dependent variable and SNOT symptom domains (nasal, oropharyngeal, sleep, facial, and systemic) as independent variables, the best associated clinical symptom domain was the nasal symptom domain (model r^2=0.76; p<0.0001). In the multivariate linear regression model, considering the five symptom domains as independent variables, the model r^2 was 0.8 (p<0.0001) and the only significant variable in the model was the nasal symptom domain (p<0.0001).
Conclusion: Patients with higher symptom scores are more likely to have CT imaging evidence of rhinosinusitis.

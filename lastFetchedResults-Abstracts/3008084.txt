The objective of this paper is to describe a computer communication architecture for an Air Space Management System (ASMS). This system is proposed for the Federal Aviation Administration William J. Hughes Technical Center (FAATC). Three transmission mediums will be used in the transfer and exchange of radar information. The methodology on computer/data communications and computer architecture will be discussed and analyzed. Geography, system topology and other system parameters have determined the computer network architecture best suited for the job. At the conclusion of this proposal a discussion of what would be accomplished by implementing this design, and lessons learned in researching this proposal will be presented.

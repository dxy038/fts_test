In DSM (deep sub-micron) regime, together with the integration density interconnects play a dominant role during layout design of integrated circuits. It eventually increases the importance of global routing problem making it more challenging day by day. To cope up with this ever increasing design complexity, the challenging time faced by researchers provides the important opportunity to explore new ideas to solve it within some reasonable time. Heuristic based approaches are generally used for global routing. Large problem space leads global routing problem to a NP Complete one which is less compatible with modern trends. The proposed multi-objective global routing technique is formulated using fuzzy logic to get rid of the limitations of deterministic approaches. After placement and prior to routing phase a set of guiding information is generated from our approach, which will help routing in subsequent steps. During global routing the decision is taken from a fuzzy logic expert system. A GUI is implemented based on the proposed algorithm which is tested for its feasibility study and experimental validation. Success of our proposed approach will open up an avenue for research in global routing phase.

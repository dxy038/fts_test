Background and objective: Distribution of thinking styles among learners and their relationship with students’ academic performance are of paramount importance. The present research was conducted to evaluate the components of thinking styles and their association with the academic performance of students at Kermanshah University of Medical sciences. 
Materials and Methods: In this correlational study, a total of 400 students were selected as the study sample through stratified random sampling using Morgan table. The instrument for data collection included Sternberg and Wagner Thinking Styles Questionnaire, and the criterion for the students’ academic performance was their mean score. Data were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient and independent t-test.
Results: The findings indicated a significant positive correlation between internal thinking style and academic performance (p=0.03, r=0.15), external thinking style and academic performance (p=0.04, r=0.13), conservative thinking style and academic performance (p=0.003, r=0.21), and liberal thinking style and academic performance of the students (p=0.004, r=0.19). Moreover, the mean score of males (17.65±20.20) was significantly higher than that of the females (15.03±2.88) (p=0.001). 
Conclusion: Given the significant positive relationship between the studied variables, thinking skills are recommended to be taught in order to provide better insights into students’ preferred thinking styles and to promote their academic performance as a result.

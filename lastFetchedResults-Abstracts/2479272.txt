Background and Objective: With a growing interest in organizational factors in occupational safety, many researches have been carried out in relation to a study of the relationship between organizational factors and safety performance in different industries in recent years. According to this, the purpose of the research is to introduce a model for safety performance assessment according to a fuzzy inference system.
Materials and Methods: The study is an applied study with respect to purpose and it is a descriptive modelling study in terms of methodology. In this paper, reviewing research literature, organizational factors affecting the safety performance of industries has been extracted. Subsequently, in order to assess the safety performance in accordance with organizational factors, an inference system was developed according to research literature and experts’ views. Having been developed, the model was implemented in an auto spare part corporation of East Azerbaijan Province.
Results: The findings of the research indicate that the developed model is capable of assessing safety performance in industries, based on which the score of safety performance of industries can be calculated. The application of the model in a cooperation as an experiment site exhibits that the score of safety performance is equal to 0.607; the value is desirable with the membership degree 0.528 and desirable with the membership degree 0.472.
Conclusion: The system of interest in the present study is an instrument to score and can be applied when we want to know the level of company’s and organization’s interest in safety performance. Given the fact that the size of determining factors in safety performance score can be expressed by verbal variables, and on the other hand the variables have internal interactions with one another in that they exert different effect on the score of safety performance at times, the fuzzy inference system is an appropriate instrument for scoring.

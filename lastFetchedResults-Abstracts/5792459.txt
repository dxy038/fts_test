Remote services of machines and industrial plants - especially proactive elements like software distribution, event monitoring and inventory management - are services, which have become a significant competitive edge for machine- and plant manufacturers. Objective of the Service Challenge based Evaluations described in this contribution was to check whether the proactive remote service modules of Siemens´ common Remote Service Platform were sufficiently suited to match the challenges of industrial service; goal of the authors was to systematically innovate them where they didn´t, in order to form a company-wide proactive remote service offering.

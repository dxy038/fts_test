Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study design was used. The sample included 386 pregnant women and their husbands. The instruments used for data collection were interview form, Cranley MFA and PFA scales . The data were analysed statistically using SPSS version 14. 
Results:  Finding revealed that the maternal fetal attachment score for pregnant women was 3.56 ± 0.55 and paternal fetal attachment score was 3.36 ± 0.55. The difference between them was statistically meaningful (p < 0.001). Also variables like planned pregnancy (p < 0.001), interest in husband (p=0.004) , marital satisfaction (p < 0.001) were effective on MFA.

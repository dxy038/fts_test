The effect of a specific set of assigned Walsh functions and the resulting variation in the amplitude, specifically the peak-to-average ratio of the amplitude of the transmit waveform from a base station in a cdma2000 system is studied. An easily implementable algorithm for optimally assigning the Walsh functions, with the objective of minimizing the peak-to-average ratio of the amplitude of the transmit waveform in an operating cdma2000 system is proposed. The use of orthogonal signals as an alternative to the Walsh functions is also considered with respect to the resulting variation in the peak-to-average ratio of the transmitted waveform

An extension of the input-to-state stabilisation (ISS) framework for interconnected systems with parameterised quadratic constraints constitutes the main contributions of this paper. The asymptotically dissipative constraint (ADC), that prescribes an approaching characteristic towards a dissipative-bounded property of input and output profiles, is employed in the extended ISS condition in this work. A partially decentralised model predictive control (DeMPC) scheme engaging offline and online computations for constrained interconnected systems is subsequently developed with the ADC-based stability constraint. Herein, we consider the inter-subsystem communication network that has multiple connection topologies. Demands on the communication links and online data are limited with a perturbed state-feedback strategy, which consists of a state feedback and a perturbation. The state feedback gains are determined in accordance with the communication network topologies and for constraint satisfactions, while the perturbations are calculated by the online optimisations adopting only decoupled objective functions.

Abstract
Introduction: Toxoplasmosis, one of the most common infectious diseases among humans and livestock, with its operating Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoa intracellular parasites, may cause serious infections in humans and animals to be domesticated. Epidemiologic studies show Toxoplasma antibodies in the serum for at least 1/3 adult population in most countries, however, previous infection and spread of organisms represents a broad and powerful contact and ability of Toxoplasma to infect humans.  Serologic tests for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis are often the size of the antibodies used.
Objective: Prevalence of Serum Antibodies (IgM and IgG) Toxoplasma gondii in Guilan by ELISA Method
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive and analytical study, 800 sera of individuals referred to the medical diagnostic laboratories in Guilan in 1391 were randomly selected, and using ELISA, IgG and IgM antibodies against Toxoplasmosis were measured.
Results: Based on the results of total 800, of the 301 men and 499 women, 261 (62/32 percent) had IgG antibody against a Toxoplasmosis of IgM antibody and all were negative. Population of men (9/87percent) and women (22/75%) of IgG antibody were detected. Using chi square test, no significant relationship was found between antibody prevalence and age, sex, job location and no history of contact with pets.
Conclusion: The results confirm the necessary test to diagnose toxoplasmosis. Promotion of health awareness among people can also reduce the risk of toxoplasmosis.

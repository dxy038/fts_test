A number of calculations have been done using both kinetic and equilibrium mathematical models which describe the phenomena occurring during the condensation of multicomponent mixtures. Two limiting cases of the condensate flow have been assumed for each model: (1) segregated flow, and (2) ideally mixed flow. The cocurrent and countercurrent flows of vapour and condensate along the condenser have been taken into account. For each case, the interfacial state variables (temperature and composition), the final degree of condensation, the composition of the liquid and gas phases, and the length of the condenser for various coolant temperatures have been calculated. The enrichment of the vapour phase with the most volatile component has been shown as a function of the final degree of condensation, as well as the temperature of the coolant. The main objective of the paper is therefore to make a comparison between the mathematical models (kinetic and equilibrium) for the two limiting cases of the condensate flow. Based on the results obtained, the cocurrent condensation has been compared with that occurring during the countercurrent flow of the vapour and liquid phases.

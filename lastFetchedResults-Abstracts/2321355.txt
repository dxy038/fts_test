In the past recent centuries, some research projects have been conducted on the influence of the West on the East (History), but such investigations have not often been scientific (Problem); consequently, tracing the roots of the extent and methods of the influences of the West on the East have not been scientifically answered (Background). The present research seeks to answer this fundamental question that how globalization caused the emergence of the discourse of salafi-jihadi political Islam in the Middle East region (Question)? By increasing the crisis of meaning, globalization has led to the strength of the discourse of salafi-jihadi political Islam in the Middle East region (Hypothesis). The present article seeks to discover how the discourse of salafi-jihadi political Islam of Daesh and Jibhat al-Nusrah emerged (Objective). The present research, which is conducted based on the discourse analysis method, shows that how globalization in the Middle East region increases the necessity of searching for false meaning by challenging dominant identities. Salafism is also among the answers which are given to these needs. By making these meaning exclusive to themselves, and by focusing on concepts like shariah, leadership, jihad, returning to predecessor (salaf), and confronting secularism, they seek to create identities which are apparently strong, but instead of creating integrity and protecting the people against the apparently hostile external world, they destroy resistant Islam (Findings).

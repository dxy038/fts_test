This paper presents a new algorithm for fairing planar cubic B-spline curves. Target curvature plots prescribed by designers according to design intent are used to identify bad points and bad curve segments. The corresponding control points are then modified using local constrained optimization. The objective function is a weighed combination of two components, which are associated with the fairness in the sense of energy minimization and the coherence to the original design, respectively. Hence, designers have more control over the fairing process by using appropriate weights for the two components. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

In this paper, new optimal power flow (OPF) techniques are proposed based on multiobjective methodologies to optimize active and reactive power dispatch while maximizing voltage security in power systems. The use of interior point methods together with goal programming and linearly combined objective functions as the basic optimization techniques are explained in detail. The effects of minimizing operating costs, minimizing reactive power generation, and/or maximizing loading margins are then compared in both a 57-bus system and a 118-bus system, which are based on IEEE test systems and modeled using standard power flow models. The results obtained using the proposed mixed OPFs are compared and analyzed to suggest possible ways of costing voltage security in power systems.

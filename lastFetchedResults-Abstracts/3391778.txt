Block-based motion compensation has been widely used for the removal of temporal redundancy existing in image sequences. However, the prediction image generated by this technique suffers from a perceptually annoying blocking-effect. This becomes especially serious in video transmission at very low bit rates. To overcome this problem, a transformed block-based motion compensation technique is proposed in this paper. Preliminary results show that both subjective and objective improvements can be obtained when a transformed block-based motion compensation scheme is employed instead of a direct block-based scheme.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

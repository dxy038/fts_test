Numerous problems encountered in real life cannot be actually formulated as a single
objective problem; hence the requirement of Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) had arisen several
years ago. Due to the complexities in such type of problems powerful heuristic techniques were needed,
which has been strongly satisfied by Swarm Intelligence (SI) techniques. Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) has been established in 1995 and became a very mature and most popular domain in SI. Multi-
Objective PSO (MOPSO) established in 1999, has become an emerging field for solving MOOs with
a large number of extensive literature, software, variants, codes and applications. This paper reviews
all the applications of MOPSO in miscellaneous areas followed by the study on MOPSO variants in
our next publication. An introduction to the key concepts in MOO is followed by the main body of
review containing survey of existing work, organized by application area along with their multiple
objectives, variants and further categorized variants.

Our objective was to determine the influence of postharvest vapour heat treatment (VHT) on qualitative and quantitative measurement of aroma volatiles during fruit ripening in mango (cv. Chausa) using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). VHT (48 °C for 20 min) accelerated the process of fruit ripening leading to edible-soft stage within 4 days after heat treatment against 8 days in control. Reversible inhibition of aroma volatiles emission was observed in heat-treated fruit, with a significant alteration in aroma volatiles profiles at different stages of fruit ripening. The heat-induced increase in the rate of fruit ripening proceeded with a significant lag in the emission of aroma volatiles. The suppression of aroma volatiles at ripe stage in heat-treated fruit might adversely impact the consumer acceptance of fruit.

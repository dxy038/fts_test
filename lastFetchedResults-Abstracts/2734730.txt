This study discusses the feasibility of a reference-tracking task of ankle-joint exercise with interactive sonification for sighted and blind individuals in terms of both objective and subjective evaluations via our wearable auditory biofeedback device using the instrumented ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) called GaitEcho. Our experimental results suggest it offers similarly adequate functionality for both blind and sighted participants.

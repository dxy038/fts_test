Digital controller algorithms are presented in this paper which allows detecting DCM and CCM operations without instantaneous or cycle by cycle sensing and sampling of inductor current. The presented control scheme also allows the estimation on output inductor value, the peak inductor current value and other information on converter operations. The objective is to estimate all of this information from the input current with low speed sensing without feeding any constants to the controller. The presented controller does not depend on sensing the input voltage, the load current, or any other information of the converter design. The presented algorithms are discussed and analyzed.

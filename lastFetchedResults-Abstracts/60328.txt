We introduce a public key encryption scheme that is based on additive mixing of a message with chaotic nonlinear dynamics. A high-dimensional dissipative nonlinear dynamical system is distributed between transmitter and receiver. The transmitter dynamics is public (known to all) and the receiver dynamics is private (known only to the authorized receiver). Bidirectional signals that couple transmitter and receiver are transmitted over a public channel. Once the chaotic dynamics which is initialized with a random state converges to the attractor, a message is mixed with the chaotic dynamics at the transmitter. The authorized receiver who knows the entire dynamics can use a simple algorithm to decode the message. An unauthorized receiver does not know the receiver dynamics and needs to use computationally unfeasible algorithms in order to decode the message. Security is maintained by altering the private receiver dynamics during transmission. We show that using additive mixing modulation is more efficient than the attractor position modulation distributed dynamics encryption scheme. We demonstrate the concept of this new scheme by simulating a simple coupled map lattice.

This paper presents a systematic approach for request, design, development, and production control of valid electronic devices for a semiconductor process technology. The principal objective is guaranteed equivalence of device silicon characteristics, electrical technology table specifications, and circuit simulation tools. This procedure also ensures that all device components are completed and delivered in a coordinated and effective manner to their various customers. Thus, both rapid design and effective production ramp and control can be achieved.

In this paper we present some experimental results from the implementation of a previously reported nonlinear controller for induction motors (G. Espinosa et al., 1994, R. Ortega et al., 1995) developed using passivity arguments. The objective of this note is to study the performance of the mentioned controller under practical conditions using a voltage-fed type inverter designed to drive a laboratory 2&#966; induction motor. The experiments are focused on the speed control problem (regulation and tracking) and special attention is given to sign changes in the reference function in order to show the global properties of the controller. The robustness controller with respect to uncertainty in the knowledge of motor parameters is also studied. The control loop is implemented using a DSP-based computational system

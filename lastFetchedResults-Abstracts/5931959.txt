Medical laboratory technicians are a unique group of healthcare professionals who are at risk for developing work related musculoskeletal symptoms. The study was conducted using 49 laboratory technicians working in the department of laboratory medicine in Mumbai hospitals. Several measures were obtained: Quick Exposure Checklist (QEC), Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), RULA and REBA. Results show that the most prevalent body regions were lower back (30.61%), upper back, knees (20.40%) and neck (18.36%). The QEC analysis showed that the neck (93.4%) has the highest level of exertion followed by the wrist (69.1%), back (62.7%) and shoulder (54.3%). The analysis of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) revealed significant differences in the morning and evening scores for neck (p&lt;0.005), low back (p&lt;0.012) and knees (p&lt;0.023). A significant difference was also found in hand grip measurements before and after the 8 hour shift, similar as for pinch grip measurements. RULA and REBA scores for various activities varied from 4 to 7 and 5 to 12 respectively. Scores of RULA and REBA indicated that risk was very high and further investigations were required. The subjective evaluation of workstations revealed that 22.4% felt the workstation height was inappropriate and an objective evaluation showed that the dimensions of the laboratory work benches were not appropriate. Stress and pain were evident from the findings of NMQ and QEC. Ergonomics intervention was recommended to reduce WRMSDs for the medical laboratory technicians.

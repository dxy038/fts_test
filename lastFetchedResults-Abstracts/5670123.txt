Result The overall understanding of hospital staff about hospital knowledge management is very low. The understanding of staff from different grades of hospitals is different (P &lt;; 0.05, P &lt;; 0.01). There are also differences between employees of different gender, different age, different educational background, different professional titles and specialized fields (P &lt;; 0.05, P &lt;; 0.01). However, all of them are keen to develop knowledge management across hospitals. Conclusion The understanding of hospital staff concerning knowledge management is at a low level.

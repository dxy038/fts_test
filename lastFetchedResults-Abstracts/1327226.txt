Current virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) tools do not lend themselves well to the simulation of non-repetitive activities that could be involved in road construction and heavy civil engineering projects. Therefore it is argued in this paper that specialised functions are required to support the use of VR and AR tools to visually design and simulate such projects. The prime objective of this study is to develop visual design and simulation analysis functions to support optimum road design by extending the applicability of current virtual reality (VR) systems to the design phase of road construction projects. The VR simulation functions developed in this research enable visual inspection of road alignment and earthwork status, simulation of alternative routes, and selection of optimum design route. This study implements a methodology for configuring VR simulation functions and develops a VR system for optimising the road design data. The research results include an improved road design process as a result of the application of the VR functions developed.

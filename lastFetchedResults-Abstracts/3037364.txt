This paper proposes an advanced distribution system, scalable, reliable, and transmission control protocol (TCP)-friendly file transfer architecture. Today, a global system such as this is required for group communications, as in the case of document-based conferencing, collaborative work and transmission and exchanging of files. The main objective of this paper is to propose an integrated server/client algorithm to manage a set of distributed entities, in particular for advance file distribution system, which we call it (AFDS).

The main objective of this research is the development of an isolation and detection interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm for partial (soft) or total (hard) reaction wheel failures in the spacecraft attitude control system (ACS). Based on different scenarios and assumptions we develop healthy models of the ACS under various operating conditions and construct faulty modes with respect to temperature changes, power supply line voltage changes, torque variations, and unexpected current variations in each motor axis windings of the reaction wheels. Once a fault mode is detected and isolated we will be able to develop in certain conditions the recovery procedure through feedback control strategies for the ACS.

Under the circumstances of China´s smart grid construction, this paper designs an intelligent management system based on the objective of orderly consumption and demand-side management. The basic principles of the system are shown and hardware structure is described. Then, the main functions of the intelligent system are suggested, including data collection, load analysis, intelligent demand management and ex-post efficiency assessment. The suggested system will achieve real-time intelligent data transferring and reading, and meet the requirement of dynamic pricing. Additionally, intelligent demand-side management system will form a new type of two-way interactive marketing mode, which will accelerate China´s pace to achieve energy efficiency and targets of energy-saving and emission reduction.

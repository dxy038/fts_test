The objective of this study was to examine and compare the reliability of optical fiber patch cord connectors in an outdoor environment. FC type connectors from three different manufacturers were compared. The experimental focus was on the accelerated occurrence of corrosion induced by acid rain, high temperature, and rotation environmental testing. During the evaluation following the test, we checked for insertion loss and changes occurring on the tip shape of the patch cord connectors.

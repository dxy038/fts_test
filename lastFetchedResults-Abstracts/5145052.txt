In this paper, we propose a novel multi-tier clustering strategy using cultural-based multiobjective particle swarm optimization (Cultural-MOPSO) for maximizing the longevity of wireless sensor networks. We take into account the distribution of surviving nodes and define three objective functions based on multi-tier cluster hierarchy to fully evaluate every clusterhead election. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed strategy can achieve energy-efficient multi-tier cluster hierarchy and outperform two other PSO-based clustering schemes in terms of a new metric of network longevity.

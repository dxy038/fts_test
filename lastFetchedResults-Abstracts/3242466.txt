The paper presents the performance optimization in wireless power transfer. The power transfer efficiency is selected as objective function and an appropriate frequency space representation is used by means of the desired performance quantity generated in full symbolic form. This is combined with some computations performed on the real system and an optimization algorithm for some scalar and/or vector functions of multiple variables provided by Matlab Optimization Toolbox. The algorithm is suitable to compute the optimal circuit parameters which guarantee the maximum value of the performance quantity. The paper also highlights some aspects regarding the conditions that have to be fulfilled by a power supply system that uses wireless technologies, for an optimal transfer of energy. The proposed optimization technique was validated by simulation.

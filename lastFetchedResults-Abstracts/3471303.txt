The results of a case study designed to select the next generation of rough-terrain cargo handlers for the US Army are presented. Three alternatives were identified and ultimately ranked using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This framework permits decision makers to conduct tradeoffs among incommensurate criteria without having to rely on a single measure. The evaluation team consisted of five program managers and engineers. Special attention is paid to the efforts at data collection and the accompanying group dynamics. The objective hierarchy contained 12 attributes. In general, the AHP was found to be quite accessible and conducive to concensus building. Once the attributes were defined, the decision makers had little difficulty in furnishing the necessary data and discussing the intermediate results

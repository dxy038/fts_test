Louis Castaldi was an Italian physician who was employed by the government and the royal court of Qajar during 1876-1902 as a teacher of medicine in Dar al-Funun and also as the special physi¬cian and surgeon of the Qajar court Then he was appointed as the official consul of Iran in Milan during 1902-1911. There are no comprehensive reports about the medical activities of Castaldi in Iran and little information is available on this issue. But there are fifty three administrative records in the archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Library and Archives of Iran which portray the nine years of Castaldi's activities in the position of Iran's consul. The most important issues discussed in these records include: how Castaldi was chosen and appointed as Iran's consul in Millan, being the representative of Iran in the International exhibition of goods in Millan, rejecting the suggestion of Iran's government to be Iran's representative in the interna¬tional congress on Tuberculosis and the medical exhibition of Rome, and his conflicts with the governments after the constitutional revolution that didn't pay his salary which was set by Mozafar al-Din Shah. This research studies these issues in two historical eras i.e. before and after the con¬stitutional revolution, with an analytic approach.

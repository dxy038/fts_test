The distribution network planning is a multi-objective problem including minimizing losses and investment. By setting planning priorities, the necessary actions to loss reduction are prioritized, thus the waste of investment will be prevented. In this paper, a new method is presented to determine planning priorities of the extensive and complex distribution network with uncertain data to optimize network variable including power losses and voltage profile.

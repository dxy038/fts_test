The main design problems of wireless mesh networks are Router/Gateway placement, connectivity and coverage area, which are critical issues to improve network performance and directly related to network reliability. In this paper we try to consider all effective parameters such as network connectivity, end-to-end transmission delay, node placement/ location to optimize WMN designing. A hybrid binary and real-valued genetic algorithm (GA) is used to solve the multi objective optimization problem. GA help us to design a WMN with optimum deployment cost, packet transmission delay and router placement/location. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and illustrate the relationship between network connectivity, total delay and number of required routers.

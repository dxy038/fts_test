This paper describes the design of an instrument for the functional and objective evaluation of the visual field, as well as an ophthalmologic methodology based on a video-oculography system (VOG). This objective evaluation methodology is carried out using the visual evoked potentials (VEP) and the pupillary response (PR). The system sustains its objectivity in the digital processing of the PR recorded by the VOG system during the test caused by the photomotor reflex, and in the analysis of the VEP. The analysis of the PR digitalized and the VEP recorded, give us an idea of the visual condition of the observer, without involve the dependence of their perception.

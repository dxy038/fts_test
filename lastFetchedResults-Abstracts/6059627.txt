IEEE 802.16 standard is proposed for providing high data rate and middle-range access to Internet through wireless access channel. The increasing of data rate, access range, and total number of wireless nodes makes the wireless media access control more difficult and critical. Our objective is to provide a fair and efficient allocation to all the users to satisfy their quality of service. In this paper we introduce a new scheduling architecture and algorithm based on GPSS mode for IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless access standard. The proposed solution which is practical and compatible to the IEEE 802.16 standard, provides QoS support for different traffic classes. OPNET simulation studies show that the proposed solution provides realtime services and high bandwidth required services with low delays. This study will help network architects to decide the system parameters as well as the kind of traffic characteristics for which the network can provide QoS support.

Analysis of electromagnetic coupling to pyro circuits with the objective of preventing adverse effects such as unintentional firing, have been studied in the past using a variety of analytical approaches. It is proposed that a much simpler and faster approach, based on computational electromagnetics, can provide similar results. A portion of a pyro MOSFET circuit is first examined addressing failure modes within the design that can unintentionally fire a pyro device if adverse electromagnetic fields of sufficient strength are present. The electrical conditions that also contribute for the pyro circuits to fire unintentionally are also discussed. Finally, the method of moments is used to address the field-to wire coupling scenario and to find if the necessary induced voltages within the pyro circuits are sufficient for a firing condition

Objective
This study examined the effects of blue light exposure on the proliferation and cytotoxicity of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). Cellular mechanism by which blue light causes cytotoxic effects was also investigated.
Methods

HGF were exposed to the plasma-arc generated blue light with various energy densities ranging from 2 to 48 J/cm2. After light exposure of the cells, they were processed for analyzing tritium incorporation, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, trypan blue exclusion, and DNA fragmentation. In addition, possible mechanism of the light-mediated cytotoxicity was investigated through flow cytometric and Western blot analyses.
Results

Blue light exposure significantly inhibited proliferation and SDH activity of HGF in a dose-dependent manner; exposure more than 12 J/cm2 had a toxic effect on the cells. The blue light-induced cytotoxicity of the cells resulted from apoptosis, as proven by the migration of many cells to the sub-G1 phase of cell cycle and the appearance of DNA ladders. Additional experiments revealed that blue light induces apoptosis of HGF through mitochondrial stress and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage.
Significance

This study suggests that plasma-arc generated blue light exerts some harm to cells, particularly damaging effect to DNA, and thus a long curing time more than recommended can cause biological damage on the oral tissue.

The objective of this paper is to present a new concept related to the revitalized microgrid concept and the paradigm of the smart grid. A combination of a rapidly aging North American power infrastructure, a clear trend towards distributed generation, and an emphasis on electrical reliability has spurred a shift toward a more distributed, decentralized power grid. The concept of the microgrid has dominated the discussion of power distribution on a localized level, while the smart grid model has been touted as the new macrogrid design paradigm. In order to bring together the microgrid and smart grid concepts, we propose the MMCS concept, which divide distribution systems into numerous microgrid-like regions, or MMCS regions, to facilitate the smart grid concepts of self-healing, intentional islanding, and anticipation for the entire distribution network while inheriting the dynamics of a microgrid. We implement the MMCS concept through the use of multi-agent systems.

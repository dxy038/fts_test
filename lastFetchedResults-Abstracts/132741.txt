Background and Objectives: A simple and universally available marker of infalmmation, is the white blood cell (WBC) count. Prcvions studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) had revealed that patients with elevated WBC counts were at higher risk of mortality and recurrent AMI. The objective of this study, was to find a correlation between increased WBC count and rate of in-hospital complications and mortality in unstable angina (UA) and AM1.
Materials and Methods: 1840 patients admitted with AMI and UA in Shahid Madany Heart Censer of Tabriz from early 1377 to second half of 1380, were studied. Half of the patients (n=920) had AMI (with average age of 63 years and male / female ratio of 618/302), and other half (n=920) had UA at admission (with averge age of 57 years and male / female ratio of 436/484). WBC count was assessed in first 48 hours of hospitalization in all patients. We detect the association between WBC count and rate of complications & mortality in UA and AMI.
Results: The typical chest pain was the most prevalent complaint (in 51.6% of patients). The most common abnormality at electrocardiogram (ECG) was ST changes (70.6%) in AMI and T-inversion (47.8%) in UA. Both enzymatic analyses (CPK, CPK-MB, LDH) and ECG changes, were used to detect UA or AMI. Most of patients with UA (86%) had WBC < 10000 mm3, but WBC> 10000 mm3 were frequently seen in AM1 patients, specially in whome subseqently expired.
Conclusion: WBC count is a potent predictor of in-hospital morbidity and mortality in patients with AMI and UA.

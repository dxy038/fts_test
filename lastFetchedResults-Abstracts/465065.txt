OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate immunosuppressive acidic protein in the prognostic characterization of advanced ovarian cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Serum levels of immunosuppressive protein were prospectively measured in 80 patients with untreated ovarian carcinoma. To evaluate the prognostic significance of immunosuppressive acidic protein levels, cutoff points were studied every 50 μg/ml between 450 and 1350 μg/ml. RESULTS: Pretreatment immunosuppressive acidic protein levels were not significantly associated with stage, histotype, grade of differentiation, postoperative residual tumor, and response to chemotherapy. The most significant association with survival was observed at a cutoff value of 1100 μg/ml (p = 0.0089). In the univariate analysis for overall survival, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and immunosuppressive acidic protein status were found to have a role in predicting ovarian cancer prognosis. In the multivariate analysis only immunosuppressive acidic protein status was significantly associated with survival. A statistical correlation was found between serum levels and overall survival (p = 0.0104, χ2 6.56), including immunosuppressive acidic protein as a continuous variable. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that immunosuppressive acidic protein assay is a potentially useful tool in the prognostic characterization of advanced ovarian cancer.

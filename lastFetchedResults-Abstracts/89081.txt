A report on an investigation of spherical, disc, and half-disc antennas in the frequency and time domains with the objective of developing small planar versions of the antennas. These antennas have an omni-directional impulse response in azimuth and pulse duration of 0.50.65 nanoseconds. In addition, the measured data show a reasonable peak received signal in a pulse communication link using two identical antennas.

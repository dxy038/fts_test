Operation in micro grids containing combined heat and power generators require specific modeling and optimization methods due to interrelation between electricity and heat. In this paper after introducing a proto type micro grid and corresponding dispersed generations a multi objective problem is investigated for micro grid operation. Based on three factors: generation cost function, environmental emission and micro grid loss a three objective optimization model is proposed. Considering proposed model a genetic algorithm based method entitled Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGAII) is employed. The objective is providing simultaneous electricity and heat considering the possibility of electricity trading with external grid. Subsequently, three scenarios: using domestic boiler, gas engine contribution and micro turbine contribution are presented for providing electricity and heat demands of consumers and the best scenarios is selected at the end.

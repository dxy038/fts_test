One of tasks of the grounding systems is to maintain the voltage rise due to discharging fault current into grounding grids at the minimum value to insure the safety of public and personnel. The objective of the paper is to make a comparison between the addition of horizontal rods and vertical rods to the grounding grids to improve the performance of it. A boundary element approach uses to get the numerical computation of grounding system analysis such as the equivalent resistance and the distribution of potential on the earth surface due to fault currents. This study describes the importance of vertical ground rods not only decrease the grounding grid resistance but also reduce the step and touch voltages.

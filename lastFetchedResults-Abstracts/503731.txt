BACKGROUND AMD OBJECTIVE: Signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) are common among individuals. Occlusal changes can be responsible for otalgia, hearing loss, tongue and throat irritation, and tinnitus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of tinnitus in students with temporomandibular disorder in medical sciences and technology universities in Babol, Iran.

METHODS: This cross sectional study was performed on 592 students of both universities of medical sciences and technology of Babol, Iran during 2007-2008. All participants were asked to fulfill a RDC/TMD revised questionnaire and were subjected to a standardized clinical examination readapted from the RDC for TMD (Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders). Tinnitus cases were examined by an ENT specialist and underwent audiometry and tympanometry.

FINDINGS: In this study, TMD prevalence was 28.9% (171 patients) that was seen more in males (p=0.04). Tinnitus was seen in 21 cases (12.3%) with TMD and in 38 cases (9.02%) without TMD that there was no significant difference. Tinnitus was seen in 42 cases (13%) of medical students and 17 (6.3%) of technology university students that this difference was significant (p=0.04). Hearing loss was seen in 14 cases (8.18%) with TMD and 26 (6.17%) without TMD that there was no significant difference.

CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that there was not a significant relationship between temporomandibular joint disorders and tinnius.

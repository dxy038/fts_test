The objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term effect of dietary selenium (Se)-enriched yeast on semen parameters in goat during the breeding season. Also, the antioxidant status and Se content in seminal plasma was investigated. A total of 72 adult Taihang black goats of proven fertility were randomly assigned to four treatment groups. They were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg of Se/kg dry matter (DM) (from Se-enriched yeast). Semen was collected by an artificial vagina (AV) and semen characteristics (volume, motility, viability, concentration and abnormality) were recorded. Seminal plasma was harvested by centrifugation for analyzing enzyme activities and Se concentration. The result showed that short-term dietary Se supplementation has both linear (P&lt;0.001) and quadratic (P&lt;0.001) effects on semen parameters and antioxidant activities. It could be concluded that the short-term supplementation of Se-enriched yeast can improve semen quality in goat and Se plays an important role in oxidative systems of seminal plasma. The results of this study provide an effective approach to improve the reproductive performance at a lower feeding cost through short-term dietary supplementation of organic Se.

In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear classifier based on a generalized Choquet integral with signed fuzzy measures to enhance the classification power by capturing all possible interactions among two or more attributes. A special genetic algorithm is designed to implement this classification optimization with fast convergence. Instead of using a discrete misclassification rate, the objective function to be optimized in this research is a continuous Choquet distance with a penalty coefficient for misclassified points. The numerical experiment shows that the special genetic algorithm effectively solves the nonlinear classification problem and this nonlinear classifier accurately identifies classes.

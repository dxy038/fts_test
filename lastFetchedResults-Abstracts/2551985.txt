Background and Objective: Adhesion molecules play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of combined exercise on vascular adhesion molecules and lipid profile in obese and overweight women.

Materials and Methods: Eighteen women participated in this study (age: 39.33±7.7 years; weight: 76.57±5.19 kg). The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: exercise and control groups. The exercise protocol included: aerobic exercise (60-75% Maximum Heart Rate) and resistance exercise program (two sets with 10-12 repetitions and with an intensity of 40-60% of maximum repetition and rest time of 60-90 seconds) for 10 weeks 3 times a week. During the study, the control group received no intervention. At the beginning and 48 hours after exercise, blood samples were taken for measurement of adhesion molecules and lipids. Data was analyzed with independent t-test with SPSS16 (p < 0.05).

Results: Test results showed that there were no differences in anthropometric indices, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and lipid levels between control and experimental groups (p > 0.05).

Conclusion: It seems that 10-week combined exercise in order to reduce VCAM-1 levels and lipid profiles is insufficient and more research is needed in this area.

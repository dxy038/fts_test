Based on requirements for spin-transfer torque (STT)-magnetic random access memory (MRAM), fundamental challenges in current CoFeB- and MgO-based STT-MRAM with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) are addressed when scaling down to sub-20 nm. Electric-field (EF)-induced PMA modulation has been proposed to significantly reduce the switching current. As EF alone is unable to induce the magnetization reversal but PMA reduction, additional mechanisms should be applied to realize EF switching. We discuss difficulties in the implementation of currently reported two switching approaches and propose a new approach using Oersted field guided EF switching in MRAM arrays. Our latest experimental results on the EF effect show that the spin reorientation transition can be realized at an EF of 0.8 V/nm for the top-pin CoFeB/MgO magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with the thermal stability factor of as high as 57 in the absence of EF. However, the bidirectional switching of the free layer cannot be achieved at a fixed biasing field, which is attributed to small STT effect and switching uncertainty due to unipolar feature of EF-induced PMA modulation. Perspective of EF-MRAM is analyzed based on currently published data on EF efficiency. We show that the EF switching is very promising for future MRAM applications in spite of challenges in materials and MTJ stack engineering.

The objective of the paper is to outline the current trend of cabling in the networking world. Today, UTP cable (CAT5e, CAT6) is the most popularly used cable to provide Gigabit Ethernet Networking despite of some disadvantages compared to Fiber Optic cable, which offers more signal reliability. The paper tries to give an overview of all categories of current UTP cables, their requirements, advantages, disadvantages and also including specifications. UTP cable is always preferred by the network users for wired LANs. Quantitative performances against different significant parameters and against different types of UTP cables are analysed. Critical parameters are studied for significant performance differences across the types of cables.

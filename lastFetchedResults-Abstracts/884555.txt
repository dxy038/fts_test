ABSTRACT : Generally, the main goal of designing and developing distribution networks, is responding to the electricity consumption growth with maximum economic efficiency in a way that does not violate the system constraints.  On the other hand, the large volume of investment and rising energy and utilitiesâ€™ prices has caused that distribution network designers use better and more accurate methods to design these networks. The appearance of distributed generation resources in distribution systems, in addition to change in the operation processes of these systems, has provided the opportunity for the companies to design systems with lower costs. To achieve this, the design steps of distribution systems must be reviewed. In this paper a multi-objective model from the perspective of the private sector is offered for optimal placement of distributed generation resources in distribution network that the main objective here is to optimize the voltage profile, system losses and costs.

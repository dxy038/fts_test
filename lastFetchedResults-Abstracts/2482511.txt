Kentucky bluegrass (
Poa pratensis L.) is one of the most widely used
turfgrasses for home lawns, golf courses, parks, and athletic fields in
temperate climates. Oxidative stress caused by drought stress is a major
limiting factor for grass cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions. The
objective of this study was to investigate whether Prohexadione-Calcium
(Pro-Ca) may play a role in promoting drought tolerance in kentucky
bluegrass. Pro-Ca was exogenously applied as a foliar spray at the rate of 0,
7.5, 15 or 25 mg a.i./m2 to well established kentucky bluegrass under wellwatered
(100 of field capacity) or drought-stressed (70 and 40% of field
capacity) conditions. The effect of Pro-Ca on the growth physiology, drought
stress response, antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxidation of kentucky
bluegrass exposed to drought stress was measured during 28 days at 7 days
interval. Pro-Ca treated kentucky bluegrass exposed to drought stress had
higher relative water content (RWC) and turf quality, and lower electrolyte
leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) content as membrane integrity indicators,
compared with untreated plants. Pro-Ca application significantly increased
the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase
(APX) and catalase (CAT) activities under well-watered and drought
conditions, but this increase is more evident in drought stressed plants. Pro-
Ca application at 15 mg/m2 was found to be more effective in alleviating
drought stress damage in kentucky bluegrass. The results from this study
suggest that Pro-Ca enhanced drought stress tolerance in kentucky bluegrass
by maintaining higher RWC and membrane stability.

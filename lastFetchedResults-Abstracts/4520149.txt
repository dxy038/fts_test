The authors describe work on an improved silicon-on-sapphire fabrication process and its application to advanced VLSI circuits. The main objective of this work has been to control and minimize the radiation-induced leakage of integrated circuits by generating rigorous material procurement specifications. This goal has been achieved with two new wafer procurement specifications. In addition, the original vendor material post-radiation variability has been significantly reduced

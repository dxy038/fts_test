Annular objective apertures are fabricated for a CM300 transmission electron microscope using a focused ion beam system. A central beam stop in the back focal plane of the objective lens of the microscope blocks all electrons scattered up to a semi-angle of approximately 20 mrad. In this manner, contributions to the image from Bragg scattering are largely reduced and the image contrast is sensitive to the atomic number Z. Experimentally, we find that single atom scattering cross sections measured with this technique are close to Rutherford scattering values. A comparison between this new method and STEM-HAADF shows that both techniques result in qualitatively similar images although the resolution of ADF-TEM is limited by contrast delocalization caused by the spherical aberration of the objective lens. This problem can be overcome by using an aberration corrected microscope.

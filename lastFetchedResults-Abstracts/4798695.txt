The paper presents comparison between approximate models of horizontal wire conductor above homogeneous lossy ground based on image theory and transmission line theory. The main objective of this study is to indicate the cases of applicability of the proposed approximate models in practical EMC studies. The results are verified by comparison with exact model based on the electromagnetic theory.

This paper explores the employment of inductive power transfer and data transfer (IPDT) for charging of electric vehicles (EV). The main objective of this paper spans the analysis and development of the inductive power transfer (IPT) design, and the practical implementation of the system prototype. The IPT typically consists of two parts; the transmitter and the receiver part. The recitified DC at the transimitter is converted to AC of high frequency through a DC-AC converter with resonat circuits at both ends (receiever and transmitter). The power transferred to the secondary is used for electric vehicle battery charging through a rectified. Data also is transferred wirelessly in order to control the electric vehicles charging process throughout different proposed scenarios. A prototype has been tested experimentally for the IPDT.

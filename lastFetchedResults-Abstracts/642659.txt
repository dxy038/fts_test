Objective
We investigated the effect of Î±-lipoic acid (LA) in rats that were subjected to torsion/detorsion of the spermatic cord in a comparative controlled experiment.
Methods

Forty-eight male Wistar rats, randomized in two groups, received intraperitoneal injections of LA (LA group; aqueous solution at 36 mg/kg of body weight per day) or equal volume of saline (control group) 21, 9, and 1 h before torsion of the spermatic cord. Rats in each group were distributed in four subgroups, each comprising six animals. All surgical procedures were performed under inhaled ether anesthesia. Ischemia was induced by 720-degree torsion of the spermatic cord for 3 h. The right testis was assessed through longitudinal scrotal incision. After each surgical procedure, scrotal incisions were closed with 4-0 nylon monofilament. Ipsilateral testes and arterial blood samples were collected at the end of ischemia and 1, 3, and 6 h after detorsion. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and reduced glutathione levels (micromoles per gram of wet tissue) were assayed in testis. Total antioxidant power was measured in blood plasma.
Results

LA pretreatment promoted a significant decrease in testicular concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and simultaneously induced an increase in reduced glutathione concentrations at all time points studied. Plasma total antioxidant power levels increased significantly during reperfusion (T-1) in LA-treated rats compared with control rats.
Conclusion

LA administered before torsion of the spermatic cord showed significant protective effects against ischemia/reperfusion injury by decreasing lipid peroxidation and regulating testicular reduced glutathione and plasma total antioxidant power levels.

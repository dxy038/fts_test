Measurements of gel time of the epoxy system DGEBA(n=0)/m-XDA were carried out using rheometry and dielectric analysis with the objective of checking the validity of Mangion–Johari equation (DEA) and Harran–Laudouard criterium (rheometry) for gel time determination. In this work, gel times obtained by rheometry and dielectric analysis are compared and conversions at gel time calculated. From the experimental results obtained for gel times it was found a reasonable agreement between the two techniques that lead to gel conversion values very close to those obtained using Flory equation.

In this paper, the downlink rate quantization and cross-layer scheduling design are investigated in multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with imperfect channel state information at transmitter (CSIT). We shall propose a systematic analytical design framework based on information theoretical approach. To capture the effect of the potential packet outage, we introduce the average system goodput, which measures the average b/s/Hz delivered to the mobiles successfully, as the system performance objective. Numerical results demonstrate that, by considering the statistics of CSIT errors into the design, the proposed scheduling scheme provides significant performance enhancement.

The objective of this paper is to probe interception effect of the permeable dam for surface runoff under different flow velocity by constructing different material dam in laboratory. Results obtained through different materials permeable dam indicated that the lower flow velocity through the permeable dam, the better effect of interception non-point pollution, and interception efficiency of limestone-conglomerate was great comprehensively. Even under higher flow velocity, the interception rates to SS (suspended solid) were over 30%. The interception rates to nitrogen and phosphorus were about 3%~12% and 8%~24% respectively. So when a heavy rainfall event happens, the permeable dam can be used to intercept and further purify surface runoff from farming. The permeable dam is appropriate to control non-point in the plain river network on account of its infrastructure investment and running costs far less than artificial wetland and operating simply.

An algorithm for the optimal voltage regulation of distribution secondary networks with distributed generators (DGs) is proposed in the paper. Based on the &#949; decomposition of the sensitivity matrix (inverse of Jacobian) obtained from the solution of the Newton-Raphson power flow problem, a large secondary network is divided into several small subnetworks. From the &#949; decomposition, the range of influence of each DG on the voltage of the entire network is determined. When voltage at particular nodes exceeds normal operating limits, the nearest DGs can be located and commanded to control the voltage. The control action can be coordinated using communications in a small-size subnetwork. The voltage regulation is achieved by solving a small linear programming optimization problem with an objective function that makes every DG to optimize its generation. The algorithm is tested with a model of a real heavily-meshed secondary network. The results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively control the voltage in a distributed manner. It is also discussed in the paper how to choose the value of &#949; for the system decomposition.

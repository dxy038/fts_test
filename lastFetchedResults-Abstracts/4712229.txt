We have undertaken mapping of the ice sheet margin and grounding zone in East Antarctica using Landsat TM and ERS SAR images in order to establish an accurate baseline for the detection of future change. As part of this work we have implemented a computer-aided edge-following algorithm to provide an objective and consistent mechanism for analysis of different images. Accurate geocoding of the images is achieved with sparsely distributed ground control points and a transformation of the images which preserves their inherent geometric properties and internal positioning accuracy. An initial comparison with published maps has identified significant changes in several large ice shelves

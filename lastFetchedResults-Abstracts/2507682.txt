Background: MR imaging is one of the best diagnostic modalities in medicine. During an MR imaging examination, three types of field are employed to produce images. Various experimental studies have been performed about the effects of each single type of field but only few studies are available on their combination to gener- ate MR imaging. The main objective of this research work is to study the effects of MR imaging on the level of glucose and cortisol hormone.
Methods: 40 adult male Wistar rats (220 Â± 10 g) were randomly divided into 2 groups of exposed (20) and control (20) groups. They were exposed under diagnos- tic MR imaging of 1.5 T field strengths for 25 minutes. Then, immediately blood samples were isolated and level of serum glucose measured by Auto-analyzer and cortisol content of blood sera was assayed by radioimmunoassay (RIA).
Results: Findings showed significant decreases in the levels of glucose and corti- sol hormone after 25 minutes of exposure .
Conclusion: MR imaging may have adverse effects on the level of glucose and cortisol hormone.

The study of satellite images topographic maps supported by ground truth survey revealed that the study has a network of interlinked subsurface fractures. In according with the nature, potential and problem with the bet amount of interference, watershed management approach is aimed to make entire development. For surface water resources and ground water resources, the proper evaluation of water potential helps in additional exploration at optional level. The river basin objective of watershed management involves geological, hydrological consideration and economic, political, financial aspect. For the formulize of proper management program, a reliable and up to date information about various factor, viz. size and shape of river basin, topography, soil, slope, elevation and their characteristics, land use/land cover, drainage parameters etc. are required. To obtain a synoptic view of respective coverage, Remote sensing and GIS techniques provide a powerful input media, unbiased reproduction of the natural features in the form of photography/ imagery and their by economizing the process of multi-displinary approach for planning and decision of  land and water resource in a watershed for integrated development. Resource information system is makes in a stabile GIS environment for the selected area. In this system evolves a subsistence plan for optimum development of the water resources and for finding solutions for different management problem related to natural resources.

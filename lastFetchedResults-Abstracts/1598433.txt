In the scheduling problem addressed in this note we have to determine: (i) the job sequence, (ii) the (common) due-date, and (iii) the location of a rate modifying (maintenance) activity. Jobs scheduled before (after) the due-date are penalized according to their earliness (tardiness) value. The processing time of a job scheduled after the maintenance activity decreases by a job-dependent factor. The objective is minimum total earliness, tardiness and due-date cost. We introduce a polynomial ( O ( n 4 ) ) solution for the problem.

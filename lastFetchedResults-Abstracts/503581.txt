Tuberculosis (TB) is in the 7th grade according to Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) and will stay in this grade until 2020. In the developing countries, 25% of preventable deaths are due to tuberculosis, 75% of them occurs in producing people .The main reason of this outcome is ineffective national programs for tuberculosis surveillance in the countries. Therefore, periodic program evaluation of tuberculosis surveillance would be essential. This was a Health system research (program evaluation) study that has been conducted in Isfahan district (2005-2006). Data were collected from epidemiologic forms sent to Isfahan provincial health center. All samples were analyzed. Data were analyzed using SPSS 11.5 software. The outcome and process indices were computed and compared with standards.

The computed indices in 2005 and 2006 were as case detection rate (CDR) 90% and 77%, incidence of smear-positive cases per 100000 population 2.28 and 1.11, conversion rate 87.5% and 81%, cure rate 77.5% and 56%, completion rate 2.5% and 2%, success rate 80% and 58%, failure rate 2.5% and 4%, respectively.

This study revealed that there is a gap between new-case incidence of smear positive lung tuberculosis, cure rate, success rate and the standards. This reveals a problem in accomplishment of tuberculosis surveillance program and continuous monitoring of this program will lead to improvement the indices.

Background A long asylum procedure
is associated with higher prevalence rates of
psychiatric disorders, lower quality of life, higher
disability and more physical health problems.
Additional knowledge about health seeking behavior
is necessary to guide governments and health professionals
in their policies. Objective To measure
service use among one of the biggest asylum seekers
population in the Netherlands and to assess its
relationships with predisposing and need variables
(including post-migration living problems). Method
Two groups were randomly selected: Group 1
(n = 143), less than 6 months and Group 2
(n = 151), more than 2 years in the Netherlands.
Respondents were interviewed with fully structured,
culturally validated, translated questionnaires, which
contained instruments to measure psychiatric disorders,
quality of life, disability, physical health and
post-migration living problems. Use of preventive
and curative (physical and mental) health services
was measured and the relationship with predisposing
and need risk factors was estimated with univariate
and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
Results A long asylum procedure is not associated
with higher service use, except for mental health
service use and drug use. Use of mental health services
is, however, low compared to the prevalence of
psychiatric disorders. Low quality of perceived general
health and functional disability are the most
important predictors of services use. Psychopathology
predicts use of a medical specialist (non-psychiatrist),
but does not predict mental health service
use. Conclusion A high percentage of asylum seekers
with a psychiatric disorder is not getting adequate
treatment. There is a mismatch between the type of
health problem and the type of health service use.
The various health services should work together in
education, detection, referral and care in order to
provide help to this group of patients

Coupled oscillators are used for phase control in microwave antenna arrays, as an alternative to electronic beam steering methods. We can find them in almost every digital communication system and that is why they are the subject of an intense research activity whose objective is to obtain a particular phase shift of the oscillators in the array. This paper presents various techniques to compute the phase shift between the output voltages of a pair of coupled oscillators.

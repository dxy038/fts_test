BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Low birth weight (LBW) in neonates is one of the main causes of neonatal mortality and in some countries is the cause of 70% of neonatal mortality. Prevalence and risk factors of LBW are different in various countries. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of low birth weight and its related factors in Babol, Iran.
METHODS: This descriptive and analytical study was done on 2228 neonates in Babol during 2000. Data included age, weight, gender, education, history of blood pressure, diabetes and renal disease, gestational age and multiple gravid of neonates were statistically analyzed by SPSS soft- ware and X2 test and p<0.05 was considered significant.
FINDINGS: Incident of LBW was 7.7%. LBW in females in comparison to males showed 1.7 fold increasing (p=0.001). Also, the risk of LBW in premature neonates (less than 37 weeks) in comparison with term neonates increased 20.5 and in mothers under 19 years and over 35 years in comparison to those over 19 years and under 30 years had 2.3 fold increasing (p<0.000).
CONCLUSION: The control of preterm labor and instruction to mothers under 19 years and over 35 years can be useful in prevention of LBW neonates.

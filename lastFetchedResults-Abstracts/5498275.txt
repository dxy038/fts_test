Ontology is recognized as a key technology for the success of the semantic Web. Building reusable and evolve-able ontologies in order to cope with ontology evolution and requirement changes is increasingly important. But the existing methodologies and tools fail to support effective ontology reuse and evolution. In this paper, we present a product line based reuse-oriented ontology development methodology which integrates ontology development with design by reuse and design for reuse. The basic building block in our approach is the meta-ontology. In the first stage, reengineering of existing ontologies will lead to the initial implementation of the meta-onotologies using design by reuse and with the objective of design for reuse. After that step new ontologies could be generated by reusing these meta-ontologies. We demonstrate our approach with a semantic Web Service application to show how to build reusable meta-ontologies with a generic composite process template and generate processes for different example scenarios

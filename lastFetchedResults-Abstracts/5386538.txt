A wideband rectangular ring antenna fed by planar disc monopole is presented. The antenna radiates bidirectional beam with average directivity of 6 dBi. The antenna characteristics are simulated and analyzed. Experiments have been carried out to investigate the impedance and radiation behavior and the results are compared with the simulated data. The antenna offers a wide impedance bandwith in the frequency band 2.2-16.7 GHz with the VSWR of less than 2:1.

More and more people are suffering from tinnitus. There are many treatments for tinnitus that have been claimed based on different causes. Unfortunately, until now none of the existing treatments has been found to be effective in general. Here, we would like to suggest a treatment to tinnitus based on neurofeedback using neural correlates of auditory selective evoked potentials (ASEPs). We have shown that the wavelet phase synchronization of auditory late responses (ALR) single sweeps allows for a direct online monitoring of phase locked auditory attention. The results show that after a simple training, subjects learned to control their attention to the auditory modality. To improve the ability in the attention control system is an objective of many tinnitus treatments, so that the perception of the patients towards the tinnitus noise can be reduced to a minimum. It is concluded that our proposed neurofeedback system by wavelet phase synchronization measure might be used in a clinical treatment of tinnitus patients and it is possible to extent to other therapeutic based control systems.

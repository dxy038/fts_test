Weakly electric fish employ active electrolocation for orientation and navigation in their environment at night and are thus able to perceive an electrical image of their surroundings even in complete darkness. This principle of active electrolocation is adopted to design a technical sensor system, which will able to detect and to analyze the walls of blood vessels and obstacles within them. The main objective involves the construction and testing of the artificial sensor, including the electronic circuits for signal analysis. To establish effective and optimal parameters for the sensor FEM analysis is done. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of proposed design of catheter based electrolocation sensor. Further by implementing efficient design of amplifier and signal processing circuit it is possible to develop biologically inspired technical sensor for routine blood vessel diagnostics and be adopted for finding and analyzing pathologic changes of artery walls.

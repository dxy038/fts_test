General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is the packet switched data service for GSM. The typical Internet applications like WWW, FTP and e-mail will work over GPRS and it is therefore important to know their performance in this system. In order to accomplish this objective, a simulator of the GPRS system is necessary. The fixed network nodes introduced by GPRS are easy to simulate, but the main problem appears when we try to simulate the GPRS radio interface. We present useful types of results of the GPRS radio interface which facilitates the GPRS emulation

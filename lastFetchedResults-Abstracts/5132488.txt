Objective Xanthine oxidase inhibitory activities of the total biflavonoids and eight biflavonoid compounds isolated from the medicinal plants of Selaginella labordei have been investigated. Method The active compounds were screened out by measuring the inhibition rate and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of each sample against xanthine oxidase (XOD) in vitro. Result Three kinds of biflavonoids were more active in inhibiting XOD than others, their inhibition rate was more than 85% at the concentration of 10 mugldrmL<sup>-1</sup>. IC<sub>50</sub> of the total biflavonoids, robustaflavone, 2",3"- dihydro -3\´,3"\´- biapigenin and 2",3"-dihydroochnaflavone was 0.529, 0.162, 0.257, 0.254 mugldrmL<sup>-1</sup> respectively. Conclusion The three kinds of biflavonoids were active compounds in inhibiting XOD from Selaginella labordei, and the total flavonoids was the main active position.

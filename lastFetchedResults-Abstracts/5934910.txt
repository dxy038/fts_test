The authors introduce a novel analytical correction method for rugged terrain image data which allows the use of the more general Minnaert law for the bidirectional reflection at the ground surface. In this correction model, single reflection by a target slope and multiple reflection by the mean background as well as diffuse reflection by the atmosphere were taken into account. Applying this correction method to Landsat MSS (Multispectral Scanner) data, the authors found that the reflection by rugged terrain vegetation (mostly deciduous forest) follows Minnaert´s law rather than Lambert´s law

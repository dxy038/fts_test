The effect of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is one of the most important factors to calibrate reflectance obtained from remotely sensed data. Because the measured BRDF data involve noise caused by various factors, BRDF model parameter estimation tends to become unstable. We examined parameter estimation robustness by using BRDF data measured at paddy fields in Japan, and experimental result of the estimation is described in this paper.

We demonstrate a technique that ameliorates the performance of bidirectional systems impaired by in-band Rayleigh crosstalk, which is common in passive optical access networks based on centralized remote wavelength feeding. The technique is based on the combined use of a suitable line coding and ad hoc postdetection electrical filtering. Therefore, it can be seamless implemented in optical access systems and it is easily scalable with the data rate. We experimentally assess the technique by using a 8B10B coded 1.25-Gb/s signal. We report an increased tolerance to the signal-to-crosstalk ratio by about 5 dB.

The objective of this work was to analyze possible electrostatic discharge (ESD) events involving the interface between the human body and an automobile. Charge generated by triboelectrification for a vehicle in motion and the interface between clothing worn by the human body and a vehicleÂ´s seats are prime causes for automotive ESD. The concept of a coupling factor can be utilized to predict values of discharge parameters for the limiting cases of typical situations involving the charged human body, another human body, and an automobile

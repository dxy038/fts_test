We have shown that high-accuracy DOA estimation can be obtained by the use of a total recording technique which simultaneously records the output signals from the elements of a virtual array antenna and a reference antenna, representing the target signals and a high-quality reference signal, and performing a correlation analysis of these signals. The method proposed in this paper enables two-branch recording of the target signals and the reference signal. By adopting two-dimensional virtual array measurement, we obtained an angular spectrum in full range of 0&#176;-360&#176;. Outdoor measurements were first performed to investigate the validity of the proposed measurement method. The results confirmed its effectiveness in determining DOAs very accurately. We then investigated the system performance in an indoor environment, which is the ultimate objective of this study. The angular spectrum obtained showed five arriving waves, and allowed determination of the angular profile and the wave propagation structure. In conclusion, we have had a very accurate measurement tool for indoor propagation.

This study establishes an intelligent battery charging system using inductive transmission of power and fast full-duplex information. The inductive charging system improves the drawback like failure connection, sparking and the risk of electrical shock of the conventional charging system. Inductive transmission of power and information has the advantages of safety, reliability, and convenience. The power and information are simultaneously transferred through one ferrite core. That means the photo coupler that is used to transfer the voltage or current signal to primary to control the output voltage is replaced by the full-duplex information transmission system with the bidirectional Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) signal In the proposed inductive charging system, the information transmission speed is bounded by the switching frequency for the power transmission. Therefore, the information transmission speed is the main issue in this thesis. The proposed information transmission wouldnÂ´t be interfered by the power transmission and the transmission speed can achieve over 200 kbps that is twice more than other inductive charging system. The feedback signal from the secondary to the primary is not only used to control the output voltage, but also used to detect the length of air gap.

An artificial voice signal that reflects the average characteristics of the human voice is described. This signal is intended for use as a test signal in the objective evaluation of speech coding system quality. To obtain the average characteristics, a multilingual set of speech samples is analyzed. An artificial voice generation method that reflects the extracted average characteristics of a human voice is formulated. This method applies vector quantizing analysis to the multilingual speech database. The partial correlation (PARCOR) speech synthesis circuit is used to reproduce the average characteristics. Finally, the artificial voice is compared with a human voice, and the estimation accuracy of the subjective quality of speech coding systems is evaluated

The objective of this paper is to provide the background data for the derivation of the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) 1993 Edition Minimum Approach Distances. Values in this paper reflect the changes to the Tables and the supporting paragraphs contained In the Tentative Interim Amendment (TIA) issued in 1993. Sufficient data is given to verify the minimum approach distances. The data was amassed by using six decimal places on the calculator, rounding each calculation in accordance with the principles of Rules 441A5a(1) and 441A5a(2), and reentering the rounded number before performing the next calculation

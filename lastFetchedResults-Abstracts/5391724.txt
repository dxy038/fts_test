For many aspects of speech therapy an objective evaluation of the intelligibility of a patient´s speech is needed. We investigate the evaluation of the intelligibility of speech by means of automatic speech recognition. Previous studies have shown that measures like word accuracy are consistent with human experts´ ratings. To ease the patient´s burden, it is highly desirable to conduct the assessment via phone. However, the telephone channel influences the quality of the speech signal which negatively affects the results. To reduce inaccuracies, we propose a combination of two speech recognizers. Experiments on two sets of pathological speech show that the combination results in consistent improvements in the correlation between the automatic evaluation and the ratings by human experts. Furthermore, the approach leads to reductions of 10% and 25% of the maximum error of the intelligibility measure.

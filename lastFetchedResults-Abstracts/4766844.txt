To integrate several communication standards into one platform, there are challenges for wide- and multi-band antenna designs using nowadays evolutionary optimization methodology. In this work, the limitations of conventional objective functions are discussed, and the general rules behind these objective functions are presented and verified. Also, an innovative approach for designing wide- and multi-band antennas within a small area is proposed. The proposed method is verified through a handset antenna design, covering 698-960 MHz and 1710-2170 MHz. The simulated and measured results confirm that the proposed method meets the bandwidth requirement and that it indeed outperforms the conventional approaches.

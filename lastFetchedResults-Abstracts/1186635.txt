Majority of the mesh-partitioning algorithms attempt to optimise the interprocessor communications, while balancing the computational load among the processors. However, it is desirable to simultaneously optimise the submesh aspect ratios in order to significantly improve the convergence characteristics of the domain decomposition based Preconditioned-conjugate-gradient algorithms, being used extensively in the state-of-the-art parallel finite element codes. Keeping this in view, a new distributed multi-objective mesh-partitioning algorithm using evolutionary computing techniques is proposed in this paper. Effectiveness of the proposed distributed mesh-partitioning algorithm is demonstrated by solving several unstructured meshes of practical-engineering problems and also benchmark problems.

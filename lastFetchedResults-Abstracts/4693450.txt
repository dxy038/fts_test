Human conversation is the best example of loosely coupled distributed communication known to man. This study specifically considers those parts of the human conversation that show evidence of dynamism and attempts to model these parts with the objective of translating the knowledge of conversational dynamics into the domain of computerised distributed systems. The discipline of metaphorical modelling is adopted in order to create a communication framework that will maintain the aspects of dynamism and apply these design directives in distributed architectures.

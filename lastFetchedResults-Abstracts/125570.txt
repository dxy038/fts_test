Objective: ERCP have special application in diagnosis and treatment of hiliary and pancreatic disease. In this study we evaluate diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP and complications in a small referral center.
Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional prospective study, we registered laboratory tests and sonographic information before and after ERCP. If complication occurrence was suspected. proper diagnostic and therapeutic studies and procedures were done.
Results: We evaluated 214 patients with an average age of 47 years, 4.1.6% were men and 40% of patients had predisposing disease (as risk factor for procedure). ERCP complications were seen in 10.6% and only 3.8%a of them needed the specific endoscopic intervention and 0.6% of them needed surgical intervention.
Conclusion: Complications of ERCP and related procedures in this small referral center were acceptable in comparison to other reports from similar centers. More experiences, technical improvement and instrumental supports might help to reduce complication.

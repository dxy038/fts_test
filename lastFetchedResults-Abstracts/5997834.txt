Up to the end of the 1970s, most adaptive control mechanisms would attempt to identify or to estimate certain parameters of the plant, and then design a feedback controller on the basis of this information. In this paper an overview is given on adaptive controllers which are not based on any parameter identification or estimation algorithm. The objective is not to obtain information about the plant, but simply to control the unknown plant or process

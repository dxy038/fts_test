This paper deals with simple model of the interaction between the output cavity of a klystron and an electron bunch has been developed using Mathcad method. The objective of this paper is to find out how to choose the klystron parameters to get the highest possible conversion efficiency under ideal conditions. The six-disc model investigates the effects of different parameters (electron velocity, trajectories) on the energy interchange in the output gap of a klystrons very quickly and easily.

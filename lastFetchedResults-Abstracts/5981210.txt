This paper discusses a priority based approach for charging Plug-in Electric Vehicles in a Smart Grid implementation. In this work, ideas from the communication network paradigm are being utilized and tailored toward achieving the desired objective of electric load leveling. The paper introduced the concept of Charging Quality of Service (CQoS) as a smart electric vehicle charging scheme and modeled it using a priority controlled leaky bucket approach. The performance of such model is investigated under the umbrella of a Smart Grid environment.

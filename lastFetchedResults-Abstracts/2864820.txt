In this paper we propose a fuzzy system for parameter adaptation in ant colony optimization (ACO). ACO is a method inspired in the behavior of ant colonies to find food and its objective are discrete optimization problems. We developed various fuzzy systems for parameter adaptation and in this paper a comparison was made between them. The use of a fuzzy system is to control the diversity of the solutions, this is, control the ability of exploration and exploitation of the ant colony.

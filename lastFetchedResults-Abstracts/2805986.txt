The requirement to improve power system stability is of utmost importance. Thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC), which is a series compensating device, can be used to govern the power flow by compensating the reactance of the transmission line. It can also improve the system stability, sub-synchronous resonance mitigation, power oscillation damping and transient stability. Because of its advantage to damp out the oscillations, TCSC is a suitable device for stability improvement. In this paper, Dynamic Inversion (DI) technique has been used to control TCSC with an objective of improving stability and damping the oscillations arising out of the variation in the infinite bus voltage. DI technique is a non-linear technique wherein the zero error dynamic is enforced and the actual output is forced to follow the desired output.

We present a framework for post-silicon analysis, that provides a formal, bidirectional communication with pre-silicon verification. We show how to exploit the framework to provide a formal guarantee on post-silicon verification accuracy under limited observability. In particular, we partition a pre-silicon assertion checker (with full observability) into (1) a limited-observability checker and (2) an in-silicon integrity unit. The composition of the two units is guaranteed to provide the same accuracy as a pre-silicon checker. We apply the framework in the verification of a cache system.

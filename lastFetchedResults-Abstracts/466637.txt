Objective: This prospective audit reports pregnancy outcomes, anticoagulation complications, and anti-Xa levels in women with mechanical heart valves who were treated with therapeutic enoxaparin plus aspirin during pregnancy. Study Design: Between 1997 and 1999, 11 women with mechanical heart valves were treated with enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg twice daily, and aspirin, 100 to 150 mg daily during 14 pregnancies. Predose and 4-hour postdose anti-Xa levels were monitored monthly. Results: There were 9 live births, 3 miscarriages, and 2 terminations. In 48 months of enoxaparin treatment, one woman who had a documented valve thrombosis when she presented at 8 weeks’ gestation also had a valve thrombosis at 20 weeks’ gestation. There were no enoxaparin-related hemorrhagic complications. Mean (SD) anti-Xa levels were 0.46 (0.12) U/mL predose and 0.89 (0.22) U/mL 4 hours postdose. Conclusion: Successful pregnancy outcome may be achieved with therapeutic subcutaneous enoxaparin, but its efficacy at preventing valve thrombosis remains uncertain. Further data are required before use of enoxaparin during pregnancy in women with mechanical heart valves can be recommended. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185: 633-7.)

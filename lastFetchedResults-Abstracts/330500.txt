Objective:  The aim of this study was to evaluate the human pulp response following direct pulp capping with a current self-etching bonding agent and calcium hydroxide (CH).

Methods: Thirty-three sound human premolars had their pulp tissue mechanically exposed. Sterile distilled water was used to control the hemorrhage and exudation from the pulp exposure site. The pulps were capped with Clearfil Liner Bond 2 (CLB-2) or CH and the cavities were filled with a resin composite (Z-100) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5, 30 and 120â€“300 days, the teeth were extracted and processed for microscopic examination.

Results: At short-term, CLB-2 elicited a mild to moderate inflammatory pulp response with dilated and congested blood vessels adjacent to pulp exposure site. With time, macrophages and giant cells engulfing globules and particulates of resinous material displaced into the pulp space were observed. This chronic inflammatory pulp response triggered by fragments of bonding agent displaced into the pulp space did not allow pulp repair interfering with the dentin bridging. On the other hand, pulps capped with CH exhibited an initial organization of elongated pulp cells underneath the coagulation necrosis. Pulp repair and complete dentin bridge formation was observed at long-term evaluation.

Significance: The present study demonstrated that CH remains the pulp capping agent of choice for mechanically exposed human pulps. CLB-2 did not allow complete connective tissue repair adjacent to the pulp exposure site. Consequently, this bonding agent cannot be recommended for pulp therapy of sound human teeth.

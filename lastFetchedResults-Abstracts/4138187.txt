A new method for the design of a bidirectional inverter based on the sinusoidal pulse-width modulation principle and the use of a low-cost and lightweight ferrite-core transformer is presented. The inverter is designed for either ohmic or inductive loads. In the case of inductive loads, the reactive power is transferred back to the DC input power source using a new active rectifier design. The inverter is controlled by two minimum-time feedback loops, providing relatively low output voltage distortion (less than 2% for DC input higher than 24 V) and good load regulation (better than 2%), while the inverter efficiency remains relatively constant (from 80 to 85%) over a wide output power range (75 to 200 W) and DC input voltage range (23 to 28 V). Theoretical results are experimentally verified using a laboratory prototype

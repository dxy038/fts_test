This paper presents an optimal cooperative routing protocol (OCRP) for Content Centric Networking (CCN) aiming to improve the in-network cache utilization. The objective of OCRP is to selectively aggregate the multiple flows of interest messages onto the same path. This improves the cache utilization while mitigating the cache contention in the Content Store (CS) of CCN routers on the routing path. The optimal routing path is obtained by binary linear optimization under threes constraints: flow conservation constraint, cache contention mitigating constraint, and path length constraint. Our simulation results of OCRP show the reduction in the server load and round-trip hop distance in comparison to those of the shortest path routing and our previously proposed cooperative routing schemes.

The main objective this article is describe a methodology for the calculation of the profile of the electric field in the level soil and proximities originated by electric energy transmission systems real and in operation in the country. It also is commented the equation used and your computational implementation in order to agile and to optimize the studies. The results of simulations were just presented for the transmission system in the voltage class 500 kV for simplify the understanding and space restriction in the article, very although five others types of configurations have also been used in the complete study with very voltages and respective classes. The results were animating and very nearby of values well-known of electric field of other and publications traditional in the area. The graphic exits of program for better visual comprehension and understanding went in accomplished in the plan and in the space.

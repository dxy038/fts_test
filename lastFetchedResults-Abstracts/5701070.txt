Among all fields of critical patient care, hemorrhagic shock, which is encountered in most traumatic injuries, is a significant factor associated with the chance of survival. Then, it is highly desirable to assess the severity of blood loss and predict the occurrence of hemorrhagic shock (HS) from biomedical signals. In this study, transcranial Doppler (TCD) signal is used to predict and classify the degree of severity of blood loss either as mild, moderate, and severe or as severe and non-severe. The data for this study were generated using the human simulated model of hemorrhage which is called lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The analysis is done by applying discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). The wavelet-based features are defined using the detail and approximate coefficients and machine learning algorithms. The objective of this study is to assess our methods of processing TCD signal for predicting the hemorrhagic. The results of this study show the prediction accuracy of 84.2% achieved by support vector machine for predicting severe/non-severe states.

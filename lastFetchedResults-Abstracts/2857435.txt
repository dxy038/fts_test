This paper proposes a novel face warping approach to deforming a 3D face using a few 3D facial features. The objective function includes two parts, the first part is local geometric constraints which aim to maintain the general characteristics of human face, and the second part is a shape regularization term which can force the deformed face to have some personalized facial characteristics. The problem can be solved by a least square optimization method. Experimental results demonstrate the effect of the proposed approach. And compared with existing method, the approach can generate better face warping result.

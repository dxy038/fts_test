The authors describe work being carried out at the University of Sydney, Australia with the objective of identifying attitudes and establishing the basic issues as well as predicting the medium-term outlook of the Australian economy and work practices, in order to devise and develop a comprehensive training system that can introduce and teach a technological program for primary and secondary education. This study also accounts for aspects of engineering and technology training and industryÂ´s approach to the issue. The major task of the project has been to design and implement effective program and instructions for technological studies, including the selection of suitable equipment to support this training. In addition, several curricula for educating engineering and technology teachers able to introduce a technological content have been developed. The proposed course program aims to provide a broad range of concepts, principles, and ideas which allow the development of knowledge and professional skills in the context of rapidly advancing technology

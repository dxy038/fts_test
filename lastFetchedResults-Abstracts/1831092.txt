Background: The kidney by the way is an essential organ and part of the urinary system and serves as natural filter of blood and removal of wastes, among other functions. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of caffeine on renal toxicity induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN), in rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 40 female rats were divided into 4 groups with 10 animals in each group. Group I (control group), group II were injected with a single dose of DEN (200 mg/kg, i.p.), group III were injected i.p. caffeine (100 mg/kg), daily for 4 weeks, group IV received the same treatment as group 2 of DEN and received daily caffeine as group 3. After 30 days, blood was collected for analyzing level of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). 
Results: The mean serum BUN and creatinine levels were significantly higher in DEN treated control group in comparison to those of base line control. Again, these levels were significantly lower in caffeine pretreated and DEN treated group (groups II, III, IV) when compared to those of DEN treated group (group I). 
Conclusion: Caffeine may have some nephroprotective effect against DEN induced nephrotoxicity.

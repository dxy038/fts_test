A local algorithm is a distributed algorithm where each node must operate solely based on the information that was available at system startup within a constant-size neighbourhood of the node. We study the applicability of local algorithms to max-min LPs where the objective is to maximise min<sub>k</sub> Sigmav CkvXv subject to Sigma<sub>v</sub> alphaivXv les 1 far each i and Xv ges 0 far each v. Here c<sub>kv</sub> ges 0, and the support sets V<sub>i</sub> = {v : alphaiv&gt; 0}, V<sub>k</sub> = {v : c<sub>kv</sub> &gt; 0}, I<sub>v</sub> = {i: alpha<sub>iv</sub> &gt; 0} and K<sub>v</sub> = {k : C<sub>kv</sub> &gt; 0} have bounded size. In the distributed setting, each agent v is responsible for choosing the value of X<sub>v</sub>, and the communication network is a hypergraph H where the sets V<sub>k</sub> and V<sub>i</sub> constitute the hyperedges. We present inapproximability results for a wide range of structural assumptions; for example, even if |V<sub>i</sub>| and |V<sub>k</sub>| are bounded by some constants larger than 2, there is no local approximation scheme. To contrast the negative results, we present a local approximation algorithm which achieves good approximation ratios if we can bound the relative growth of the vertex neighbourhoods in H.

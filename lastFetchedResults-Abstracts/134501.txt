Background and Objectives: The fungal infection of the nail (Onychomycosis) is one of the most significant and most prevalent causes of nail involvement. Any misdiagnosis or late treatment of these infections will lead to extensive disorders in the nails. The objective of this survey was to determine different types of nail fungal infections and to discover the predisposing factors of this disease.
Material and Methods: In this descriptive study ,100 patients with nail disorders were selected and introduced for laboratory studies during one year. The removed nail samples were evaluated by direct microscopy and culture.
Results: Foully eight cases out of 100 patients with nail lesions were positive from fungal contamination point of view. Direct examination of nail samples included 30 cases ( 62.5%) yeast fungi, 13 cases (27%) dermatophytosis and 5 cases (10.5%) saprophytic fungi. In culture examination of the samples among the yeasts, Candida albicans and among the dcrmatophytes, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and among the saprophytic fungi, ilspergillus funrigatus were the most prevalent ones.
Conclusion: The findings of this survey indicate that early diagnosis and correct treatment of nail fungal infections (Onychomycosis ) due to its high rate of prevalence, is very important and any misdiagnosis will lead to chronicity and severe destruction of the nails .

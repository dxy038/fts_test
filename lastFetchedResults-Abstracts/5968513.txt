Methods : Twelve cases of primary breast DLBCL, diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO classification of tumors of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, were retrospectively studied. Immunochemical study was performed and follow-up information analyzed. The histopathologic and immunophenotypic features of all cases were summarized. Subclassification was carried out as described where CD10 positivity and/or Bcl-6 positivity but negativity for MUM1 were considered indicative of germinal center B-cell-like type (GCB-DLBCL) and the opposite expression as non-germinal center B-cell-like subtype (non-GCB-DLBCL). Results.Female 10 patients, male 2 patients. Median age of patients was 49 years. 7 patients in right breast, 5 patients in left. 12 patients in stage I E. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) of 1 patients was 2, which of 2 patients was 1, and which of 9 patients was 0. Follow-up information was available in 6 patients, three of which were still alive and three died (survived 7 to 37 months). The patients usually presented with unilateral painless enlargement of breast. Morphologically, the lymphoma cells of 7 DLBCL cases showed a centroblastic variant, 5 a immunoblastic variant. 5 patients with lymphoepithelial lesions (LEL). Expression of Bcl-6 and MUM1 protein was observed in 8 and 12 cases, respectively, and without expression of CD10 in 12 cases. Al- of 12 patients with DLBCL belong to the non-GCB-DLBCL. Most cases demonstrated high proliferation index, the median of Ki-67 index was 40% and more than 40% was found in 7 cases. Conclusion : Primary breast diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a rare entity, and shows a non-germinal center B-cell phenotype, accurate pathologic diagnosis relies on detailed histological examination and immunochemical study, and treated mainly by chemotherapy combining with othe- therapies.

Summary form only given. At the end of their study, most post-graduate research students will need to decide their career destination, which ends up between two choices - academia or industry. The former was evidently the default choice over the past few decades in Malaysian context. Little was known about any engineering career opportunity post-graduate students with research background in the Malaysian electrical and electronics industry. This is unsurprising given that little was broadly known about research and development (R&amp;D) activities within the industry sector itself. The unadvertised R&amp;D opportunity in the Malaysian Electrical and Electronics Industry is an issue that needs to be addressed. It is not only needed for research and career planning, but it is also a pre-requisite for initiating collaborative research projects that produce industry-relevant research outcome needed for the advancement of the knowledge with beneficial economic impact. This objective is high on the agenda of Collaborative Research in Engineering Science and Technology (CREST). This keynote will reveal those unadvertised opportunities, suggest ways for students, academic community and industry to work together to address pertaining issues, and share programs that facilitate meeting these objectives. The talk shall provide useful information in determining industry relevant research topics, collaborative research opportunity and career choice.

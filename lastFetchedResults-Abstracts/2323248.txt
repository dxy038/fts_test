     The redundancy allocation problem can be described as selecting the components and system configuration in order to optimize some objective function(s) without violating the system constraints. Operating conditions are not constant in many advanced engineering systems. Mostly, in the engineering applications selection, the number of redundancy components must be balanced among the constraints (cost, space, weight etc.) and the improve system reliability. In the presented model, Optimum number of redundancy components obtained by considering the working conditions and constraints in the series-parallel systems. In this model, the number of redundancy components establishing by maximizing the reliability of the system in all scenarios. Finally, for better understanding, a numerical example is presented.

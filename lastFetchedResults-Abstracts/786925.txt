In this paper we study the q-analogue of the jÎ± Bessel function (see (1)) which results after minor changes from the so-called Exton function studied by Koornwinder and Swarttow. Our objective is first to establish, using only the q -Jackson integral and the q-derivative, some properties of this function with proofs similar to the classical case; second to construct the associated q-Fourier analysis which will be used in a coming work to construct the q-analogue of the Bessel-hypergroup.

The objective of this work is to form a general understanding of biological communication mechanisms by applying Shannon information theory and coding theory concepts to study the complex system of information transmission in biological organisms. We assess the viability of a biological coding theory framework by exploring coding theoretic characteristics of the genetic system that parallel traditional communication systems. We present results of channel capacity studies for prokaryotic and eukaryotic replication processes and explore connections between capacity and cellular aging.

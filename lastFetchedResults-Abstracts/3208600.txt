One of the research voids in the study of home-based rehabilitation is the lack of benchmarks of the performance for various body kinematics. The objective of this work is to form a metric to evaluate the wrist motion for rehabilitation applications. The wrist motion components that were considered in this study are the angular velocity and acceleration in each plane of movement, namely Pronation/Supination, Flexion/Extension, and Radial/Ulnar Deviations. Two games were developed to measure wrist motion variables, namely the Cup and plate game (to measure the Supination/Pronation motions), and the Golf game (a horizontal version to measure the Radial/Ulnar motions and a vertical version to measure the Extension/Flexion motions). The derived values can serve as a motion benchmark to detect proper movement and steadiness of the wrist, in order to quantify the quality of patient performance.

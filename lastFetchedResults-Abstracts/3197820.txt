The influence of an additional annealing in the base/emitter module fabrication of state-of-the-art DPSA-SEG SiGe:C HBTs is studied in this paper. The objective of this annealing is to reduce the extrinsic base resistance R<sub>Bx</sub> which in previous studies appeared to limit f<sub>MAX</sub> of DPSA-SEG SiGe HBTs. TCAD simulations and on-silicon measurements are presented for two different base widths. It is shown that the f<sub>MAX</sub> increase brought by R<sub>BX</sub> reduction can be traded for a larger f<sub>T</sub>. A f<sub>T</sub>/f<sub>MAX</sub> frequencies couple reaching 320/390 GHz is demonstrated, associated to a CML ring oscillator gate delay time of 2.2 ps.

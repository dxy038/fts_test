The main objective of the paper is to investigate the enhancement of the heat and mass transfer characteristics for a NH3/H2O bubble absorption process using the CNTs-ammonia binary nanofluid as a working medium. Using the surface modification of CNTs, the CNTs-ammonia binary nanofluid is successfully prepared without the addition of any dispersants. The effects of the mass fraction of CNTs, the initial concentration of ammonia in the binary nanofluid and the flow rate of ammonia vapor on NH3/H2O bubble absorption are studied experimentally. The mechanism of the binary nanofluid enhancing bubble absorption is discussed accordingly. The results show that the mass fraction of CNTs has an optimum value to the effective absorption ratio of the binary nanofluid, and the effective absorption ratio increases with the initial concentration of ammonia increasing.

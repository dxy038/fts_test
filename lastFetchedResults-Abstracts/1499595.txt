Purpose: Satisfied customers of a library might not return to that library due to reasons such as
seeking diversity or the advertisement of competitors. However, the returning of these customers
is the ultimate goal of any service organization. Specialists in the field of marketing consider the
loyalty of customers to the services as the solution to this problem. In one part, this paper discusses
the importance and necessity for the loyalty of costumers and in another, it investigates the role of
social media in increasing the loyalty of costumers to libraries.
Design/Methodology/Approach: Literature review.
Findings: The loyalty of library costumers is necessary in this era. To this end, there must be some
programs in libraries for improving the loyalty of costumers. One of the free and accessible tools is
social media. Social media can improve the loyalty of costumers by increasing direct and bidirectional
interactions, personalizing services and using face-to-face marketing techniques.
Conclusion: Libraries, alike other service organizations, must run customer loyalty programs
and it is very simplistic to suppose that satisfied customers will come back and unsatisfied customers
will not. Using the capabilities and capacities of social media can play an important role in
this issue. In the informal environment of social media, dissatisfaction, as well as satisfaction may
spread rapidly and this may threat the reputation of a library.

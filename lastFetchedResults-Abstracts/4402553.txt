In order to recommend the combined e-learning resources to a learner according to his objective and knowledge background automatically and dynamically, an e-learning process model was presented. The directed-hyper graph was used to model the process which connected the learner, the knowledge and the learning resources. The structure of an e-learning process, the personalized resource requirement corresponding to different kinds of knowledge backgrounds, and the relationship among the process, the learner and the resource environment were modeled graphically and formally. Then how the model support the combined resource optimization personally and dynamically was discussed by using the hyper graph theory and the semantics appended to the model. A set of modeling and optimizing rules and theorems were given too. Through contrasting with the method provided by Acampora, it showed the effectiveness of this method. Finally, the application and limitation of this method was discussed.

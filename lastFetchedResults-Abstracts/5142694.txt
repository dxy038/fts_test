Fast and accurate positioning of corn image is a premise to variable spray. In this paper, a method of locating the centre of strains based on over-segmentation positioning block projection was raised against the growth characteristics and overlapping leaves of hole-sowing plant. Hole-sowing corn was studied as the research objective. Tests showed that the locating error was within 30mm, and the locating time was 16ms, which met the precision and real-time requirements of spray. This method was applicable to location for all stages of seedling crops.

The present paper deals with some questions concerning digital coding of TV signals for ISDN-B applications, without emphasis being placed on the source encoding techniques; the main objective of this paper is not only to indicate the implications caused by the transmission of different TV signals-components according to CCIR Recommendation 601, MAC, and HDTV-but also to investigate the marginal conditions created by digital transmission. Digitization of the signal components, the problems of filtering resulting therefrom, sampling rate conversion, and the new system family MAC as well as aspects of HDTV transmission and coding are described. In the second main part, appropriate substandards are derived from the digital studio standard for digital transmission, using data rates standardized by the CCITT. A description is given of some coder concepts, and finally some important aspects of broad-band techniques are dealt with.

Objective: The main objective of this study was to evaluate comprehension and expression of nouns in a statistically-sufficient sample of normal Farsi-speaking children aging 2.5 to 4 years old. The assessment tools were two tests: a test on picture-naming and a test on picture-pointing. The study was carried out in Isfahan-Iran.
Materials & Methods: In this analyzed research, 2.5-to-4-year-old children (n=252) were selected and assessed from 32 kindergartens by cluster sampling method. The raw data obtained from the picture-naming and picture-pointing tests were analyzed by statistical tests of one-way ANOVA, Spearman correlation coefficient, and non-parametric test of Kruskal-Wallis.
Results: results from this study indicate that, there was a significant difference among the 4 above-mentioned groups regarding mean scores of comprehension and expression of nouns (P < 0.001). This study provides evidence that mean scores of comprehension and expression increased consistent with chronological age. There was a positive direct relation between mean expression and compression scores (r=0.803, P < 0.001). 
Conclusion: the ability of comprehension and expression of nouns develop harmoniously with each other- with relative precedence of comprehension- according to age. The Decrease of standard deviation through 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4-year-old groups may imply a decrease of inter-individual differences in receptive and expressive abilities therefore convergency of these abilities across the whole population. Finally, it is worth to say that picture-naming and picture-pointing tests are appropriate means of demonstrating childrenâ€™s ability of comprehension and expression of nouns at the studied ages.

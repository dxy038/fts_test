Meat is one of the important sources of nutrients required by the human body. In addition to pork, consumers in Taiwan can also choose other livestock or poultry meats such as beef, mutton, chicken, duck, and goose. Traditionally, the superiority evaluation criteria for choosing these 6 meats are mainly based on intuition and sales volumes. Consequently, the present article is focused on quantification as the major objective. The grey entropy analysis of Kansei Engineering was applied and the evaluation criteria were based on multi-dimensional considerations. At first, health, environmental protection, price, cooking time, calories, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins were the factors for the assessment in the psychological perception aspect. The price factor in the psychological impact on the consumer during the purchase was also taken into account. Furthermore, the perceptual factors such as the environmental issue from the impact of the number of veterinary drugs on the Green House gas emissions during husbandry, cooking time, and nutritional contents were also included. Through the quantification approach, different aspects were incorporated for the superiority ranking assessments of 6 meats as the standard for choosing meats. The result achieved by analysis and calculation was basically comparable to the actual circumstances.

Objective
lore the relationship among the amount of food intake of 8- to 12-years old overweight children, their psychopathology (internalizing, externalizing and attention problems) and the mothers' amount of food intake.
s
revious trial designed to test the influence of a preload on food intake, overweight to obese children and their mothers participated in a taste test thereby consuming a preweighed amount of a mousse-like dessert, which was reweighed again at the end. In the current study, we reanalyzed these data by assessing the relationship between children's amount of food intake and their psychopathology, as measured with the Child Behavior Checklist.
s
nd that children with high scores for attention problems consumed larger amounts of food. No such relationship could be observed for children's externalizing problems. Additionally, a positive and direct effect of mother's amount of food intake on children's energy food intake was present even when accounting for children's psychopathology.
sion
s suggest that besides mothers' influence on children's food intake, children's problems to self-regulate impulses may be related to uncontrolled eating behavior and weight gain.

Special components of perfect binary codes are investigated. We call such components i-components. A class of perfect codes of length n with minimal i-components of cardinality (k+1)2n−k/(n+1) for every n=2s−1, s>2 and k=2r−1, where r=2,…,s−1 is constructed. The existence of maximal cardinality nonisomorphic i-components of different perfect codes of length n for all n=2s−1, s>3, is proved.

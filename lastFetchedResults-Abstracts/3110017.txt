This paper treats linear-quadratic optimal control of a thermoelastic rod. The main objective of the paper is to approximate the solution to the infinite dimensional optimal control problem by solving a sequence of finite dimensional optimal control problems for a sequence of approximations to the coupled partial differential equations that represent the axial vibrations and temperature distribution in the rod. Numerical results for two approximation schemes are presented.

Foreign logistics enterprises use information technology and rapid reactive operation to subordinate Chinese logistics market, the logistics information technology level of our countriesÂ´ enterprises increased year by year, and informationization level is also higher and higher. As the internet of things technology development, the logistics information management achieved by the internet of things and related RFID technology and GPS can solve many problems in the field of logistics. This paper designed a kind of cargo transportation management system combining RFID, GPS and GPRS technologies and its functions are as follow: RFID is used to record (into) the goods information; GPS is the orientation of the vehicle; GPRS is to transfer the corresponding data information. Each functional module uses the vehicle-mounted computer to control. The collected information was sent to remote control management center though the GPRS. Thus, they can not only manage the loading of the goods effectively, and also realize the orientation of the vehicle, which achieves the objective of discovering and dealing with the error in time, improving the management of the cargo transport efficiency and reducing the time cost.

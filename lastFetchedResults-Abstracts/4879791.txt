This paper is concerned with carrying out synchronization between two completely different complex dynamical networks, which is called generalized outer synchronization. Our objective is to develop a control scheme so as to achieve this generalized outer synchronization. The derived result is built upon BarbalatÂ´s Lemma. It is shown that when two complex dynamical networks to be synchronized have different topologies and diverse node dynamics, the designed controller is a nonlinear one. In particular, when two complex dynamical networks have the same topological structures or identical dynamics, the designed controller can be simplified, sometimes to a linear controller. Computer simulations are presented to show that generalized outer synchronization can be quickly realized under the designed controller.

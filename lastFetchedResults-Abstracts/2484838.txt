The important situation of management and decision-taking is common factor which that links spatial planning with passive defense. Objective of this research is investigating the spatial distribution and localization of therapeutic land use (important hospitals) of Mashhad city with passive defense approach. Although, emphasis is on passive defense approach, however, because it is closely tied to the issue of spatial planning (especially in urban scale), the findings of the study can also be effective in spatial planning and urban planning. Study area is city of Mashhad that with regard to the diversity of therapeutic spaces, major city hospitals were selected for final consideration. Research methodology is descriptive - analysis method. Findings of Research indicate that the main part of important hospitals in Mashhad have been concentrated in the central part of the city. These regions located in areas of high risk in terms of passive defense. Imbalance between density population and spatial distribution of hospitals in urban areas is strongly noticeable. Finally, with attention to investigations and results, some suggestions for reduction hazards of therapeutic spaces in times of crisis offered.

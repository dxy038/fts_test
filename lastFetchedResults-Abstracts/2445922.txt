The objective of this paper is applying the well-known exact
operational matrices (EOMs) idea for solving the Emden-Fowler
equations, illustrating the superiority of EOMs over ordinary
operational matrices (OOMs). Up to now, a few studies have been
conducted on EOMs ; but the solved differential equations did not
have high-degree nonlinearity and the reported results could not
strongly show the excellence of this new method. So, we chose
Emden-Fowler type differential equations and solved them utilizing
this method. To confirm the accuracy of the new method and to show
the preeminence of EOMs over OOMs, the norm 1 of the residual and
error function for both methods are evaluated for multiple $m$
values, where $m$ is the degree of the Bernstein polynomials. We
report the results by some plots to illustrate the error
convergence of both methods to zero and also to show the primacy
of the new method versus OOMs. The obtained results demonstrate
the increased accuracy of the new ‎method.‎

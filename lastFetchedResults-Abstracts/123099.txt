In the first place,  the present article discusses the hagiography of Sheikh
Shahabuddin Sohravardi and, quoting Ibn Abi Osaibe'a, mentions some accounts about the Sheik. Then the author alludes to the story of Hayy bin Yaqdhan and the most important preoccupation of man, that is, how a stranger can return to his homeland.
Allusions are made to the Sheikh's idea about philosophy. The Sheikh believes that a philosophy whose objective is not to guide the philosopher to achieve spiritual truth is nothing but a mere claim. In the next step the author defines illuminative theosophy and refers to the categorization of this school in the Sheik's book. According to this classification, theosophists are of several groups: some of them are divine sages and some of them are scholarly but are do not belong to the category of divinity. The divine sages too are of several categories. Referring to the idea of Sohravardi about theosophist, the author concludes that Sohravardi puts a theosophist, who has made achievements in philosophy and spiritual experience, at the top of the hierarchy of the theosophists and calls such a theosophist a spiritual mentor.

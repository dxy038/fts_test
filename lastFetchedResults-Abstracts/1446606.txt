The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of pumping, cooking method and endpoint temperature on quality of fresh pork chops. The longissimus was removed from 30 paired pork sides. One side was pumped to 110% of original weight (0.4% phosphate, 0.4% salt+added water). Chops were cut (2.5 cm thick) then fried or grilled to 70 or 80 °C. As endpoint temperature increased from 70 to 80 °C, pork flavor increased (P&lt;0.05) from 95 to 104 (on a 150 point scale) for pumped samples but remained constant in unpumped samples. Juiciness decreased when unpumped samples cooked to 80 °C (62) rather than 70 °C (78). Warner–Bratzler shear values were lower (P&lt;0.05) in pumped chops than in unpumped controls. Pork flavor was higher and off-flavor was lower in fried chops. Pumping loins appears to enhance sensory attributes of chops even when cooked to abusive endpoint temperatures with limited detrimental effects on physical characteristics.

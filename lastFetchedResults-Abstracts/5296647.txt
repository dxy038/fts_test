The objective of this paper is to analyze the albedo-NDVI spectral feature space to develope drought estimation methods using Landsat ETM+ imagery. A simple ratio and differences of surface albedo and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are examined. The methods are compared against field measured soil moisture at Shunyi test site in Beijing, China. Results indicate that there are close correlations between soil moisture and both albedo-NDVI difference index (AVDI) and albedo-vegetation ratio index (VARI). The coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) between AVDI and 5 cm soil moisture is 0.45. The strongest correlation between the VARI versus soil moisture R<sup>2</sup> = 0.4103.

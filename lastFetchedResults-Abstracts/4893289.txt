In this paper we describe a model and solution approach to a day-ahead market (DAM) operations planning problem. DAM operations planning is the first task to be solved by different deregulated-environments system operators, i.e., independent system operators (ISOs). The model presented here considers that offers and bids for power supply, as well as spinning reserve, are sent to the ISO along with time availability and energy limits. The ISO objective is to consider all offers and bids in order to maximize the day-ahead benefits while preserving the systemÂ´s network security. The proposed model allows us to consider load curtailment according to its bids. A DC power-system model is used to handle the network constraints. The resulting large-scale linear programming problem is solved using an interior point method (IPM). Results on a 14-node system are presented

The aim of this paper is to provide some solutions for the stress distribution in rectangular composite patches under inplane
loading. Two different cases are considered: normal stresses and shear stresses. The stress distributions in the patch,
the adhesive and the substrate show evidence of some bidirectional effects, which are not accounted for by usual unidirectional
solutions available in the literature.

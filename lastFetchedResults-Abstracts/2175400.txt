The sulfated seaweed extract, fucoidan, has anticoagulant, antithrombotic, and antiviral activities. Despite extensive work on the biological activities of fucoidan, detailed studies on the genotoxicity of fucoidan from Sporophyll of Undaria pinnatifida sources have not been tested before. The objective of this study was to investigate the genotoxicity effects of fucoidan extracted from Sporophyll of U. pinnatifida using a test battery of three different methods. In a reverse mutation assay using four Salmonella typhimurium strains and Escherichia coli, fucoidan did not increase the number of revertant colonies in any tester strain regardless of metabolic activation by S9 mix, and did not cause chromosomal aberration in short tests with S9 mix or in the continuous (24 h) test. A bone marrow micronucleus test in ICR mice dosed by oral gavage at doses up to 2000 mg/kg bw/day showed no significant or dose-dependent increases in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE), and the high dose suppressed the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) to total erythrocytes. We conclude that fucoidan presents no significant genotoxic concern under the anticipated conditions of use.

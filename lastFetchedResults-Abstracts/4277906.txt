In this work, we propose a flit-level speedup scheme to enhance the network-on-chip(NoC) performance utilizing bidirectional channels. In addition to the traditional efforts on allowing flits of different packets using the idling internal and external bandwidth of the bi-directional channel, our proposed flit-level speedup scheme also allows flits within the same packet to be transmitted simultaneously on the bi-directional channel. For inter-router transmission, a novel distributed channel configuration protocol is developed to dynamically control the link directions. For the intra-router transmission, an input buffer architecture which supports reading and writing two flits from the same virtual channel at the same time is proposed. The switch allocator is also designed to support flit-level parallel arbitration. Simulation results on both synthetic traffic and real benchmarks show performance improvement in throughput and latency over the existing architectures using bi-directional channels.

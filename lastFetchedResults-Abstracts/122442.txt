Background: High blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important modifiable risk factors of cardiovascular diseases .
Objective: To determine the prevalence of high blood pressure (BP) and its relation with other cardiovascular risk factors.
Methods: This cross-sectional study ( phase I of IHHP) was performed on 12494 people over 20 years in 2002 . First a questionnaire consisting of demographic details , drug intake and smoking status was filled out. Then physical examination induding blood pressure, body mass index and waist to hip ratio were performed . Fasting blood sugar, total cholesterol and triglyceride and a 2-hour postprandial glucose was also detected. Data were analyzed using SPSS VI l /win by the chi-square test .
Findings: 48% of the subjects were male and 52% were female with the mean age of 39.0 ± 15.30 and 38.80 ± 14.54 years respectively . The prevalence of high BP in men and women was 15.6% and 18.8% respectively . The prevalence of high BP was higher in women than in men, except in under 25-year age group . Overall 26.7% of hypertensive men and 47.7% of hypertensive women were on anti-hypertensive pharmacological treatment among which BP was under control in 6.4% of the men and 13.8% of the women . In 86.5% of men and 89.3% of women with high BP, at least one other cardiovascular risk factor ( increasing with age) was seen . Obesity (especially abdominal obesity) was the most frequent associated risk factor ( 41.9% in male , 59% in female ). Except for smoking , the prevalence of all cardiovascular risk factors increased with the severity of hypertension .
Conclusion: The high prevalence of BP & its relation with other risk factors necessitate the importance of implementing community - based interventions .

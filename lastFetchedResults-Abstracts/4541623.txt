The objective of the study is to utilize the high resolution PLP and the beacon on the C/NOFS satellite to determine the impact on the equatorial ionosphere of two moderate magnetic storms during solar cycle 24. These two storms perturb various SCINDA sites at dusk. The in-situ C/NOFS data allows the tracking of the plasma bubbles on a global scale. The spectral analysis of the PLP data shows interesting variation in the spectral shapes depending on its location with respect to the bubbles. Current analysis is ongoing to determine the impact of the spectral shapes on UHF scintillations from C/NOFS.

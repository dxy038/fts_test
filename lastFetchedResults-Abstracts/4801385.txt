This paper considers a large-scale service system consisting of a number of service areas (cells). Each cell contains a queueing model that operates continuously and independently from the queueing models in other cells. Each cell changes its state between alive and dead based on certain rules that depend on the queueing status of its own queue, the neighboring queues, and the whole community, while satisfying a constraint on the number of live cells in a neighborhood. The objective is to examine emerging behaviors from the interactions of the cells under various rules. Chaotic, deterministic, and in-between emerging behaviors are presented.

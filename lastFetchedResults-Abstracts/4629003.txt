Software metrics measure certain properties of the software or its specifications. As quantitative measurements are required in all the sciences, there are ongoing efforts among computer science practitioners and academics to apply analogous approaches to software development process. The main aim is to provide objective, reproducible and quantitative measure that can have many useful applications in such important parts of software project management as the schedule and budget planning, cost estimation, quality assurance, software debugging, performance optimization and optimal staff task assignments as well as in the whole software development life cycle. There exist a number of techniques for modeling software metrics including FPA estimation (mean-based, median-based), LS regression, LMS regression, Neural Networks, and Fuzzy Logic. In this paper we are going to talk about singularities of applying Fuzzy Logic approach to the software metrics modeling.

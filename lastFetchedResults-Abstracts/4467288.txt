The main objective of this document is to compare the performance between Fuzzy Logic controller (FLC) and Proportional Integral Derivative controller (PIDC) in improving the performance of DC/DC Buck Converters. The evaluation of the output has been carried out and compared by software simulation using MATLAB Simulink. Fuzzy logic controller has been implemented to the system by developing fuzzy logic control algorithm. The signals will be processed based on the fuzzy logic rules-based and PID algorithm.

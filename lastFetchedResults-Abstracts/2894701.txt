The objective of this paper is to present a new profile for the design of embedded systems at the system level, appointed CoMMix Profile. This profile offers unified concepts for designing the systems level. It privileges a component-based approach based inspired by AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) and as well SysML and UML-Marte standards. Modeling CoMMix system is described as an assembly of the components and architectural mappings.

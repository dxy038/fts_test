Introduction: Headache is a common complaint in children. Uncertainties about definition and the absence of a diagnostic marker can make identification of headache types difficult. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency, duration, symptoms and aggravating factors of migraine and tension-type headaches in school children.
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional population-based study was performed in 2003. A total number of 2226 subjects were selected using multistage random sampling procedure, from 43 elementary schools in Shiraz. Data were collected by screening questionnaire followed by clinical interviews, general physical and neurological examinations, and diagnostic criteria of International Headache Association (IHA). A total number of 228 children (10.2%) met IHA criteria for recurrent headache.
Results: A total number of 38 children (1.7%) had migraine and 122 children (5.5%) had tension-type headache. 39.5% of children with migraine reported to have an aura. During the attack, 34.2% of the migraineurs and 23% of children with tension-type headache had to stay in bed. Only 40% of children were diagnosed for their headache before the study. In 23% of migraineurs the duration of headache was less than 2 hours. Majority of children reported to have bilateral headaches.
Conclusion: In several respects our findings differ from the IHA criteria. Applying IHA criteria, children with recurrent headache require a careful history and physical examination.

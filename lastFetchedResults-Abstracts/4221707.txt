This work presents a microscopic 2-dimensional TCAD (technology computer aided design) simulation of an edge-emitting laser (EEL), with the objective to investigate the effect of temperature and carrier distribution on the spatial distribution of optical intensity. Simulation of the optical far field pattern is crucial in order to optimize the coupling efficiency of the laser with the optical fiber and single mode stability. The device under investigation is an InGaAs/AlGaAs narrow stripe laser with graded index carrier confinement (GRICC) and single quantum well (SQW) active region manufactured by Bookham. A fully self-consistent electro-optical-thermal model, consisting of Helmholtz equation, PoissonÂ´s equation, drift diffusion equations, heat transport equation and photon rate equation is calibrated with far field measurements taken at different driving currents and ambient temperatures.

Objectives
udy objective was to assess the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
ound
is insufficient evidence about the association of ACEI or ARBs with mortality in patients with CKD.
s
stic regression analysis was used to calculate the propensity of ACEI/ARB initiation in 141,413 U.S. veterans with nondialysis CKD who were previously unexposed to ACEI/ARB treatment. We examined the association of ACEI/ARB administration with all-cause mortality in patients matched by propensity scores using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox models in “intention-to-treat” analyses and in generalized linear models with binary outcomes and inverse probability of treatment weights in “as-treated” analyses.
s
e of the patients at baseline was 75 ± 10 years, 8% of patients were black, and 22% were diabetic. ACEI/ARB administration was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality both in the intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio: 0.81, 95% confidence interval: 0.78 to 0.84; p &lt; 0.001) and the as-treated analysis with inverse probability of treatment weights (odds ratio: 0.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.34 to 0.41; p &lt; 0.001). The association of ACEI/ARB treatment with lower risk of mortality was present in all examined subgroups.
sions
s large contemporary cohort of nondialysis-dependent patients with CKD, ACEI/ARB administration was associated with greater survival.

The main objective of this paper is to address both technical and financial aspects of a solar home system compared to Stirling engine system with our proposed model. The solar dish Stirling engine with solar tracker, tracks the sun ray to provide higher output power at a less cost compared to Solar Home System (SHS). In this paper it is shown that our proposed voltage controller provides higher efficiency than the other existing controller system.

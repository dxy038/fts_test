Following the first IET Conference on Wireless Sensor Networks in Beijing in 2010, as promised here are a number of selected papers from the Conference proposed by the Steering Panel, combined with many from the open call for papers which entered the long queue of the journalÂ´s editorial process. This has resulted in 9 papers presented in this prestigious Special Issue. Considering all sensing systems feature scarce resource objectives we see that all papers consider this critically important objective but broadly speaking our 9 papers can be classified into three areas: Topological Papers (2), Deployment Papers (2) and Application Papers (5). The papers are briefed below.

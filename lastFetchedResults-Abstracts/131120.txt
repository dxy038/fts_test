BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In this study, laparascopy was evaluated to diagnose infertility. METHODS: This study was done on the files of 221 infertile patients who referred to Fateme Zahra infertility center in Babol during 1997-2000. Data was gathered from the files of patients and then analyzed.
FINDINGS: Seventy seven percent of the women had primary infertility and 23% secondary. The commonest risk factor was abnormal HSG (hysterosalpingography) that in primary infertility was 44% that was more than secondary infertility (33%). The most abundant abnormal laparascopic findings, in primary and secondary of infertility were pelvic adhesion 24% and 27% and also unilateral tubal obstruction 17% and 25%, respectively. Also, the report of laparascopy following the abnormal HSG 27% normal and 73% abnormal (p<0.001). The amount of diagnostic accuracy of HSG as compared with laparascopy was obtained 67%.
CONCLUSION: According to this study, the commonest agents were pelvic adhesion and tubal obstruction and the commonest risk factor in infertility was the abnormal HSG. Based on the findings, it is suggested that laparascopy in females who have had primary infertility and normal HSG and who have not any risk factors can be performed later.

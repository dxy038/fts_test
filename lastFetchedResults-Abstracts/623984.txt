Background and Objective:  Teachers’ evaluation is considered one of the important strategies for education quality enhancement in universities. The objective of the current study was to investigate the students’ viewpoints about the evaluation criteria of teacher’s performance in theoretical courses in Golestan University of Medical Sciences.
  Material and Methods: This cross- sectional study was conducted, in 2008, on 330 students of various disciplines.  They were recruited via stratified random sampling and asked to fill out a valid and reliable questionnaire including 63 closed questions, which are related to individual, scientific and professional fields.  Using SPSS software, we analyzed the data by descriptive statistics, independent t -test, and Anova and Pearson correlation.
Results: Seventy-three-point-three (n=242) are females and 26.7% (n=88) males.  The most important factors in teacher's evaluation are Professional characteristics (4.22±0.42).  Their scientific ability (4.14) and individual characteristics (3.86%), respectively, are the other factors. In professional characteristics,  “The verbal skills and teaching methods" with the mean of 4.64; in scientific ability, "the knowledge and scientific power" with the mean of 4.65 and in individual issue, “patience and good humor" with the mean of 4.61 are the most important issues. Sixty-two-point-four percent of students believe that they are honest about their evaluation and 59.4% of them claim that their evaluation is reliable.  
Conclusion: In spite of the importance of the scientific abilities, the verbal skills and teaching methods are considered the most prominent ones.  The Students’ viewpoints can be used as an important part of teachers' evaluation for recognizing and eliminating the shortcomings.

First, it is concluded that re-designing the objective lens of system is a good method to obtain maximum performance at fixed refractive index of media. Also, two systems cutting SIL and none cutting SIL were compared as re-designing objective lens. The result says that two systems are the same practically. Therefore, in designing the system, it does not need to consider the cutting the SIL. In comparing with Opti and Hyper, Opti has more tolerance that Hyper in certain respects. Hence Opti can be a suitable system for optical data storage. Adding to this, it is possible to minimize the error due to production process by moving the collimate lens.

Simultaneous optimization of shape and ßow parameters is performed for a combined free and forced
convection ßow through vertical rectangular channels with moving walls. The laminar ßow is assumed to be
fully developed in the axial direction. The wall velocity, the axial pressure gradient and the channel height in
the transverse plane are taken as the optimization parameters. The sensitivity expressions of both the
objective function and the ßow rate constraint of optimization are obtained in terms of the relevant physical
variables, as well as adjoint variables which satisfy additional p.d.e.Õs. All equations are discretized using the
Þnite element method. Numerical results are provided for the present constrained optimization problem for
various values of the problem parameters which include the moving wall segment size and the Rayleigh
number. The results indicate that with increased Rayleigh number the optimal values of the wall velocity and
the axial pressure gradient are increased, while the optimal value of the channel height is decreased. General
sensitivity expressions are also presented in the appendix which might be utilized for arbitrary boundary
variations along with arbitrary optimization objectives in other investigations.

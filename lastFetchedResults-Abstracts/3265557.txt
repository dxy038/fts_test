In this paper, a virtual machine placement model to maximize resource utilization, balance multi-dimensional resources use and minimize communication traffic simultaneously within the data center is proposed. The multi-objective problem is simplified by employing average valued inequality and positional constraints. The improved genetic algorithm with local heuristic method and elitism strategy is developed to solve the problem. The simulation results show that performance gains in all aspects can be achieved by the proposed model and algorithm compared to the existing algorithms.

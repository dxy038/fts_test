The problem presented in this paper is the identification of eleven parameter values of a 4th-order state equation used to model the incremental lateral dynamics of an aircraft subject to a step aileron deflection. The objective is to minimize the difference between the model´s response and recorded inflight test data in a least squares sense. State sensitivity functions, which describe the variation in the model´s state response for small, constant parameter perturbations, are used to develop an iterative solution to the identification problem. Results for three sets of initial parameter values show that the method rapidly converges to the same solution set.

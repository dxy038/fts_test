Modeling dispersion in homogeneous porous media with the convection–dispersion equation commonly requires computing effective transport coefficients. In this work, we investigate longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients arising from the method of volume averaging, for a variety of periodic, homogeneous porous media over a range of particle Péclet (Pep) numbers. Our objective is to validate the upscaled transverse dispersion coefficients and concentration profiles by comparison to experimental data reported in the literature, and to compare the upscaling approach to the more common approach of inverse modeling, which relies on fitting the dispersion coefficients to measured data. This work is unique in that the exact microscale geometry is available; thus, no simplifying assumptions regarding the geometry are required to predict the effective dispersion coefficients directly from theory. Transport of both an inert tracer and non-chemotactic bacteria is investigated for an experimental system that was designed to promote transverse dispersion. We highlight the occurrence of transverse dispersion coefficients that (1) depart from power-law behavior at relatively low Pep values and (2) are greater than their longitudinal counterparts for a specific range of Pep values. The upscaling theory provides values for the transverse dispersion coefficient that are within the 98% confidence interval of the values obtained from inverse modeling. The mean absolute error between experimental and upscaled concentration profiles was very similar to that between the experiments and inverse modeling. In all cases the mean absolute error did not exceed 12%. Overall, this work suggests that volume averaging can potentially be used as an alternative to inverse modeling for dispersion in homogeneous porous media.

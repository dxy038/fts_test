This study aimed at identifying the impact of interactive and non-interactive multimedia training on student's learning at fourth grade experimental science class at elementary school which particularly considered the impact of the multimedia on the two components of the learning speed (rate) and learning accuracy. The methodology of the study was quasi-experimental and based on the objective of the study it was applied by nature. Therefore, the study sample included all students at fourth grade elementary school studying in the city of Sari (2350 students) in the educational year of the 2009-2010 who were grouped into two classes of 20 students (both control and experimental groups) through applying cluster random sampling. The data gathering tools were the standard questionnaire of "Toloz -Piroun" accuracy test and the researcher-made speed test of which the reliability and validity were measured. The tests were administered as the pretest and post test for both control and experimental groups. The data analysis was conducted by applying descriptive statistics and the inferential statistics including t-test and paired t. The results of the study showed that there were significant differences between interactive and non interactive multimedia training. In other words, the interactive multimedia training had a higher degree of impact on students' learning than non-interactive multimedia training which was also true for the learning speed and learning accuracy, that is, the interactive multimedia training is more efficient and helpful in learning speed and learning accuracy compared with the non-interactive multimedia training.

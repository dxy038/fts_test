In this paper, we firstly consider an optimization problem with a linear objective function subject to a system of fuzzy relation inequalities using the max-product composition. Since its feasible domain is non-convex, traditional linear programming methods cannot be applied to solve it. An algorithm is proposed to solve this problem using fuzzy relation inequality paths. Then, a more general case of the problem, i.e., an optimization model with one fuzzy linear objective function subject to fuzzy-valued max-product fuzzy relation inequality constraints, is investigated in this paper. A new approach is proposed to solve this problem based on Zadeh’s extension principle and the algorithm. This paper develops a procedure to derive the fuzzy objective value of the recent problem. A pair of mathematical program is formulated to compute the lower and upper bounds of the problem at the possibility level α . From different values of α , the membership function of the objective value is constructed. Since the objective value is expressed by a membership function rather than by a crisp value, more information is provided to make decisions.

The objective of the paper is to reduce the losses and improve the voltage profile of the radial distribution system with optimally placing the multiple distributed generator in the system. In this paper analytical expressions for optimal siting of distributed generators (DG). The optimal sizing of distributed generators by Improved Analytical (IA) method and Harmony search algorithm. The analysis is carried out on IEEE-33 bus and IEEE-69 bus systems.

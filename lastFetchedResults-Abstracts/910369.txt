SWAT is a physically based model that can simulate water quality and quantity at the watershed scale. Due to many of the processes involved
in the manual- or autocalibration of model parameters and the knowledge of realistic input values, calibration can become difficult. An autocalibration-
sensitivity analysis procedure was embedded in SWAT version 2005 (SWAT2005) to optimize parameter processing. This embedded
procedure is applied to six small-scale watersheds (subwatersheds) in the central Texas Blackland Prairie. The objective of this study is to evaluate
the effectiveness of the autocalibration-sensitivity analysis procedures at small-scale watersheds (4.0e8.4 ha). Model simulations are completed
using two data scenarios: (1) 1 year used for parameter calibration; (2) 5 years used for parameter calibration. The impact of manual
parameter calibration versus autocalibration with manual adjustment on model simulation results is tested. The combination of autocalibration
tool parameter values and manually adjusted parameters for the 2000e2004 simulation period resulted in the highest ENS and R2 values for
discharge; however, the same 5-year period yielded better overall ENS, R2 and P-values for the simulation values that were manually adjusted.
The disparity is most likely due to the limited number of parameters that are included in this version of the autocalibration tool (i.e. Nperco,
Pperco, and nitrate). Overall, SWAT2005 simulated the hydrology and the water quality constituents at the subwatershed-scale more adequately
when all of the available observed data were used for model simulation as evidenced by statistical measure when both the autocalibration and
manually adjusted parameters were used in the simulation.

Transportation systems can be represented by graphs with travel weights accorded to each of the edges that represent the roads to be travelled. This paper gives brief introduction of the EulerÂ´s path and the description of Chinese postman problem. The said problem is then extended to multi-objective problem by considering multiple weights for each edge. Finally, this paper presents an algorithm to solve this multi-objective problem and implements the same on a biobjective Chinese postman problem.

Objective: The present research investigates the link between aspects of a learning organization with job burnout among librarians working in NLAI.
Methodology: A survey method was employed. Data were collected using Demographic Characterization questionnaire, Marsick and Watkins Dimension of the Learning Organization Questionnaire (DLQQ) and Maslash Burnout Inventory. Sample included all NLAI librarians.
Findings: Findings indicated that there is a negative significance between the seven dimensions of learning organizations and emotional fatigue. While investigating the links between dimensions of learning organization with the dimension of metempsychosis, a negative significance was observed only between the dimension of “established systems for acquiring and sharing learning” and “provision of strategic leadership for learning”. Furthermore, individual performance displayed a positive significance with dimensions of “established systems for acquiring and sharing learning”, ‘Empowerment for achieving common prospect”, “learning organization link with environment” and “Provision of strategic leadership for learning”.

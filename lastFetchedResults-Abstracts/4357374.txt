This paper presents an image watermarking scheme based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) on non-overlapping blocks of both the host image and the watermark image. The singular values of each non-overlapped block of binary watermark are embedded into the singular values of corresponding non-overlapped block of the host image using the Multiple Scaling Factors (MSFs) of firefly algorithm. Finally, the objective function is to be computed to know the best scaling factor for embedding. In addition to this, various types of attacks (like compression, gaussian filtering, sharpening, scaling and cropping etc..) are applied on embedded image to show the robustness of the proposed watermarking scheme. The proposed watermarking scheme gives better optimization, less computations, robustness and good at visual quality. For this, the Structure Similarity Index measure (SSIM) is used to indicate the measure of imperceptibility and robustness of watermarking scheme.

Summary
argeted agents have shown efficacy in advanced renal cell carcinoma. These agents were evaluated in pivotal phase III clinical trials using different treatment settings and different patient populations. As patients encountered in ‘real life’ clinical practice are frequently under-represented in phase III trials, making treatment decisions based on phase III data alone may have limitations. In order to support treatment decisions for patients who do not fit within the inclusion criteria of many phase III trials, physicians must consider additional data sources such as expanded access programmes, sub- and retrospective analyses, and also clinical experience. The suitability of a specific targeted agent for a given patient group, e.g. elderly, will depend on a number of factors, including disease-, patient- and treatment-related characteristics.

we identify the need for an individualised patient-focused approach to the management of advanced renal cell carcinoma in clinical practice. In order to optimise therapy for individual patients, we present a schema providing guidance on the wide range of parameters that should be considered when making treatment decisions. We recommend the integration of this approach into everyday clinical practice.

As sensor networks are battery powered and it is uneasy to recharge, the primary goal in this field is to reduce energy consumption and enhance network lifetime. To achieve this objective we must reduce the energy consumption during the routing functionality and use sensor nodes in an equitable manner. The aim of this paper is to propose a new protocol for multi-path routing in which nodes choose one route among several routes with a probability which will counts the residual energy, the energy of the communication and the number of paths including the forwarding node. Our approach allows the sensor nodes of the network wasting their energy in an equitable manner in order to enhance the lifetime of the sensor network. This is proved by simulation on SENSIM. We have implemented our solution and compared it with EAR and FEAR, results show that our protocol outperforms EAR and FEAR by enhancing the network lifetime.

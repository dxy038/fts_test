This paper presents a novel FET/IGBT gate drive circuit for high power applications. Full galvanic isolation is provided, no floating power supplies are needed and continuous (DC) gate drive is possible. The circuit topology consists in essence of an inverter coupled to a synchronous rectifier. Bidirectional current flow to reverse-bias the gate is obtained by using field-effect transistors operating in the third quadrant as switching elements

Evaluation of the safety production situation is a multi-objective decision-making problem. In this paper, the comprehensive index system of capital safety production was firstly set up, which including inherent risk, supervision personnel allocation, regional economy, accident, supervision and management capacity and development potential. Secondly, 23 second-level indexes were combined to 6 third-level indexes using the AHP approach. The DEA model with weight constraints was proposed to evaluate the situation of safety production. Finally, as an illustration, the proposed method was applied to evaluate the situation of safety production in 18 districts of Beijing during each month of 2009. The case study shows that the proportion of districts whose compositive index of safety production equals 1 to all is small, and the supervision and management level of every district need to be improved.; there is no big difference in the situation of districts; seasonal difference in the situation is detected (the compositive index in January, February, and March of 2009 is higher than other months).

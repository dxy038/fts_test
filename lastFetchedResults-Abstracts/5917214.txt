In a shipboard power system, all components of the system, including sources, loads and distribution have multiple commitments and responsibilities. These commitments include serving the energy needs of a local load, but also maintaining the efficiency and stability of the overall system. This paper proposes a differential game-theoretic approach that uses a componentÂ´s objective and operating characteristics to plan an optimal state trajectory without the need for extensive communication or centralized control.

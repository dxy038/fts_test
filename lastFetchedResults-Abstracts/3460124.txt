A preaccelerator is being developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in a program to demonstrate the accelerator technology which will be needed for power plants utilizing inertial-confinement fusion (ICF). The preaccelerator has been constructed and is now undergoing performance tests with the initial objective of achieving pulsed 30 mA beams of 1.5 MeV Xe+1. The design, construction, and initial performance of the preaccelerator are described.

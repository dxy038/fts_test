This paper focuses on an autonomy of computer agents and explores its architecture that can generate its objective by itself without being provided by humans. For this purpose, we propose the agent architecture that has the auto-associate memory as the internal factor and the resource limitation as the external factor for generating the objectives of the agent. To evaluate our proposed agent architecture, we apply it to the "fruit game" which is the simple game of guessing a type of fruits, and have revealed the following implications though the intensive simulations: (1) the auto memory association enables the agent to generate the specific objective and (2) the resource limitation is indispensable for generating the objective itself.

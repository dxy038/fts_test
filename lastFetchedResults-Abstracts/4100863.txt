In a device using binary rate multipliers and reversible counters (up/down counters or bidirectional counters) to perform arithmetic operations, the result of computations could oscillate up and down around the exact answer. This oscillation can be minimized by means of backlash units (digital filters). However the introduction of the backlash units will cause an additional error on the computing time. This paper analyses the additional error in an experiment with a system performing multiplication.

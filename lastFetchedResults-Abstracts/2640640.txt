 Background Road traffic injuries (RTIs) impose a significant
                            social and economic burden. Objectives The objective of this study was
                            to estimate the medical costs and economic burden caused by RTI in Iran
                            Methods The major components included in this study were medical costs,
                            lost output, and indirect costs. Cost components and their values in
                            2011 were obtained using previous data collected during the study. A
                            general approach that included a consideration of capital was used to
                            calculate the cost of RTIs. Results The economic burden of RTIs was
                            estimated to be more than 111,000 billion Iranian rials (IRR) ($4.44
                            billion USD) in 2011. This cost relates only to the health sector and
                            does not include components such as vehicle damage, lost time in
                            accidents, and the administrative costs of insurance and police
                            services. The estimated cost of RTIs to the health sector was about
                            2.18% of Iranâ€™s total GDP in 2011. Conclusions The medical costs and
                            economic burden caused by RTIs in Iran clearly indicate that injuries
                            should be a significant concern for health policymakers and medical
                            planners.

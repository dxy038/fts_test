In the study, a robust nonlinear L<sub>&#8734;</sub>-gain output feedback tracking control design for robotic systems is proposed under persistent bounded disturbances. The design objective is to find a reduced-order observer-based controller such that the peak of the tracking error in time domain must be as small as possible under persistent bounded disturbances. Since the nonlinear L<sub>&#8734;</sub>-gain optimal tracking control for robotic systems can not be solved directly, the nonlinear L<sub>&#8734;</sub>-gain optimal tracking problem is transformed into a nonlinear L<sub>&#8734;</sub>-gain tracking problem by giving a desired (prescribed) disturbance attenuation level for the L<sub>&#8734;</sub>-gain tracking performance. The proposed robust L<sub>&#8734;</sub>-gain controller is based on a reduced-order observer, which is constructed to estimate the velocity signal only and whose dimension is half of the dimension of robotic systems, and is suitable for practical control design of robotic systems.

The objective of this study was to determine whether supplemental dietary iron (Fe) would protect against cadmium (Cd)-induced injury in the liver and kidneys of bank voles. The rodents were provided, for 6 weeks, Fe-adequate (60–80 μg/g) and Fe-enriched (250–270 μg/g) diets containing 0.05 (control), 40, and 80 μg Cd/g. Histological examinations and analyses of Cd, Cd bound and not bound to metallothionein (MT), Fe, and lipid peroxidation in liver and kidneys were carried out. The Fe-enriched diet prevented Cd-induced histopathological changes as well as deprivation of tissue Fe and lipid peroxidation. Also, supplemental Fe significantly decreased hepatic and renal Cd burden. However, in the Cd-80 bank voles fed the Fe-enriched diet, the non-MT-bound Cd, considered a toxic species, reached 4.7 μg/g liver and 13.7 μg/g kidney, these values being similar to those at which histopathological changes occurred in the voles fed Cd diets not supplemented with Fe. The data indicate that the protective effect of supplemental Fe in the bank vole may be due to the prevention of Cd-induced deprivation of tissue Fe and Fe-dependent oxidative processes rather than to reduction of cadmium accumulation.

Protein structure comparison is a important and developing area in Bioinformatics. Understanding the protein structure is very useful, since protein structure suffers less evolutionary changes compared to the amino acid sequences. Thus, comparing protein structures provides additional evolution information. However, structure comparison is not straightforward and multiple algorithms for comparison have emerged recently. In this paper we evaluate the performance of algorithms based on contact maps and Calpha, and their respective objective function, which is a measure of biological and evolutionary importance. The contributions are a state-of-the-art review of protein structure comparison algorithms that have not been compared with other servers. Further, we compare findings and evaluate them across others methods already proven effective.

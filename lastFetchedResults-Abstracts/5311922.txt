It is anticipated that a variety of cars with diversified features that include anti-lock braking system (ABS), traction control system (TCS) antiskid steering, collision warning system (CWS) will be more commercially produced to satisfy the consumer needs in the near future. This is parallel to the trend of current technology of manufacturing smart cars and the desires of people who always want to have comfortable and safe ride in their vehicles. Moreover this type of vehicles can fit much better into the intelligent highway that Malaysian government is planning to have in the near future. Consequently, there is a need to modify the current conventional braking system so as to make it work automatically. This paper considers the use of an intelligent controller to achieve the above objective. To ensure high speed of system response, a DSP controller TMS320C24x with an embedded fuzzy algorithm is used in the implementation of this new device. Results of simulation studies using MATLAB have demonstrated the feasibility of this new system under investigation

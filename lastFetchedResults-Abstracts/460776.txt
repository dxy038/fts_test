Objective
Risk factors of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) caused by central venous catheter (CVC) use at a university hospital were evaluated.
Design

A prospective, observational, hospital-wide study was conducted.
Setting

The study was conducted at a university hospital with 1050 beds.
Methods

Nontunneled catheters were used, and double or triple lumen was observed. Catheters were cultured by semi-quantitative method, and blood cultures were performed if necessary. All epidemiologic and clinical data were recorded without intervention during the study.
Results

Over a 1-year period, the study assessed 389 CVCs inserted in 367 patients (mean age 50.9 ± 18.1 years; 215 [58.6%] men, 152 [41.4%] women). Duration of catheterization was 12.0 ± 9.9 days. CVCs were inserted into either the subclavian vein (N = 263; 67.6%) or the jugular vein (N = 128; 32.4%). In 250 episodes (64.3%), antibiotics were used concomitantly. CR-BSI was found in 43 of all CVCs (11.1%). The rate of CR-BSI per 1000 catheter-days was 9.21 for the whole cohort. In multivariable analysis, only renal failure (OR 4.83; CI 1.32-17.66; P = .017) was found to be a risk factor for CR-BSI.
Conclusion

Renal failure was an independent risk factor for CR-BSI.

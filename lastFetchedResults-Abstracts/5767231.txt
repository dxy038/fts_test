Objective VHDL was developed to utilize the object-oriented paradigm to the hardware design process. In order to facilitate flexible modeling of communication among (entity) objects appropriate to the specific context, no message passing mechanism has been integrated into the language. Based on earlier ideas related to message passing with Objective VHDL the paper demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete communication mechanism. As an example a non blocking handshake protocol is chosen. Special emphasis has been given to an abstract user-interface and good reusability of the communication mechanism

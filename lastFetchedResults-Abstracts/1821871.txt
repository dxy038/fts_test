Objective
de concentration in dentine has been recommended as the best marker for the level of chronic fluoride intake and the most suitable indicator of an individual's total body burden of fluoride. We analysed fluoride concentrations in the dentine of cheek teeth of European roe deer from fluoride-polluted habitats to retrospectively assess the level of fluoride uptake into the tissue. Thereby, we tested the hypothesis of the existence of mechanisms that limit fluoride intake of individuals and fluoride exposure of forming dental hard tissues during the late foetal and early postnatal periods in the species.

electron-microprobe analysis, fluoride profiles were obtained on sectioned P4s, M1s, and M3s from individuals exhibiting pronounced dental fluorosis. Fluoride concentrations were compared between early formed (peripheral) and late-formed (juxtapulpal) dentine both within single teeth and amongst the three different teeth studied.
s
eral dentine of the M1, which is formed during the late foetal and early postnatal periods, exhibited markedly lower fluoride concentrations than juxtapulpal dentine of the same tooth and both, peripheral and juxtapulpal dentine of P4 and M3 that are formed post-weaning.
sions
udy provides strong support for the hypothesis that in the European roe deer the prenatal and early postnatal (pre-weaning) stages of dental development are (largely) protected against exposure to excess fluoride. This is attributed to the operation of certain protective mechanisms during these periods.

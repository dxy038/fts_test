This paper reports on a study undertaken within the CEPT SE42 project team, with the objective of deriving regulatory out-of-block radiation limits for mitigating the impact of adjacent-channel interference between TDD and FDD terminal stations (TSs) in the 2.6 GHz band. We present a novel stochastic approach for the calculation of TS block-edge mask (BEM) out-of-block (or baseline) limits. Appropriate BEM baseline limits are subsequently derived via Monte-Carlo simulations based on interferer TS spatial densities commensurate with those observed in busy hot-spots. It is shown that, for a typical activity factor of up to 12.5%, a TS BEM baseline limit of -22.5 dBm/MHz is sufficient to ensure that the victim TS is desensitized by 3 dB with a probability of only 5%.

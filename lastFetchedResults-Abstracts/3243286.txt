This paper presents a method to estimate voltage profiles on source distribution system using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm. The profiles are estimated for 24- hours with time interval of 1 minute. The objective of this research is to reduce loss by controlling source of voltage per-unit. When voltage source is controlled, the losses occur on the system is reduced drastically. Power System Simulation for Engineering (PSS&#8482;E) Software and Python Programming was used in the simulation of IEEE 69 test bus system, while ICA is programmed using MATLAB R2012b version. The losses of simulation results with different tap changer and voltage set are compared and discussed in this paper.

In this paper we introduce a fully non intrusive test method which is based on the Differential Electro-Magnetic Analysis (EMA). Our objective is to demonstrate the capability of this new method to detect stuck-at-0 faults voluntary injected in a full-custom circuit. This detection is carried out by comparing a reference trace, called Reference Signature, with a differential trace representing the observed electromagnetic activity. The results show the efficiency of the proposed method. We will then introduce the possibility offered by EM measurement to be used to detect degradation of physical parameters on equipments where no intrusions are allowed.

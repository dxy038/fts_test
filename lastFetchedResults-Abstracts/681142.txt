This paper compares the results from a single-stage clustering technique (average linkage) with those of a two-stage technique (average linkage then k-means) as part of an objective meteorological classification scheme designed to better elucidate ozone’s dependence on meteorology in the Houston, Texas, area. When applied to twelve years of meteorological data (1981–1992), each clustering technique identified seven statistically distinct meteorological regimes. The majority of these regimes exhibited significantly different daily 1 h maximum ozone (O3) concentrations, with the two-stage approach resulting in a better segregation of the mean concentrations when compared to the single-stage approach. Both approaches indicated that the largest daily 1 h maximum concentrations are associated with migrating anticyclones that occur most often during spring and summer, and not with the quasi-permanent Bermuda High that often dominates the southeastern United States during the summer. As a result, maximum ozone concentrations are just as likely during the months of April, May, September and October as they are during the summer months. Generalized additive models were then developed within each meteorological regime in order to identify those meteorological covariates most closely associated with O3 concentrations. Three surface wind covariates: speed, and the u and v components were selected nearly unanimously in those meteorological regimes dominated by anticyclones, indicating the importance of transport within these O3 conducive meteorological regimes.

The combination of semiconductor photocatalysis with cross-flow microfiltration accompanied by periodical back-washing was investigated in a pilot plant. The investigation included the testing of membrane materials because the membrane must resist the abrasion and the periodical back-washing. Another objective of this investigation was to assess the potential of two different TiO2 materials (Hombikat UV100 and P25) for continuous photocatalytic degradation of persistent organic pollutants. The study focused on the longâ€“term stability of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 during its continuous application. The combination of photocatalysis and cross-flow microfiltration allowed the separation and reuse of TiO2 after the photocatalytic degradation of clofibric acid, carbamazepine and iomeprol. The investigations showed that the photocatalytic activity of P25 and Hombikat UV100 was constant during continuous usage over several days.
This study indicates the high potential of the combination of heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation processes with cross-flow microfiltration accompanied by periodical back-washing of the membrane. Thus environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals and X-ray contrast media can be transformed and mineralized in a continuous water treatment process.

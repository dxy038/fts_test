An optimization model with a linear objective function subject to a system of fuzzy relation equations with Yager's union operator in special case is presented. The solution set of such a fuzzy relation equations is a non-convex set. In this paper, we characterize the feasible solution set and then, optimize a linear objective function. In order to optimize it, we convert it to an equivalent problem involving 0-1 integer programming with a branch-and-bound solution technique. Furthermore, a concrete example is included for illustration purpose.

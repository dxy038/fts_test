Organizational ethics of today's world of the West, by creating harmony and consistency, developing codes of conduct, both organizational and legal, help western organizations to perform tasks with maximum efficiency and effectiveness and expedite the achievement of the goals and missions. Although the Islamic ethics and especially moral conduct of Imam Ali (A.S.) and His style in governance has necessary integrity in management of the government, society and individuals, but still it is seen that organizations do not achieve acceptable results. It seems that the thought and culture of management has not reached to a level of Islamic belief to know adherence to moral principles the best practices and strategies to achieve maximum efficiency and effectiveness yet, though achieving the virtues of morality has been recognized as the objective of the divine messengers and subsequently the formation of the government based on religious rules. Among these, the role of management and decision making ways of managers in appearing moral behaviors has been emphasized. Thus, the present study tries to enumerate norm-breakings which may occur in the management of organization considering Islamic teachings of management and especially Imam Ali (A.S.) commands and sermons. And avoiding these kinds of norm-breakings makes Iranian organizations closer to Islamic organizations.

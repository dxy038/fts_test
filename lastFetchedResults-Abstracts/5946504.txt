The objective of this study is to investigate the combined effects of micro-modeling (modeling reduces to a trivial level in maturity) and remodeling on the development of trabecular bone with aging or during menopause. The adaptation of trabecular bone involves modeling and remodeling processes. Although many models have been made to investigate the process of bone adaptation and provide insight into understanding of it, they failed to distinguish really bone modeling from remodeling. In our study, the computational model was divided into micro-modeling and remodeling components. Micro-modeling component was responsible for the net increase or decrease of trabeculae density; while remodeling component employed microdamage that distribute randomly within bone tissue as stimuli to initiate Basic Multicellular Units to replace and repair damaged tissue. Finally, the combined model was applied in conjunction with finite element method to a two-dimensional simulated trabecular bone structure. During the simulation, the developments in bone microstructure and material properties have been monitored. The results suggested that trabecular bone deteriorated and became anisotropy inevitably in elder individuals or post-menopause women. This work provides a novel methodology for the numerical simulation of bone morphological changes under the regulatory of biological-mechanical factors.

In Aristotle’s view, the explanation of an object or an issue is carried out according to the real form or reasonable essence and the utmost objective (ghayat) it has and the goal it achieves. For instance, why do objects fall? According to Aristotle and his followers, motion is explained as per the innate tendency of anything seeking to return to its natural resting place. The resting place or “natural station” of fire is up and that of the earth is down. The heavier objects have a stronger tendency downward, hence should fall faster. The motion’s utmost objective – in both meanings of extreme and purpose and objective – is more of interest than the trends that take place in the meantime or prior to it. Thus, causality is described with respect to the future goals (ultimate causes) and essential inclinations (formal causes), rather than by the impressions of past events (efficient causes), which act upon passive and talented matters (material causes).
The above words do not mean that observation had no place in Aristotelian science. Aristotle had personally done considerable researches on biological classification, which involved accurate observations. However, the issue of ultimate objective, i.e., assuming 
everything and every action as purposeful and with an ultimate goal, had not yield theories that can be tested by earlier experiences.

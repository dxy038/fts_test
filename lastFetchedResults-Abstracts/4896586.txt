In cloud computing, data generated in electronic form are large in amount. To maintain this data efficiently, there is a necessity of data recovery services. To cater this, in this paper we propose a smart remote data backup algorithm, Seed Block Algorithm (SBA). The objective of proposed algorithm is twofold, first it help the users to collect information from any remote location in the absence of network connectivity and second to recover the files in case of the file deletion or if the cloud gets destroyed due to any reason. The time related issues are also being solved by proposed SBA such that it will take minimum time for the recovery process. Proposed SBA also focuses on the security concept for the back-up files stored at remote server, without using any of the existing encryption techniques.

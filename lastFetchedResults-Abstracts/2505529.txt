Dependence on chemical fertilizer continually is increasing. Continual increasing of using chemical
fertilizer causes nature pollution (e.g. water contamination). This has led researchers to aggressively investigate
renewable fertilizer resources, biomass, to produce organic crops and reduced wastage. Wormy compost is a
bulk solid and biomass feed stocks. Wormy compost flow is obstacle as it often becomes confined by Clogging
and bridging which occurs during storage and processing. The objective of this study was to review the
primary factors affecting flow-ability and wall friction characteristics of granular solids and powders, as well
as devote testing methodologies for this biomass material. It can be said that high moisture content and small
particle size has an adverse effect on the flow property of wormy compost. Increasing the moisture content
and decrees particle size of the wormy compost reduced its flow-ability from free flowing at moisture content
of 25% (w.b.) and 1.18mm in particle size to cohesive at moisture content of 35% (w.b.) and 0.3mm in particle
size. The maximum values of friction angle were occurred for Steel, Galvanized and Aluminum surface,
respectively.

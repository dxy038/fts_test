Background: The antioxidant components have been identified in some pine species. Antioxidant properties of proantocyanidins reduce free radicals induced by DNA fragmentation and lipid proxidation and also proanthocyanidines could curb lipid peroxidation. 
Objective: In this study, we analyzed different parts of Pinus eldarica (bark, seed and needle) and assessed their antioxidant contents. 
Methods: Pine specimens were collected from four different geographic locations in Tehran. 
The HPLC method (UV detector, C18 reverse phase column, 4.6 mm (25 cm, and water/ H3PO4/ methanol/ acetonitril as eluant) were employed for evaluating total polyphenols. The wavelength for detection of polyphenolic compounds was 280 nm in this study. 
Results: The highest range of total polyphenols was detected in the bark of this pine, specially reported a considerable amount of tyrosol in Pinus eldarica. Tyrosol stimulated resistance to oxidative stress and also has anti aging effect.
Conclusion: The high amount of total phenolic compounds in P. eldarica bark might be attractive for future research considering its health benefits.

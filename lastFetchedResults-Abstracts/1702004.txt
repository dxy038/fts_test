Objectives: Cultural Intelligence (CI)  is well recognized as individuals’ ability to adapt to new cultures and includes four capabilities; CI strategy, CI knowledge, CI motivation, and CI behavior. The objective of this study is to measure cultural intelligence and investigate likely impacts of demographic characteristics of the context on university students. Method: For this purpose, a sample of 320 students of different faculties from a large Iranian university with student population of approximately 20000, was randomly selected. Cultural intelligence was measured using a questionnaire that was manipulated through factor analysis and focus group discussion to assure its conformity. Appropriate statistical analysis including One-sample T-test, Independent-samples T-test, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis were utilized to analyze research data. Result: The result of our research shows that cultural intelligence of population under study is slightly above average based on a five- point Likert scale. However, no significant differences exist among students of different genders, fields of specialization or levels of study. It was also noticed that there is a significant difference of CI between students living on and off campus. In other words, students using university accommodation have higher CI than those living off campus.  Conclusion: It was further noticed that CI motivation of male and female students, CI knowledge of on and off- campus students, as well as CI motivation and knowledge of undergraduate and graduate students, are significantly different. Finally, this study did not recognize students’ field of specialization as a source of significant differences of cultural capabilities among students

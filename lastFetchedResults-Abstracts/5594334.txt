Clustering the nodes and controlling the number of cluster heads and members provides an effective way of energy efficiency. In this paper, we develop a clustering protocol for single hop wireless sensor networks. In the proposed algorithm some of the nodes become volunteers to be cluster heads. We develop a time based competitive clustering algorithm that the advertising time is based on the volunteer nodeÂ´s residual energy. We assign to every volunteer node a competition range that may be fixed or variable as a function of distance to BS. The volunteer nodes compete in their competition ranges and every one with more energy would become clusterhead. Our objective is to balance the energy consumption of the cluster heads all over the network. Simulation results show the more balanced energy consumption and longer lifetime.

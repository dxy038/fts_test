Trust is the cornerstone for a successful and lasting relationship with the customer it largely determines the customer´s future behavior and loyalty towards the business. The main objective of this research paper is to investigate the relationship between trust and electronic banking adoption. This empirical research involved 307 respondents those completely response the questionnaire from a total of 511 questionnaires distributed in three universities located in the northern states. As a result, trust was found positively influence e-banking adoption. As an implication, the banks have to ensure that e-banking services fully satisfied their customer to ensure a repeat usage and loyalty among them. Somehow, future research must investigate other factors as the antecedent for electronic banking adoption. Other initiative is to consider a model testing in difference context of electronic service to see any generalization on the research result.

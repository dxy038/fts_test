Smart sensors differ from conventional ones in their ability to process a high amount of data close to the source and in the ability to communicate in a bidirectional way. In this article, we show the reasons to make sensors smart, identify the design challenges of the software running on smart sensors, and put forth our software platform. In our solution, we adopt the event-driven components with bidirectional interface and provide alternative scheduling policies for specific applications. This component infrastructure also supports diversity of connections by including a hierarchical communication model. Additionally, we present our solutions to improve the reliability of these software systems.

Objective
MyStudentBody.com-Nutrition (MSB-N) is an internet-based nutrition and physical activity education program for college students.
Method

Students from six universities (N = 476) in the U.S. were randomly assigned in the fall of 2005 to one of three groups: MSB-N (Experimental I), MSB-N plus Booster (Experimental II), or an attention placebo control group.
Results

Experimental I and II group participants increased their fruit and vegetable intake by .33 and .24 servings, respectively, relative to the control group at post-test. Both experimental groups improved their motivation to change eating behaviors (p < .05) and were also more likely to increase their social support and self-efficacy for dietary change (p's < .05). Experimental groups also improved their attitude toward exercise (p < .05), but no behavioral changes in physical activity were noted.
Conclusion

MyStudentBody.com-Nutrition is an effective internet-based program that may have wide applicability on college campuses for nutrition education and promoting change in health behaviors.

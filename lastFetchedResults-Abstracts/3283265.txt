This article presents a novel method of optimizing sensor node location of wireless sensor network (WSN) in a circular arrangement. Appropriate selection of active collaborative beamforming (CB) nodes and cluster are needed each time to perform CB in WSNs. The nodes are modeled in circular array location in order to consider it as a circular antenna array (CAA). This newly proposed intelligent circular sensor node array (ICSA) is further presented to solve the problem. In particular, the selected collaborative nodes and the desired objective can vary significantly. Analyses obtained are compared to those from previous work. The findings demonstrate a better beamforming performance, and the difference is shown in normalized power gain.

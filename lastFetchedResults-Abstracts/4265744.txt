Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) has the potential to reduce the cost of owning and operating Electric Vehicles (EVs) while increasing utility system flexibility. Unidirectional V2G is a logical first step because it requires less infrastructure and does not degrade EV batteries from cycling. This work develops an optimal combined bidding formulation for regulation and spinning reserves to be used by an aggregator. Two different aggregator revenue structures are explored as objective functions. These algorithms maximize profits to the aggregator while increasing the benefits to the customers and utility. Simulations over a one month period on the ERCOT system verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show differences in performance of the two algorithms.

The SONET technology employed in reducing the complexity, cost and number of transmission systems of a public network makes the creation of the telecommunication superhighway system for transporting signals for a wide range of services at high speed possible. But SONET technology can also create a certain degree of complexity in building a cost-efficient SONET network, especially in the case of SONET SHR (self-healing ring). It is a challenge to the network planner to find an efficient way to select the most economical SONET ring, or combination of rings, for demands between a set of nodes that are expected to be connected in a certain type of ring configuration. To gain the full benefit of the economics and services SONET might have to offer, effective ways for ring selection must be found. Routing decisions, especially for bidirectional rings, play a key role in deciding the ring capacities which the ring is supposed to meet. We present two efficient demand loading algorithms for BSHR, and analyze the results from their application on a variety of demand patterns, to find criterion for ring selection

This paper presents the analysis and novel controller design for a hybrid switched-capacitor bidirectional dc/dc converter that is applicable for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)/plug-in HEV energy-storage system (ESS) applications, based on the power of the traction motor and the gradient of the battery current. Features of voltage step-down, voltage step-up, and bidirectional power flow are integrated into a single circuit. The novel control strategy enables simpler dynamics, compared with a standard buck converter, with input filter, good regulation capability, low electromagnetic interference, lower source current ripple, ease of control, and continuous input current waveform in both modes of operation (buck and boost modes).

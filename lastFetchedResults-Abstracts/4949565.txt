The electrically small self-resonant wire antennas can be designed using a genetic algorithm. It has also been shown that the resonant frequency of the antenna can be further reduced by immersing the antenna in a dielectric, thus further reducing its electrical size. The main objective of this investigation is to compute the Q and dielectric loss for the electrically small self-resonant antenna for both free space and when it is immersed in a dielectric.

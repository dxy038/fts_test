Making decision usually occurs in the state of being uncertain. These kinds of problems often expresses in a formula as optimization problems. It is desire for decision makers to find a solution for optimization problems. Typically, solving optimization problems in uncertain environment is difficult. This paper proposes a new hybrid intelligent algorithm to solve a kind of stochastic optimization i.e. dependent chance programming (DCP) model. In order to speed up the solution process, we used support vector machine regression (SVM regression) to approximate chance functions which is the probability of a sequence of uncertain event occurs based on the training data generated by the stochastic simulation. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps: (1) generate data to estimate the objective function, (2) utilize SVM regression to reveal a trend hidden in the data (3) apply genetic algorithm (GA) based on SVM regression to obtain an estimation for the chance function. Numerical example is presented to show the ability of algorithm in terms of time-consuming and precision.

The objective of this study was to examine whether dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) is removed from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea by adhering to atmospherically deposited loess particles sinking through the water column. In a series of radiolable experiments, loess from the Negev Desert, treated in various ways, was added to surface (SSW) and deep (DSW) seawater spiked with 32PO4−3. It was shown that when fresh loess reaches the Mediterranean SSW approximately 1.3 μmol P/g are released ( 11% of the total P concentration). Biological activity and inorganic particles removed similar amounts of the tracer (30–40%) from SSW. It was estimated that about 0.2 μmol P/g of ‘aged loess' (proxy of particles sinking into DSW), were removed from poisoned SSW and DSW, while there was minor adsorption when either nothing or quartz powder was added. The adsorbed DIP accounts for approximately 15% of the released P and is equivalent to about 2% of the remaining P (11.17 μmol P/g loess). Therefore, the process of DIP removal by atmospherically derived particles exists, but due to the higher release of P, the result is a net addition of dissolved atmospheric phosphorus in seawater. It is postulated that in actual SSW where dust concentrations are much lower, biological uptake out-competes inorganic adsorption, although it was demonstrated that the decrease in loess particle concentrations tends to increase their adsorption capacity. As the loess descends into the DSW it continues to remove DIP and thus transports phosphate from the water column to the sediments. A preliminary quantitative estimate suggests that the process of DIP removal by loess particles cannot explain the phosphate ‘deficit' in the Eastern Mediterranean DSW characterized by unusually high DIN/DIP ratios ( 27) reported by others.

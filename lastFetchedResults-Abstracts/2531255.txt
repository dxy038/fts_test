The questionnaire’s reliability was confirmed by Cronbach alpha with a coefficient of 90. The content validity of the questionnaire was measured by employees’ opinions. SPSS 16 was used for the statistical analysis. Results: Assessing the effective factors on cultural development indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between current and optimal status (p<0.001) (95% CI: 1.435.00). Results indicated that there is a significant difference in cultural development between current status and optimal state among the staff of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.

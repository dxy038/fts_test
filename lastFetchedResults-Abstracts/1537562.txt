Abstract
Background and Objectives
Clopidogrel is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs to prevent ischemic events following coronary syndromes or stent placement. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 2C19 enzyme (CYP2C19) genotypes in the Iranian population.

Materials and Methods
CYP2C19 (*1/*2/*3) variants were analyzed using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Length Polymorphism (PCRâ€“RFLP) assays in a representative sample of 154 Iranian patients with ischemic heart disease in Peyvand Laboratory.

Results
In this study, out of 154 Iranian patients the frequency rates of CYP2C19 *2 were 36 (23.4%) in heterozygous and 6 (3.9%) in homozygous forms; 112 (72.7%) patients had the normal genotype.

Conclusions
FDA recommendations are more useful to be practiced in our country than other countries. Physicians should identify patients and advise them to consider other antiplatelet medications or alternative dosing strategies in poor metabolizers.

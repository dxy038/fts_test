This paper describes the binaural cue preservation of a noise reduction algorithm for bilateral hearing aids, namely the multichannel Wiener filter with interaural transfer function extension (MWF-ITF). An extra term is added to the cost function to preserve the binaural cues of both the speech and noise component of a signal at the cost of some noise reduction. This paper combines the theoretical analysis with objective binaural performance measures and a perceptual evaluation.

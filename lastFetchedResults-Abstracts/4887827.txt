The fuzzy comprehensive model was established with fuzzy c-mean cluster method. Based on this fuzzy model, the operation state of anaerobic system, divided into stable, relatively stable, relatively unstable and unstable, was estimated. The results showed that the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is suitable to judge different operation state in anaerobic system, and to discover the relationship among factors of system parameters and evaluation results. The fuzzy model is objective and gives all-round and more accurate reflection of operation state. It is help for improving the management and control effect of anaerobic system.

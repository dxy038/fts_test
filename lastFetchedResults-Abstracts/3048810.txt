We present results for PID controller synthesis of a single-link inverted pendulum-based biomechanical model with control effort constraints. A model of human neuromusculoskeletal system using single-link inverted pendulum and a PID controller was earlier developed. The model included dual position and velocity feedback from muscle spindles, and force feedback from Golgi tendon organ, with neural transmission latencies included in the reflex feedback loops. We extend the earlier results on characterization of stabilizing PID controllers to include additional criteria involving initial control effort constraints. In most cases, such a design objective would help avoid nonlinearities such as actuator saturation.

Iterative coordinate ascent algorithms have been
shown to be useful for image recovery, but are poorly suited to
parallel computing due to their sequential nature. This paper
presents a new fast converging parallelizable algorithm for
image recovery that can be applied to a very broad class of
objective functions. This method is based on paraboloidal surrogate
functions and a concavity technique. The paraboloidal
surrogates simplify the optimization problem. The idea of the
concavity technique is to partition pixels into subsets that can
be updated in parallel to reduce the computation time. For fast
convergence, pixels within each subset are updated sequentially
using a coordinate ascent algorithm. The proposed algorithm is
guaranteed to monotonically increase the objective function and
intrinsically accommodates nonnegativity constraints. A global
convergence proof is summarized. Simulation results show that
the proposed algorithm requires less elapsed time for convergence
than iterative coordinate ascent algorithms. With four parallel
processors, the proposed algorithm yields a speedup factor of 3.77
relative to single processor coordinate ascent algorithms for a
three-dimensional (3-D) confocal image restoration problem.

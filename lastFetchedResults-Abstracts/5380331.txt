The composite materials are becoming more and more used in aircrafts design. Their light weight and their excellent robustness make them attractive compared to metallic materials which have been widely employed till now (aluminum for instance). However, an important drawback is their electric conductivity which is quite weak compared to the metallic one. Thus, in case of lightning phenomenon, the outside circulating current is not evacuated in the same way as in aluminum structures with possible damages to the on-board devices. The objective of this article is to compare the performances of two cylindrical samples made of composite and aluminum respectively. The PEEC (Partial Element Equivalent Circuit) method is applied to model their electrical behavior in terms of an equivalent circuit, which is then supplied with the standardized lightning current in order to evaluate its impact upon the structure. The conducted and radiated EMC modes are both investigated by means of two different test-cases. Conclusions concerning the level of currents, frequency range involved and EMC performance are then drawn.

The objective of this paper is to propose a novel three-port flyback-type single-phase micro-inverter with active power decoupling circuit (APDC). The proposed micro-inverter can improve the performance of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) while reducing the size of the input capacitor. The electrolytic capacitor would be replaced by the film ones and the reliability of the micro-inverter can be improved significantly. The operation principle of the proposed micro-inverter will be explained. The computer simulation results of a 200W micro-inverter would be presented to verify the performance of the proposed micro-inverter.

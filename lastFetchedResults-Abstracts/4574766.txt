Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are increasingly being used to implement large datapath-oriented applications that are designed to process multiple-bit wide data. Studies have shown that the regularity of these multi-bit signals can be effectively exploited to reduce the implementation area of datapath circuits on FPGAs that employ the traditional bidirectional routing. Most of modern FPGAs, however, employ unidirectional routing tracks which are more area and delay efficient. No study has investigated the design of multi-bit routing architectures to effectively transport multiple-bit wide signals using unidirectional routing tracks. This paper presents such an investigation of architectures which employ multi-bit connections and unidirectional routing resources to exploit datapath regularity. It is experimentally shown that unidirectional multi-bit routing architectures are 8.6% more area efficient than the conventional routing architecture. This paper also determines the most area efficient proportion of multi-bit routing tracks.

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine whether peripartum cocaine use shortens labor.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1220 gravidas delivering at an urban county hospital (November 1991 through April 1992) had urine specimens sent for toxicology studies. Cervical dilatation on admission and time intervals during the course of labor were recorded. Analysis of covariance and exact tests for multiple contingency tables were used to compare duration of labor by cocaine use after we adjusted for other factors.
RESULTS: Compared with nonusers, women who had positive test results for cocaine were older, were of greater parity, and were admitted to the hospital at greater cervical dilataiton (4.63 cm vs 3.96 cm, p< 0.05). The duration of labor from admission to birht was also shorter (336 vs 565 minutes, p< 0.001). After we controlled for type of delivery, parity, birth weight, and prenatal care, there was no significant difference in labor duration in any stage.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in duration of any stage of labor related to cocaine use after patients' obstetric characteristics are controleld for.

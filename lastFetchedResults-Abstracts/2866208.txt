This paper describes the effect of cooling from a surface of power Si MOSFET on hot spot temperature. In traditional thermal design of electronics, the temperature distribution of chips is assumed to be uniform for simplicity of thermal design. However, in recent years, thermal problems of electronics are more serious, because electronics have been downsizing. Therefore, we should consider the temperature distribution of the chips. In a chip, semiconductor devices are mounted, and the generation of hot spots in semiconductor devices is widely known. Therefore, the chip has non-uniform temperature distribution. However, the detail of thermal properties of power Si MOSFET, which is one type of transistor, is not clear. Power Si MOSFET has large thermal problems, because high voltage is applied to power Si MOSFET. Therefore, we should obtain thermal properties of power Si MOSFET. Thus, the objective of this study is investigation of thermal properties of power Si MOSFET for high reliability of electronics. In this paper, as a fundamental study, we investigate the effect of cooling from the surfaces of power Si MOSFET on hot spot temperature using electro-thermal analysis. As a result, it was investigated that the effect of cooling from the top surface of the device on hot spot temperature is small.

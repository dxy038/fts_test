Introduction & Objective: In recent years stem cells have been evaluated for regenerating lost tissues. Therefore, many studies aimed to assess isolation of these cells from different origins, and culture them. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells derived from periodontal ligament of periodontitis affected teeth in melatonin con-tained media.
Materials & Methods: In this experimental-laboratory study after tooth extraction and isolating the apical segment of the roots, the periodontal ligament tissue was removed. Cells were ex-panded and after the third passage; flow cytometery analysis was performed to evaluate the surface markers (CD 105, CD146, CD90, CD 45, CD31, CD34, CD106 and CD 73). Adher-ent cell layer was used for osteogenic differentiation in melatonin contained osteogenic me-dia. Then, osteogenic differentiation was evaluated using alizarin red staining, alkaline phos-phatase and calcium content tests were performed. 
Results: Quantitative analysis of alizarin red staining on the 28th day demonstrated that miner-alized nodule formation in the group supplemented with melatonin was higher than the con-trol group. Results from alkaline phosphatase activity test on the 7th, 14th and 21st days dem-onstrated that, this activity was higher in the group supplemented with melatonin. Also, the amount of calcium on the 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days, in melatonin group, was higher than the control group.
Conclusion: Melatonin (50 ÂµM) may be beneficial for differentiation of PDL stem cells into osteoblast.

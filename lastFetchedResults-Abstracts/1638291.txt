The objective of this study is to identify the mechanisms and associated variables of horizontal cracking in continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) and to develop mitigation methodologies. To this end, the laboratory and field testing were carried out. The behavior of CRCP at relatively early ages under environmental loadings was measured and compared with numerical analysis. The effect of factors related to design, materials, and construction on the horizontal cracking potential was evaluated through the comprehensive numerical analysis. It is expected that this study could help develop or improve design standards and/or material or construction specifications to prevent distress from horizontal cracking in CRCP.

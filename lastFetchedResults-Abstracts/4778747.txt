This paper describes an experimental implementation of a variation of the Reverse Direction (RD) Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol (RDP) defined in the IEEE 802.11n using the Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP). The proposed approach, named Bidirectional MAC (BidMAC), allows the receiver of a valid data sequence to perform an RD transmission to the transmitter without contending for the channel. Whereas in RDP the RD transmission must be initiated by the transmitter, in BidMAC it can be dynamically initiated by the receiver according to its traffic requirements. Previous results based on mathematical analyses and computer-based simulations have shown that BidMAC can better balance downlink and uplink transmission opportunities in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) where the Access Point (AP) handles bidirectional data flows for some of its wireless stations (STAs). This paper aims at going one step further and demonstrating that such superior performance can be attained in real environments. Towards this end, an implementation of BidMAC has been carried out in a reference design of WARP compatible with the IEEE 802.11a/g and tested in a proof-of-concept network formed by an AP and two STAs. Experimental results confirm the superior performance of BidMAC when compared to the legacy Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) of the IEEE 802.11 versus the traffic load, packet length, and data rate, yielding gains of up to 60%.*

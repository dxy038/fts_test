Developing an efficient stent for treating atherosclerotic related diseases requires effective and appropriate methodology for the optimization of its design factors. Present work reports the use of a multi-parameter computer-aided-design (CAD) model for optimization of stent design. A defined aggregate objective function including mechanobiological and haemodynamical objectives which affect stent response in human blood vessel was minimized using the proposed model. FEM results indicate that the stents made of Nitinol can increase the risk of stent restenosis (ISR) and allergic contact dermatitis due to Ni2+ ions releasing. Moreover, a drug delivery simulation of Heparin and Paclitaxel, two commonly used drugs in drug-eluting stents, indicated that a conjugated Heparinâ€“Paclitaxel drug is more favorable.

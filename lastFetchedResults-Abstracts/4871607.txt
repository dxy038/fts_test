In this paper, our objective is to minimize passengers waiting times at the bus stops by making buses wait at a stop. We compare a simple rule based approach to a Monte-Carlo method to reach this objective. When allocated enough time, the Monte-Carlo method gives better results. If the passengers arrivals and the bus travel times are known, the best algorithm is nested Monte-Carlo search with memorization which clearly outperforms nested Monte-Carlo search without memorization as well as Monte-Carlo and rule based regulation.

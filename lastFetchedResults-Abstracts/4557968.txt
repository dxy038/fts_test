Recent developments in streaming video and information technology have made it possible to design video-on-demand (VoD) based learning systems that allow on-campus and off-campus access to learning material available in video format. The wide-spread approach to computer based and distance education is to present mainly text based material as Web pages or as other graphics enriched text presentation forms through the World Wide Web or CD-ROMs enriched with video clips. An alternative but as yet not widely explored approach is possible where video presentations can be made the central media for the coverage of the concepts but this time, the additional material in the form of text, graphics, visualization models, presentation slides and other document forms may be inserted in the presentation project in support of the video presentation. This work describes the design of a pedagogically enhanced video-on-demand (PeVoD) system for the implementation of a complete computer assisted learning (CAL) or asynchronous distance education (ADE) system. The main objective is the provision of a pedagogically enhanced learning environment that allows the traditional VoD systems to include synchronized "html" based pages for additional clarifications on the subject material. Furthermore, all the other features of a dynamic Web page, such as animation, flashing objects, color, forms, special icons, dynamic links, graphics, sound can be used in conjunction with the VoD based video material presentation. The system incorporates a number of features including the facility for student interaction with the learning material. Other features include communications facility between the learners, learners and the instructor, threaded discussions, chat and discussion forums. These help create an environment for active and student centered learning system.

This work proposes a formulation for the design of low-order robust damping controllers for power systems. The proposed control formulation employs an alternative design objective, based on the energy of the system output, to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional regional pole placement in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The formulation allows setting a performance index only for the response modes of interest. The control formulation is less costly in terms of computational effort when compared to the one with the traditional regional pole placement. This work also establishes a relation between the value of the energy of the system output and the damping ratio of the system output. In this paper, the methodology is applied to generate damping controller for synchronous generator. However, the proposed procedure is general enough to be applied to other kinds of power plants (wind generation, for example), to FACTS devices, as well as to other dynamic systems.

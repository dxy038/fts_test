The objective of the speech distortion weighted multichannel Wiener filter (MWF) is to reduce background noise while controlling speech distortion. This can be achieved by means of a trade-off parameter, hence, selecting an optimal trade-off parameter is of crucial importance. Aiming at incorporating knowledge about the resulting speech distortion and noise power, in this paper we propose to compute the trade-off parameter as the point of maximum curvature of the parametric plot of noise power versus speech distortion. To determine a narrowband trade-off parameter, an analytical expression is derived for computing the point of maximum curvature, whereas to determine a broadband parameter an optimization routine is used. The speech distortion and the noise power terms can also be weighted in advance, e.g. based on perceptually motivated criteria. Experimental results show that using the proposed method instead of the MWF improves the intelligibility weighted SNR without significantly degrading the speech distortion.

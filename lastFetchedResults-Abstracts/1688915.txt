Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 30-20-10 training on anaerobic power, mental health, heart rate, blood pressure and rate of perceived effort.

Materials and Methods: This study was semi-experimental on 40 male students with a mean age 25.2±6.5 years, height 175.22±4.05 cm, weight 80.4±10.33, body mass index 26.25±4.3 kg per square meter, and VO2max 25.15±6.5 ml kg min-1. Aerobic power, mental health, blood pressure, heart rate and rate of perceived effort (Borg scale) of students before and after10 sessions of 30-20-10 training was measured. The data were analyzed with paired t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient method at P?0.05 significance level.

Results: After performing program training, aerobic power index (VO2max) (25 ± 6.5 vs. 29.17 ± 4.5) shows a statistically significant increase (p?0.05), while rate of perceived effort (18.5 ± 1.2 vs. 16.2 ± 3.7), systolic blood pressure (141 ± 20 vs. 133 ± 22) and mental health (22.08 ± 4.17 vs. 18.01 ± 5.69) indicate a significant decrease (p?0.05).

Conclusion: 30-20-10 training improves the psychological and physiological parameters of untrained subjects simultaneously. This type of training can be used in physical education classes in university, since resulting a in the maximum of psychological and physiological benefits from minimum training volume. Thus, according to the present results, using 30-20-10 training (or similar practices and new exercises) for untrained subjects (students) instead of using the boring and repetitive training in physical education classes is recommended.

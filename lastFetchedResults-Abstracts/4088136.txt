This study presents a modified shunt-stub dual-band impedance transformer. The load impedances can be complex and unequal at two uncorrelated frequencies. The proposed transformer has two parts; each part is composed of a two-section transmission line. Similar to the single-stub matching network at a single frequency, a two-section transmission line is connected to the load and transforms the load impedances to normalized unit conductance at the two designated frequencies simultaneously. The resulting susceptances are then canceled out simultaneously by a two-section shunt stub at the two frequencies. The required nonlinear simultaneous equations are derived and solved to obtain the physical parameters of transmission lines. Rearranging the simultaneous equations to construct an objective function with only one unknown variable makes it easier to solve the equations. This approach avoids high-impedance transmission lines by choosing the characteristic impedance of each transmission line first. Return losses for various load impedances are simulated to validate the proposed structures. Good agreements between numerical and measured results validate the proposed structure.

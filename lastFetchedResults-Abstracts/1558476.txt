The main objective of this contribution is to outline briefly, a set of interesting problems in computer science that involve the use of combinatorial objects and techniques. We also present our results for the case of fault-tolerance in hypercube-based parallel computer architectures, where we show the involvement oft-designs andt-covers in the structure of extremal fault-sets, which is useful in the construction of fault-tolerantm-partitions of then-cube.

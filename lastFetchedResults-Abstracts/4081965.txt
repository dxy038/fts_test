The significance of objective tests is dealt with in relation to the various properties of the loudspeaker. The characteristics of a hypothetically perfect vibrating disc are stated and the extent of their achievement in moving-coil loudspeakers for low and high frequencies discussed. In the ribbon loudspeaker the advantage of a uniform mechanical drive over the entire radiating surface is offset by the disadvantage of a small diaphragm area; this may be overcome by the adoption of electrostatic principles. The electrostatic loudspeaker is described and the con siderable advantages of the balanced push-pull type over the single-sided type are pointed out.

T h e m a i n objective of this paper is to report on a newly
developed three phase TCR model which is based on the
use of harmonic switching vectors and discrete convolutions.
This model is amenable to direct frequency domain
operations and provides a fast and reliable means
for assessing 6- and 12-pulse TCR plant performance at
harmonic frequencies. The use of alternate time domain
and frequency domain representations is avoided as well
as the use of FFTs. I n this approach, each single phase
unit of the TCR is modelled as a voltage-dependent harmonic
Norton equivalent where all the harmonics and
cross-couplings between harmonics are explicitly shown.
This model is suitable for direct incorporation into the
harmonic domain frame of reference where all the busbars,
phases, harmonics and cross-couplings between harmonics
are combined together for a unijied iterative solution
through a Newton-Raphson technique exhibiting
quadratic convergence.

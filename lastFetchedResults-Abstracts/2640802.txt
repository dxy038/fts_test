Setting and ranking the government’s goals in the Islamic economics has a significant impact on economic policymaking. Different economic schools offer different views on this issue. This paper seeks to study and rank the objectives of government in the Islamic economics. It makes use of meta-analysis to investigate the works of Muslim writers in this area. According to the research hypothesis, as two main objectives of the Islamic state, justice and economic growth are ranked in order to fulfill the governments’ ultimate goal of contributing to the development of the society in the light of nearness to god .The research findings show that most of schools of economics regard welfare and economic growth as the goal of economy and largely leave ensuring it to the market mechanisms. From the perspective of Muslim economists, Islamic government seeks justice and economic growth and , together with people, plays an active role to meet these objectives. Accomplishment of these goals is an introduction to the role of government in contributing to the development of society. Accordingly, in case of conflict among the economic objectives of Islamic government, the objective is given priority that assists the government in achieving its ultimate goal, i.e. training people for perfection and nearness to God.

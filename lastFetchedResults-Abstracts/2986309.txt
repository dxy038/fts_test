A 300 mm carrier with 25 wafers weighs approximately 16 lbs. (200 mm=8 lbs.) making human transport and manual tool loading within bays undesirable from an injury and incident free work environment perspective. Given these facts, Intel has established a strategy to implement 100% intrabay automation for its 300 mm factories. Intrabay automation has also been shown to increase process equipment utilization and reduce the labor required to operate a factory for 200 mm operations. The objective (purpose) of this analysis was to estimate how intrabay automation, in various stages of complexity, would impact direct labor requirements for 300 mm manufacturing

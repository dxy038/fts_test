The Method of Auxiliary Sources (MAS) with peculiarities, which could be considered to use it efficiently are introduce. The MAS was demonstrated as a suitable method for handling complex 2-D electromagnetic problems 111. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate his efiiciency to the 3-D Problems. Details of realization and results of solution particular problems are presented.

Spectrum sharing has been considered as one of candidate technologies for enhancing spectral efficiency in wireless networks. Efficient cooperation among multiple radio access networks and proper system parameter setting regarding spectrum sharing are required in order to accomplish improvement on the system performance through spectrum sharing in such heterogeneous networks. This paper proposes a spectrum sharing scheme among access networks utilizing licensed and unlicensed band with an objective of enhancing system throughput while satisfying the user quality of service (QoS) under a simple condition of user deployment. A problem formulation to achieve the objective is suggested which enhances the systemÂ´ spectral efficiency.

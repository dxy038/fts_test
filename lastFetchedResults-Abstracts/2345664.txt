Seeking optimal solutions has been one of important tasks in engineering design. Design optimization problems have normally been formulated by aggregating diverse criteria into one single objective function subject to a set of constraints. There is a growing number of engineering systems, however, involving coupling of multiple optimization problems that are competing in nature and yet must simultaneously satisfy various conflicting objectives. Such joint optimization of multiple competing optimization problems is very difficult, if not impossible, to be modelled and solved with traditional multi-objective optimization methods. This paper presents an approach to joint optimization problems based on a Stackelberg game to achieve equilibrium solutions that leverage upon multiple conflicting goals of design.

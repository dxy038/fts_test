Smart antenna, which improves the performance of wireless systems, suppress all interfering signals, and increase the system capacity. The objective of this paper is to provide an analysis of system capacity when using smart antenna with the orthogonal code. A new technique, which uses orthogonal codes in multiple beams to distinguish multiuser is introduced. The properties of linkair communicationsÂ´ large area synchronous (LAS) or smart codes, which are claimed to be fully orthogonal code and are used to combat major interferences, are studied. The effect of spatial multiple beams in an area where density of users is very condense in a cell is also examined. Finally, the system performance in term of system capacity is presented.

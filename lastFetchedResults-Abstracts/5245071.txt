The author presents the series of SMART alternators suitable for high-reliability applications, such as for telecommunications stations. They may be equipped with a special-purpose electronic voltage regulator, the AVIR, capable of bidirectional action, which improves the alternator performance without affecting its reliability. The alternator structure is described as well as the electronic regulator. Machine behaviors with and without the regulator are illustrated. Some typical experimental results are given

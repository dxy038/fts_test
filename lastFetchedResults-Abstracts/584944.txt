The Middle Ages began with the gradual domination of Catholic Church over Europe. The anti-mundane and anti-scientific approach of this religion led to the creation of a situation which is also called the Dark Age. As a result, a man who renounced the world and was inclined to live in monastery, focusing on the hereafter in its catholic sense, was born. In reaction to this approach, humanism and Protestantism were born, which played a crucial role in expansion of modern materialistic civilization and birth of utilitarian human begin who discarded religion. With the victory of Islamic Revolution, the said schools of thought were challenged. The new Islamic approach offered a new human identity based on Islamic thought and practically a new human being was born in our age. The main objective of the present paper is to compare the three said approaches.

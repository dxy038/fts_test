This paper will analyze and compare the performance of a 12/8 switched reluctance (SR) machine with a higher number of rotor poles machine in terms of the power being generated. It will also highlight a new approach to maximize the power generated by the SR machine operating as a generator. There are many variables which affect the power generated by the SR machine such as: firing angles, reference current, speed and voltage. The study indicates that there is an optimal voltage, firing angle and reference current for each speed range. Also by using the single pulse mode operation as opposed to the current chopping mode, the percentage of power generated in the low and medium speed range can be increased. The objective of the work is to identify these optimal parameters and characterize them under closed loop control. The proposed control method allows the voltage to be selected in order to maintain the high percentage of power generated.

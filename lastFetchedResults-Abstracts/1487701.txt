The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between polymorphisms of the heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) gene and variation in intramuscular fat (IMF) content, fatty acid composition, and meat quality in Berkshire breed. We detected an association between IMF content and H-FABP HinfI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotype. The HH genotype showed the greatest IMF content among the genotype classes (P &lt; 0.05). Regarding meat quality traits, only drip loss was significantly different among the H-FABP HinfI RFLP genotype classes (P &lt; 0.01). In the case of fatty acid composition, the degree of saturation of fatty acids was greater in hh-genotype pigs than in HH and Hh genotypes. The H-FABP MspI RFLP genotype affected unsaturated fatty acid content, and the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid (P &lt; 0.05), whereas the H-FABP HaeIII RFLP genotype had no effect on fatty acid characteristics.

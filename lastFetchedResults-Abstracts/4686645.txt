This paper proposes a new design procedure aimed at controller order reduction and structuration. Our main objective is order reduction. However, the proposed method also allows the designer to take controller structuration into account (e.g. nullity of some feedback transfers, roll off and stop band properties). Such a method can be particularly advantageous for redesigning lower order and structured versions of H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> or &#956; controllers which are known to be of very high order. The proposed method is based on the multi-model modal theory and is validated with a realistic example of flexible aircraft control law design

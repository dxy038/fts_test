Summary form only given. Today´s distributed information systems often are collections of existing information sources and as such heterogeneous. Technical integration of heterogeneous sources is supported by CORBA. However, CORBA provides very general support and does not take source specific semantics into account. This also applies to CORBA´s Event Service. Our objective is to enhance CORBA by mechanisms that allow to add application semantics. Our key idea is to provide a flexible configurable event monitoring service, which accepts heterogeneity, for a CORBA environment. Configurable means that we are able to generate code templates at compile time and to provide dynamic parametrization of parts of the service. Event passing semantics follow those developed for active database Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules

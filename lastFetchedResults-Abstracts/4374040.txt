For changing the traditional method based on experience in industrial Ethernet network system (IENS) design, a general one based on load analysis for IECS with redundant topology is presented. As industrial Ethernet network system with hierarchical topology is the key part of redundant topology system, its objective and constraint in design is depicted by graph partitioning mode. Furthermore, GA (genetic algorithm) is proposed to realize the depiction. In order to improve the algorithm ability of local searching and rapid convergence, by introducing simulated annealing operation to GA, a hybrid GA based on schema preprocessing and crowding niche strategy is designed

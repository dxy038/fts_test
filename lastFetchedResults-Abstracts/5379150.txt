In the reuse domain, the necessity of finding a new more suitable description language opposes the need to make reuse an accepted practice, and thus related to standards. This paper presents a new method to reuse VHDL described components in an IP centric manner. The basic object reuse model uses an object-oriented extension of VHDL, Objective VHDL. In contrast to conventional reuse approaches, which imply a considerable re-design effort, this new approach bridges the gap between design and reuse integration. The methodology is implemented in the form of a Reuse Management System which handles the classification, modification, adaption, storage and retrieval of the reuse components

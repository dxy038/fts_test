The study objective was to determine emergency department (ED) patients' perceptions of the specialty of emergency medicine. We surveyed a convenience sample of adult ED patients regarding their knowledge of the specialty of emergency medicine. Responses included: 22% believing that ED physicians have their own practice outside the ED; 26% of patients with primary care physicians expected to be seen by their primary care physician in the ED; 19% thought ED physicians care for patients after admission; 26% thought that ED physicians perform surgery, 62% perceived emergency medicine to be a specialty; 15% have heard of the American College of Emergency Physicians; 71% thought that ED physicians are board certified and 15% thought paramedics were ED physicians. Patients estimated ED physicians' mean annual mean salary to be $100,000 and 61% believe that ED physicians are hospital employees. In conclusion, the specialty of emergency medicine is not well understood by our patients.

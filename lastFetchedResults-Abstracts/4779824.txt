In this paper, we study the Antenna Orientation (AO) problem concerning symmetric connectivity in Directional Wireless Sensor Networks. We are given a set of nodes each of which is equipped with one directional antenna with beam-width &#952; = 2&#960;/3 and is initially assigned a transmission range 1 that yields a connected unit disk graph spanning all nodes. The objective of the problem is to compute an orientation of the antennas and to find a minimum transmission power range r = O(1) such that the induced symmetric communication graph is connected. We propose an algorithm that orients the antennas to yield a symmetric connected graph where the transmission power range is bounded by 6 which is currently the best result for this problem. We also study the performance of our algorithm through simulation.

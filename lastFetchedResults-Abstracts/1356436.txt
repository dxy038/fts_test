Objective: It is not clear whether siblingâ€™s gender ratio is associated with
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study examines
whether inattentiveness severity and hyperactivity/impulsivity severity are
associated with birth order of children with ADHD .
Method: Participants are a clinical sample of 173 children and
adolescents with ADHD and 43 ones without ADHD. Diagnoses were
made using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders forth
edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), diagnostic criteria according to faceto-
face interview with the children and their parents. ADHD DSM-IV
checklist was used to measure inattentiveness and
hyperactivity/impulsivity scores .
Results: The association of birth order and diagnosis of ADHD was not
statistically significant after adjusting for covariate factors. The gender
ratio of siblings is not associated with ADHD.
Conclusion: Birth order and siblings gender ratio are independent of ADHD diagnosis. The results of this study support the fact that genetic factors rather than environmental factor of birth order is associated with ADHD. Moreover, contrary to autism, the current results do not suggest the androgen theory for ADHD.

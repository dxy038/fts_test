The integration in the Moroccan power grid of electrical power via Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) units using parabolic mirrors is expected to have a significant impact on the reliability of the electrical system. Therefore, the objective of this work is firstly to assess the reliability of the Moroccan grid at hierarchical level HL1 (HL1: load covering under the assumption of infinite node) by use of a non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation in which CSP units are introduced. The second goal of this paper is to assess the reliability of the Moroccan grid with an expected common integration of 14% wind and 14% solar energy.

The authors investigate cost-effective sensors that are based on light sensing techniques. A number of light-based sensors were analyzed for use in a mobile robotic application. The objective of the analysis was to develop a cost-effective light-based ranging sensor that may be used as an alternative to sonar. Commercial optoelectronic sensors priced under $500 and several different camera auto-focus systems were examined to determine their suitability for the application. A description of the tests used in the assessments followed by a description of each sensor are included

In this paper, we focus on large-scale multiobjective fuzzy linear programming problems with the block angular structure and examine the efficiency of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method in the interactive fuzzy satisficing method proposed by M. Sakawa et al. After overviewing the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method (1961) and the interactive fuzzy satisficing method, three-objective linear programming problems with 15 coupling constraints are considered in order to show the efficiency of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method over the revised simplex method. Through a lot of computational experiments on workstation for numerical examples with both 50 and 200 variables, the advantages of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method are discussed with respect to processing time and required memory storage

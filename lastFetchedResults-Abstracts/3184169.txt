Biomass derived vegetable oils can be used an alternative fuels for CI engines. In this view the properties measurement of biofuels and its blends with diesel were carried. Biofuels selected for the properties measurement are Undi, Palm and Simarouba. These fuels are added in proportions with pure diesels so as to biodiesel form. These biofuels in transesterfication process are prepared in ethyl and methyl based. The blends of the biofuels are formed in volume proportions of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100 % with commercial diesel. The various physical and the chemical properties of these biofuels and its blends with diesel were measured. From the measured data of these properties trend lines were plotted and the correlations are found. Also comparative studies of these properties of the blends are discussed in terms of its suitability as fuel in the CI engine with emission characteristics. Also the efforts are made, to study the preparation method and its probable effect on CI engine is discussed. The main objective of this study is to find the suitability of these biofuels and its blends as alternative fuel for CI Engine.

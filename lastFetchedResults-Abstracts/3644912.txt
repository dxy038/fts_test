The authors present an efficient technique to model the system load such that the impact of demand-side management (DSM) on the power system can be easily and accurately evaluated. The main objective of implementing DSM in power systems is to change the utility´s load shape, i.e., changes in the time pattern and magnitude of the utility´s load. Changing the load shape as a result of demand side activities could change the peak load, base load and/or energy demand. Those three variables have to be explicitly modeled into the load curve for properly representing the effects of DSM. The impact of DSM will be manifested as higher or lower reliability levels. The proposed technique to model the load duration curve will facilitate the representation of DSM effects on loss-of-load probability, energy not served, and energy consumption. This will provide an analytical method to study the impact of DSM on capacity requirements. So far iterative methods have been applied to study these effects. The proposed analytical method results in a faster solution with higher accuracy. It takes only 18 s on an 80486 PC to solve each case study involving different peak and base loads, and energy use

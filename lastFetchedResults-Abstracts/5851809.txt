A description is given of a bilateral series-resonant inverter for high-frequency link uninterruptible power supply. The inverter consists of a zero-current-switched series-resonant power converter, a high-frequency transformer, and a zero-current-switched cycloconverter, whereby bidirectional power flow is possible and high efficiency is obtained. The output voltage is regulated by controlling the resonant tank energy, and the switching pattern of the cycloconverter is fixed to obtain the high-frequency transformer. A novel control scheme to minimize the output ripple voltage is suggested and verified through computer simulation, and the effects of the circuit parameters on the output voltage ripple are discussed

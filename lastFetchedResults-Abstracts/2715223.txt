The objective of this study is to build up a common approach for the assessment of logistics innovations. Innovations are referred to here as best practices and are considered as existing approaches or solutions providing an answer to a relevant problem or challenge in freight transport. The impact evaluation of logistics innovations takes into account strategic targets, topics covered, transferability and novelty of the best practices. A freight specific multi-criteria analysis approach was designed for the evaluation process.

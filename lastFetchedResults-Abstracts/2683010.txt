Background and Objective: liver disease is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and exercise training is effective in preventing and treating diabetes-induced hepatic injury. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of chronic swimming exercise on the hepatic matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) activity and tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) level of liver tissue in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. 

Materials and Methods: In this study, 28 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (7 rats per group) of control, diabetes, exercise, and diabetes-exercise. Diabetes was induced by alloxan (90 mg/kg, i.p.). The animals exercised by swimming training at 5 min to 30 min per day, five days a week over 8 weeks. The rats were killed 48 h after the last treatments and liver MMP-2 and TNF-? level were evaluated by zymography and  ELISA methods. One-way analysis of variance was used for data analysis.

Results: Findings showed that the diabetes significantly increases MMP-2 activity and TNF-? level in animals (p?0.05). In addition, 8 weeks swimming training were associated with a significant decrease of TNF-? level and MMP-2 activity in the liver tissue of diabetic rats (p?0.05). 

Conclusion: It seems that regular swimming training can partially prevent diabetes-induced liver injury via decreasing MMP-2 activity and TNF-? level in diabetic rats.

The present study was performed with the objective to evaluate the effect of scrotal temperature elevation under condition of environmental discomfort (high temperature and humidity) in Santa Inês rams. This inedited study was conducted in Amazonian region during the rainiest period of the year, characterized by high temperature and humidity; condition related to thermal discomfort of the four rams used. The breeding soundness evaluations (BSE) (scrotal-testicular-epididymal biometry and seminal and libido evaluation) were realized before and after the scrotal insulation. The injury resulted in a decrease in the biometric values of scrotal circumference, length, width and testicular volume, between the period of pre-insulation and the one week after the damage (P < 0.05), and the reestablishment to normality occurred on the 13th week post-insulation. The seminal parameters (sperm aspect, sperm mass motility, motility, vigor, concentration and live spermatozoids percentage) showed significant reduction in the post-insulation firsts samplings, with the reinstatement of physiological standards on the 11th week post-insulation. In conclusion, the Amazonian region´s climate (high temperature and humidity rate) indicated heat stress on animals, which had helped to intensify the deleterious effects caused by the scrotal insulation on spermatogenesis and spermatozoids maturation retarding the testicular regeneration process.

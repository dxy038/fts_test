Mobile operators are slowly migrating towards all IP based packet data service of LTE to grab new business opportunity for the demand of end users. As per recent market survey, there would be 80% surge in the demand for data services by 2016 (6.6 million terabytes per month) especially for video on demand, live streaming apps, online gaming, webcast, file sharing...etc. In this scenario, the existing resources may not be sufficient to serve the expected demand. One potential solution could be to fulfill the demand using eMBMS over LTE cell transmission. There is an opportunity for effective utilization of available bandwidth to deliver the required content with an optimal way using eMBMS. To provide these services, carriers are leveraging bidirectional networks using IP based packet technology like LTE. At present there are no commercial systems which can cater these services. The main objective of the proposed architecture is to address the future needs with few key optimizations. The proposed novel literature has multiple objectives. 1) Workable new architecture model to support eMBMS service in MBSFN area using multicell transmission 2) Achieve better performance when compared with the existing model using optimized MCE scheduling algorithm 3)Improve Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) using multicell transmission, as cells are timely &amp; tightly synchronized and can provide better quality of services to the users. 4) Users will have a choice to choose the desired content from User Equipment (UE) either through mobile apps or push messaging technology.

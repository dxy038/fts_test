Background and Objective: Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) is a plant pathogen that is an important mortality factor in immune-compromised and hospitalized patients. We aimed to Isolate and Characterize the Burkholderia Cepacia Strains from Hospitalized Patients in the Hospitals of West Guilan Province.  
 Material and Methods: This study was conducted on 90 saliva and blood samples obtained from patients with blood infection, pneumonia, asthma, patients connected to the monitoring and ventilator systems, and immune-compromised patients in different sections of hospitals such as the pediatrics, internal section, ICU and CCU. Primary screening was performed by cultivating the samples on Burkholderia cepacia selective agar (BCSA); Sensitivity to antibiotics was tested by Kirby-Bauer and Muller-Hinton Agar (MHA); and the separated isolations were recognized by strengthening the gene rec A.
Results: Of 90 isolated samples, only one strain suspected B. cepacia was isolated from 24-year old women with asthma. This strain was resistant to bacitracin, pipracillin and ciprofloxacin antibiotics.
 
Conclusion: The incidence of B. cepacia is rare in western part of Guilan province, which is congruent with the results of overall incidence in Iran.

Background/Objective To compare the
frequency of ICD-10 depressive episodes in a community
sample of Sardinian immigrants in Argentina
and a community sample of Sardinian residents in
Sardinia, Italy. Method A search of telephone directories
provided all subscribers with Sardinian surnames
in the Argentinean area involved. A 75.8%
of all subjects thus identified took part in the study
(n = 210). The characteristics of randomisation
methods used to identify the community sample in
Sardinia (n = 1040) have already been published
elsewhere. All subjects were interviewed using the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview Simplified.
Results A higher frequency of depressive
disorders was observed among the Sardinian immigrants
in Argentina (26.7 vs. 13.5%, P < 0.0001). Females
in particular showed a higher risk with respect
to the Sardinian sample resident in Sardinia. Discussion
On comparison of the present findings with the
lifetime rate of depressive episodes in Sardinian
immigrants in Paris (France), reported in a previous
research study, a lower prevalence was observed
among the latter group than in Sardinian immigrants
in Argentina but the young male immigrants in Paris
were at risk. Conclusion The results obtained seem to
suggest that emigration to a country where economic
conditions have since dramatically changed may
predispose subjects to depressive disorders, particularly
when compared to the percentage of affected
subjects in their native population and among subjects
who had emigrated to more economically stable
countries. Further epidemiological studies are warranted
in order to confirm the present results and to
clarify the determinants of the major risk for females
in such a condition

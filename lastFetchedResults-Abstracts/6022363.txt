As costs of the equipments operation and maintenance shares great proportion in the construction of the whole power grid, it seems extremely urgent to do researches about Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of power transmission line. At present, whole process cost management is adopted by most of the domestic power enterprises. But costs of the power loss, maintenance and fault loss are not considered; so to some extent, whole process cost management is narrow and limited. On the basis of LCC management, this dissertation discussed the whole process which includes planning, design, construction, purchase, operation, maintenance and disposal. Transmission line usually shares large percentage of whole project costs. WhatÂ´s more, changes of wire scheme will bring changes to tower and foundation design. Thus whole project costs are greatly impacted. The changes directly influence construction costs of the whole transmission line project, technical feature after construction and operation costs. Thus, this dissertation resolved the LCC of the whole power transmission line, at the mean time; transmission line wire type selection model and algorithm which based on LCC are the key point of the research. In this dissertation, basic principles of transmission lines wire selection are integrated into LCC theory. Objective function of wire type selection, which is on the basis of investment cost, operation wastage cost, maintenance cost, fault loss cost and retirement cost, is constructed.

Through the investigation and analysis of the actual driving cycles in Changchun, Jilin Province, the design method for transient driving cycles is introduced. The consistency of two-dimension distribution of velocity and acceleration between designed driving cycles and referenced driving cycles is applied as the design objective. The satisfaction criterion model for the design of transient driving cycles is established, which is solved by the genetic algorithm and GA toolbox. According to the satisfaction value of the designer, the representative transient driving cycles of Changchun is obtained.

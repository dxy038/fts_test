The active control of reconfigurable mobile robots based on multi-objective optimization is considered. Different control strategies to improve the robot mobility are presented. Traction is considered in terms of the contact forces distribution among wheels, while stability is defined by a potential energy margin. Thus, considering the conflicting control objectives associated with these strategies, a multi-objective optimization approach is formulated to determine a set of optimal solutions which allows to establish a tradeoff solution. A planar robot is considered to illustrate the proposed multi-objective optimization approach.

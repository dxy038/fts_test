At present, E-waste has become a considerable problem in China. Based on the multi-objective programming theory, this paper develops a fuzzy mathematic model for the location of treatment sites and transfer sites for e-wastes. Firstly, it proposes a two-phase fuzzy algorithm. Secondly, through solving the model, it conducts an analysis on the locations and numbers of these sites and how to assign the generation sites to transfer sites. Therefore, a reverse network for e-waste is constructed. Finally, it takes Dalian economic-technological develop area in Dalian city in China as a case to prove the availability of the fuzzy model.

Objective
pare salivary IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels between patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS) and controls.

female patients with BMS (mean age: 61.6 ± 10.1 years) and 20 female control subjects (mean age: 65.1 ± 9.0 years) were included in the study. Unstimulated (UWS) and stimulated whole saliva samples (SWS) were collected and their flow rates were determined. Salivary IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels and total protein concentration were also determined. Salivary transferrin level was determined to investigate the level of blood contamination in saliva samples. Gingival index of the subjects was also examined. Student's t-test, Pearson's correlation analysis, and analysis of covariance were used.
s
nificant differences were found in the salivary levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in BMS patients compared with controls. Salivary flow rates and their total protein concentrations did not differ significantly between the groups. The levels of salivary cytokines and total protein concentration correlated significantly with the level of blood contamination in both UWS and SWS.
sion
were no differences in the salivary levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in BMS patients compared with controls. Cytokine levels in whole saliva were affected mainly by the amount of blood contamination.

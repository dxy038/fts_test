Cloud architecture has the ability of sharing hardware resources and services among multiple tenants. In this paper we measure the performance for the multi-VM (multiple virtual machines) cloud architecture and compare it with the single-VM architecture. Renting resources on a cloud usually comes with a variety of options, such as use of more and smaller virtual machines or use of less and bigger virtual machines. The objective of this research is to find out which scenario gives better performance for the same price of rented resources. This will be done by comparing the following attributes: Average response time, Pages per second, Average page time, Requests per second, CPU time. We setup a hypothesis that the multi-VM approach would be better, and the best architecture is the one offering the highest number of small virtual machines, predicting that the computational demands will spread to different virtual machines in a balanced manner. The results confirm the hypothesis and lead to a recommendation for an optimal architecture of a cloud based solution for a common transactional web solution.

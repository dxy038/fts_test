The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of calcium propionate and grain level on performance and ruminal variables in 32 finishing Criollo lambs (28.14 Â± 2.34 kg initial BW) over 42 days. A completely randomized design was used with a factorial arrangement of treatments with either 550 or 650 g grain and 0 or 10 g calcium propionate per kg diet. All diets contained corn grain 200 and molasses 100 g/kg diet. Sorghum grain levels were 350 or 450 g/kg diet, replacing corn stover. No differences were observed in intake, gain or feed conversion among treatments. Rib eye area increased with 650 g/kg grain (P&lt;0.05). Ruminal pH was not affected by treatments. Ruminal acetate concentration decreased with more grain (P&lt;0.005). It was concluded that Ca propionate could be used to partially replace the energy usually supplied by grain in diets for finishing lambs.

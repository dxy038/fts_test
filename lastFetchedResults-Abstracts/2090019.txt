This paper proposes a new hybrid fuzzy multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (HFMOEA) based approach for solving complex multi-objective, mixed integer nonlinear problems such as optimal reactive power dispatch considering voltage stability (ORPD-VS). In HFMOEA based optimization approach, the two parameters like crossover probability (PC) and mutation probability (PM) are varied dynamically through the output of a fuzzy logic controller. The fuzzy logic controller is designed on the basis of expert knowledge to enhance the overall stochastic search capability for generating better pareto-optimal solution. Two detailed case studies are presented: Firstly, the performance of HFMOEA is tested on five benchmark test problems such as ZDT1, ZDT2, ZDT3, ZDT4 and ZDT6 as suggested by Zitzler, Deb and Thiele; Secondly, HFMOEA is applied to multi-objective ORPD-VS problem. In both the case studies, the optimization results obtained from HFMOEA are analysed and compared with the same obtained from two versions of elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms such as NSGA-II and MNSGA-II in terms of various performance metrics. The simulation results are promising and confirm the ability of HFMOEA for generating better pareto-optimal fronts with superior convergence and diversity.

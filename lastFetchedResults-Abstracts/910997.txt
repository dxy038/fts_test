METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, hospital records of all patients 15-45 years old with stroke who were hospitalized in Ayatollah Roohani hospital during 2009-2010 by using a checklist including demographic characteristics, time of stroke onset, type of stroke and risk factors were extracted and the collected data were analyzed.
FINDINGS: The average age of patients was 38.09Â±6.11 years that 34 patients (52.3%) were male and the rest were female. The most common type of stroke was ischemic in 61 cases (93.8%), that the most common of them was embolic in 38 (58.8%) and hemorrhagic strokes (6.2%), and 10.8 % were as a TIA (transient ischemic attack).

Alcohol and substance abuse in 18 cases (28.1%), hyperlipidemia in 15 cases (23.1%), diabetes in 13 patients (20%), hematologic  disorders in 12 cases (18.5%) that 6 cases (9.2%) of them had hypercoagulable state. Miscellaneous causes were in 13.8% cases and no risk factor found in 7.7% cases.
CONCLUSION: The most common type of stroke was ischemic stroke and hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, hyperlipidemia and diabetes were the most common risk factors associated with stroke.

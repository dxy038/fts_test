This article focuses on the study of an age-structure model for the disease transmission dynamics of tuberculosis in populations that are subjected to a vaccination program. We first show that the infection-free steady state is globally stable if the basic reproductive number R0 is below one, and that an endemic steady state exists when the reproductive number in the presence of vaccine is above one. We then apply the theoretical results to vaccination policies to determine the optimal age or ages at which an individual should be vaccinated. It is shown that the optimal strategies can be either one- or two-age strategies.

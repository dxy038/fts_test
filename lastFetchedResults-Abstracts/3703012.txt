Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) is an Earth observation mission developed by the European Space Agency in cooperation with the Centre National dÂ´Etudes Spatiales, France and the Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology, Spain, whose main objective is to provide global maps of soil moisture over land and sea surface salinity over oceans. This paper describes the SMOS mission in terms of the mission objectives and associated key system requirements, the conceptual implementation of the mission and corresponding system architecture, major building blocks and associated functions, the SMOS selected polar orbit and characteristics, and SMOS satellite attitude modes for the different phases of the mission and for the calibration of the Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis instrument.

Mycotoxin patulin represents potential health hazard especially in apple based baby food. There are already a lot of data to predict the fate of the toxin during the processing of fruits, but not enough for the apple puree and the existing data for apple puree are not usually consistent. The objective of the study was to evaluate the course of patulin degradation during the processing of apple puree under the conditions close to the real production process. The apple samples were spiked with patulin at four levels of concentration (539 μg/kg, 140 μg/kg, 23 μg/kg and <2 μg/kg). The patulin content changes during the processing were followed. The samples were taken after the homogenization, pulping, pasteurization and aseptic packaging. All operations of apple puree production contributed to patulin reduction. The principle operation was pulping, where the patulin levels were reduced from 29% to 80% of original content.

Objective
We review two cases of non tuberculous mycobacteria infections of the parotid region in members of the same family. The parotid region represents a peculiar location for the disease and it is exceptional to discover cases in members of the same family.
Methods
Two unusual case reports of non tuberculous mycobacteria infections in two members of the same family are presented. We discuss the diagnostic criteria and review pertinent recent literature. To our knowledge, these are the first English language reports of NTM infections in member of the same family.
Results
We performed surgical exeresis of the lesions in parotid region together with the skin affected by the fistula; regular check-ups for 24 months after surgery.
Conclusions
Surgical exeresis of regional structures is the treatment for non tuberculous mycobacteria infections non responsive to antibiotic therapy.

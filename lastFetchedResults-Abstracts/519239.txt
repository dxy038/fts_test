The main objective behind this study was to do a survey on the relationship between personality type (A and B) and learning strategies among a group of girl students in technical high schools. In this respect, 341 participants were selected using cluster random sampling. Then, Bortner's Classification Scales and Vinstein-Mayer Learning Strategy Questionnaire were administered to them. Data analysis using correlational method indicated that there is no significant relationship between personality type (A and B) and learning strategies (p<0.05). The regression analysis also showed that there is not any meaningful relationship between all strategies, except affective and expanding strategies, and personality type and can not predict each other.

Multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) are, a powerful decision-making aid for the control system designer. It is possible to search for many Pareto-optimal solutions concurrently, while concentrating on relevant regions of the Pareto set. Also, a human decision maker may interactively supply preference information to the algorithm as it runs. Applications described include the design of controllers for flight dynamics, gas turbine engines and active magnetic bearings. Design problem characteristics include non-linear system descriptions, incorporation of H-infinity approaches and online use of the MOGA tool

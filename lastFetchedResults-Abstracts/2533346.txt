The subgroup J of ALV (ALV J) has emerged as an important pathogen of meat type chickens since1989. This virus is responsible for economic losses due to both mortality and depressed performance inchickens. So, the objective of this study is the detection of ALV J in the albumen of commercial and nativefowl eggs using RT PCR. Three hundred and seventy egg albumens were randomly selected from differentfarms of Fars province, Iran. These eggs were obtained from the flocks of two research centers on native fowl production (70 eggs), a broiler grandparent farm (60 eggs), three broiler breeder farms (180 eggs), and a commercial layer flock (60 eggs). RT PCR was undertaken on isolated RNA from egg sles using a pair of ALV J specific primers H5/H7 that produced a 545 basepair fragment. RT PCR analyses detected ALV J in 15 of 180 (8.33%) sles from three broiler breeders farms, 17 of 70 (24.28%) sles from flocks of two research centers of native fowls production, and none of the sles of commercial layer and broiler grandparent farms. Direct sequencing using primers specific for subgroup ALV J verified the viral subgroup in the RT PCR lification products. This is the first report of the ALV J in egg albumen in Iran which indicates the necessity to apply eradication programs for ALV J in the poultry industry and native fowls in Iran.

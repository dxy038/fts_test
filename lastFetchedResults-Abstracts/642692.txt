Objective
This study explored current nutritional treatment policies and nutritional outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.
Methods

We performed a retrospective, structured survey of the medical records of 64 patients up to 6 months after injury or until the patients were independent in nutritional administration.
Results

Enteral nutrition was administered to 86% of patients. Fourteen patients (22%) had a gastrostomy; after 6 months four were still in use. At 6 months, 92% of patients received all food orally and 84% had gained nutritional independence. Energy intake was equal to the calculated basal metabolic rate throughout the first month after injury and increased by 21% during the second month. Sixty-eight percent exhibited signs of malnourishment with weight losses of 10â€“29%.
Conclusion

This study suggests that most patients with severe traumatic brain injury regain their nutritional independence within the first 6 months after injury, but also that most develop signs of malnutrition.

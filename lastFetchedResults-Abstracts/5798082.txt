In this paper, we present an interference and channel conditions aware multiple relay assignment and subcarrier allocation scheme for OFDMA based cognitive radio systems employing cooperative transmission using Decode and Forward (DF) technique. We focus on the problem of assigning the relays, the relay powers and allocating the subcarriers to the destination nodes using the sum capacity of the cognitive radio system as the objective function to be maximized under the constraint of maximum acceptable levels of interference for the primary users (PU). The computational complexity of this assignment using exhaustive search algorithm grows exponentially with the number of relays, subcarriers and receivers. Thus we propose Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for this assignment problem. EDA is a probabilistic evolutionary algorithm which updates its population at each iteration on the basis of the probability densities obtained from the population of superior candidates evaluated and chosen at the previous iteration. EDA employed with our allocation scheme has low computational complexity and its performance is comparable to the Upper Bound of the solution as shown by various simulation results.

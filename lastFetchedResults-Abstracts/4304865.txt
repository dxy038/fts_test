This work presents a fuzzy-norm approach for solving a general multiobjective single-tuned harmonic-filter planning problem by assuming that the decision-maker (DM) has imprecise or fuzzy goals for each of the objective functions. The objectives are total harmonic current distortion at the point of common coupling, total harmonic voltage distortion and harmonic filter investment cost The fuzzy-norm approach is presented for convert a multiobjective optimization problem to a single-objective optimization problem and the single-optimization problem can handle easily by simulated annealing method. A desirable, global optimal solution generated is guaranteed by the solution methodology. Results of application of the proposed method to general multiobjective harmonic filter planning are also presented.

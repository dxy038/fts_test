The most easily realizable resistive and ironless coils, with cylindrical bore and square ends (Solenoid and Bitter-coil), are studied from the point of view of the Magnetic Scalar Potential Difference (MSPD) between two points on the revolution axis, for Faraday effect measurements. The best coil dimensions are calculated as a function of the sample length. To reach this objective, we use new dimensionless factors E and D, homologous for MSPD, to the wellknown factors G and F used for the central magnetic field of coils. For given values of power consumption and sample length the optimisation of E gives the best coil dimensions and the best current distribution, to obtain the maximum MSPD.

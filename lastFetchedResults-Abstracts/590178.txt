Background: It has been shown that the Juglans regia leaves have hypoglycemic, diuretic and blood pressure reduction properties. The objective of the present study was to examine the histopathology effects of Juglans regia leaves on diabetes mellitus in rats. 
Material and Methods: Forty-eight Wistar rats (150- 200 g) were randomized into six groups of 8 animals. Groups III, IV, V and VI received intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin to make diabetic model. Blood glucose was measured by glucometer after 72 hours.  After 10 days, Group II, IV and V received 400, 200 and 400 mg/kg Juglans regia extract, respectively and group VI treated with 4 mg/kg glybenclamid for four weeks.  Group I were fed with normal diet and group III received distilled water (diabetic control). The body weight and blood glucose were measured in every week. The number of B cells and diameter of islets of Langerhans were determined using hematoxylin-floxin staining. The collected data was analyzed by the SPSS software using one-way ANOVA. 
Results: The number of B cells and diameter of islets decreased significantly in diabetic control compare to the normal group. Treatment with 400 mg/kg of Juglans regia extract showed a significant decrease in blood glucose, a significant increase in diameter of islets and number of B cells compared to diabetic control group. The pancreas / body weight ratio increased in diabetic rats compare to the treatment group. 
Conclusion: The administration of Juglans regia extract can cause recovery of B cells number and improve the size of islets of Langerhans in diabetic model rats.

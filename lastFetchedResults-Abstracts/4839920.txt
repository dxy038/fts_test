The term reverse logistics did not appear in foreign magazines until 1980s. In the early 1990s, with proposal of environmental protection awareness and green logistics by the government and customers, reverse logistics began to attract attention from some foreign developed nations. Although forward logistics draws considerable attention in China, there is still lack of researches concentrating on reverse logistics, especially special research fields including automobile reverse logistics which almost remain untouched. Therefore, the paper first gives an overview of research background at home and abroad on reverse logistics and automobile reverse logistics, then develops an analysis of recycling process of automobile reverse logistics, and concludes the recycling model of reverse logistics suitable for automobile products, i.e. reverse logistics network for remanufacturing. Based on that, the paper divides recycling network into open-loop network and closed-loop network, with relation between reverse logistics and forward logistics as the basis. Through analyzing, the paper concludes that recycling network of automobile reverse logistics belongs to closed-loop recycling network. And then, the paper continues to apply mixed integer programming method, to establish a closed-loop recycling network model, with minimal total cost in network as objective function. In the end, the paper concludes and forecasts research prospect and orientation of automobile reverse logistics in the future.

In this paper, a system model of UWB radar distributed over optical fiber is proposed. The bidirectional transmission performance of UWB pulses and echoes over optical fiber is analyzed. The theoretical simulation results demonstrate that 80km distribution distance can be achieved with the two modulation schemes of Optical Carrier Suppression and Single SideBand to keep the echo SNR larger than 10dB, when the fiber dispersion is fully compensated with dispersion compensation fiber (DCF).

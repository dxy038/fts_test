The interoperability of components requires both macro process in business context, semantic metadata, and micro process for service design and physical implementation, we apply this strategy as our objective to evaluate and validate the common component and service aggregation which is the pre-design of service interoperability. This research apply decision process, analytical model, and fuzzy techniques to take the result from group decision for further development, we demonstrate how to use these model and techniques to produce the common component and service aggregation which is the foundation of enterprise integration. Fuzzy interaction model has been used to those systems that need be decided with uncertainty, it represents tools to aid research in production management when the dynamics of the production environment limit the specification of model objectives, constraints and the precise measurement.

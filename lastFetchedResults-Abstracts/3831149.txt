The paper presents a new frontier for progressive image transmission. By applying the segmentation technique, adaptation of the pyramid structure can be improved. This method concatenates an image into a group of diverse sizes depending on its regionÂ´s activity. The result is an intermediate approximation displaying an improved image. From the simulation results, the relative quality of intermediate image reconstructions, based on this proposed method, is superior to those of the existing ones, both in terms of its subjective and objective criteria

With an increasing number of Electric Vehicles (EV), the optimal planning of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) into distribution system has become more and more important. However, the problem of optimal planning is complex, nonlinear and combinatorial optimization problem. Thus a multi-objective and multivariate planning model based on hierarchic genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed, considering the investment costs of EVCS and feeder and the energy losses and constraint conditions. The innovation points of this paper are encoding method and checking operator, changing the infeasible solutions in filial populations into feasible solutions. Finally the proposed approach is tested on 33 nodes distribution power system of IEEE with EVCS, based on the MATLAB programming language. Study results indicate the validity of this method.

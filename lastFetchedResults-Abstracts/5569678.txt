In this paper, a compliant mechanism is designed based on topology optimization for fast tool servo (FTS), which is used to compensate positioning error caused by chatter and other external disturbances for turning operation. The compliant mechanism works as a transmission mechanism between the actuator and the tool, and requires low transmission loss at the driving direction. Moreover, high stiffness and high resonant frequency are also desired to resist the cutting forces in other directions. Considering the above factors, a multi-objective topology optimization method is proposed for the design of the compliant mechanism. For comparison, a traditional design with size optimization of flexible hinge is also given. Compared with the traditional design, the proposed design shows better performance by increasing the effective stroke of FTS and improving the stiffness in the vertical (main cutting force) and horizontal (feed force) directions.

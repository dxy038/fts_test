A new series of diaryloxy methano phenanthrenes were prepared through tertiary-aminoalkylations of [(methoxy-phenyl)-phenanthren-9-yl-methyl]-phenols obtained from Friedel–Crafts alkylations on (methoxy-phenyl)-phenanthren-9-yl-methanols. These series of compounds were evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and showed the desired activity in the range of 6.25 μg/mL in vitro. One of the compound 12j protects the mice from the challenge of M. tuberculosis in vivo, as 30% of the mice were survived at treatment of 50 mg/kg body weight.

This paper describes AquaOptical II, a bidirectional, high data-rate, long-range, underwater optical communication system. The system uses the software radio principle. Each AquaOptical II modem can be programmed to transmit user defined waveforms and record the received waveforms for detailed analysis. This allows for the use of many different modulation schemes. We describe the hardware and software architecture we developed for these goals. We demonstrate bidirectional communication between two AquaOptical II modems in a pool experiment. During the experiment AquaOptical II achieved a signal to noise ration of 5.1 over a transmission distance of 50 m at pulse widths of 1 &#956;sec, 500 ns, and 250 ns. When using discrete pulse interval modulation (DPIM) this corresponds to a bit-rate of 0.57 Mbit/s, 1.14 Mbit/s, and 2.28 Mbit/s.

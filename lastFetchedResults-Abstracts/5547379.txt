Suspended stripline offers several advantages at microwave and millimetre wave frequency as compared with the conventional stripline and microstrip. However, there is limited data available on discontinuities in suspended stripline and its variants. Discontinuities which have received some attention are the open-end and the gap. The objective of the present study is to carry out detailed frequency dependent study of some important discontinuities in suspended stripline. This study is important because it would enable an engineer to design suspended stripline circuits more accurately at microwave and millimetre wave frequencies. Extensive numerical data are generated as a function of frequency from 1 to 100 GHz

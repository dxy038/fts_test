We have developed a new error modeling and optimization-based localization approach for sensor networks in presence of distance measurement noise. The approach is solely based on the concept of consistency. The error models are constructed using non-parametric statistical techniques; they do not only indicate the most likely error, but also provide the likelihood distribution of particular errors occurring. The models are evaluated using the learn-and-test techniques and serve as the objective functions for the task of localization. The localization problem is formulated as task of maximizing consistency between measurements and calculated distances. We evaluated the approach in (i) both GPS-based and GPS-less scenarios; (ii) 1-D, 2-D and 3-D spaces, on sets of acoustic ranging-based distance measurements recorded by deployed sensor networks. The experimental evaluation indicates that localization of only a few centimeters is consistently achieved when the average and median distance measurement errors are more than a meter, even when the nodes have only a few distance measurements. The relative performance in terms of location accuracy compare favorably with respect to several state-of-the-art localization approaches. Finally, several insightful observations about the required conditions for accurate localization are deduced by analyzing the experimental results

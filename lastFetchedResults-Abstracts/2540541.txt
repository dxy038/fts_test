Background and Objective: The successful glycemic control in diabetic patients is very important. Since the poor selfcare is reported as the most important causes of mortality and complications, therefore these patients require selfcare knowledge. This study aimed to determine the effect of education of selfcare behaviors on HbA1C level in diabetic patients.

Materials and Method: In this clinical trial, 80 diabetic patients referred to the diabetes clinic in Bandar Abbas were selected through random sampling and then were randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and control based on stratified random sampling. Designed educational program was implemented in 9 sessions (60 minutes, once a week for 12 weeks) for patients in the intervention group. Patients in the control group were received usual care of clinic. Data were collected through using demographic information form and HbA1c test. Data were collected at the beginning of the study and 12 weeks after the intervention. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 18) using independent T test, paired Ttest, MannWhitney U and chisquare.

Results: Before the intervention, the HbA1c average in the intervention and control groups was 8.18 plusmn; 1.66 and 8.41 plusmn; 2.10, respectively and after the intervention these values were changed to 7.78 plusmn; 1.48 and 8.82 plusmn; 2.11 in the intervention and control groups respectively (p = 0.01).

Conclusion: Implementation of educational program of selfcare behaviors was effective in reducing HbA1C and it can be used as an appropriate educational method by nurses and other health care team in controlling of diabetes in patients.

To overcomes the disadvantages of computing the attributesÂ´ weight method in multi-attribute decision problem. In this paper, a weighted averaging method based on Dempster-shafer evidential theory and grey fixed weight cluster has been used. Firstly, by using the Dempster-shafer evidential theory can integrate the subjective and objective weights to get the weight coefficients, and then avoid the shortcomings of single weighting method. Secondly, after the fusion of weights which come from Dempster-shafer evidential theory, ones could apply information of grey classification of each clustering object fully. Finally, an example of design scheme selection is presented to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the method mentioned in this paper.

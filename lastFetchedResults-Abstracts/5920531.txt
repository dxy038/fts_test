In this paper, we investigate a clustering protocol for single hop wireless sensor networks that employs a competitive scheme for cluster head selection. The proposed algorithm is named EECS-M that is a modified version to the well known protocol EECS where some of the nodes become volunteers to be cluster heads with an equal probability. In the competition phase in contrast to EECS using a fixed competition range for any volunteer node, we assign a variable competition range to it that is related to its distance to base station. The volunteer nodes compete in their competition ranges and every one with more residual energy would become cluster head. Our objective is to balance the energy consumption of the cluster heads all over the network. Simulation results show the more balanced energy consumption and longer lifetime.

This paper establishes a robust model to adjust the hourly load level in response to hourly electricity price of a given consumer .The objective of the model is to maximize the utility of the consumer subject to a minimum daily energy supply level, maximum and minimum hourly demand levels, and ramping limits on such demand levels. Unknown price is forecasted through neural network with a confidence interval. A simple bidirectional communication device between the power supplier and the consumer enables the achievement of the proposed model. Numerical simulations are provided.

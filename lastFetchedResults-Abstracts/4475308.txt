This paper presents a full proteomics analysis LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) chain combining bio, nano and information technologies in order to quantify targeted proteins in blood sample. The objective is to enable an early detection of pancreatic cancer. We focus on the data processing step which estimates the proteinsÂ´ concentration. First, we pre-process the data in order to correct time shift between the experiments. We propose to use block matching algorithm. Second, quantification of protein is performed using chemometrics approaches and more precisely CLS, PLS, N-PLS and PARAFAC algorithms. Performances of the various methods have been compared on cytochrome c protein LC-MS analyses.

Adhesive bonding has been widely used to join or repair metallic and composite structural components to
achieve or restore their designated structural sti ness and strengths. However, current analysis methods
and empirical databases for composite bonded patch repairs or joints are limited to  at structures, and
there exists a very limited knowledge on the e ect of curvature on the performance and durability
of composite bonded joints and repairs. Recently, a novel  nite element formulation was presented
for developing adhesive elements for conducting 2.5-D simpli ed stress analysis of bonded repairs to
curved structures. This paper presents the work on optimal shape design of a bonded curved composite
patch using the newly developed adhesive element. The Sequential Linear Programming (SLP) method
is employed as the optimization algorithm in conjunction with a fully implemented mesh generation
algorithm into which new features have been incorporated. The objective of shape optimization is to
minimize the maximum stress in the entire adhesive layer to ensure that the bonded patch e ectively
works together with the parent structure in service. Several di erent objective functions, related to
possible failure mechanisms of the adhesive layer, are proposed to optimize the shape of a bonded
patch.

Depression is a common and disabling mental health disorder, which impacts not only on the sufferer but also their families, friends and the economy overall. Our ultimate aim is to develop an automatic objective affective sensing system that supports clinicians in their diagnosis and monitoring of clinical depression. Here, we analyse the performance of head pose and movement features extracted from face videos using a 3D face model projected on a 2D Active Appearance Model (AAM). In a binary classification task (depressed vs. non-depressed), we modelled low-level and statistical functional features for an SVM classifier using real-world clinically validated data. Although the head pose and movement would be used as a complementary cue in detecting depression in practice, their recognition rate was impressive on its own, giving 71.2% on average, which illustrates that head pose and movement hold effective cues in diagnosing depression. When expressing positive and negative emotions, recognising depression using positive emotions was more accurate than using negative emotions. We conclude that positive emotions are expressed less in depressed subjects at all times, and that negative emotions have less discriminatory power than positive emotions in detecting depression. Analysing the functional features statistically illustrates several behaviour patterns for depressed subjects: (1) slower head movements, (2) less change of head position, (3) longer duration of looking to the right, (4) longer duration of looking down, which may indicate fatigue and eye contact avoidance. We conclude that head movements are significantly different between depressed patients and healthy subjects, and could be used as a complementary cue.

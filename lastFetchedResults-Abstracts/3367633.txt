Esophageal electrical stimulation using short and a relatively small number of (200 &#956;s, 0.2 Hz, n=25) electrical pulses generates a characteristic and well defined cortical evoked potential response (EP). There are two methods of stimulation: either through intraesophageal electrodes or with transmural electrodes. The objective of this paper is to compare EP response, sensations and heart rate variability power spectra elicited by both stimulation modalities in healthy volunteers. Our results suggest that transmural stimulation is more accurately perceived and at lower intensities, produces more reproducible peaks of higher amplitude than during intraesophageal stimulation. During either mode of esophageal stimulation, power within the high-frequency component of the heart rate variability power spectrum is enhanced.

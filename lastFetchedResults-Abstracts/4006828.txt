Stability and encoding properties of two-layer nonlinear feedback neural networks are examined. Bidirectionality is introduced in neural nets to produce two-way associative search for stored associations. The bidirectional associative memory (BAM) is the minimal two-layer nonlinear feedback network. The author proves that every <e1>n</e1>-by- <e1>p</e1> matrix <e1>M</e1> is a bidirectionally stable heteroassociative content-addressable memory for both binary/bipolar and continuous neurons. When the BAM neutrons are activated, the network quickly evolves to a stable state of two-pattern reverberation, or resonance. The stable reverberation corresponds to a system energy local minimum. Heteroassociative information is encoded in a BAM by summing correlation matrices. The BAM storage capacity for reliable recall is roughly <e1>m</e1>&lt;min (<e1>n</e1>,<e1>p</e1>). It is also shown that it is better on average to use bipolar {-1,1} coding than binary {0.1} coding of heteroassociative pairs. BAM encoding and decoding are combined in the adaptive BAM, which extends global bidirectional stability to real-time unsupervised learning

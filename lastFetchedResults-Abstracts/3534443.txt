From the application of simulated annealing to the optimal design of electromagnetic devices, it is usually found that its convergence speed is low. Based on the analysis for the iterative procedure of simulated annealing, adaptive simulated annealing is put forward, which has a higher convergence speed. When used to solve the optimization problem that arises from the optimal design of a 6 kV fuse-contactor and involves a multimodal objective function, adaptive simulated annealing can not only obtain the global optimal solution but also save 30 percent of the computation time taken by simulated annealing

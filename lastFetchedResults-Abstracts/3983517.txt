High-density magneto-optical recording using near field optics with a solid immersion lens is discussed. The spot size, and defocusing distance are calculated for various combinations of n and NA. Also, the misalignment of the objective lens and SIL is discussed. The magnetic and magneto-optical properties of SIL media candidates of TbFeCo/Pt multilayers are presented

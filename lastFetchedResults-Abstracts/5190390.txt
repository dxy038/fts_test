This paper presents a state-of-the-art discrete pulse modulated (DPM) three-phase AC/DC power converter with an active-voltage clamped resonant DC link (ACRDCL). Its DSP-based digital control strategy to realize unity power factor correction and sinewave line current shaping is proposed. The operating characteristics are illustrated using simulation results and experimental data. In addition, the bidirectional double power conversion circuit with a single stage ACRDCL is demonstrated as an extended concept of the switched mode DPM rectifier treated here

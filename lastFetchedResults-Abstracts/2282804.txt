
Introduction: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are one of the most significant current environmental issues. Phenanthrene and naphthalene adsorption at activated carbon beds prevent the release of these compounds into the environment. The objective of this research was to compare the amounts of phenanthrene and naphthalene adsorption at activated carbon beds in the n-hexane solution. .
Material and Method: This discontinuous experimental study was conducted in the laboratory scale batch and in the n-hexane solution containing phenanthrene and naphthalene.PH values were adjusted by adding hydrochloric acidand 1 N NaOH. The initial and residual phenanthrene and naphthalene concentrations were spectrophotometrically measured at 270 and 266 nm, respectively.
.Results: Findings showed that the maximum adsorption of naphthalene was obtained at pH=5 and contact time of 8 hours (7.4 mg/gr). The maximum adsorption was reached at pH=7 and contact time of 11 hours for phenanthrene (8.34 mg/gr).Improvement in the adsorption capacity was happenedby the increases in contact time and initial phenanthrene and naphthalene concentrations. The adsorption kinetics of these two compounds followed pseudo-second-order and Freundlich isotherm model.
.Conclusion: Freundlich isotherm model showed a strong association with PAHs adsorption process. A weak correlationwas observed between Langmuir theory and the results of the adsorption at activated carbon beds in the organic n-hexane solution.

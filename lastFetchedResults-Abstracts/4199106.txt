Today, the evolution of IP networks and the diversity of the data flowing through these networks require domain managers to ensure quality of service (QoS), security and mobility for various communications. Security and QoS can be negotiated between domain managers implied in a service offer. The SLNP (Service Level Negotiation Protocol) protocol allows the negotiation of a service level QoS and it functions in the interoperable environment of web services. The objective of this paper is to consider QoS requirements of the communications when security is introduced in the service level negotiated with the SLNP protocol.

Digital Cinema (DC) electronic distribution requires networks with high available bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a system that adopts a frequency multiplex of DVB-T signals to deliver JPEG 2000 video over wideband wireless channels. The objective of this paper is to present a transmission scheme that, by transmitting over DVB-T channels, provides content distributor and/or end users with the possibility to obtain a very high quality video stream. The source coded video can be downsampled to a video quality still at an high level, and then compressed with parameters reflecting the specifications for DC. The stream is thus split and encapsulated into MPEG-2 TS packets. A proper strategy of substream multiplexing and composition is presented, which may reduce the residual error effects and bandwidth requirements. An additional Forward Error Correction (FEC) layer using JPWL can be applied to further enhance transmission robustness. At the receiver side a proper demultiplexing and decompression is performed. Eventually, we will also present simulated results in terms of objective video quality vs. channel SNR or equivalent bit error rate.

Background & Objective: Portfolio is useful as a learning method and an evaluating scale. The goal of this survey was to study the effect of portfolio based evaluation on the accuracy of clinical evaluation of nursing students during their internship in Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.
Methods: This educational trial was conducted on all senior nursing students (n = 30) of Arak University of Medical Sciences. Their clinical learning was evaluated by routine (first two weeks) and portfolio evaluation (last two weeks). All data were analyzed with SPSS version 17.
Results: Mean age of students (14 boys and 16 girls) was 22.7 ± 1.2 years. Mean of scores given by the instructor based on routine (19.4) and portfolio methods (16.5) in nursing management internship course had a significant difference (3 scores) (P = 0.0001). Moreover, mean of scores given by the instructor based on routine (19.11) and portfolio methods (16.3) in the internal internship course had a significant difference (3 scores) (P = 0.0001). Mean scores of students’ opinions about effective learning in internal wards with routine and portfolio methods had a significant difference (P ? 0.001). 
Conclusion: Scores based on routine evaluation forms cannot be real, since they are, subjective not objective. However, scores based on portfolios are more real. In spite of some limitations, portfolio is applicable and user-friendly in clinical fields. Therefore, it is recommended for promoting learning levels and evaluating students’ clinical learning.

This paper introduces the theory and application of a new designing method of the controller for boost single-phase ac-dc converters with power factor correction. The method is based on the use of a Multi-Objective optimization evolutionary algorithm which is called NSGA-II. As the input current quality and dynamic response of output voltage for PFC rectifiers are conflicting objectives and with improving one of them another is degraded, this method is very operative for seeking desired rectifier features. By using of Pareto Optimal Set and Pareto Optimal Front which NSGA-II algorithm offered, designer can select the controller coefficients based on his priority of objectives. Simulation results prove that the controller gains which offered in the paper dominate the conventional design.

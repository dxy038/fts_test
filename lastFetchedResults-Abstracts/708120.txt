Objective
The physical examination of the abdomen is crucial to emergency department (ED) management of patients with abdominal pain. We sought to determine the interrater variation between attending and resident physicians in detecting abdominal exam findings.
Methods
Research enrollers surveyed attending and resident physicians on abdominal exam findings in the ED in patients with abdominal pain. Strength of agreement was calculated using the κ statistic.
Results
A convenience sample of 122 surveys was completed. Calculated κ results are in parentheses. There was almost perfect agreement on the presence of masses and substantial agreement on the need for imaging studies. There was moderate agreement on guarding, distension, tenderness, and need for laboratory tests and surgical consultation. For 88 (72%) patients with tenderness, substantial agreement was calculated for epigastric tenderness, moderate agreement on right upper quadrant, supraumbilical, suprapubic, left lower quadrant, right lower quadrant tenderness, and fair agreement on left upper quadrant tenderness. Sixty-one (50%) patients received pain medicine in the ED. Among those, there was fair agreement on a presence of a surgical abdomen. Upper level resident physicians noted a higher level of agreement with the attending physician for tenderness than junior resident physicians.
Conclusions
There was moderate agreement between resident and attending physicians for most of the findings in patients with abdominal pain. Recognition that selected findings are more variable than others should encourage careful confirmation of resident physicians' assessments in teaching settings.

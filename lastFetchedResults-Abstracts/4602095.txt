This paper has as principal objective to determine the value of some parameters of light that are determinants in the activation or inhibition of the growth stimulus of wheat seeds (Triticum aestivum L). In this case intensity and dose, as important parameters, were considered. GaAlAs laser with lambda=850 nm was used to irradiate the biological system. The growth of main shoot was considered. All data were processed using statistical methods. Results obtained indicate that when the appropriate light parameters are used activation can occur.

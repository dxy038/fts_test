In this paper we present a novel method for digital audio steganography where messages are embedded into image and image is embedded into the host audio. “Audio Steganography using GA with multilevel security” is a proposed system which is based on Steganography and Encryption; the systemensures secured data transfer between the source and destination. Here a novel approach is presented to resolve the remained problems of substitution technique of audio Steganography. In the first level of security, encrypted message bits are inserted into image using LSB algorithm. In the second level, a secured GA based LSB (Least Significant Bit) Algorithm is used to encode the image data into audio data. Here image bits are embedded into random and higher LSB layers, resulting in increased robustness against noise addition. The robustness specially would be increased against those intentional attacks which try to reveal the hidden message and also some unintentional attacks like noise addition as well. On the other hand,multi-objective GA is used to reduce distortion.

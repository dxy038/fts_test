This research is implemented with the objective to survey course content effect in various academic disciplines such as: various management orientations, medicine, basic sciences, engineering, art and theology, on Tehran University students’ learning style (LS) and spiritual intelligence (SQ or SI). This study used Kolb's learning styles model (1985) which involves four learning styles; abstract conceptualization (AC), reflective observation (RO), active experimentation (AE), concrete experience (CE). 
The goal of this article is to examine the relationship between measures of SQ among various academic disciplines and their learning styles. Hence, two questionnaires consisting of thirty one questions for SQ evaluation (by alpha %968) and twelve questions for students learning styles measurement (by alpha %87) were used. Our statistic sample included two hundred and twenty five students. Findings of the research show that there is a positive relationship between course contents and LS. Also, the assumption of existing a significant correlation between spiritual intelligence and individual learning style was confirmed. According to the research findings, significant point is that the humanities disciplines, especially management should employ assimilation style to increase power of abstract conceptualization in their learning. But, contents of management lessons are changing in a way that the students’ mentality inclines toward concrete experience and active experimentation.

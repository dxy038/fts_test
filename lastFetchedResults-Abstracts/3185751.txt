This paper provides an overview of the final draft of the ECSS EMC Handbook (European Cooperation for Space Standardization, Space Systems Electromagnetic Compatibility Handbook), ECSS-E-HB-20-07A [1] that has been written by a working group involving representatives of European space industry, CNES (Centre National dÂ´E&#769;tudes Spatiales) and ESA (European Space Agency). The purpose of the Handbook is to provide practical and helpful information for Electromagnetic Compatibility in the development of spacecraft equipment and systems. It gathers experience, know-how and lessons-learnt from the European space community with the aim to assist engineers throughout the design and development phases. The Handbook discusses system level activities and suggests design techniques, analyses and test methods. It also complements the ECSS-E-ST-20-07C standard (Space engineering - Electromagnetic compatibility) [2] by providing rationale for unit level test requirements. The ultimate objective of the Handbook is to guide engineers towards solid spacecraft EMC design and to assist them in the decision making process to avoid lengthy negotiations or late adjustments.

In this paper, we propose a new UDP-based and rate-based application layer protocol, named UAP. The main objective of UAP is to meet the needs of the applications to have all the following merits: reliability, real time, fairness, file-transport, P2P-friendliness and TCP-friendliness. However, the previous studies of UDP-based application layer protocol have only focuses on certain parts of the above characteristics, such as reliability and file-transport, not all of them as UAP did. Moreover, in order to be used easily, UAP is designed to be connectionless, as a result, the interface is very succinct. Our experimental results justify that UAP is a promising protocol for certain applications.

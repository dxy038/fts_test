In this study, the main objective was to asses the distribution of Cu, Cr, and As in soils adjacent to CCA-treated utility poles in Eastern Blacksea Region of Turkey (Trabzon, Rize and Artvin ) and determine the influence of soil composition.
Surface (0–5 cm) and subsurface soil samples (30–40 cm) were collected near CCA-treated utility poles and control soil samples away from CCA-treated utility poles were also collected. Water holding capacity, pH and mechanical properties of soil samples were determined for both depth levels.
Results showed that Cu, Cr and As concentration in soil samples taken from all three cities in 0–5 cm depth was higher than soil samples taken from 30–40 cm depth. Cu, Cr and As concentrations were much higher in soil samples taken from city of Rize

In the on-line rescheduling on a single machine, a set of original jobs has already been scheduled to minimize some cost objective, when a new set of jobs arrives overtime. The decision maker needs to insert the new jobs into the existing schedule without excessively disrupting it. In this paper, we consider the online rescheduling problem to minimize makespan under a limit on the maximum sequence disruption constraints and give an online algorithm of competitive ratio 3/2.

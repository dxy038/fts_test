This paper presents a novel method for assessing the accuracy of unsupervised polygonal approximation algorithms. This measurement relies on a polygonal approximation called the “reference approximation”. The reference approximation is obtained using the method of Perez and Vidal [11] by an iterative method that optimizes an objective function. Then, the proposed measurement is calculated by comparing the reference approximation with the approximation to be evaluated, taking into account the similarity between the polygonal approximation and the original contour, and penalizing polygonal approximations with an excessive number of points. A comparative experiment by using polygonal approximations obtained with commonly used algorithms showed that the proposed measurement is more efficient than other proposed measurements at comparing polygonal approximations with different number of points.

Among the many physical and chemical strategies used to make air pollution gas sensors for CO and NO<sub> 2</sub> monitoring, those employing multisensor arrays offer excellent selectivity, long lifetimes, low drift and low costs of manufacture. Targeting the two gases CO and N O<sub> 2</sub>, new thick film sensor matrix was fabricated using the screen printing technology. With this purpose, undoped and noble metal-doped thick film SnO<sub> 2</sub> sensing layers deposited by screen printing technique upon micromachined Si substrate have been characterised. The main objective in this study has been the challenging perspective to define a sensing layer type which allows a high quality monitoring and easy discrimination of low concentration of NO<sub> 2</sub> by an interfering species like CO, both present in the outdoor air. The experimental results reported in this work have shown that combining the sensor technology with a suitable catalytic element in the present case, gold, palladium and platinum, low concentration of NO<sub> 2</sub> can be revealed with a sufficient selectivity towards CO.

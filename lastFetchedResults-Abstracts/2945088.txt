Mixed model assembly lines are used to produce different product types on the line at the same time. Their correct management requires a number of problems to be solved, among which there is the determination of the input sequence. Traditionally papers appeared in the literature dealt with two objectives, the constant usage of parts on the line and the load levelling of the line. In this paper it is recognized that a different objective is important as well, i.e., the respect of due dates. So, we propose a combined problem, where both the constant usage of parts and the respect of due dates need to be pursued. It is shown how the combined problem can be formulated as an assignment problem, which is known to be an easily solvable problem

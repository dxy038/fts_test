Spectral subtraction is one of the most famous and common-used methods for speech enhancement. The main weakness of this method is the production of an annoying noise called musical noise. In this paper, we have reduced the musical noise and improved the quality of enhanced speech by increasing the accuracy of the system spectral estimator. This method is useful for speech enhancement systems in which the speech signal is degraded by stationary or near-stationary noises. Different experimental results in different SNRs confirmed the better performance of our system from both objective and subjective views, which means better quality and more SNR improvement

The objective of this study was to determine the potential of mid-infrared spectroscopy coupled with multidimensional statistical analysis for the prediction of processed cheese instrumental texture and meltability attributes. Processed cheeses (n = 32) of varying composition were manufactured in a pilot plant. Following two and four weeks storage at 4 °C samples were analysed using texture profile analysis, two meltability tests (computer vision, Olson and Price) and mid-infrared spectroscopy (4000–640 cm−1). Partial least squares regression was used to develop predictive models for all measured attributes. Five attributes were successfully modelled with varying degrees of accuracy. The computer vision meltability model allowed for discrimination between high and low melt values (R2 = 0.64). The hardness and springiness models gave approximate quantitative results (R2 = 0.77) and the cohesiveness (R2 = 0.81) and Olson and Price meltability (R2 = 0.88) models gave good prediction results.

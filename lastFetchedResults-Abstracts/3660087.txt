A new electrical resistance tomography system has been designed using the single drive electrode method. The bidirectional pulse current is adopted in this system as the exciting current. The model of this new method has been set up in ANSYS and validated by simulation and actual measured data. Based on this model, the influence of medium resistivity and connected resistance as well as the influence of medium distribution on the measured data is studied. The experimental results and the reconstructed images are presented at last to testify to the reliability of the new system and the feasibility of the new method.

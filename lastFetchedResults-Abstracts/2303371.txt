ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder among women of the reproductive age.The complications of this syndrome such as Hyperandrogenism, infertility, Hirsutism and pregnancy complications increase in obese women with PCOS. This study aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory features of overweight and obese women suffering PCOS with women of normal weight.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 368 PCOS patients were studied. According to the Rotterdam Criteria, they were divided into two groups of equal body mass index (BMI) ?25 and  < 25. They were compared in terms of age, parity, infertility history, menstrual disorders, family history of diabetes, weight, BMI, waist to hip ratio (WHR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure and clinical and laboratory symptoms of PCOS.
FINDINGS: In both groups, the common phenotype was IM/ HA/PCO and the frequent menstrual pattern was Oligomenorrhea (81.2%). In group the overweight and obese group and the normal-weight group, respectively, the mean age was 26.84±5.28 and 25.59±4.66 (p=0.0001), the mean systolic blood pressure was 114.4±11.61 and 106.66±10.02 (p=0.01), the mean diastolic blood pressure was 73.24±8.97 and 67.29±8.36 (p=0.01), infertility was 45.5 % and 22.61% (p=0.0001) and the android obesity incidence was higher in the patients than normal individuals (p=0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Infertility, android obesity and increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure was higher in the overweight and obses group than the normal weight group. Therefore, a follow-up for these patients in order to prevent the complications seems necessary.

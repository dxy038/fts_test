Objective
rpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of measuring total uterine blood flow in pregnancy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique.
s
e blood flow was determined in pregnant women in whom MRI was being carried out to assess a fetal anomaly. A two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiogram sequence was performed. Scout images and a peripherally gated phase contrast MR sequence were planned to study simultaneous blood flow in the uterine and ovarian arteries.
s
 pelvic angiogram sequence was completed in 13 women. The uterine arteries were visualized and their cross-sectional area determined. The complexity of the pelvic blood supply prevented the calculation of blood flow velocity and, thus, total uterine blood flow.
sion
asurement of total uterine blood flow during pregnancy was not possible using our MR technique. The ovarian vessels were not consistently visualized. Doppler ultrasonography remains the best modality by which to estimate total uterine blood flow in pregnancy.

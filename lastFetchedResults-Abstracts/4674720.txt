The application of new technologies in the road transport system is seen as one of the key challenges to ensure safe and efficient driving through the increasingly overloaded road infrastructure. One of the most recent developments in this respect is the implementation of co-operative traffic management systems and the establishment of a bidirectional wireless infrastructure to vehicle (12 V) communication link for transmission of ´legal binding´ messages into the vehicle (e.g. speed limit, lane change, weather warning). The quality of these messages - in respect to time, accuracy, and content - relies on the quality and process performance within the whole service chain. Hereby especially for complex services covering weather warnings resulting in slippery road surfaces including driving restrictions for the driver (e.g. speed reduction, alternative routing) a complex service chain needs to fulfill highest quality criteria to ensure a precise, accurate, and timely driver information.

This paper presents a biogeography based optimization method with blended migration operator to solve dynamic economic dispatch (DED) problem with valve point effects. A new migration scheme based on blended crossover of genetic algorithm (GA) is presented with an aim to achieve the cost reduction together satisfying the dynamic behavior of the generating units over the considered time period. The blended migration operator increases the search effort of biogeography based optimization (BBO) technique. The blended migration operator enhances the convergence speed and the performance of the standard BBO technique. The performance of the blended BBO (BBBO) is tested on a 10-unit system under a 24 hour load pattern. The results obtained for the system shows that the BBBO method is capable of solving complex objective functions with nonlinear characteristics.

Pedestrian lower leg protection and low speed impact have different requirements on the frontal bumper system. Some even be contradictory. Therefore, the frontal bumper system needs to be analyzed and designed for both pedestrian protection and low speed impact requirement. In this paper, FE models were developed based on GTR and CFVSS215. The Orthogonal Arrays design of experiments was used to simulate the influence of the bumper parameter on the pedestrian lower leg impact and the low speed impact respectively. Finally, the multi-objective optimization of the structure parameters was conducted based on the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Algorithm), the results of simulation showed that the performance of the lower leg protection and low speed impact could be improved significantly meanwhile the CFVSS215 legislation and GTR requirements were satisfied.

The objective of this work is to develop and implement an intelligent medical decision system for identifying Ultrasound (US) carotid artery images with vascular diseases. The proposed method categorizes the carotid artery subjects into normal and diseased subjectsâ€™ namely cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. For each and every preprocessed ultrasound carotid artery image, contours are extracted using contour extraction techniques. Multilayer Back Propagation Network (MBPN) system has been developed for categorizing the carotid artery subjects. The obtained results show that MBPN system provides higher classification efficiency, with minimum training and testing time. It helps in developing Medical Decision System (MDS) for ultrasound carotid artery images. It can also be used as secondary observer in clinical decision making.

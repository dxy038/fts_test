During the driving process, to reduce Power Input and improve Portable Performance of the anti-flood spiral pile equipment, it needs to deduce the Resistance Torque of computational formula for the head of the anti-flood spiral pile between soil, which bases on establishing the Pile-soil Interaction Mechanical model for the head of the anti-flood spiral pile and combining with soil spherical cavity expansion theory. Then, take the resistance torque as the objective function, and the spiral diameter, blade width, thread pitch as optimization variables. In MATLAB write programs, call Fmincon optimization function, and it can obtain a reasonable optimization results.

In this paper, a novel image zooming method based on the boundary effect is proposed, which combines the advantage of the nearest neighbor interpolator and the bilinear interpolator in edge zooming area. Comparing the proposed method with the above two traditional interpolation algorithms, the result of computer simulation reveals that the former has higher performance, especially for the image containing both words and non-words information, in terms of some objective evaluation criteria.

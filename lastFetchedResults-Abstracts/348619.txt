Objective
To examine maturation of the central auditory pathways in children with language-based learning problems (LP).
Methods
Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) recorded from 26 children with LP were compared to CAEPs recorded from 38 typical children. CAEP responses were recorded in response to a speech sound, /uh/, which was presented in a stimulus train with decreasing inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 2000, 1000, 560, and 360 ms.
Results
We identified three atypical morphological categories of CAEP responses in the LP group. Category 1 responses revealed delayed P1 latencies and absent N1/P2 components. Category 2 responses revealed typical P1 responses, but delayed N1 and P2 responses. Category 3 responses revealed generally low-amplitude CAEP responses. A fourth sub-group of LP children had normal CAEP responses.
Conclusions
Overall, the majority of children with LP had abnormal CAEP responses. These children fell into distinct categories based on the abnormalities in maturational patterns of their CAEP responses.
Significance
We describe a rate sensitive stimulation paradigm which may be used to identify and categorize LP children who exhibit abnormal patterns of central auditory maturation.

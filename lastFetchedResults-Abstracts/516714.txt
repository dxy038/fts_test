The highest temperatures of the world are recorded in dry and warm climates. This can especially be observed in deserts, where vegetations and soil moisture are very low. As a result, the soil surface receives high thermal energy and its temperature rises up. The Lut desert has the above characteristics, making it a suitable environment to prepare land surface temperature (LST) models. Objective of this study was preparing of LST model in the Lut desert. It has been used 12 satellite images of NOAA-AVHRR in 2001 as well as meteorological data to model the LST of Lut desert Yardangs for the study. To test the model accuracy, 8 ground control points were applied. Results have shown that useful information of surface (mention them) can be attainable. Due to several problems present in measuring the surface temperature of features using thermal remote sensing data, it is necessary to apply precise radiation potential for features or soils to measure temperature precisely.

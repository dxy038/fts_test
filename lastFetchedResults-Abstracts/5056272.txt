[Objective] The research aimed to optimize extraction process of total flavonoids from Pteridum aquilinum var.latiusculum and provide a theoretical basis for development and utilization of total flavonoids from Pteridum aquilinum var.latiusculum. [Method] Taking the yield of total flavonoids as index, the orthogonal test L16 (44) with four factors and four levels was used to optimize the technological condition of total flavonoids including volume fraction of ethanol, boiling time, leaching time and solid-liquid ratio on the basis of the single-factor experiments. [Result] The results showed that the optimal extraction process of total flavonoids from Pteridum aquilinum var.latiusculum was as follows: volume fraction of ethanol 60%, boiling time 2.0 h, leaching time 1.0 h and solid-liquid ratio 1:30. The yield of total flavonoids was 8.80% under the optimized extraction process. The total flavonoids contents in different organs of Pteridum aquilinum var.latiusculum were in order: fat-free leaves&gt;;leaves&gt;;fat-free petioles&gt;;petioles. [Conclusion] The extracting total flavonoids method established in this study could obtain higher yield comparing with traditional methods, which was simple, easy and to save time in practice.

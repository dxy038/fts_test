The paper proposes a novel Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA) for solving optimal power flow (OPF) problems with considering transmission security for practical application. The objective of OPF is to minimize total generation cost, enhance transmission security, reduce transmission loss and improve the bus voltage profile under normal or contingent states. Moreover, the valve-point loading effect of thermal units should be taken into consideration. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for a 26-bus and the IEEE 30-bus systems, and it is compared with the PSO-RO algorithm in terms of solution quality and evolutionary computing efficiency.

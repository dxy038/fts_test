The objective of this paper is to develop and analyze an analog circuit capable of delivering regulated output voltage in a dual input buck converter. The major components of the control circuit comprise a PI controller block and a duty ratio limit block. The PI controller is designed through linear control theory and the duty ratio limit on the each power switch is based on the relative amplitude of the source voltage connected to each power source. The development of the circuit is explained first followed by computed and measured results on a prototype.

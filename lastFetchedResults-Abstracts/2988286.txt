The paper deals with the building and use of symbolic models for the sizing of static converters. After a presentation of a way to use such a model in an optimisation process for sizing, the paper presents the structure chosen for the sizing model. Such a model is characterised by coherence criteria and generic criteria that can be defined automatically, specific criteria defined by the user and an objective function to achieve. Then, the cautions in using such a model, mainly its numerical instabilities, are discussed and a way to solve them is proposed. After, the paper presents the computer implementation of the model builders. Finally, it illustrates the approach with an example

Objective
This report describes a case of a 62-year-old male with giant cell carcinoma of the larynx that presented as a neck mass and hoarseness.
Methods
Case report, review of the world literature, and an immunohistochemical examination.
Results
Extended total laryngectomy and bilateral functional neck dissection were performed. Microscopical examination showed that the tumor was composed of solid masses of anaplastic small cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. There were multinucleated giant cells with huge nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and clear or eosinophylic cytoplasm. The diagnosis of giant cell carcinoma of the larynx was made. An immunohistochemical staining was applied to the case and tumor showed immunoreactivity with cytokeratin 8/18, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 19, vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen, S-100, cytokeratin 7 and did not show immunoreactivity with cytokeratin 10, cytokeratin 20, and carcinoembryogenic antigen.
Conclusion
Giant cell carcinoma of the larynx is an extremely rare tumor the origin of which is not clearly understood. It is believed to be the counterpart of giant cell carcinoma of the lung in larynx. It is the sixth case reported in English literature and also the first case that is examined immunohistochemically. In conclusion, giant cell carcinoma of the larynx is confirmed to be a specific entity of simple epithelial origin and it is the counterpart of giant cell carcinoma of the lung.

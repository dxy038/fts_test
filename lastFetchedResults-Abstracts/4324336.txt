Imaging techniques open new vistas in various fields of science, such as the observation of ultra-high-speed events, very dark signals under a couple of photons, signals with a frequency range outside of visible light, such as X-ray, Infrared and THz signals. The objective of this forum is to present applications and details of circuits, system and sensor device techniques to realize such scientific imaging, starting with the overview of scientific imaging across wavelengths, followed by a discussion of CMOS-based sensor devices and circuits for multi-spectral imaging. The next two talks cover ultra-high speed imaging up to 20Mfps, and ultra-high-sensitivity imaging by SPAD. The next two talks cover IR imaging and readout circuitry, one for uncooled conditions and the other for ultra-low temperature conditions for astronomy. The final three talks highlight THz imaging, overview, system aspects, and CMOS realization.

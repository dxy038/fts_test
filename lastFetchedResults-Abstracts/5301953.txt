Region of interest (ROI) video coding offers an efficient way of improving the picture quality of the important areas in a picture. State of the art video coding standard, H.264, provides a set of handy tools to implement ROI coding easily. This paper presents a novel technique to represent ROI using the flexible macroblock ordering (FMO) and a rate control technique to improve the picture quality in ROI. Experimental results show that 2 dB objective quality gain can be achieved over the ROI

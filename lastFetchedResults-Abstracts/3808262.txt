The objective here is the analysis of a systematic error inherently existing in aircraft geometric height monitoring under radar surveillance. This error is caused by the nonlinear processing of noisy measurements. The geometric height system under investigation uses mixed-type radar data, since the height is computed by referring range raw measurements to horizontal trajectory smoothed data

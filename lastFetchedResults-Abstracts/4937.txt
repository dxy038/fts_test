The effect of an alternate strategy employing two different flowrates during loading was explored as a means of increasing system productivity in Protein-A chromatography. The effect of such a loading strategy was evaluated using a chromatographic model that was able to accurately predict experimental breakthrough curves for this Protein-A system. A gradient-based optimization routine is carried out to establish the optimal loading conditions (initial and final flowrates and switching time). The two-step loading strategy (using a higher flowrate during the initial stages followed by a lower flowrate) was evaluated for an Fc-fusion protein and was found to result in significant improvements in process throughput. In an extension of this optimization routine, dynamic loading capacity and productivity were simultaneously optimized using a weighted objective function, and this result was compared to that obtained with the single flowrate. Again, the dual-flowrate strategy was found to be superior.

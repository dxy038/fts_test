This paper focuses on the analysis and synthesis of optimal servo control for network-based systems subjected to connection failure. It is shown that for an open loop stable system containing integral control action, existence conditions as well as the initial feasible controller gains are solely dependent on a set of interaction indices which can be computed directly from the open loop DC gains of the system. It is the objective of this paper to provide a procedure to synthesize an optimal control for the system with the nominal operation reformulated as an optimization constraint. The synthesis process is carried out using nonlinear optimization techniques to minimize a discrete-time Lyapunov equation performance index to obtain the optimal control parameters. An example is also provided to illustrate the key properties of this approach.

Background and Objectives: Gamma ray has been shown as an effective method to reducing or eliminating microbial contamination of raw and cooked meat products. However, irradiation-induced chemical and sensory changes are important to accept the technology for both the meat industry and consumers. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of gamma-irradiation (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 kGy) on the fatty acid and lipid oxidation of German sausage during refrigerated storage (4 oC).

Materials and Methods: German sausage samples were irradiated at 2, 4, 6 and 8 kGy doses. During the storage period at 4 oC, TBA value and fatty acid profiles were considered.

Results: The TBA value was significantly increased by irradiation at 6 and 8 kGy. Also irradiation at 6 and 8 kGy caused significant decrease of oleic acid and linoleic acid and significant increase of total trans fatty acids in both of these products.

Conclusion:&nbsp; Irradiation at 2 and 4 kGy doses is suggested as the best dose. However, more research in the subject seems necessary.

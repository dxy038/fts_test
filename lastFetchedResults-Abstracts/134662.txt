Background: Satureja Khuzestanica is an endemic plant of Iran widely distributed in the southern part of the country. This plant is famous for its medical applications as an analgesic and antiseptic in folk medicine.
Objective: To investigate the effect of oral administration of aqueous extract of Satureja Khuzestanica on hemostasis and body weight in vivo.
Methods: This research was an experimental study carried out in Lorestan Medicinal Herbs Research Center, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khoram-abad, Iran. Thirty six rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. An equivalent of 50 mg of aqueous extract of Satureja Khuzestanicalkg was orally administered. For two weeks the rats in group I and 2 received an equal amount of extract once and three times a day, respectively. Control group received only pure water. Animals' weights were measured every day. Following two weeks, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were determined. Data were analyzed using One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey multiple comparison tests.
Findings: As compared to control, the administration of aqueous extract of Satureja Khuzestanica as 3 separate dose/day resulted in a significant prolongation of APTT by 20.7% (p<0.001), PT by 15.7% (p<0.05) and a reduction of body weight by % 9.24 (p<0.001) after 2 weeks.
Conclusion: Regarding our data, it seems that the aqueous extract of Satureja Khuzestanica induced some changes in coagulation activity shown by increased values for APTT and PT. Loss of body weight in rats was also observed when the extract administered three times a clay.

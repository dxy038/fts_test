A hybrid generator with a photovoltaic energy conversion system is proposed with supercapacitors and lead-acid batteries in a dc-coupled structure. The objective of this system is to supply the prescribed reactive and active power to the grid. This paper focuses on the strategy, which makes it possible to ensure a high battery state of charge and overcharge security by designing a dedicated local control system. A continuous dynamic model and a control design of the power system studied are proposed in this paper. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the performances obtained.

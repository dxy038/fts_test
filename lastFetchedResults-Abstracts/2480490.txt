ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Stomach cancer tends to progress gradually over the years. Considering the relationship between blood type, peptic ulcers and impaired mucus secretion, we aimed to determine the frequency of ABO and Rh blood types in patients with stomach cancer.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 150 patients with stomach cancer, referring to Shahid Beheshti Hospital of Babol for surgical interventions during 2006-2011. Moreover, 150 control patients with no prior history of cancer, referring to the clinics, were included in this study. Data including age and sex were recorded in a checklist. After determining patients’ blood type and Rh, age, sex, blood type and Rh were converted into numerical codes, and the two groups were compared. 
FINDINGS: The mean age of subjects was 61.25±14.52 years in the study group and 58.37±16.37 years in the control group. The number of male subjects was higher than females in both groups. Among 150 patients with gastric cancer, 36 (24%), 47 (3.31%), 2 (3.1%) and 65 (3.43%) patients had A, B, AB and O blood types, respectively. In the control group, 33 (22%), 36 (24%), 8 (5.3%) and 73 (7.48%) subjects had A, B, AB and O blood types, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the frequency of O blood type was higher in patients with stomach cancer, compared to other blood types.

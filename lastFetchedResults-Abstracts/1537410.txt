The objective of the present work is to investigate how pattern formation in the Cahnâ€“Hilliard system can be influenced by geometry of the manifold. This is in contrast to control methods in which the physical field is modified and the pattern formation of the original system changes in response to control inputs. The idea begins with the cylindrical manifold symmetry leading to circumferential rolls while the torus manifold can be used to produce and control helical rolls. The next step is to search for a weaker restriction on the geometry of the manifold in order to reduce its dimension. In particular a short amplitude sinusoidal modulation on a flat surface is studied. At the final step a sequential pattern formation is presented.

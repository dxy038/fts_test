In this paper an algorithm for optimal design of active power filters using Strength Pareto multi-objective optimization approach is proposed. Some parameters of the repetitive current controller together with the inverterÂ´s DC bus voltage have been considered as design variables. Different optimizing pairs of objective functions including THD of the line currents and the transient response of the filter have been considered and discussed. The proposed methodology gives a wider horizon to the controller design task for active power filters. The simulation and experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed design methodology.

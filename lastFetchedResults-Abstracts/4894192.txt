With the increasing acceptance, micro-grid, combined with distributed generation (DG), may be operated in two modes: grid-connected mode and island mode. In grid connected mode, energy management is the control objective. While in island mode, the control of Voltage and frequency will take the place. The conventional droop control can perform the energy management in grid-connected mode, but may not so effective when micro-grid transferring between grid-connected mode and island mode. The paper analysis the micro-grid in different modes (Conventional droop control, Voltage reference compensation, Constant power output mode, Phase adjustment mode), and then proposes an overall control strategy for the micro-grid. The voltage reference compensation would minimize the steady-state error on the nominated operation point; the coordinate control of voltage and frequency with a feed forward control of the voltage and frequency deviation added to power references could achieve secondary regulation of the voltage and frequency. In this paper, the authors take the steady and transient transition of grid connecting and disconnecting of the micro-grid as an example, and demonstrate that compensation on voltage reference is effective, and voltage and frequency coordination control can well perform not only energy management in grid-connected mode, but also the secondary regulation of voltage and frequency when micro-grid separates from the main grid, and furthermore the strategy can perform well in the transition states between the operation modes. The new droop control method has been validated through simulations by PSCAD software and experiments.

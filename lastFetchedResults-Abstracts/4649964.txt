This work deals with complex and typical problem in order to optimize both water and energy management for water pumping and desalination processes. This contribution aims at proposing a management strategy for a Brackish Water Reverse Osmosis (BWRO) desalination plant. This unit is powered by a hybrid source mixing photovoltaic and wind resources. The main objective of the developed strategy is to maximize fresh water production taking advantage of the available renewable energy. This strategy ensures the DC link stability and manages the power flows between the hybrid source and the motor-pumps of the BWRO desalination process. The proposed method gives correct results confirmed by simulation results and experimental tests.

Background. Acquisition of Helicobacter pylori infection occurs mainly during childhood. To study the events associated with H. pylori colonization in children it is important to have reliable diagnostic methods. Our objective was to validate invasive and noninvasive tests for diagnosis of H. pylori infection in children before and after antimicrobial treatment.

s. Before treatment, invasive rapid urease test (RUT) culture and histology, as well as the noninvasive carbon-13 urea breath test (13C-UBT) and serology were validated in 59 children. The gold standard for H. pylori infection was any of three positives of the five tests. After antimicrobial treatment culture, histology, and 13C-UBT were validated in 43 children to determine eradication. The gold standard for eradication was negative in all three tests.

s. For primary diagnosis, RUT was the most sensitive and specific test, followed by 13C-UBT, which performed better than serology, culture, and histology. Concordance tests also showed that RUT and 13C-UBT performed better. For determination of eradication, 13C-UBT and histology were better than culture, which showed poor sensitivity.

sions. RUT performed better for primary diagnosis. However, as endoscopy might not be indicated in most children, 13C-UBT could be the test of choice for diagnosis of H. pylori infection both before and after eradication treatment.

Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine if high-arched and low-arched runners exhibit different injury patterns.

Design. Non-randomized, two-group injury survey.

Background. Running-related injuries are thought to be related, in part, to lower extremity structure. High-arched and low-arched runners with their different bony architecture may exhibit very different lower extremity mechanics and, consequently, different injury patterns. It was hypothesized that high-arched runners will exhibit a greater incidence of lateral injuries, skeletal injuries and knee injuries while low-arched runners will show a greater incidence of medial injuries, soft tissue injuries and foot injuries.

Methods. Twenty high-arched and 20 low-arched runners were included in this study. Running-related injuries were recorded and divided into injury patterns of medial/lateral, bony/soft tissue and knee/foot and ankle for both high-arched and low-arched runners. A Ï‡2 analysis was then employed in an attempt to associate injury patterns with arch structure.

Results. High-arched runners reported a greater incidence of ankle injuries, bony injuries and lateral injuries. Low-arched runners exhibited more knee injuries, soft tissue injuries and medial injuries.

Conclusions. Based on these results, high and low arch structure is associated with different injury patterns in runners.

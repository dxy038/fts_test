This paper describes, simulates and compares a four segment CSMA/CD network and a four segment CSMA/CD network interconnected by FDDI. We evaluate the performance of an FDDI network under varying load and changing topographical conditions and compare the results to the original CSMA/CD network. The objective of the paper is to study the performance benefits of the migration using simulation, to determine if stated FDDI performance objectives can be met with the existing equipment, and to discuss implementation issues

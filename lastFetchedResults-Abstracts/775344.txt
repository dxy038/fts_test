Inter-AS outbound traffic engineering (TE) is a set of techniques for
controlling inter-AS traffic exiting an autonomous system (AS) by assigning the
traffic to the best egress points (i.e. routers or links) from which the traffic is forwarded
to adjacent ASes towards the destinations. In practice, changing network
conditions such as inter-AS traffic demand variation, link failures and inter-AS
routing changes occur dynamically. These changes can make fixed outbound TE
solutions inadequate and may subsequently cause inter-AS links to become congested.
In order to overcome this problem, we propose the deployment of a closedloop
control traffic engineering system that makes outbound traffic robust to inter-AS
link failures and adaptive to changing network conditions. The objective is to keep
the inter-AS link utilization balanced under unexpected events while reducing service
disruptions and reconfiguration overheads. Our evaluation results show that the
proposed system can successfully achieve better load balancing with less service
disruption and re-configuration overhead in comparison to alternative approaches.

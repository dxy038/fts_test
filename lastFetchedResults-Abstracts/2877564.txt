This study presents a simulation design and analysis case study of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) considering a multi-response simulation optimization using TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) based Taguchi approach. While in order to reduce expensive simulation experiments with the Taguchi design, the TOPSIS procedure is used to combine the multiple FMS responses (performance measures) into a single response in the optimization processes. Thus, TOPSIS carries out an important role to build a surrogate objective function that represents multiple responses of the system. The integrated approach finds a new design considering discrete factors (physical and operational parameters) which affect the performance measures of FMS. Optimal design configuration is obtained for the considered system with improved performance.

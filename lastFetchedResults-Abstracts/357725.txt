Objective Our purpose was to measure the effect of ventricular pacing in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on stroke volume and cardiac output. Background  Unceasing variation in cycle length in AF decreases stroke volume and cardiac output. Because ventricular-inhibited pacing after atrioventricular node ablation has been reported to improve left ventricular performance, we tested the hypothesis that overdrive pacing would produce a similar benefit by regularizing cycle length. Methods and Results  We studied 18 patients with chronic AF and permanent pacemakers. The aortic time velocity integral (TVI) was measured with continuous-wave Doppler and was used as a surrogate measure of stroke volume (stroke volume = TVI Ã— aortic valve area, and aortic valve area is constant whether in AF or during pacing). For each patient, the linear relation between preceding cycle length and TVI in AF was used to estimate relative stroke volume (TVI compared within each patient) at a preceding cycle length of 666 ms in AF, and a similar comparison between AF and pacing was made at the minimum allowable pacing rate. Relative stroke volume in AF was then compared with relative stroke volume at both the fixed cycle (666 ms) and the minimum allowable rate. During pacing at 666 ms, relative stroke volume increased significantly by 18% (t = 2.8, P  = .048), but there was no difference in cardiac output during pacing at the minimum possible rate and the corresponding preceding cycle length in AF. Conclusion Our data suggest that regularization of ventricular rhythm by overdrive pacing in patients with AF only improves stroke volume (and by extension, cardiac output) at pacing rates at the outer limit of and above the normal physiologic range.

This paper describes a novel method for heat-up phase control of an industrial batch polymerization reactor
where heat transfer characteristics change with batches due to fouling of the polymer products on the
reactor wall. The main objective of the control is to settle the reactor temperature on a target value within
_+ 0.1Â°C in a minimum possible time. To achieve this goal utilizing the repetitive nature of batch operation,
the control problem was defined as a tracking problem and feedback-assisted iterative learning control
(FBALC) was employed as the underlying control technique. The proposed control method was
applied to an industrial batch reactor polymerizing ABS resin. After on-site evaluation for an extended
period of time, it was found that the proposed method gives a pronounced improvement in heat-up phase
operation. Consistent heat-up profiles with a minimized settling time are obtained.

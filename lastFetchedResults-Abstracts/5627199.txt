Multi-finger microaccelerometer are microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices based on IC technology and micro-machining technology, which are widely implemented both in military and civilian fields. Robust Collaborative Optimization (RCO) method is built based on CO method. The research establishes the RCO Model based on genetic algorithm for the problem, and proposes a MATLAB program to calculate it, which eliminate the coupling of the system and minimize the fluctuations of the system objective function, so as to obtain the stable and optimal solution for the system. The results are compared and analyzed to validate the effectiveness of RCO method and MATLAB program. The research analyzes the cause and effect of variable quantity magnitude difference problem encountered in the process, and proposes weight variation method to improve, which eliminates the impact of the problem.

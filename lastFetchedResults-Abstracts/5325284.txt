In this paper a mono-objective optimum design procedure for a six-degree of freedom parallel micro robot is outlined by using optimality criterion of workspace and numerical aspects. A mono-objective optimization problem is formulated by referring to a basic performance of parallel robots. Additional objective functions can be used to extend the proposed design procedure to more general but specific design problems. A kinematic optimization was performed to maximize the workspace of the mini parallel robot. Optimization was performed using genetic algorithms.

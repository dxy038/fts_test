A new Pareto-based differential evolution (PDE) algorithm for solving multi-objective optimization problems was proposed by applying the nondominated sorting and ranking selection procedure developed in NSGA-II to select nondominated individuals to constitute a nondominated solution set. The PDE algorithm was validated using eight benchmark cases. The experimental results show that PDE, compared with NSGA-II algorithm, can find many Pareto optimal solutions distributed onto the Pareto front uniformly, which is an effective method to solve multi-objective optimization problems.

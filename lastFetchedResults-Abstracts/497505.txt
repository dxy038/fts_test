The proper and suitable utilization of rangelands will cause their sustainable utilization and decrease range degradation. It also promotes range condition and plant composition. So the objective of present research was identification of criteria to help range managers to choose proper utilization level. To do this, Taleghan catchment was selected. Criteria of soil sensitivity to erosion, range condition and trend were considered. Vegetation types were considered as management unit and in each vegetation types, sensitivity of soil to erosion, range condition and trend were evaluated. Based on the mentioned factors the proper utilization factor was determined. According to the results, proper utilization factor in Taleghan rangelands varies between 20-50% depending on the criteria condition in each vegetation type. Consequently, map of allowable use in the study region was prepared. Generally, in Taleghan rangelands allowable use depends on criteria and differs among vegetation types.

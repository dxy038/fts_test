Code-excited linear prediction (CELP), a powerful technique for low-bit-rate speech coding, leads to a huge computational load. A related scheme that replaces the conventional stochastic excitation by an efficient regular pulse excitation is introduced. This method, called regular pulse CELP (RPCELP), takes advantage of the codebook structure together with a convenient perceptual criterion to achieve a very low complexity while maintaining high-quality output speech. The algorithm can be implemented easily in real-time and can provide good communication quality at 6 Kb/s, even over noisy transmission channels. Objective performance results are reported for several configurations

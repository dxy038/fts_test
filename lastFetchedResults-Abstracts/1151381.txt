The objective of this paper is to present the development of a new composite material used for designing of metal forming stamping tools. Therefore, the experimental research has been carried out to define the mathematical model for the composite production process by using experimental planning method. The correlation between the composite production process’s parameters and the mechanical properties was the main point of the mathematical treatment and optimisation of the composite. The designed composite material has been implemented in stamping tool as a material for the upper and lower shoe of the tool as well as for the material stripper. The stress–strain condition of the tool has been investigated by using finite element method. The results show that the compressive, impact and flexural strength and surface hardness of the composite can response to the high level requirements for metal forming tool design in the field of tool stiffness and geometry.

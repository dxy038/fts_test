The authors describe level-of-repair analyses for four major US Army weapon/communication systems using the Optimum Supply and Maintenance Model (OSAMM). The four systems are: Single Channel Objective Tactical Terminal (SCOTT); Global Positioning System (GPS); Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS); and Hawk guided missile. The analyses compare the costs associated with a strict two-level maintenance concept with the resulting costs of other maintenance alternatives (e.g. three- and four-level, with and without screening). The authors identify the sensitivity of the resulting cost to such factors as inaccurate built-in test (BIT); TMDE (test measurement and diagnostic equipment) costs, including test program sets; provisioning levels and supply support measures, including number and placement of test equipment and maintenance personnel; and the impact of repair vs. discard. The cost of each policy is assessed not only in terms of dollars, but also in terms of operational availability and system readiness

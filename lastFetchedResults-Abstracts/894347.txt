Backgroud & Objective:  Debridment necrotic tissues then healing under tissue  is one of the necessary intervention in management  burn wounds. The presence of necrotic tissue is an important problem in patients with deep burns. This study compare  topical effectivness of kiwifruit versus Elase pomade on removal of necrotic tissue of  full-thickness burns in male rats.
Material & Methods: In this experimental study, were selected 10 vistar rats. After anesthesia by ketamin and xylosine, both flanks of rats were shaved. Then full thickness burns with 3cm diameter were produced using boiling water. Rats were divided into 3 groups randomly. One side of the first was treated by elase pomade and the other side of the first was treated by elase pomade and the othere side in group was used from topical kiwifruit.
Results:Findings showed that kiwifruit debridement time with 5/7days was related to elase pomade(p=0/001). also this difference was significant in elase groups(p=0/001). On the other hand there was relatively no significant difference between debridement time in two control groups. In addition neo-epithelialization and healing were faster other groups.
Conclusion: The result of research indicate that using topical kiwifruit not only causes no injury to healthy tissues but also can be debridement in the short time. Findings this study can open new horizons and provid a new treatment modality for burns.

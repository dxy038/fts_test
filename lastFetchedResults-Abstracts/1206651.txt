Territory and territoriality are the philosophical foundation of politicalgeography. Territory as the spatial objective arising from the ownership's natural right and desire to survive has directed the human's territoriality behavior such that interpretation of human's action and behavior has been largely a function of his territoriality character. Many of the concepts and themes of political geography Are defined and operationalized consciously or unconsciously in connection with such features. Expansion of territory is not necessarily sequent of the political boundaries; rather it varies according to the scope of awareness, activism, decision-making and the role of humans and human groups. The data Collection was done by Library method. Theresearch results indicated that at least from 1970 onwards, with the globalization of technology and democracy, the mental and content aspects of human activism have gotten more importance in invisible dimensions but space making will represent more aspects of territory in the future.

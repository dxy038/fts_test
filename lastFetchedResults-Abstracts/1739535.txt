In this paper we analyse the three-parametric phase diagram of the classical Lorenz model. This has been done by the combined use of different techniques. The most important one for our objective is the combined use of the recently developed OFLI2 Chaos Indicator and the classical Maximum Lyapunov Exponent, which have permitted a fast and complete location of the chaotic parameter region. As a result, we provide a three-parametric model of the chaotic regime for the Lorenz system that gives new light on this classical problem.

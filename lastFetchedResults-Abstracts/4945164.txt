Vibrato is a frequency modulation effect of the singing voice and is very relevant in musical terms. Its most important characteristics are the vibrato frequency (in Hertz) and the vibrato extension (in semitones). In singing teaching and learning, it is very convenient to provide a visual feedback of those two objective signal characteristics, in real-time. In this paper we describe an algorithm performing vibrato detection and analysis. Since this capability depends on fundamental frequency (F0) analysis of the singing voice, we first discuss F0 estimation and compare three algorithms that are used in voice and speech analysis. Then we describe the vibrato detection and analysis algorithm and assess its performance using both synthetic and natural singing signals. Overall, results indicate that the relative estimation errors in vibrato frequency and extension are lower than 0.1%.

We proposed a simple and flexible bidirectional optical amplifier (BOA) that consists of one erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). This BOA is especially suitable for networks having asymmetric traffic patterns since the circuit configuration of BOA can be modified easily by manipulation of AWG ports connection. We constructed the BOA and demonstrated its performance for 10-Gb/s symmetric traffic over 80-km single-mode fiber. The proposed BOA worked well with negligible relative intensity noise by virtue of intrinsic tolerance of backscattering in an AWG.

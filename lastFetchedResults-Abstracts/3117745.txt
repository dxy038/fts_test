As the qualitative assessment does not objectively reflect the nature characteristics of the data model, it is also necessary to establish a quantitative evaluation method in order to scientifically reflect the performance computing space of X3D-based ORGDM. However, other professional model for reflecting the objective laws of nature, its quantitative evaluation method does not apply to the quantitative evaluation on X3D-based ORGDM. On the basis of database research, combining with the characteristics of geospatial data model, put forward that use the superimposed calculation efficiency based on X3D-based ORGDM to quantitatively evaluate its performance space under the two different management style between comparing file system and database systems in this paper. Then, design the experiment according to the method. The experimental results objectively reflect the performance computing space of X3D-based ORGDM really. At last, we introduce the application of X3D-based ORGDM for the specific project briefly.

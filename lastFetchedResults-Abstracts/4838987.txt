This paper introduces a multi-objective optimization approach for layout synthesis of MEMS components. A case study of layout synthesis of a comb-driven micro-resonator shows that the approach proposed in this paper can lead to design results accommodating two design objectives, i.e. simultaneous minimization of size and power input of a MEMS device, while investigating optimum geometrical configuration as the main concern. The major contribution of this paper is the application of memetic computing in MEMS design. An evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) technique, in particular non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), has been applied to find multiple trade-off solutions followed by a gradient-based local search, i.e. sequential quadratic programming (SQP), to improve the convergence of the obtained Pareto-optimal front. In order to reduce the number of function evaluations in the local search procedure, the obtained non-dominated solutions are clustered in the objective space and consequently, a post optimality study is manually performed to find out some common design principles among those solutions. Finally, two reasonable design choices have been offered based on manufacturability issues.

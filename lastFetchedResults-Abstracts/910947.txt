ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Allium latifolium has polyphenolic compounds with power antioxidant properties which reduce serum lipids. Phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP) is a key enzyme in controlling the synthesis of glycerophospholipids. The aim of  this study was to determine the effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of Allium latifolium on the liver PAP and serum lipid profile in hyperlipidemic rats.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 40 male rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (8 in each group). Group I (normal) received standard diet, group II received cholesterol and oil diet (without treatment group), and groups III and IV were the rats which received cholesterol (Chol) and oil plus 150 and 300 mg/kg bw Allium latifolium extract, respectively. Group V were the rats which received cholesterol and oil diet plus 30 mg/kg bw gemfibrozyl. At the end of the study, liver PAP activity, liver triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol, and serum lipoprotein levels were determined and compared. 
FINDINGS: In group II, liver PAP activity showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) compared to other groups. In  groups III and IV (the rats which received Allium latifolium extract),  the liver Chol and TG, serum HDL-C, TG, total Chol, and VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoprotein) concentrations showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) compared to group II (the rats without treatment). In group IV, serum total cholesterol indicated a significant elevation (62.30%) with respect to group III (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The consumption of Allium latifolium in the low dose can reduce the side effects of hyperlipidemia such as elevated serum Chol and TG.

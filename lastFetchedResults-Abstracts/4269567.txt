The voxel array sequence is utilized to build up spatial composite scale explaining the relative grade of regional quality, constructing the appraisal model of regional quality based on three key elements of process capability, product characteristic and market effect. By comparison and analysis based on simulation system and appraisal pointer approach between different regional qualities, the objective of evaluating regional quality can be realized.

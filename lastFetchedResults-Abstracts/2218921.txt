The objective of the present study was to detect polymorphism in follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and beta subunit of follicle stimulating hormone (FSHB) genes and their relation to litter size and body weight trait in Baluchi, Iran black and Arman sheep breeds. PCR-RFLP technique using ACCI and HinfI enzyme treatments employed to detection of polymorphism in FSHB marker site but detected no polymorphism pattern in this locus. SSCP analysis used for more survey on detection of polymorphism in FSHB marker site which resulted in AA and AC genotypes in Baluchi sheep, AA and AB genotypes in Iran black population and no polymorphism pattern detected in Arman breed and all samples showed AA geno-type. Polymorphism in FSHR gene has been detected by treatment with MSCI restriction enzyme. Three genotypes of AA, AB and BB were observed among studied breeds. The B allele was found with the high-est frequency in all tree breeds. Analysis of variance for the effects of theses marker loci was carried out using SAS program. Mean comparison by Duncan test showed that the effect of each FSHB and FSHR marker sites on litter size has significant effect only in Baluchi sheep population. It seems mutant alleles can improve considerably mean of litter size than the wild type ones. Analysis of data for body weight and polymorphisms in different ages showed that there are no significant differences between genotypes of FSHB locus and body weight trait in various ages in none of Baluchi, Iran-black and Arman breeds. Survey on polymorphisms of FSHR locus and body weight trait revealed significant difference in some ages only in Arman breed and wild type allele caused better performance. This information can be used to plan breeding programs for sheep breeds aimed at improving production and reproduction performance.

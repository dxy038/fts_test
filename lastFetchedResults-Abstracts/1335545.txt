A design approach is presented for the multi-objective optimal design problem of aeroelastic laminated doubly curved shallow shells. The design objective is the maximization of weighted sum of the critical aerodynamic pressures under different probability density function of flow orientations. The design variable is the fiber orientations in the layers of the symmetrically angle-ply shells. Four typical probability density functions of flow orientations are considered. Hamilton’s principle with the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is used in the flutter analysis of supersonic doubly curved shallow shells. The multi-objective optimal design problem of symmetrical alternating angle-ply sequence [θ/−θ/θ/−θ]s and symmetrical arbitrary angle-ply sequence [θ1/θ2/θ3/θ4]s laminated shell structure are investigated. Finally, using a layerwise optimization approach (LOA), the optimal fiber orientation angles of supersonic laminated shells are determined to obtain the maximum design objective.

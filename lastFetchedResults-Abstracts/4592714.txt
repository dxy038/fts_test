We have developed a 1 times 4 wideband array structure for multiple wireless applications. The utilized single element is a wide-slot antenna and has demonstrated ultra-wideband operation characteristics. The proposed antenna system associated with feeding network and antenna elements can be integrated in a single substrate. Consequently, such a design is with low fabrication and assembly cost and compact size. The bandwidth of this wideband antenna array is from 2.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz and the radiation pattern is bidirectional. The performance of the antenna array is investigated both numerically and experimentally.

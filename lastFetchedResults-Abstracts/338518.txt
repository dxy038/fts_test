Objective
We evaluated the frequency of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in CD34+CLA+ (cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen) and CD34+CLA− cord blood cells, and followed cellular growth and HPC production during cultures in Flt3 ligand, thrombopoietin, and stem cell factor (FTS).
Materials and Methods

Immunomagnetic bead-purified CD34+ cells were sorted into CD34+CLA+ or CD34+CLA− cells. HPC frequency was assessed by clonal assays in methylcellulose either ex vivo or after, 7, 14, or 21 days of culture with FTS. Dendritic cell (DC) progenitors were evaluated after induction of FTS-amplified cells into DC using secondary cultures containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4.
Results

Ex vivo, granulocyte-macrophage progenitors were more frequent and erythroid progenitors were less frequent in the CLA+ fraction. In FTS culture, CD34+CLA+ cells produced greater absolute numbers of CD34+ cells, granulocyte-macrophage-, erythroid-, and DC (including Langerhans cell-related) progenitors compared to CD34+CLA− cells. In CD34+CLA+ cultures, CLA+ cells steadily decreased with time, and CD34+CLA− cells appeared. In CD34+CLA− cultures, CLA+ cells were generated, increased up to day 7, and decreased thereafter. CLA was expressed only on CD34− cells in these cultures. Ex vivo, CD34+CLA+ cells could be subdivided further into CD38low and CD38high cells. Cord blood and growth factor-mobilized CD34+ cells contained more CLA+CD38low cells than nonmobilized peripheral blood CD34+ cells and proliferated more extensively with FTS than the latter cells.
Conclusions

CD34+CLA+ cells contain a rather immature progenitor capable of high proliferation and extensive amplification of HPC in vitro. This progenitor may be localized in the CD34+CLA+CD38low fraction. In addition, cultures of CD34+CLA+ cells from cord blood produced CD34+CLA− cells, suggesting that these cells may derive directly from CD34+CLA+ cells in vivo.

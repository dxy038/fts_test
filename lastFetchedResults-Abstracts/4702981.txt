Visual Servoing is generally comprised of feature tracking and control. According to the literature, no attempt has already been made to optimize these two parts together. In kernel based visual servoing method, the main objective is to combine and optimize the entire control loop. By kernel definition, a Lyapanov candidate function is formed and the control input is computed so that the Lyapanov stability can be verified. This is performed in four degrees of freedom. In the present study, previous kernel algorithm from the recorded literature has been implemented. We have used the KBVS for our purpose such that an object without any marker is tracked. This method is chosen because of its robustness, speed and featureless properties. Furthermore, in order to show the visual tracking performance, all four degrees of freedom have been synthesized. Experimental results verifies the effectiveness of this method implemented for four degrees of freedom movements.

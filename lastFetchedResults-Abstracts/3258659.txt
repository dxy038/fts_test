This paper considers the problem of distributed state feedback controller design for interconnected nonlinear systems operating on different time scales. The proposed approach relies on dissipative systems theory to guarantee the stability of a network of interconnected subsystems operating on different time scales, where each subsystem objective is encoded as a supply rate. In particular, the supply rates parameterize the time scale separation between different subsystems. Then, for each subsystems, a storage function and an associated damping feedback controller are built to guarantee that the local dissipative objective is met. An example is presented to illustrate the approach.

The Brazilian biodiesel program has created great demand for biodiesel. The production of oleaginous derived biodiesel produced by small-scale farmers is a key objective of PNPB. The Social Fuel Seal is one of the instruments for achieving this goal. Five years after the mandatory implementation of program, Brazil is among the world's leading producers of biodiesel. However, the goal of the productive insertion of small-scale farmers in Brazil's less favored regions has not been fully achieved. The Brazilian government has faced difficulties to promote regional development based on PNPB, consequently not reaching the audacious goals that were set at the beginning of the program. In this context of difficulties, the productive arrangements with palm oil should be emphasized. This paper submits in detail the model developed by Agropalma – in partnership with public agencies – together with family farming in the North of the country. These social projects are taken as reference and can promote social inclusion in the country's national biodiesel productive chain. Moreover, this case can serve as an assessment tool for other countries that seek to invest in the production of biodiesel with the concern for the social production inclusion of disadvantaged small-scale family farmers.

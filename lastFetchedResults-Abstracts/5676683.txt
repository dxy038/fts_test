Applying the fundamental work of Zienkiewicz and Boroomand, this paper introduces a methodology for automated mesh optimization based on estimates of the discretization error. The objective of this effort has been the use of the methodology with a commercial FEM code (ANSYS<sup>TM</sup>) and its application to thermal stress analyses of flip chip modules (FC) and chip size packages (CSP) with solder joints, which means the presence of nonlinear material models (plasticity and creep).

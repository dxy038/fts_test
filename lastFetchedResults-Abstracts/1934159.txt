The objective of this study was to investigate the different levels of dietary Se (from sodium selenite) on the proliferation of SSCs (spermatogonial stem cells) in testis of roosters. Also, the antioxidant status and Se content in blood plasma and testis were evaluated. A total of eighty 12-week-old Hy-Line Variety white roosters at an averaged body weight of 1.38 ± 0.2 kg were selected and randomly divided into four experimental groups. They were fed with the basal diet (0.044 mg Se/kg DM) supplemented with 0 (control), 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg Se/kg DM (from sodium selenite). After the feeding experiment, blood and testis samples were collected for analysis of the antioxidant status and Se concentration. The testis samples were also used to examine the Thy-1 and β1-integrin mRNA expression by RT-PCR and detect the population of SSCs by immunofluorescence analysis. The results show that Se concentration in blood and testis of the animals was progressively increased with the increasing Se level in diet. The highest GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase) activity and lowest MDA content in blood and testis was obtained in the treatment of 0.5 mg/kg. RT-PCR analysis showed that mRNA expression of SSCs markers were significantly lower in the control and 1.0 mg/kg groups when compared with that in the treatment of 0.5 mg/kg. A similar trend was observed in the population of SSCs analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. These data suggest that dietary Se can influence the population of SSCs of roosters during spermatogenesis and that oxidative stress can modulate SSCs behavior through regulating some key factors during spermatogenesis.

Based on the theory of large scale system general optimization, a model for optimal deployment of regional water resources with multi-sources and multi-consumers was developed. A new nonlinear integrated objective function was introduced in the model, which synthetically takes economic benefit, expense of water usage and water resourceÂ´s equilibrium distribution into account.With the restriction of water demand and supply, polluntant emission, harmonious development ,the objective function optimal value was calculated by mixed genetic algorithm. The model was applied to water resource deployment in Fenhe River basin. The results show that water demand can meet requirement at different guarantee rate.It indicate that the model can increase obviously the economic benefit and provide a scientific and balanced decision for future water deployment.

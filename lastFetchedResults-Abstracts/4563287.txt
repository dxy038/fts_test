The paper deals with a mobile vehicle-independent radar-based sensor platform which - regardless of vehicle type - measures system characteristics of assistance systems based on the surrounding area, such as the ACC system. Unlike other measurement technology systems in common use today, this equipment is integrated and concealed in a roof box. The paper describes the requirements for this kind of measurement technique and the most important system components. The primary focus is the design of the vertical and horizontal orientation of the radar-based multisensor system. Additionally, the technical system responses of an ACC test vehicle are identified with respect to one selected performance feature (time gap). The available systems can be compared by examining the system characteristics of identified system limitations on the basis of objective values and actual behaviour observed in experiments involving a representative cross-section of vehicle users in combination with additional data reflecting subjective impressions.

The objective of the present paper consists in evaluating the fatigue reliability of a railway wheel subject to multiaxial non-proportional fatigue loading. For this purpose, a combined traction/torsion loading has been considered and the endurance curve has been reported in terms of both load factor and von Mises maximum stress as a function of the number of cycles to failure. Based on fracture surface observations, a new non-local approach, using the effective normal stress and the effective shear stress, is proposed. Finally, a comparison between experimental results and theoretical prediction demonstrates that the proposed criterion gives us satisfactory results.

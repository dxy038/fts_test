The objective of this study is to clarify the possibility of biodegradation of TCE adsorbed on granular activated carbon (GAC) and to determine the adsorption capacity of bioregenerated GAC. The amount of desorption and mineralization was estimated to account for 82.5% of the total TCE (26.2 mg) adsorbed in the GAC. It indicates that incinerators were saved from the damage by HCl gas generated by decomposition of TCE. The adsorption capacity of the bioregenerated GAC was very low compared to that of new GAC indicating that the bioregenerated GAC cannot be recycled for TCE adsorption without thermal regeneration.

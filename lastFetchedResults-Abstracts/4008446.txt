In this article we consider the objective of efficient transfer of electric en1 ergy between subsystems, where each 1 subsystem can generate, store, or conl sume energy. An application example is a multidomain system consisting of a fuelcell-based generating unit, batteries, super capacitors, and electric motors or generators; this topology is used in some electric cars. Depending on the operation regime, energy must be transferred between the various units, which we refer to as multiports, according to some energy-management policy. To ensure energy exchange, the interconnection of the storage and load devices is performed by using power converters. These subsystems are electronically switched circuits capable of adapting the port voltage or current magnitudes to a desired value.

This article is a study of the background of Isfahan's revolt, during Teymur's invasion of the Mozafarid territory, in 1387, by reviewing the historiographical texts on this event. Considering the fact that Teymurid historians wrote their books for the objective of legitimizing the rulership, they merely emphasized special aspects of the event, leaving out others such as the role of social groups. It seems to be scattered writings of researchers which have brought up the issue of re-examining these texts as well as the lack of critical methods, dominated exaggeration, reduction and prejudice. Certainly the lost aspect of this event could be reconstructed only by applying critical methods and designing questions about the situation of these narrations. Therefore, this article, based on a critical method, endeavors to reconstruct the ultimate events of 1387

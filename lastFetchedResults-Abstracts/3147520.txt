As products collaborative design has an essential effect on the creativity of complex product, products collaborative design will need many design resources in the distributed environments. How to quantify and use the approximate and even uncertain information to evaluate design resources on collaborative design under the distributed knowledge resource environments is a crucial issue. This paper focuses on the collaborative design system reconfiguration of design resources. A collaborative design unit model is proposed. The evaluation system of dynamic knowledge alliance members in collaborative product design is then built up. A computational selection strategy method called Multi-objective Weighted Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process is then proposed to realize the computational selection of dynamic knowledge alliance members on collaborative product design under the distributed knowledge resource environments. This paper also proposes a model of collaborative design based on distributed knowledge resources. The framework of distributed knowledge resource is then put forward to support collaborative design. A computer-aided collaborative design software platform based on distributed knowledge resources is developed. The collaborative design of new devices for construction site personnel wireless location system is given as an example, which demonstrates that the methodology is obviously helpful to reuse and reorganize distributed knowledge for collaborative design and product innovation.

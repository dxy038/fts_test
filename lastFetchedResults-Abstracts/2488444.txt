As a crucial issue in aqua sciences, optimizing dam reservoirs exploitation has been studied with a variety of optimization techniques. One of these methods is using Meta-Heuristic algorithms such as Firefly and Ants Algorithms. Using the firefly algorithm, this study studies the exploitation optimization of Doroudzan reservoir in a 99-month period. The most sensitive parameter in sensitivity analysis of Firefly Algorithm, ?, is known as the mutation rate. Selecting its appropriate value by Firefly worms leads to an appropriate solution and increases the efficiency of the Firefly Algorithm dramatically. To determine the efficiency of this algorithm in optimizing the utilization of the dam reservoir, the obtained results were compared with the results of Continuous Ant System and Ranking Ant System. The findings indicated that FACC algorithm with objective function rate of 4.196 had a satisfactory performance. ACOrCC and ACOrankCC algorithms with the values of 17.004 and 26.156 followed it respectively. In addition, FACC algorithm with a value of 0.959 had the highest reliability coefficient. The results indicated that regarding Chain constraints, all program performances led to feasible solutions; however, ignoring chain constraints, the Continuous Ant System algorithm was unable to find a feasible solution. Hence, applying these constraints in the main structure of this algorithm would enhance its efficiency significantly.

In this paper, a method of applying multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGAs) to optimise the excitation and subarray division of an active array antenna is presented. This enables beam patterns with multiple desired characteristics such as low sidelobes, maximum power efficiency and s in particular locations to be generated. The division of the array elements into subarrays is also optimised simultaneously by the MOGAs.

After the Constitutional Revolution, many elites explained the role of people in government and society and in this regard thinkers like Imam Khomeini (R.A) and Sayyid Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr also theoretically justified and explained this role in the realm of the Islamic government. (History) However, the dimensions and aspects of the thoughts of these two contemporary Shiite scholars about the extent and quality of people's role in the political destiny are not clearly explained. (Problem) This is an important issue that religious researchers and thinkers have not paid serious attention to. (Background) Therefore, the main question is: what is the role of the people in the Islamic government thought of Imam Khomeini and Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr? (Question) It seems that they have explained the role of the people in government from the perspective of the two deep-rooted political – intellectual schools of Qom and Najaf.  (Hypothesis) Such a scientific possibility can guide us to the theoretical frameworks and goals of religious democracy in the political thought of Shiism. (Objective) The present paper, using comparative analysis, seeks to compare the political thoughts of these two great Shiite jurists from two different perspectives. (Methodology) The emphasis of the school of Qom on the concurrent accompaniment of jurists and people, and the insistence of the school of Najaf on people's role as God’s vicegerent, but under the supervision of a competent religious authority, are from the findings of the present paper.

A systematic multi-objective fuzzy optimization procedure to design the optimum dimensions of a conical convective spine is presented in this paper. Conflicting fuzzy design objectives, such as the weight and the length of spine as well as ‘soft’ constraints, are considered simultaneously in this study. The conical convective spine design based on the proposed procedure leads to a practical spine shape for production. The proposed design procedure cal also is applied to other design problems with complicated constraints.

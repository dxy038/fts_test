For years, the success of a project is measured using the cost, time and quality, but to restrict the assessment in these dimensions for the evaluation of success of the Project Management has been challenged both by the academic community and by practitioners. Differences emerge from the fact that these criteria are restricted to efficiency, while the results of the project are evaluated in a more comprehensive way, including effectiveness and strategic alignment. The objective of this research is to propose a methodology for identification, measurement and integration of those aspects that explain quantitatively what success is in the perspective of decision-makers in a developing software corporation. This process has helped in negotiations between the stakeholders of the project, and consequently, has helped the chief project officer to select and prioritize strategic projects within the demands of new products.

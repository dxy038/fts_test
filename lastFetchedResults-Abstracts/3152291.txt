Starting in January 2009, the RAUVI project is a three years coordinated research action funded by the Spanish Ministry of Research and Innovation. This paper shows the research evolution during the first half of RAUVIÂ´s live, bearing in mind that the long term objective is to design and develop an underwater autonomous robot able to perceive the environment and, by means of a specific hand-arm system, perform autonomously simple intervention tasks in shallow waters.

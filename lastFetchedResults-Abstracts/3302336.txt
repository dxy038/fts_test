This paper deals with control of smart grid by using distributed Model Predictive Control to control the load frequency of the power network. The control objective is to minimize the cost function while still keeping the frequency deviation constrained to a safe level. Some different control structures are proposed and control law and constraints are derived. Lastly we show the effectiveness of the different controllers by using a large scale power network simulation.

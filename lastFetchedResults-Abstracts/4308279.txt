We consider the discrete bit loading problem in OFDM systems with objective and constraints in terms of ergodic rates and powers. This differs from almost all existing techniques, which allocate rates and powers using instantaneous channel gains. The resulting optimization problem is still convex in the single user case, and a dual decomposition is employed along with a tailored approach to the discrete rate case used in our previous work. Our proposed approach is a flexible, near optimal, and efficient algorithm, and simulations results are presented.

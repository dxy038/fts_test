In this paper, we present an experimental study on photovoltaic solar energy. The objective is to produce more energy and reduce the price by applying a low concentration of solar radiation. Either on smaller cells; so we reduce the manufacturing cost, or on the same cells; so that the energy output increases. Tests have shown that we can make a concentration up to 5 X; so the cell surface can be reduced 5 times while keeping the same delivered power. To examine the results, we have built a concentrator of 2.5 X concentration ratio and put it in use to commercial photovoltaic panel.

The main objective of this paper is to provide an evaluation method for both: the quality aspect of corporations (marketable quality) and the profitability. First, we define the corporation rate of operation and profitability. Based on these definitions, we present a model to identify the profitability function considering the rate of operation at the break-even point. This function is considered as the marketable quality indicator from the viewpoint of a fair relationship between producers and consumers. In this paper, we consider only the fair relationship. We apply the real values of some leading manufacturing corporations in Japan to our proposed model to analyze its accuracy. From the analysis we concluded that the theoretical and real standard values of the marketable quality indicator were both 0.6 (that is 60%).

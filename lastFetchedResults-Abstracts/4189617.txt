This paper presents a procedure for the design of two-stage Miller-compensated operational transconductance amplifiers in switched-capacitor circuit applications. The objective of this approach, implemented in MATLAB, is the electrical-level synthesis of amplifiers so that settling error specifications are satisfied with minimum power consumption. At the core of the tool, an accurate routine for parasitics estimation is used to guarantee a close agreement between high-level and electrical simulation results. The procedure and tool are demonstrated with the sizing of a 1.2 V supply fully-differential two-stage Miller compensated amplifier in a 0.13 mum technology.

This paper describes a multimedia content broadcast system implemented using multi-agent technology. Content is delivered to a content distribution platform from where it is distributed via satellite to cars. In the system, a file based distribution mechanism has been chosen in contrast to streaming. This allows, on the mobile receiver side, playing the content whenever and wherever and how often the user wants. Originally, the content playout centre, which is in the focus of this paper, has been implemented using a proprietary middleware. The progress in agent platforms such a JADE and more recently Jason made it interesting to study this new programming paradigm in more detail. The objective of the paper is to describe the agent based software architecture of the Satellite Content Distribution Platform, its implementation and the first outcomes of the study.

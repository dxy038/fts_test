This paper describes the objectives, concepts and solution approach of the KING research project, which is carried out jointly by a number of leading research organisations in Germany. Our overall objective is to develop efficient solutions for carrier-grade IP networks. The distinguishing characteristic of our approach is that we pursue an integrated solution to achieve the carrier-grade requirements for quality of service (QoS) and resilience as well as low-cost efficient operation.

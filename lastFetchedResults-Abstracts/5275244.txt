Data warehousing has been a buzz word in the industry. Researches have been constantly involved in finding new ways of designing and developing data warehousing architectures, algorithms and tools for bringing together some selected data from multiple heterogeneous databases into a single repository. The real work of taking output from the data warehouse depends largely on how it is managed. Although a lot of research is going on to enhance the design and development of data warehouse, very little effort has been spent on the maintenance side. Without proper maintenance data warehouse is not going to give the desired output which is expected of it. In this work a comparison of various architectures of data warehousing system, based on analyzed on concepts like wrapper, monitor, integrator, metadata, data quantity indicator is considered. The objective of the work is to come out with comparisons between theoretical projections and real world findings on all these factors. The final goal of the work is to suggest an improved methodology for potential users of the data warehouse in their decision making process in the business process system.

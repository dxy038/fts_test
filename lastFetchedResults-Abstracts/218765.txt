The objective of this study was to develop a thermal model that can be used for prediction of saffron
flowering time. For this pwpose, existing data on saffron flower emergence time were collected in a wide range
of temperature regimes over the saffron production regions of Khorasan province, Iran. Linear second-order
polynomial and 5-parameter beta models were used and statistically compared for their ability in predicting
saffron flowering time as a function of temperature. The results showed a significant delay in flowering date
across the temperature gradient. While beta model had a better statistical performance but the simple linear
model also showed a good predicting ability and therefore, can be used as a reliable model.

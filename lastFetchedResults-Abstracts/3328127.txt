More than 25 years after its introduction, Model Based Predictive Control (MBPC) is still very much underutilized. It is still perceived by many as too difficult, too expensive, not suitable for non-linear processes etc. Furthermore, many of the installed applications suffer from low utilization, mainly due to over-complex designs and resulting poor operator understanding and acceptance. As a consequence, the industry is by far not exploiting the potential benefits. To help improve this situation is the overall intent of this paper. The first goal is to promote the use of MBPC by raising the awareness of its many benefits and opportunities, by pointing at typical application areas and by describing the mechanism why and how MBPC can deliver superior performance and how to estimate the associated economics. The second objective is to discuss the key factors for successful implementation and use.

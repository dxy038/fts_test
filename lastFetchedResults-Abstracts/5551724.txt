The desire of human beings and the goal of government policy basically have a common point, i.e., the better life in happiness. However, the common point composed of multi-criteria from objective and subjective living causes difficulty in decision making. This research applies the fuzzy set extensions of dominance-based rough set approach (FSE-DRSA) on the better life in happiness defined by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and DevelopmentÂ´s (OECD). The proposed application discloses the important criteria that can raise the living standard. The results show that dwellings with basic facilities, employment rate, long-term unemployment rate, and life satisfaction are identified as significant in the top-ten level.

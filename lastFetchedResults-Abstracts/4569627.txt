In this paper, we proposed a non-iterative joint precoder and decoder design for uplink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, with perfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and receiver. The main objective is to minimize the total mean squared error (TMSE) of the symbol estimation under constant transmit power constraint. The single value decomposition (SVD) is used instead of conventional system, where complex algorithms are used to iteratively arrive at optimum precoder and decoder. The improved performance of the proposed method is proved by simulation results.

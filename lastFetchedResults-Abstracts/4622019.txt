This paper studies the global synchronization and adaptive synchronization between two chaotic delayed neural networks with linearly bidirectional coupling. By using Lyapunov function and analysis technique, sufficient conditions are derived to achieve the state synchronization of two coupled identical chaotic neural networks. Moreover, a simple adaptive feedback scheme is proposed for the synchronization of two coupled neural networks based on the invariant principle of functional differential equations. Finally, the theoretical results are applied to some typical chaotic neural networks (chaotic delayed Hopfield neural networks and chaotic delayed cellular neural networks) and the numerical simulations also demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.

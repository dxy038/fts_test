An assessment of the operational features of battery storage and fuel cell systems connected to a distribution substation bus was the objective of a Purdue University study [1], which investigated the operation of both line and force commutated converters. System operation with a line commutated converter is discussed in a companion paper [2]. This paper covers the use of a force commutated converter system which incorporated phase angle voltage regulation. The investigation was performed using a simplified or generic simulation of the force commutated converter and the same detailed simulation of the ac system, harmonic filters and dc sources used in the line commutated converter system study. Computer results of quasi steady state and transient operation enable evaluation of the performance and design requirements with respect to harmonic filtering, power factor control, dc source interface and converter control. A related Westinghouse study compared line commutated with various force commutated schemes, from an economic and reliability viewpoint. Conclusions reached in this paper are based on both the Purdue investigation and the Westinghouse study.

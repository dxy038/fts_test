Scorched eyelashes and burned eyelids are a common finding in facial burns, though the eye itself is often spared. Affected patients often complain of foreign body sensation and ocular discomfort in the absence of objective physical findings, other than scorched eyelashes and burned eyelash particles in the conjunctival sacs. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic trimming of scorched eyelashes as a treatment for these findings and complaints. Eleven consecutive facial burn patients with bilateral eyelash scorching and no accompanying ocular damage were included. The eyelashes of one eye were trimmed, and those of the fellow eye served as untreated controls. Opthalmic examinations were performed and eye-related complaints noted every other day for 10 days. We found that symptoms of foreign body sensation and discomfort occurred at a lower rate in the treated eyes (P< 0.002) and no scorched eyelash particles were found in their conjunctival sacs (P< 0.004) as compared to the untrimmed side. Conjunctival hyperemia was reduced. We suggest that shedding of scorched eyelash particles is a major cause of the ocular complaints in facial burn patients. Trimming the eyelash affords a simple and effective method of prophylactic treatment.

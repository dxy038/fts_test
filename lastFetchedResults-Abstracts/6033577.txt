The objective of this paper is to propose a novel multi-input inverter for the grid-connected hybrid PV/wind power system in order to simplify the power system and reduce the cost. The proposed multi-input inverter consists of a buck/buck-boost fused multiinput DC/DC converter and a full-bridge DC/AC inverter. The output power characteristics of the PV array and the wind turbine are introduced. The perturbation and observation method is used to accomplish the maximum power point tracking algorithm for input sources. The operational principle of the proposed multiinput inverter is explained. The control circuit is realized by using a digital signal processor and auxiliary analog circuits. For practical applications, functions of soft-start and circuit protection are implemented. Experimental results have shown the performance of the proposed multiinput inverter with desired features

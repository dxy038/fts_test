Objective: Post-operative shivering is a common complication following both general and
spinal anesthesia. Tramadol is one of the drugs used for prevention and treatment of this
complication. The aim of this study was to assesses its effectiveness in prevention of postspinal
anesthesia shivering among pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section..
Subjects and Methods: In this double blind randomized clinical trial, 90 pregnant women
with ASA I & II who were referred for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, were divided
in two groups. At the end of surgery and during skin closure, tramadol I mg/kg (in 20 ml
normal saline) was injected by slow IV in the studied group. Control group received 20 ml of
normal saline. Vital signs (PR, S&D BP, SP02) were checked at the end of injection, and 5,
10, 15 minutes after injection. Oral temperature, nausea and vomiting, and incidence of postoperative
shivering and grading of shivering were recorded in both groups. The resulting data
were analyzed by Chi square test.
Results: Post-anesthesia shivering was detected in 39 women (86.6 %) in the control group
and in 4 patients (8.8 %) in tramadol-treated group (P<O.OOI). Mild and moderate shivering
was detected post-operatively in 6 (13.3 %) and 33 (73.3 %) of control group and 2 (4.4 'Yo)
and 2 (4.4 %) of tramadol group respectively (P<O.OOI). None of the patients in either group
developed severe shivering. No significant differences in two groups in respect to
homodynamic variables and SP02, body temperature and nausea and vomiting were observed.
Conclusion: This study showed that trarnadol is an effective drug in prevention or post-spinal
anesthesia shivering with no hemodynamic, SP02, body temperature and nausea and vomiting
side effect. Therefore, tramadol is recommended in prevention of post operation shivering in
women undergoing post-spinal elective caesarean section

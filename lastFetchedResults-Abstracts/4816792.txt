A fuzzy multi-objective optimization method based on posterior satisfying degree is proposed for parallel machines scheduling in this paper. As the classical unrelated parallel machines scheduling problem, the drilling of Printed Wiring Boards with different performance requirements is considered and the multi-objective integer programming is formulated. In order to obtain the preferred scheduling results, the fuzzy optimization strategy via posterior satisfying degree is designed and the three-step optimization procedure is constructed, where the multi-objective genetic algorithm, the elimination method and the fuzzy c mean clustering with the validity criteria are respectively used to get the uniformly distributed Pareto optimal set, to reduce and to partition it into the representative M-Pareto optimal subset such that the final solution can be chosen easily. The simulation result shows the effectiveness of our method.

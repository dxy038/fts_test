Decisions about water resource management are complex in nature, since they involve consequences of environmental, social and economic impacts in the society. The multicriteria analysis is a powerful tool to support this kind of decision, assuring a transparent, structured, rigorous and objective evaluation of the problem. This paper presents a group decision support system model to support committees responsible for water resource management. The model provides a ranking of alternatives through the combined use of the multicriteria methods PROMETHEE II and ELECTRE IV.

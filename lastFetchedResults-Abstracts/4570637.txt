Comparing the solution of the traditional optimization and the solution of the robust optimal design, the robust design parameter displays a significant stability in performance when the value of the crank and rack section changed. This paper also presents a new quantum behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm with inverse proportional inertia weight. All the optimizations are solved by this efficient algorithm.

Research suggests that NADH formed from lactate addition can increase mitochondrial oxygen consumption. However, limited research has assessed the subsequent effects of lactate-mediated mitochondrial oxygen consumption on oxymyoglobin. Therefore, our objective was to assess the effects of bovine mitochondrial oxygen consumption on oxymyoglobin in the presence of lactate, LDH, and NAD. Isolated beef cardiac and skeletal muscle mitochondria (n = 5) were reacted with lactate (40 mM), LDH (100 units), and NAD (0.02 mM) to initiate oxygen consumption. Myoglobin redox state was measured to assess the effects of oxygen consumption on oxymyoglobin. The addition of lactate–LDH–NAD to mitochondria increased (p &lt; 0.05) both oxygen consumption and conversion of oxymyoglobin to deoxymyoglobin compared with control mitochondria without substrates. The addition of antimycin A to mitochondria decreased oxygen consumption and deoxymyoglobin formation (p &lt; 0.05). The results suggest that increased oxygen consumption can influence myoglobin redox state and this effect might be partially responsible for the darkening effect in lactate enhanced beef.

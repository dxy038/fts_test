Robotics is a technology that is utilised tremendously in industrial and commercial applications. Different types of robots are designed to fulfill the human needs. The aim of the work presented in this paper is to simulate a robotic hand that emulate the shape and performance of a human hand (i.e. palm and fingers section). The robotic hand comprises of five fingers, which each of them has three degree of freedom (DOF) and 2 DOF for the thumb. This robotic hand simulation is divided into three main parts. The main objective is to design a three dimensional graphic of a robotic hand and its movement animation that imitates the movement of a human hand. This graphic design is then used as a foundation to find the kinematics and dynamic properties of the robotic hand. The end result is a robotic hand simulation that comes with analyses of the kinematics and dynamic properties

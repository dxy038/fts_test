In this paper, we propose a new preventive reliable virtual network embedding algorithm denoted by PR-VNE within the CloudÂ´s backbone network. The proposal does not allocate any backup resources and takes into consideration the ageing of the hardware backbone network. The main objective is to maximise the number of hosted virtual networks while minimising the rate of crashed virtual networks impacted by physical (i.e., routers or links) failures. The problem is a multi-objective non-linear optimisation and classified as NP-hard. To overcome its complexity, PR-VNE is based on the artificial bee colony metaheuristic. Moreover, it makes use of a multi commodity flow algorithm in order to maximise the load balancing of bandwidth usage within the physical network. Based on extensive simulations, the performance obtained is better than the related strategies found in literature in terms of reject and blackout rates of virtual networks.

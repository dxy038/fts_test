The authors address the issue of optimal design (in terms of the number of processors) of a distributed system which is based on a recursive algorithm for fault tolerance (RAFT). The reliability and performance of the system using RAFT are determined as a function of reliability of individual processors and the number of fault modes in a processor. Also discussed are how to determine the design policies when the objective is to minimize the average system failure. Several numerical examples illustrate the results

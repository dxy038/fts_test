Automation techniques have been widely used in the manufacturing industry, but there are still many
manual handling operations required in assembly and maintenance work. Inappropriate posture and
physical fatigue might result in musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in such physical jobs. In ergonomics
and occupational biomechanics, virtual human modelling techniques have been employed to optimize
manual operations in the design stage so as to avoid or decrease risk of MSD. In these methods, physical
fatigue is only considered to minimize muscle or joint stress, while the effect of fatigue along time on
posture is not often considered, although workerâ€™s motion strategies and postures under physical fatigue
are different from those under non-fatigue conditions. In this paper, based on related literatures and multiple-
objective optimisation method (MOO), a new posture prediction and analysis method is proposed
for predicting the optimal posture under non-fatigue and fatigue conditions and evaluating the physical
fatigue in manual material handling operation. The posture prediction and analysis problem is mathematically
described, and a special application case is demonstrated for analyzing a drilling assembly
operation in European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS).

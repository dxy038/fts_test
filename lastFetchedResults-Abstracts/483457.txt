Background: Rupture of Achilles tendon is a disabling condition and accounts for approximately 11-18% percent of all tendon ruptures.
Objective: The goal of this study was to compare the functional brace with and without patellar tendon bearing in patients with Achilles tendon rupture.
Methods: This was a semi-experimental study initially carried out on 17 patients with Achilles tendon rupture although 3 patients failed to complete the follow-up course and were removed from the study. The remaining 14 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. The calf circumference and the power of plantar flexion were measured and also the degree of satisfaction in patients evaluated. The data were analyzed using independent t-test, Kolomogrov-Smironov test, and the mean difference by SPSS13.
Findings: There was a significant difference between the pre- and post-intervention regarding the calf circumference and also the power of plantar flexion in each group. However, no significant difference between two groups following intervention was found when all 3 variables taken into account (p>0.05).
Conclusion: According to the findings of the present study, both kinds of orthoses used were effective on improving the plantar flexion power and reducing the calf circumference but no significant difference between the effects of both groups of orthoses on all variables after intervention was established

As the title of this paper suggests, the objective of asymmetric operation in the long run is to enhance the flexibility of power system operation in the light of so many conflicting constraints and demands. It is not so much the design as the operation, not so much the criteria as the technology that has enable the modern power system to respond to the stresses imposed by a new environment. This is not the same power system as yesterday. The question that naturally arises is to what extent the three phases of a system is considered as three separate entities, at least in selected areas of the network, to achieve a better degree of flexibility. Such an approach is termed asymmetric operation and in combination with compensation devices, especially FACTS controllers, can go a long way to achieving this improved flexibility. Such an approach is applied to preserving the security of the network under fault conditions and to meeting the operational requirements of the deregulated environment. It is a window of opportunity.

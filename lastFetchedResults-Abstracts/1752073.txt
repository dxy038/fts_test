Recently, shape memory polymer fibers (SMPFs) have been used in a biomimetic two-step (Close-Then-Heal) self-healing system for healing macroscopic cracks. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of cold-drawing programming of SMPFs on the healing efficiency of conventional thermosetting polymer composites and the possibility of healing wide-opened crack by localized heating. To achieve the objective, continuous SMPF strand reinforced conventional epoxy composite beam specimens, which were dispersed with thermoplastic particles, were prepared. The SMPF strands were cold-drawn to various pre-strain levels before casting the polymer matrix. Repeated fracture/healing test was conducted by uniaxial tension. It is found that the composites were able to repeatedly heal macroscopic cracks. Strain-hardening by cold-drawing increased the healing efficiency considerably. It was demonstrated that healing can be achieved by heating locally surrounding the cracked region. The mechanism for the enhanced recovery stress was due to cold-drawing induced molecular alignment and formation of some perfect crystals in the hard segment domain of the SMPF.

The Point Coordination Function (PCF) of the IEEE 802.11 standard represents a well-known Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol providing Quality-of Service guarantees in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). However, with the currently employed polling mechanism WLANs consume a significant amount of the energy resources from battery-powered user devices. To provide energy saving, an improved MAC protocol is presented in this paper, where bidirectional transmissions of fixed duration are incorporated into PCF in order to enable dynamic scheduling of real-time traffic. Based on this new strategy, wireless access points (APs) can estimate the proper duration of the Contention Free Period (CFP), in order to allow mobile stations to acknowledge any received data packet with a data packet equal to the received packet in size. Having this information, a mobile station, following the data exchange with the AP, can determine its wake-up timer and activate the sleep mode for the rest of the CFP interval. Comprehensive computer-based simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed MAC improvements to achieve energy efficiency with negligible impact on packet delivery delay.

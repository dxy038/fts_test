In this paper, a case study using EDSA<sup>&#174;</sup> (Electrical Design and Simulation Analysis) software is presented with the objective to minimize the total cost and power losses using an adequate power correction system. A simple four bus system is analyzed to study different tools provided by the software for steady state and transient studies. The user friendly GUI is very advanced and can be effectively used to plot various signals. It is observed that the EDSA is an effective and efficient analytical tool to carry out such studies.

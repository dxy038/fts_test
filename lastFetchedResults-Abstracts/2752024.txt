The objective of this paper is focused on developing an interleaved four-phase current-fed converter with new voltage multiplier topology for low-voltage distributed energy generation systems. The proposed four-phase current-fed converter is with the interleaved configuration and preserving the inherent advantages of smaller input current ripple and smaller inductance size. Through the proposed topology, the high voltage gain can be achieved using the relatively lower transformer turns ratio. Also, the voltage stresses of both active switches and rectifier diodes are greatly reduced so that the low on-resistance active switches can be adopted, and the reverse-recovery effect of rectifier diodes can be decreased naturally. The dc and ac small signal models of the proposed converter topology are derived for better closed loop control, and some design guidelines are then given for circuit implementation. Both simulation and experimental results indeed verify the effectiveness of the proposed converter.

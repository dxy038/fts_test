To mitigate capital equipment investments and enhance product quality, semiconductor manufactures are turning to advanced process control (APC) methods. With the objective of facilitating APC, this paper investigates a methodology for real-time malfunction diagnosis of reactive ion etching (RIE) employing two types of in situ metrology: optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and residual gas analysis (RGA). Based on metrology data, time series neural networks (TSNNs) are trained to generate evidential belief for potential malfunctions in real time, and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory is adopted for evidential reasoning. Successful malfunction diagnosis is achieved, with only a single missed alarm and a single false alarm occurring out of 21 test runs when both sensors are used in tandem. From the results, we conclude that the OES and RGA sensors, in conjunction with the TSNN models, can be effectively used for RIE monitoring and diagnosis. Furthermore, D-S theory is shown to be an appropriate inference methodology.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the replacement of soybean meal by extruded chickpeas in diets of growing–finishing pigs on meat quality. In a 17 wk study 48 growing–finishing crossbred pigs were fed ad libitum. The experimental design included four treatments, each one of 12 pigs; the ECKP0 treatment was fed with diet containing soybean meal and no chickpeas (control), while treatments ECKP100, ECKP200 and ECKP300 were fed with diets containing 100, 200 and 300 kg/t of extruded chickpeas, respectively. The lean meat quality of the longissimus lumborum et thoracis muscle was evaluated by chemical analysis (moisture, protein, fat and ash), fatty acid profile, pH measurement, cooking loss, color evaluation, and sensory evaluation. Odor and taste, tenderness, juiciness, and overall acceptability were scored on 1–10 scales by a group of 10 experienced assessors after a standard cooking regime. Small differences were observed between control and experimental groups in chemical composition (P &gt; 0.05). Fatty acid profiles, pH measurements and color evaluation did not differ among treatments (P &gt; 0.05), while cooking loss was significantly lower in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The taste panel gave slightly higher scores for the tenderness and juiciness for the control group compared with the chickpea treatments (P &lt; 0.05). No differences were observed between control and experimental groups in taste scores (P &gt; 0.05). It is concluded that the replacement of soybean meal by extruded chickpeas, when substituted isonitrogenously and isoenergetically at inclusion levels up to 300 kg/t of pig, does not influence significantly meat quality.

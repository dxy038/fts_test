The main objective of the OSISIM project (Open System Integrated Simulator) is to set up an atelier for the modeling of communication networks and the analysis of their performances. The atelier gives the end-user powerful tools to edit a communication system in a graphical environment. The representation of a system to be simulated is based on models of several standard networks available in the library which is the kernel of the atelier. Each model implements uniform and well-defined sets of functions, while having clearly specified interfaces. This article describes the architecture of the atelier, and focuses on the internal structure of basic models

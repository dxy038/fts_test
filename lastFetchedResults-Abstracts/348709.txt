Objective
We investigated whether patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) manifest changes in the excitability of the soleus H-reflex.
Methods
H-reflex stimulusâ€“response curve was studied in 14 CLBP patients and 14 age-matched healthy subjects. H-threshold, H-maximum size, H-steepness and H-latency were determined for both legs. Homosynaptic depression (HD), following a train of H-reflexes, and presynaptic inhibition (PI) from flexor afferents onto soleus Ia afferents were also evaluated.
Results
H-threshold was significantly increased, H-size as a function of stimulus intensity was significantly different, and H-recruitment curve steepness was significantly lower in CLBP patients compared to healthy subjects. No significant difference in the amount of HD and PI of the H-reflex was found between the two groups. H-latency and Hmax/Mmax ratio was comparable between the subjects groups.
Conclusions
In CLBP there is a reduced excitability of group Ia afferent fibres from the soleus muscle to which presynaptic factors do not seem to contribute and that presumably depend on changes in the peripheral sensory input.
Significance
Changes in H-reflex excitability may underlie a decrease in the gain of a peripheral sensor in CLBP. Estimation of soleus H-threshold and H-recruitment curve may contribute to the diagnostic evaluation of CLBP and may be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment.

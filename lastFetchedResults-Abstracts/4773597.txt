Government agencies responsible for riparian environments are assessing the utility of remote sensing for mapping and monitoring environmental health indicators. The objective of this work was to evaluate IKONOS and Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery for mapping riparian vegetation health indicators in tropical savannas for a section of Keelbottom Creek, Queensland, Australia. Vegetation indices and image texture from IKONOS data were used for estimating percentage canopy cover (r<sup>2</sup>=0.86). Pan-sharpened IKONOS data were used to map riparian species composition (overall accuracy=55%) and riparian zone width (accuracy within 4 m). Tree crowns could not be automatically delineated due to the lack of contrast between canopies and adjacent grass cover. The ETM+ imagery was suited for mapping the extent of riparian zones. Results presented demonstrate the capabilities of high and moderate spatial resolution imagery for mapping properties of riparian zones, which may be used as riparian environmental health indicators

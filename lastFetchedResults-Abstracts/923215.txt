Alternative energy technologies are being disseminated in many countries with an objective to reduce the uses of traditional and commercial energy sources. These technologies convert local resources to usable energy forms. Since the scale of these technologies is small, their implementation is targeted mainly to individual households or small communities. However, due to various constraints, these implementation programmes have not been very successful. In this paper, the author introduces the main characteristics of alternative energy technologies used in Nepal and discusses promotional barriers for their implementation. It is hoped that this paper would help energy policy makers to devise better alternative energy programmes.

Multiobjective optimization has been applied successfully to real-world optimization problems with few objectives. However, the performance of current algorithms for multiobjective optimization reduces exponentially as the number of objectives grows. In this paper we present a non-parametric harmony-based approach for objective reduction in order to deal with this issue in many-objective optimization problems. The proposed approach has many advantages such as the independence of the relationship between the objectives as long as they are harmonious and the possibility to visualize conflict and trade-off in the reductions performed.

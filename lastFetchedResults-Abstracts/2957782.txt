The next-generation wide-area all-optical networks, employing wavelength division multiplexing, will be used in future for nationwide coverage. The design principles of such networks, using Lagrangean relaxation and subgradient heuristic, is the theme of this work. Our aim is to find an optimal virtual topology from a given physical topology consisting of wavelength routing nodes interconnected by fiber links. The formulation has been done as a nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem with an objective to minimize the network delay. We have determined an optimal virtual topology and then presented a heuristic algorithm for embedding the virtual topology to the given physical fiber network.

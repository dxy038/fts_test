With the assumption of shooting error distributed independently two-dimension normal, the traditional estimation of hitting probability with rectangle objective domain is biased. Based on an uniformly unbiased minimum variance method, in this paper the unbiased estimation of hitting probability with rectangle objective domain is compared with the traditional one, and the statistic characteristic of hitting probability is studied. Some examples are illustrated to prove that the unbiased estimation can reduce the amount of shells in test. The project of amount of shells are also provided for the test of first round hitting probability for tanks and armored vehicles.

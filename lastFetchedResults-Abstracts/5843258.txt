In this paper, Further Reduced Resolution Depth Coding (FRRDC) method is proposed as an improvement for the Reduced Resolution Depth Coding (RRDC) method that was used for Scalable Video Coding (SVC). Similar to RRDC, FRRDC is applied by using Down-Sampling and Up-Sampling (DSUS) of the depth data of the stereoscopic 3D video. The depth data is down-sampled before the SVC encoding and up-sampled after the SVC decoding operation. The proposed FRRDC using DSUS method aims to improve the coding method and efficiency of the RRDC method in terms of objective and subjective quality of the stereoscopic 3D video. The difference between FRRDC and RRDC method lies in the sense that FRRDC encodes an even more reduced resolution of the depth video compared to the RRDC. This paper gives an overview of the FRRDC method and the simulation results are obtained to evaluate the performance of the FRRDC method.

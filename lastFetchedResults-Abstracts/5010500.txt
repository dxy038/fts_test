Nowadays, the traditional approach of Project Management, as described by PMI (Project Management Institute) PMBoK<sup>&#174;</sup> (Project Management Body of Knowledge) Guide, divides it into nine knowledge areas: project integration, scope, time, cost, quality, human resource, communications, risk and procurement management. This is the reductionist approach, where a subject is divided into its constituent parts and one tries to understand the whole from its parts. The objective of this paper is to approach the evolution and expand the understanding of Project Management discipline through the eyes of the General Systems Theory, Cybernetics, Deep Ecology and Chaos and Complexity Theory. Thus, it is possible to understand, from the point of view of these traditional theories, how the changes in the world are affecting the concepts and the human side of Project Management and how themes like ecology, network and sustainability should be inserted and connected into the context of Project Management.

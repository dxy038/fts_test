Objective
ve a capacity problem in a pediatric cardiovascular program, a 5- bed short-stay unit was created in the cardiac catheterization recovery room area within a 6-week timeframe. We describe the problem, solution, and early results in hospital performance and patient outcomes.
s
ere reviewed for 183 patients who underwent various cardiac catheterization procedures and recovered overnight in the cardiac short-stay unit during the first 4 months of operation. The effect on bed use throughout the cardiac program and impact on the usual recovery room operations were assessed.
s
rdiovascular inpatient bed shortage was relieved with the creation of a 5-bed short-stay unit, and no cardiac procedures were canceled because of lack of beds during the study period.
sion
was no negative impact on clinical operations in the catheterization laboratory recovery room, and the short-stay unit was cost-effective. According to the rate of admission after recovery in the short-stay unit (5/183), patient selection was appropriate.

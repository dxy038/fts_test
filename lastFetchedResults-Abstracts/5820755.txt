Aimed at developing academic and social competences in engineering students, a program has been designed that integrates this objective into the curriculum. Our experience with the development and implementation of such a program in first year engineering courses is described. Our results show that it is possible to reduce desertion and improve adaptation to college life and demands, among engineering first year students, while improving social and academic skills and competences in an Introduction to Engineering course.

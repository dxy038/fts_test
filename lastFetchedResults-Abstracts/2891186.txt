Crowdsourcing systems such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Yahoo!Answers, and Google Helpouts have attracted extensive attention over the past few years. In a crowdsourcing system, a large group of &#8220;workers&#8221; solve the tasks outsourced by &#8220;requesters&#8221;. To make a crowdsourcing system sustainable, it is vital to attract users (both requesters and workers) to participate, and incentivize high-quality solutions. To achieve this objective, we design an effective incentive mechanism and reputation protocol. Our design incorporates various important elements of a crowdsourcing system such as workers having heterogeneous skill sets (i.e., some are &#8220;experts&#8221; while others are &#8220;novices&#8221;), and task assignment process, rating system, etc. Our incentive mechanism is composed of a rating system and a reward dividing scheme, and requires the system administrator to divide the reward based on requesters´ rating on the solution quality. We derive the minimum reward needed so that &#8220;expert&#8221; workers are guaranteed provide high-quality solutions. We show that &#8220;novice&#8221; workers provide low-quality solutions, and our reputation protocol eliminates this undesirable behavior by tracking a worker´s solution history and penalizing him when his reputation is poor. We apply repeated game-theoretic frameworks to quantify the impact of this reputation protocol on requesters´ cost in guaranteeing high quality solutions.

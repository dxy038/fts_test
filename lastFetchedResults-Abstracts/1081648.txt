This paper presents the results of a research on direct drinking water treatment through an ultrafiltration pilot plant unit using spiral-wound membranes (3500 MWCO). The source of water is the Guarapiranga Reservoir, an eutrophicated water body located in the metropolitan region of São Paulo, Brazil. The data were collected during a period of almost 3400 h, from August 2005 to January 2006. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the membrane production capacity and contaminant removal efficiency. It was verified that the system was able to produce a high quality permeate with a flow close to the specified by the membrane manufacturer. The average permeate flow was 19.7 L.h−1.m−2, at 467 kPa and 25°C, with a global water recovery of almost 85%. The removal efficiencies for TOC, UV light absorption, and turbidity were 85%, 56%, and 95%, respectively. The results provide substantial evidence of the technical feasibility of spiral-wound UF membranes for direct drinking water treatment from euthrophicated sources, as an alternative for conventional drinking water treatment systems.

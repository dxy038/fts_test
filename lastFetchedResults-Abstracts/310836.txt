Objective. To compare the stiffness and maximum strength between the untwisted and twisted free-tendon.

Design. 22 twisted and untwisted sectioned-specimens of human cadaver patellar tendons were used and pulled to failure to obtain load-deformation profiles from which stiffness, maximum load to failure and elastic elongation limit were derived.

Background. In the reconstruction of the deficient anterior cruciate ligament, the use of the central one-third of the patellar tendon is a well-established procedure in which, prior to insertion, the tendon graft may be twisted to mimic the natural orientation of the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee joint.

Results. The untwisted tendons had a mean stiffness of 36.5 kg/mm (SD, 16.6 kg/mm) and maximum load of 165.9 kg (SD, 86.8 kg). With a 90Â° twist, the average stiffness of the twisted tendon was 66.5 kg/mm (SD, 25.4 kg/mm), with maximum load at 364.5 kg (SD, 109.9 kg), an increase of over 100%. The elastic elongation limit, or allowable elongation before permanent deformation or failure, was significantly larger in twisted tendons by 35%.

Conclusion. Twisting increased the resistance to deformation of the tendon in this study.

The objective of the Standard is to achieve improved accuracy in testing and determination of efficiency of induction motors. It contains two methods, which outline a procedure to determine the additional load losses: Method 1 (input/output with loss segregation) for motors tested by using a torque measurement device, with additional load losses derived from measurements; and Method 2 (summation of losses) for motors tested without using the torque measurement device, with assigned additional load losses. The paper describes the objective and the test procedure advocated in the IEC 61972 (CDV). In comparison to other standards, the draft methods: provide a higher level of certainty of efficiency, this is especially true for method 1, is not difficult to use and hence, is user friendly; requires no internal thermocouple probe(s) for the testing, thus the test can be applied to any three-phase cage induction motor, old or new, without having to take it apart; and it requires similar effort for testing out of both methods with the entire test analysis done on a PC. Technically it is an excellent standard for determining losses, including stray load, and efficiency of three-phase cage induction motors

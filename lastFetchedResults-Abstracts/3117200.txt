Comprehensive evaluation on health care system of ten countries is discussed in this paper. In order to comprehensively assess and evaluate the health care system in an objective manner, five first-tier indicators and nineteen second-tier indicators are set up as evaluation criteria in the first place. Then entropy modeling and Matlab software are applied to compute the values for first-tier indicators and the evaluation scores for the ten countriespsila health care systems. Three essential indicators to evaluate health care system are selected by Cluster Analysis and SPSS software, and yield same evaluation ranks as the entropy model of five first-tier indicators.

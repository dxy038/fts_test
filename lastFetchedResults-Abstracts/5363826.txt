In this paper, influence of tire damping on multi objective control of quarter-car suspensions excited by random road disturbances is studied. The active suspension design problem is first formulated as a mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> synthesis problem and this convex problem is solved using linear matrix inequalities. Next, the control design problem is re-formulated as a non-convex and non-smooth optimization problem with fixed order controllers and solved by using the recently developed HIFOO toolbox. Parametric studies show that tire damping can seriously impact closed-loop performance of actively controlled quarter-car models.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that elevation of COX-2 is significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of cervix. The main objective of this study is to characterize the relationship between elevation of COX-2 and its possible clinical role in adenocarcinoma (AC) of cervix. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined COX-2 expression levels in 84 patients with AC of uterine cervix [71 ACs, 13 adenosquamous carcinomas (ASCs)]. Elevation of COX-2 was correlated with clinicopathological variables and p53 expression, as detected by immunohistochemistry. Elevation of COX-2 was detected in 13.0% (11 of 84) of the tumors. Elevation of COX-2 was significantly correlated with histologic type (AC 8.5% vs. ASC 38.5%, P=0.011). Both tumor stage and lymph node metastasis were correlated with elevation of COX-2 with a borderline significance (P=0.062 and 0.068, respectively). Elevation of p53 was not associated with elevation of COX-2. The association between lymph node metastasis and elevation of COX-2 was stronger in cases of AC than in cases of ASC (28.4 vs. 4.3%, P=0.023). According to the results of univariate analysis, elevation of COX-2 was significantly associated with decreased overall survival (P=0.003, log-rank test). However, multivariate analyses revealed that only tumor stage was independently associated with overall survival, suggesting that elevation of COX-2 itself may not be an independent prognostic factor. The present study shows that elevation of COX-2 may contribute to lymph node metastasis in AC of uterine cervix. This suggests that the potential therapeutic role of COX-2 inhibitors should be validated, not only in SCC, but also in AC of uterine cervix.

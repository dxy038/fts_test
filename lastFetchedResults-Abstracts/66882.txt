e consider a model of voluntary contributions for a public project with random number of potential contributors. The fundraiser, ho observes this number, has to decide whether to reveal or suppress the information before contributions are given. The undraiser's objective is to collect maximal contributions. We show that whether the public project is convex or non-convex can e the key to the fundraiser's announcement decision. In the convex case, this number is always revealed. In the non-convex case he number may not be revealed at all or sometimes revealed only when it is in an intermediate range. In the presence of multiple quilibria, total contributions increase with the extent of concealment.

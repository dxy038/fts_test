Accidents in single lane tunnels can be avoided significantly by using an efficient automatic traffic control system for all possible traffic conditions. Here the objective of the proposed system is to control the traffic density on either side of a single lane tunnel and avoid the vehicle collision inside the single lane tunnel. It is assumed that the entry and exit of the tunnel is only for light and heavy motor vehicles. The proposed traffic control signal logic is a time efficient and human independent system. The system can be implemented in a remote area irrespective of its topography. The proposed control signal logic is implemented in ARM cortex-M0 microcontroller.

MUSES-C is a mission for near-earth-asteroid sample return. The spacecraft is launched in 2002 and returns to the earth in 2006. The primary objective is to demonstrate the key technologies requisite for future advanced sample return mission. It collects samples of a few g from a near-earth asteroid. Sampling will be made by rendezvous with the asteroid, approaching the asteroid, then shooting a small projectile onto the asteroid surface and catching the ejecta. In this paper outline of the mission is shown with special stress on the science aspect.

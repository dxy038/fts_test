In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient cooperative multiple-input single-output (MISO) technique to reliably deliver multicast IPTV content in WiMAX networks. To support the strict quality of service requirements of the IPTV service within a cooperative framework, we utilize a two-phase based transmission strategy, which allows the session users to reliably receive the multicast data either from the base station during the multicast phase, or from other peers during the cooperation phase. Within this framework, our objective is to maximize the session throughput, while keeping delivery latency and energy usage within acceptable limits. To achieve this objective, an adaptive rate selection algorithm is proposed to maximize the session throughput for a given set of users. We simulated the proposed reliable content delivery framework and compared its throughput, latency, overhead, and energy usage performances, to that of MIMO-based and non-cooperative (or direct) transmission techniques. When compared to the considered MIMO and direct transmission techniques, we found that the proposed approach presents a desirable balance for the given performance metrics, especially between throughput-efficiency and energy-efficiency.

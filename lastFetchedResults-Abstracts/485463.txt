The main purpose of this study was to examine the effect of visual, proprioception and practice sessions on acquisition and transfer of underhand service in volleyball and to exploring the specificity of learning hypothesis. To accomplish this objective, 60 college female students of right hand who were all novitiate in the skill with average age of (21 Â±1.5) were selected voluntarily and according to practice conditions(normal visual and blindfolded) and practice sessions (2or5 session), randomly divided into 4 groups that each was 15 subjects. Participants fallowing participated in pretest, practiced 20 services in Volleyball with receive knowledge of results feedback in per sessions and then participated in acquisition test. Subjects performed 10 trails while blindfolded and without knowledge of results in transfer test. Data has been analyzed by statistical methods of mixed factorial ANOVA with repetition on practice sessions factor in acquisition process and factorial ANOVA in acquisition and transfer tests and Bonferrroni post hoc test. The result showed that all of practical method using in this research had significant effect on the acquisition process, acquisition and transfer tests. Groups with 2 and 5 practice sessions and normal visual had better progress in acquisition process and group with 5 practice sessions and normal visual had the best performance in acquisition test (P<0.05).Group with 5 practice session and blindfold had a better performance than other groups in transfer test (P<0.05). The results indicate that learning is specific to the sources of afferent information available during practice and it more dependence on the afferent resources available with increasing of practice time. Thus the specificity of practice hypothesis does apply to training of underhand service in volleyball.

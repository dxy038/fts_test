The newly organized Technical Committee on Mass Storage held its first Workshop in Washington, D.C., May 22&#8211;23. The objective of the Workshop was to bring together professionals, not only in the area of mass store technology, but also those who have been involved with the use or systems design of such devices. Since the operation of a mass storage system requires a significant interaction with the userÂ´s organization and procedures, the interaction of these three viewpoints proved key to the success of the Workshop. For purposes of the Workshop, mass storage referred to devices with capacity in the order of 10<sup>12</sup> bits. Some attention was given to technologies which yield smaller capacities in order to assess their prospects for growth.

In this work, the control system and fault detection algorithm applied on a real fatigue assay machine is addressed. The objective of the machine is to apply periodical forces to restored teeth and to detect the teeth collapse calculating the number of cycles until the fault occurs. There is a Scottish yoke mechanism that converts the torque of a brushless motor on linear forces. This motor is driven by a power drive that receives the torque reference from a computer operating on real-time, and where the fault detection algorithm is applied. There is also a user computer where the parameters of the assay are introduced and where the results are shown. In this work the control system that has been implemented is shown in detail and the developed fault algorithm with adaptive threshold for the system with several sampling times is addressed.

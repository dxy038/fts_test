Wireless Sensor Network consists of tiny, battery enabled sensor nodes. In the recent years, the most important problem in WSN is to improve the life time of Network. Network life time depends on the residual energy of the sensor nodes. Most of the energy in the sensor node is used for data transmission. So, we should employ the routing protocols which can consume the energy of nodes efficiently. Already, many energy efficient routing protocols have been suggested by the researchers, among which Hierarchical Protocols achieve the better performance. In this paper, a novel routing protocol has been proposed which introduces new clustering algorithm and constructs the routing tree for efficient data transmission. The objective of this algorithm is to consume less energy, distributing energy consumption equally among all nodes and finally, extends the network lifetime. The simulation results show that this protocol consumes the energy of the nodes efficiently and improves the life time of the network. For a set of 100 nodes, the proposed algorithm gives 31% better performance than LEACH, 18% better performance than LEACHC and 15% better performance than TL-LEACH in terms of network life time.

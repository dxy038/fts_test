Part of the hardware/software codesign process invariably involves partitioning a system specification into hardware and software sub-systems, which may be subsequently synthesised into custom hardware and compiled into processor code, respectively. This paper presents a study of the influence of hardware sub-system memory accesses, in a codesign system, in order to determine the interface mechanism between the hardware and software sub-systems. The objective is to achieve an acceptable performance in terms of the overall execution time of an application

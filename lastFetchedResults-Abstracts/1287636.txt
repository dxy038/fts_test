A series of 2,6-disubstituted and 2,5,6-trisubstituted imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazoles were synthesized, the structures of the compounds were elucidated and screened for antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system, antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus cirrhosis, and antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Penicillium wortmanni. Among the tested compounds 2-(2-furyl)-6-phenylimidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4] thiadiazole-5-carbaldehyde (6c) and (2-cyclohexyl-6-phenylimidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-5-yl)methanol (7a) have shown the highest (100%) inhibitory activity. Compounds 6a, 6b, 7c, and 8a exhibited moderate antitubercular activity with percentage inhibition 36, 30, 15, and 20, respectively, at a MIC of >6.25 Î¼g/ml.

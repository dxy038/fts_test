kyphoscoliosis were noticed. Systolic murmur was heard in the left sternal border. Long slim limbs with long fingers
and joint laxity in thumb fingers of both hands were also observed. The ability to join thumb and fifth finger around the
wrist (Walker-Murdock sign) and Steinberg thumb sign were both positive. In her family history. three case of Marfan
syndrome were diagnosed. Two of them were her cousins. One of her cousins died due to the aortic dissection at 18
years of age and the other was a 2 year old boy who had myopia, mild skeletal deformity, arachnodactyly and mitral

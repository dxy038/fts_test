This paper describes the mode matching design of powertrain based on the case for electric vehicle from the engineering point of view and the real vehicle testing. It includes the choice of motor, drive the design, choice of battery power and so on. It is the goal for improving efficiency of electric vehicle for the design of transmission scheme. By output characteristics on the test drive motor, the change of accelerator pedal position sensor signal voltage variation about speed and motor efficiency is obtained. The design will be used to determine the transmission shift control strategy in order to ensure high efficiency motor area when the motor always works to achieve the objective of increasing driving range. In the design process the performance simulation is by ADVISOR. The performance of matching design is tested by experiments.

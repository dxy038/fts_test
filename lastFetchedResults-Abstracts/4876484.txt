The wind farm-dual-battery energy storage systems (BESS) described in [1] is studied in greater detail for those instances when the battery banks change-over. The primary design objective of the wind farm-BESS scheme is to realize the dispatchability of wind generation. The scheme requires two BESS modules to inter-change between charging-discharging modes. A new power flows control strategy is designed to cater for the battery switching-over operation while practical constraints on the charging-discharging of the BESS are considered. A dynamic study is included to illustrate the strategy.

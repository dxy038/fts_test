Background: Zinc contained cements are commonly important cements used in restorative dentistry. Therefore, cements that are used must be tested and assured.
Objective: To measure compressive strength, setting time and solubility and disintegration of Iranian zinc contained cements included zinc oxide - eugenol, zinc phosphate and zinc polycarboxylate.
Methods: An Iranian company dental products, used as prototypes and a German company dental products as proof samples. For compressive strength test, 11 samples provided from each types of cements. For setting time test, 1_6 samples provided from zinc oxide - eugenol cement and I 1 samples from two others. For solubility and disintegration 11 samples provide from zinc oxide - eugenol cement. A Hypothesis test with confidence interval of 95% was used for means estinating.
Findings: The means of zinc oxide - eugenol, phosphate and polycarboxylate cements are: 12.58, 37.21 and 35.86 MPa. Setting time are: 49.04, 5.41 and 2.5 minutes. Solubility and disintegration of zinc oxide - eugenol cement is 8.44%.
Conclusion: By comparision of results and standards, it's concluded that none of Iranian cements are standard and not recommended for use.

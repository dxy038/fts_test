This paper investigates double objective real-time load distribution model in the mode of unit automatic control for the Geheyan hydropower plant. Temporally, unit commitment scheme of real-time operation is setting by combining unit priority list with unit startup and shutdown rules. A set of optimal solutions can be obtained using dynamic programming method to resolve spatial object function and assort with temporal object, from which the load distribution scheme rules were chosen in accordance with real-time control demand. The results of daily simulation operation during April to July, 2006 show that proposed operation model can save water more than 2%, and reduce frequency number of unit crossing vibration area by 17.27%. Furthermore, under the condition of giving four different reserve load modes, consumption of power production and frequency number of unit crossing vibration area are also reduced more than 1.38% and 17.13%, respectively.

Objective: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder with adverse cardiovascular risk. Chromium (Cr) is an essential nutrient and its role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism has not been clarified especially in Iran. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of chromium picolinate administration on blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile and lipid peroxidation in type 2 diabetic patients.
Materials and Methods: One-hundred subjects were studied in double-blinded and placebo-controlled. They divided into study and placebo groups by simple randomization. The study group received 200Âµg chromium picolinate capsule twice daily and the placebo group received capsule devoid of chromium (from Century Company)  for 12 weeks. Subjects were instructed not to change their normal eating and living habits and medication. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile and malondialdehyde were measured and analyzed at beginning and completion of the study.
Results: Results revealed that chromium picolinate consumption in type 2 diabetic patients reduced fasting blood glucose (48.83%, p? 0.01), HbA1c (22%, p < 0.001), total cholesterol (6.17%, p? 0.02), triglyceride (11.36%, p  <  0. 5), LDL (17.22%, p <  0.05), HDL (5.78%, p <  0.05) and malondialdehyde (11.37).
Conclusion: These data demonstrate beneficial effect of chromium picolinate supplementation on blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile and lipids peroxidation in type 2 diabetic patients.

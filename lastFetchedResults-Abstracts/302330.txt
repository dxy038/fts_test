In the psychodynamic approach we understand the defensive meaning of anorectic and bulimic conduct, and its value as a reorganizing of objective relations: difficulties in investing, antagonism between the objective inclination of these patients and the need to protect their narcissistic balance. The avoidance of depression linked to a compensatory juxtaposed narcissistic schema must be appreciated in order to understand the developing risks in these behaviours. The psychopathological significance of these behaviours, their stakes, and their therapeutic consequences are discussed.

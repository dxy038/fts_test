This paper presents a heuristic method to solve the network reconfiguration problem in the presence of distributed generation (DG) in order to minimize energy losses and improve the performance indexes in distribution system. Topological reconfiguration corresponds to an important tool for planning and operation of electric power distribution systems. Considering the distribution operation planning, how much time one algorithm gets an alternative topological status for the system is not a matter of importance, since the main objective assumed involves: power losses reduction, enhancing the voltage profile and increasing the reliability levels. In this challenge, multiple criteria might be used according to the utility purpose in observation of regulation policies and public awareness. Despite the complexity of this combinatorial issue in large systems, researchers are making an effort to find effective optimization methods since the classic ones do not represent a reasonable alternative.

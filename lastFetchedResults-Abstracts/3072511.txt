The performance of most dynamic load balancing schemes, proposed to solve the hot spot problem in cellular systems, depends on the user distribution within a cell. In this paper, we first study the impact of user distribution on the call blocking probability performance that can be achieved by two key dynamic load balancing schemes (i.e., channel borrowing without locking (CBWL) and integrated cellular and ad hoc relay (iCAR) system (H. Jiang and S.S Rappaport, 1994)-(H. Wu et al., 2001)). We show that the achievable call blocking probability performance is location-dependent, and iCAR and CBWL schemes might not be able to achieve 2% call blocking probability for all user distributions, unless major modifications are made to CBWL or iCAR to overcome local congestion problems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to use a joint dynamic load balancing scheme that combines the features of CBWL and iCAR schemes. Our objective is to guarantee a low call blocking probability in congested cells irrespective of user location.

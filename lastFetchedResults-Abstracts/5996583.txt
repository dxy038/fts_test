The main objective of our activities in the first place was the implementation of a number of communication controllers. Analyzing the high complexity of the designs a formalized design methodology became mandatory. To ease the design process we developed a co-design methodology that makes possible the implementation of highly complex real-time applications with comparable short design cycles. The outcome of hardware components satisfies all timing constraints that were imposed by protocol and the reactivity of the application. It also was of reasonable size

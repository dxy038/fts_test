MILDATA was an Army-sponsored exploratory development study in the area of digital computer technology. Its objective was to explore and evaluate new organizational concepts for hardware and software in a tactical command control information system (CCIS) and to develop new measures of effectiveness and methods for evaluating system performance. It was assumed that the MILDATA system would be operational in the field army during the time frame 1975-1985. A unique feature of the MILDATA concept is an unprecedented degree of modularity which provides flexibility to fulfill a wide variety of tactical data processing requirements. This paper supplies necessary background on CCIS requirements and develops modular design criteria. It then summarizes MILDATA study requirements and the general nature of the results obtained and outlines a program of future work. Finally, an attempt is made to systematize the experience gained during MILDATA as an aid to the organization of future exploratory development studies.

This paper proposes a novel and computationally efficient global optimization method based on swarm intelligence for locating nodes in a WSN environment. The mean squared range error of all neighbouring anchor nodes is taken as the objective function for this non linear optimization problem. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a high performance stochastic global optimization tool that ensures the minimization of the objective function, without being trapped into local optima. The easy implementation and low memory requirement features of PSO make it suitable for highly resource constrained WSN environments. Computational experiments on data drawn from simulated WSNs show better convergence characteristics than the existing Simulated Annealing based WSN localization.

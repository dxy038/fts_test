In 3D based wavelet video coders that use longer filters, the PSNR of the reconstructed frames within a GOF varies significantly. This distortion variation is not directly related to the motion in the video sequence as in the case of hybrid video coding schemes. The paper focuses on the problem of controlling erratic variation of distortion in 3D coders. The wavelet filter properties are explored and scaling coefficients for the wavelet filter is calculated with the objective of smoothening the temporal PSNR. The biorthogonal 5/3 wavelet filter is considered in this paper and experimental results are presented for 2D+t and t+2D wavelet coders.

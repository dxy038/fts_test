Abstract
Introduction: Today, research on new antimicrobial materials is growing and nanoparticles can serve as good representative. 
Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles in the removal of bacteria E.Coli isolated from industrial effluents. 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, after sampling polluted industries, coliform and total coliform measurements fecal industrial wastewater microbiology was performed by standard methods. The silver nanoparticles with different concentrations of the nutrient media broth dilution method in the bacterium E.Coli isolates and standard (PTCC8739) and the effect of turbidity tubes (OD), which represents growth of bacteria at a wavelength of 600 nm spectrophotometer was read. Then, all tubes were inoculated on nutrient agar solid medium. The results were analyzed using statistical methods and software SPSS22.
Results: Total coliform and fecal coliform contamination was approved in slaughterhouse wastes and E.Coli (slaughterhouse industry pollution index). was isolated. With increasing concentrations, anti-bacterial activity of silver nanoparticles increased and the number of colonies was reduced, although none of the concentrations of bacteria was able to contain and eliminate the bacteria. The effect varies with type of bacteria, but this difference was not statistically significant. 
Conclusion: The results showed that the concentration of bacteria and type of bacteria are effective on the range of antimicrobial activities of silver nanoparticles. On the other hand, although the concentrations used in the study of E.Coli were effective, but did not remove the whole bacteria and economic feasibility and other factors need to be considered in the application of nanoparticles.

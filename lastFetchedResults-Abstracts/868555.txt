We study single machine scheduling problems with the objective of minimizing the number of early and tardy jobs. Several cost structures are considered: job-independent, job-dependent and symmetric, and job-dependent and asymmetric. The first two problem-classes are shown to be polynomially solvable, whereas the latter is shown to be NP-hard, and heuristic solution methods are introduced. An extensive numerical study tests the performance of the proposed algorithms. Finally, separate treatment is given to the pre-emptive versions of the above models.

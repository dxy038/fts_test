Standard texture mapping hardware enables rapid rendering of color mapped surfaces with interpolated surface shading. New algorithms extend this to bump mapping, Phong shading, and reflection mapping. We first introduce the bidirectional reflectance function we wish to optimize, split into diffuse, specular and environment terms. Casting the diffuse term as a table lookup, we introduce lighting tables and efficient ways to compute them for distant lights. We also revisit the geometry of bump mapping, extending BlinnÂ´s (1978) results. We consider caching intermediate results for rendering animated rigid bodies, generalizing this to animated surfaces using a technique called parametric rasterization. Finally, we describe efficient reflection mapping and discuss implications for bump-mapped surfaces. We present a fast method for rendering Phong highlights and discuss a special case of a planar surface with simulated water ripples

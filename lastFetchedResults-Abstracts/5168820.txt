Close-to-beam experiments require radiation detectors with the least dead region surrounding the active sensor. Silicon radiation detectors in n-type substrates with a current terminating structure, called slim-edge detectors, were developed for the TOTEM experiment at LHC [1] for this purpose. The dead region of these detectors is reduced to less than 50 J.lm offering an adequate performance. Based on those results, the EU TOSTER project arose with the objective of studying the radiation tolerance of these detectors and the development of new techniques to improve their radiation hardness. Simulations of irradiated slim-edge detectors in p-type silicon presented in this work have been carried out in this context.

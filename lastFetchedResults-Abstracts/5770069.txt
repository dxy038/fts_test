Cryptographic devices are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and complex, making reliability an important design objective. Moreover, the diffusion of mobile, low-price consumer electronic equipment containing cryptographic components makes them more vulnerable to attack procedures, in particular to those based on injection of faults. This workshop aims at providing researchers in both the dependability and cryptography communities an opportunity to start bridging the gap between fault diagnosis and tolerance techniques, and cryptography.

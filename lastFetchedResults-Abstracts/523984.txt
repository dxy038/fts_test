Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of cumulus cells on maturation,
fertilization and subsequent development of mouse germinal vesicle oocytes.
Materials and Methods: A total of 470 germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes were obtained from
26 ovaries of 3- 4 week old ICR female mice 48 hours after injection of 5 IU pregnant mare
serum gonadotropin (PMSG). Collected oocytes were divided into two groups; group I: GV
oocytes without cumulus cells (denuded oocyte), group II: GV oocytes with cumulus cells
(cumulus-oocyte complex). The oocytes in both groups were cultured in TCM-199 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 22- 24 hours in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 in air at 37Â°C. Oocyte maturation was scored under inverted microscope.
To do in vitro fertilization, matured oocytes from each group were placed in T6 medium
and capacitated spermatozoa were added. Then the fertilized oocytes were cultured and
assessed for cleavage to the 2-cell stage 24 hours and production of blastocyst 120 hours
after fertilization. Data was analyzed by chi-square test and differences in the values were
considerable significant when p < 0.05.
Results: Maturation, fertilization, cleavage and blastocyst rates in denuded oocytes were:
76.32%, 57.49%, 51.15% and 19.14% respectively. In the cumulus-oocyte complex rates
were: 89.41%, 80.76%, 75.58% and 45.62% respectively; all in the cumulus-oocyte complex
were significantly higher than those of denuded oocytes (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: The present study indicates that cumulus cells have important role during
maturation, fertilization and subsequent embryo development to the blastocyst stage.

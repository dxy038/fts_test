Mobile ad-hoc network technology has gained popularity in recent years by researchers on account of its flexibility, low cost and each of deployment. The objective of this paper is to model the behavior of routing metrics in MANET for different protocols. These metrics have been generated by Network Simulator NS 2.34 tools and the node movement has been generated using Bonmotion 1.4. The metrics behavior for each protocol is hypothesized to be dependent on node density, pause time, number of packets transferred, and the number of connection. A statistical model is implemented on MATLAB 7.0 and the model is found to be satisfactory with fitness value almost ideal value (1.0).

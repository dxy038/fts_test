The authors deal with the problems of software partition for distributed real-time applications. The software-partitioning models analyzed are those that take maximizing the efficiency in resource utilization for their objective, while observing the constraints on CPU throughput, memory space available, maximally allowed task execution time, and the order of module execution. The problem of software partition based on the models is proved to be NP-complete. There is no efficient partitioning algorithm for the models. The authors present two heuristic software-partitioning algorithms

This paper addresses a fuzzy multi-objective decision making of the advertising budgeting allocation as well as its application at the tactical level. The enterprises always want to find an optimal allocation of advertising budget in order to maximize the advertising effectiveness, which is generally represented by the viewerspsila number. However, the viewerspsila data collected by the media just approximates to the actual number of viewers who really pay attention to the advertisement. Therefore, we employ a fuzzy multi-objective decision making model to present it and a random-weight approach based on genetic algorithm to solve this model. The approach is applied to an IT company called Suojia and the result shows important gains can be achieved.

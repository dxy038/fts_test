We formulate a block processing objective function for the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and present a nonlinear optimization strategy for its rapid minimization. The resulting algorithm is called the block Shanno constant modulus algorithm (BSCMA), which is applied in the simulation to equalize multipath fading channel models with a multi-antenna system. The results show that the algorithm can converge considerably faster than the steepest descent based CMA and the RLSCMA configured similarly

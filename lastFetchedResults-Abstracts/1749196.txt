The objective of this study was to investigate how the water uptake features and carrier characteristics of the TS-1 zeolite affected the physical and rheological properties, morphological parameters, and enzymatic hydrolysis of Poly (butylene succinate) (PBS). The introduction of TS-1 zeolite as catalyst was developed for the preparation of PBS/TS-1 zeolite hybrid composites (PTHC) without heavy metal toxic substance in the context on clean technology. The TS-1 zeolite can act as a catalyst as well as a reinforcement filler with the result that PTHC can show marked increases in tensile properties and elongation at breakage in the solid state. The rheological properties of PTHC with high zeolite contents showed low values of complex viscosity, as compared with PTHC with low TS-1 zeolite contents, due to the volatilization of water released from the zeolite pores during esterification. The introduction of the TS-1 zeolite in the PBS matrix was not significantly affected by changes in the size of the long period, lamella thickness, or the amorphous region, indicating that PBS chains do not penetrate into zeolite pores, as confirmed by SAXS profiles. In enzymatic hydrolysis over 90 days, the enzymatic hydrolysis rates of PTHC significantly accelerated with increasing TS-1 zeolite contents, compared with Homo PBS. This result indicated that TS-1 zeolite can act as a carrier for enzyme activation, resulting in enzymatic hydrolysis, occurring from the amorphous area on the surface into the inside of the film.

The design, fabrication and test results of monolithically integrated transceiver chips consisting of GaAs metal-semiconductor-metal photodiodes and 850 nm wavelength vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers is presented. These chips are well suited for low-cost and compact bidirectional optical interconnection at gigabit per second data rates in mobile systems and industrial or home networks employing large core size multimode fibres.

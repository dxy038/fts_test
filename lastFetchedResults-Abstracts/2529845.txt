The main objective of this study is to propose the StrutandTie method (STM) to predict the shear capacity of simply supported RC deep beams shearstrengthened with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). It is assumed that, the total carried shear force by shearstrengthened RC deep beam provided by three independent resistance, namely diagonal concrete strut due to Strutandtie mechanism, and the equivalent resisting force resulted by with web reinforcement and FRP layer. The STM approach is regressioned with 104 specimens shearstrengthened with different scheme which are modelled and analyzed through the Non Linear finite elements method and analyzed according under Push over load. For verifying of the accuracy of proposed method, it was used to determine the shear capacity of specimens which have been tested by other researchers. Obtained results were compared with experimental data, that this comparison indicate the proposed method is capable to predict the shear strength of strengthened deep beams with externally bonded (EB) CFRP with acceptable accuracy.

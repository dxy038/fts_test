Inroduction & Objective: Nuroglia or glial cells are non-polar cells that are responsible for metabolic function and physical support. Proliferation of glial cells is answering the obvious signs of CNS to environmental damage. Yarrow is a plant belonging to the family Asteracea that contain antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti- apoptosis component. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effects of Achillea biebersteinii leaves alcoholic extract on spinal cord neuroglia cell after sciatic nerve compression in rats.
Materials and Methods: 30male Wister rats were divided randomly in groups (control,comperession, comperession+ treatment). Sciatic nerve was exposed to compression for 60 s using lockerpincers. Extract injection was done intra peritoneally in the first and second week with 50, 75, 100 mg/kg dose after compression. Then 28 days after compression under profusion method the lumber spinal cord was sampled. After cutting and coloring, the density of motoneurons was measured using dissector methods. The numerical density in each group compare with each other.
Results: According to results, neurglia density shows meaningful increase between compression and control groups (P < 0.001). Neuroglia density in treatment groups 50, 75, 100 mg/kg alcoholic extract has also a significant meaningful decrease (P < 0.001) comparing with compression group.
Conclusion: It seems that alcoholic extracts of Achillea biebersteinii leaves have probably growth factors, regeneration factors and decrease neuralgia density because of anti inflammation effect.

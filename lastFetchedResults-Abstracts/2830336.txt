The main goal of this paper is to find a control input for a unicycle-like mobile robot, to make it move, within the workspace, tending to a selected algebraic curve. To reach such an objective, an algorithm is used to compute a polynomial vector field, whose associated dynamic system has such a curve as attractive set, and a control input is given, to move the robot along the trajectories of such a system.

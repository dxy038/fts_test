Objective(s)
Previous studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with alpha-tocotrienol (?-TCT) can reduce ischemic damage in mice following middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. It is also reported to decrease stroke-dependent brain tissue damage in 12-Lox-deficient mice and spontaneously hypertensive rats. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of ?-TCT and rosiglitazone (RGZ) at 3 hr after cerebral ischemia were investigated. 
Materials and Methods
Stroke was induced by embolizing a preformed clot into the MCA. Rats were assigned to vehicle, ?-TCT            (1 or 10 mg/kg), RGZ and sham-operation. 
Results
Compared to the control group, only RGZ decreased infarct volume (P<0.05), neurological deficits (P<0.05) and sensory impairments (P<0.01) but low and high doses of ?-TCT did not show any significant neuroprotective effect. 
Conclusion
Our data showed that ?-TCT was not neuroprotective at 3 hr after the embolic model of stroke. Further studies should be undertaken to clarify the neuroprotective effects of ?-TCT after stroke.

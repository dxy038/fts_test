Renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind which are of intermittent nature are usually combined with one type of energy storage device. Combination of photovoltaic energy or wind energy with an energy storage device offers a more reliable electricity supply system which is needed for remote areas. The objective of this paper is to present a system model of a hybrid power system in which photovoltaic energy is used as an electricity generating unit and battery storage as backing up device

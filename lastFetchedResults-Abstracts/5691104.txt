A set of power stage and control loop design and simulation tools are described. The power stage design tools produce component values that meet the given specifications; an optimal design is produced by the software based on a user-definable objective function. The control loop design tools also produce optimal designs for current-injected control using the specified requirements. An important point to note is that the design tools produce values for the key components only; thus, the intention is to lay the foundation of the design. The user must complete the design by choosing other component values. Circuit-level simulation tools are described in detail

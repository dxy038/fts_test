In this paper, we outline the basis for a new distributed Bayesian search scheme in which all Bayesian decision makers recognize the same performance objective but do not possess the ability to communicate with each other. Coordination among the players is achieved indirectly by tracking search performance. This scheme is ideal for unmanned vehicles searching in extreme environments where extensive bilateral communication between actuators is not feasible. Preliminary results suggest our new search scheme is scalable and can easily be adapted for tracking moving targets

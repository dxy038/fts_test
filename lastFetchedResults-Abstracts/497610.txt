A total of 32 lactating Holstein cows with mean body weight of 622 kg (s.e.524) were allotted, at week 25 of lactation, to
eight groups of four cows blocked for similar days in milk. The objective of the experiment was to determine the effect of
feeding four dietary concentrations (0, 50, 100 or 150 g/kg of dry matter) of whole flaxseed, which contains the plant lignan
precursor secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), on concentrations of two mammalian lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) in
milk. The effects of the four diets on feed intake, milk production, milk composition and digestion were also studied. Cows
within each block were assigned to one of the four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic total mixed diets and the experiment was
carried out from week 25 to 29 of lactation. Diets were fed for ad libitum intake. Enterolactone was the mammalian lignan, of
the two metabolites studied, detected in the milk of cows and its concentration in milk tended (P50.08) to increase linearly
with higher intake of SDG in the diet. Feed intake, milk yield and milk composition were similar among diets. Milk fatty acid
profile was slightly improved by feeding flaxseed, as shown by higher concentrations of fatty acids (e.g. n-3) recognized as
being beneficial for human health. Those results suggest that feeding of whole flaxseed may result in changes in milk fatty acid
composition and enterolactone content, which offer benefits for consumers

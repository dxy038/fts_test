Objective
This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of postsurgical ovarian failure in patients undergoing laparoscopic excision of bilateral endometriomas.
Study design
Patients who had been operated on for bilateral ovarian endometriosis between January 1995 and December 2003 and who were younger than 40 years at the time of surgery were contacted by telephone and interviewed.
Results
A total of 126 patients were recruited. Mean ± SD age of patients at the time of surgery was 30.4 ± 4.3 years. Postsurgical ovarian failure was documented in 3 cases, corresponding to a rate of 2.4% (95% CI 0.5%-6.8%). In all cases, this complication occurred immediately after surgery.
Conclusion
Patients who had been operated on for bilateral endometriomas have a low but definite risk of premature ovarian failure occurring immediately after surgery.

A novel quantum evolutionary algorithm based immune mechanism for solving multi-objective public traffic optimization (PRIQEA) is proposed. By niche methods population is divided into subpopulations of real-coded chromosome automatically, and then local search is carried by the immune mechanism, each subpopulation can obtain optimal solution. By exchanging optimal pattern between subpopulations, we can achieve co-evolutionary of niche. Real-coded chromosome is provided with innovation; co-evolutionary strategy of niche can guarantee quite nicely the population diversity and the convergence speed. The convergence of the PRIQEA is proved based on Markov chain; the algorithm is applied to urban public traffic operation optimization, and experimental results show its superiority.

The reduction of consumption is an objective of the Smart Grid paradigm. The pursuit of efficient solutions requires the knowledge that can be derived from each installationÂ´s energy consumption measurements through Smart Metering. This work presents an event detection methodology, aimed to help in the disaggregation of the total measured energy consumption in an installation to a number of partial curves corresponding to individual appliances. The work has been conducted within the scope of the EU funded FP7 project &#8220;CASSANDRA - A multivariate platform for assessing the impact of strategic decisions in electrical power systems&#8221;.

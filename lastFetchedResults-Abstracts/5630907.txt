Two unidirectional hypercube topologies are proposed. Both have short diameter, short average distance, efficient routing, and multiple paths characteristics, and can accommodate a large number of nodes. They simplify the communication port hardware from bidirectional to unidirectional, and hence allow one to build larger VLSI hypercubes as well as to implement hypercube-based MANs (metropolitan area networks) with optical fibers. Improvements to and optimizations of the proposed schemes are discussed

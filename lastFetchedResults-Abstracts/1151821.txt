This paper presents a study of the influence of cutting conditions (cutting velocity and feed) and cutting time on turning metal matrix composites (MMCs). A plan of experiments, based on the techniques of Taguchi, was performed machining with cutting conditions prefixed in workpieces. An orthogonal array and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) are employed to investigate the cutting characteristics of MMC (A356/20/SiCp-T6) using PCD cutting tools. The objective was to establish a correlation between cutting velocity, feed and the cutting time with the tool wear, the power required to perform the machining operation and the surface roughness in workpiece. These correlations were obtained by multiple linear regression. Finally, confirmation tests were performed to make a comparison between the experimental results foreseen from the mentioned correlations.

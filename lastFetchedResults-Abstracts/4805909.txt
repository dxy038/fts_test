This paper develops a simple cooperative-game model for an alliance with a design house and a foundry in a semiconductor supply chain. In particular, we attempt to investigate an emerging observed type of contracts among fabless-foundry partnership. It is termed the purchase commitments on shared yields contract. We emphasize the risk-sharing aspect on the contract by explicit modeling risk into the fabless and foundry&#194;&#191;s objective functions. It is shown that the optimal share of yields depends on two parties&#194;&#191; expectations on prices of the products, risk-aversion, and scales of production. The optimal share is not directly related to the both firms&#194;&#191; marginal cost of production. That is, this contract is a cost-invariant contract. A Nash bargaining solution for the wholesale price under this contract between fabless and foundry is also proposed.

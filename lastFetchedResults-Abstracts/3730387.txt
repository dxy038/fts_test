The application of superconductivity technology to electric power apparatus is very important for promoting the conservation of energy and resources. Generators using superconductors as the field windings have many merits compared with conventional generators. A description is given of the basic designs and the current status of R&amp;D work on 70-MW-class superconducting generators. The objective of this work is a 200-MW-class superconducting generator

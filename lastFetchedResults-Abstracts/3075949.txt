The research, design and simulation of a programmable bandgap voltage reference is presented. This reference is novel in that it is programmable via a system on chip bus and it comprises a bandgap voltage reference that is digitally modulated by a first order delta sigma modulator and then smoothed by a passive RC filter. The key design objectives are to provide a programmable output from 0 V to 2.5 V approx. with 10-bit resolution and a temperature coefficient of less than 100 ppm/degC over a temperature range from -55degC to +125degC. Another key design objective is to integrate all passive and active components used into one 0.35 micron full custom mixed signal CMOS ASIC

The doping of n-type silicon solar cells was investigated using two ion implantation techniques: beam line and plasma immersion. Initially we studied the effects of beam line ion implantation, where the dopants were activated by two different annealing routines. The first one used a single annealing to activate both B implanted emitter and P implanted back surface field (BSF), while the second one used two different annealing to separately activate the dopants. Good yield was reached with a record cell of 20.33% efficiency. Secondly, we investigated the doping by plasma immersion ion implantation with final objective of fabricate a solar cell fully doped by plasma.

The Flexible Job Shop problem (FJSP) is an important extension of the classical job shop scheduling problem, in that each operation can be processed by a set of resources and has a processing time depending on the resource used. The objective is to minimize the make span, i.e., the time needed to complete all the jobs. This works aims to propose a new promising approach using multi-agent systems in order to solve the FJSP. Our model combines a local optimization approach based on Tabu Search (TS) meta-heuristic and a global optimization approach based on genetic algorithm (GA).

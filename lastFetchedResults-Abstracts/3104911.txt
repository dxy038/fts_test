The current confluence of energy needs, enhanced environmental awareness and technical developments has led vigorous global efforts toward making wind power a key component of renewable and sustainable energy resources. The conventional wind generators are induction machine types having small and limited wind power production and high cost per unit. Large wind plants involving interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous generators in modern power system is becoming an engineering challenge throughout the world. Using IPM wind generator system, the wind turbine can be operated at its maximum power production point for various wind speeds by adjusting its shaft speed to its optimal generated electrical power from wind energy. The objective of this invited paper is to provide a brief outline of the background and recent advances in the design and development of IPM wind generators to take advantage of high efficiency, high power factor, compact size, large rating, high controllability, stable operation, additional reluctance torque and low per unit cost. The IPM wind generator system yields maximum output power, while taking into accounts wind turbine characteristics and constraints of power electronic converters.

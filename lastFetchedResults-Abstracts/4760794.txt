In the highly competitive market of RFICs, components test plays a key role. In order to reduce the critical factor time to market, the main objective is to test the most products possible in the least amount of time, for the lowest cost and with the highest accuracy. Automated tests help reaching this goal, for example for VCOs measurements. A fully automated modular test system in industrial R&amp;D laboratory environment has been developed for RF and I/O products. This paper presents a part of this global test system and focuses on VCOs measurements capabilities. Multiple die testing, temperature control, automatic report generation, traceability, large modularity, enhanced accuracy, multiple instruments choice, friendly interface, re use strategy are ones of the main features of this system. Using this solution, measured improvement of productivity is a factor of 12. This system will be extended to other types of RF/PLL/mixed measurements to provide complete characterization solutions. Some switching capabilities will allow mixing different measurements campaigns. The perspectives of this system are thus wide opened.

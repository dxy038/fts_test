Driving is a demanding task, which requires constant concentration and appropriate maneuvers of a vehicle on the road. The introduction of in-vehicle navigation and route guidance system should be carried out with utmost care because of the abundant information that can be provided to a driver. In order to increase the acceptance level and lower the negative safety impacts of in-vehicle navigation, the psychological consideration and study of a model of driver behaviour is crucial. The focus of this paper is on the human factor consideration in the design of a route selection function for an in-vehicle navigation system. The issue on route selection criterion, decision-making as well as user-interface is discussed. The objective is to develop a system function which can act as a driver´s assistant and helps in the evaluation of alternate routes. Such a system can help to filter and interpret information to lessen the stress of drivers. In this paper, the philosophical consideration of drivers´ route selection is discussed. Also, a review of route selection studies is presented. The concept of primary attributes is also introduced and the issue on the user-interface is discussed

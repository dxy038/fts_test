-Most phased arrays operate in array modes that produce a twin-lobed far field pattern. A robust method has been developed to produce a single lobe by using an external phase corrector plate positioned at the image plane of the array facet. Results are given showing the changes in the far field pattern as the corrector plate is shifted across the image plane of the array facet. Alignment of the corrector plate is not critical to a certain extent, along the optic axis of the microscope objective, and the pattern is stable over a wide operating current range.

The effect of radio frequency interference that occur within a system designed for mobile communication applications is considered. The design must satisfy the objective of providing continuous communication to a large number of users distributed over a vast area while ensuring that the desired received signal level is adequately protected form the noise and interference. The cellular network design, based on the frequency reuse concept, for optimum utilization of the radio frequency spectrum in a mobile interference environment is discussed. The effect of cochannel and adjacent channel interference on spectrum efficiency is considered. The compatibility criteria to provide large service area coverage and avoidance of cochannel and adjacent channel interference are defined. The results are extended to optimize the radio communication network parameters which satisfy the coverage and interference criteria

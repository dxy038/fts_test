The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether variation of human head size results in different outcome regarding intracranial responses following a direct impact. Finite Element models representing different head sizes and with various element mesh densities were created. Frontal impacts towards padded surfaces as well as inertial loads were analyzed. The variation in intracranial stresses and intracranial pressures for different sizes of the geometry and for various element meshes were investigated. A significant correlation was found between experiment and simulation with regard to intracranial pressure characteristics. The maximal effective stresses in the brain increased more than a fourfold, from 3.6 kPa for the smallest head size to 16.3 kPa for the largest head size using the same acceleration impulse. When simulating a frontal impact towards a padding, the head injury criterion (HIC) value varies from the highest level of 2433 at a head mass of 2.34 kg to the lowest level of 1376 at a head mass of 5.98 kg, contradicting the increase in maximal intracranial stresses with head size. The conclusion is that the size dependence of the intracranial stresses associated with injury, is not predicted by the HIC. It is suggested that variations in head size should be considered when developing new head injury criteria.

3H-1,3,4-Oxadiazole-2-thione and 3H-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-one derivatives were synthesized and tested for their in vitro antimycobacterial activity. Oxadiazolone derivatives showed an interesting antimycobacterial activity against the tested strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, whereas the corresponding thione derivatives were devoid of activity. Molecular modeling investigations showed that the active compounds may interact at the active site of the mycobacterial cytochrome P450-dependent sterol 14Î±-demethylase in the sterol biosynthesis pathway and that their binding free energy values are in agreement with their MIC values.

The objective of this study was to examine the relation of tumor vascularity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with differential diagnosis malignant from benign lesions and tumor invasiveness in breast carcinoma. Forty-nine patients with breast cancer or benign lesion (median 49 yrs) were examined with dynamic MRI. Scanning of the entire breast was performed at 1.5 T with a three-dimensional fast spin echo sequence, using an original polarity altered spectral and spatial selective acquisition (PASTA) technique for fat suppression. Subsequently 0.1 mmol/Kg Gd-DTPA was administered and 3â€“6 images were obtained. The presence or absence of intratumoral, marginal and peritumoral vascularity on MRI was recorded. The excised specimen was histopathologically examined for the size of lesion, the presence and extent of local invasion. Tumor size on MRI correlated closely with the size at morphologic examination (r = 0.96). Intratumoral (p = 0.04), marginal (p = 0.05) and peritumoral vascularity (p = 0.01) were less common in benign than in malignant lesions. Among the latter, intratumoral (p = 0.01) and marginal (p = 0.03) vascularity were more common in invasive carcinomas than in DCIS. In the subset of invasive carcinomas (n = 31); however, the tumors exhibiting intratumoral vascularity were markedly larger (p = 0.03). The presence of intratumoral and marginal vascularity on MRI can help predict both the differential diagnosis malignant from benign lesions and the presence tumor invasion in breast carcinomas.

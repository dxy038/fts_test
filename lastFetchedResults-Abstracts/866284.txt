This paper presents a proposal of standardization of the Nutrition and Diet Division, (NDD) of a University Hospital based on the quality philosophy in services and standardization of enterprises. The objective is to identify and document the routines of some of the existing categories through a routine manual. The procedures used to standardize the NDD show that more participation of the management in solving divisional problems, and adequate training of the employees are required.

A conceptual framework for specifying a physical layer and a medium for a wireless local area network is detailed. This framework defines a physical layer entity consisting of a medium independent sublayer, a physical convergence sublayer and a medium dependent sublayer. The action of this physical layer entity is to provide a bidirectional mapping between the information present at the media access control interface and the information present at the media interface. The framework defines a medium characterization methodology that can be used to specify specific instances of medium for use in conformance testing and installation planning. In order to illustrate the use of such a framework a direct sequence spread spectrum PHY-layer entity and some thoughts on the characterization of the 25 GHz ISM band medium are provided. This example is not intended as an actual proposal of a standard. Rather, it is intended strictly to illustrate the operation of the template

Summary form only given. This talk will review the subject of nanotechnology and explore how new materials can be used to integrate sensing and actuation functions onto semiconductor chips, with the ultimate objective of permitting nanoscale fabrication and information storage. Ferroelectric materials offer a wide range of properties which can be used in such microsystems and nanotechnology, particularly the pyroelectric effect for thermal infrared detection and imaging and the piezoelectric effect for sensors (sound, acceleration, etc.), and for actuators (motors, pumps). The potential for ferroelectric thin and thick films to contribute to these fields will be discussed, and problems reviewed, especially from the aspect of materials and process integration. Specific examples of the factors critical to the growth and behaviour of the materials will be given and novel processing for the fabrication of thin and thick films of ferroelectrics discussed

Since electric vehicles (EVs) can operate in two modes, charging and regeneration, the idle EVs can support the system as a reserve resource through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Suppose, an ideal aggregator who has a great number of EVs joins the grid, and its idle EVs can supply aggregator itself partial power demand. The grid makes a contract for the interruptible loads (ILs) with the aggregator, they agree on the time and capacity that the grid can reduce the aggregatorÂ´s power supply, meanwhile the aggregator could manage its idle EVs to supply its demand and get the compensation from the grid. Here the grid charge the working and idle EVs during off-peak. The wind speed profile follows a Weibull distribution. Based on 24-hour load forecast curve, an optimal model, whose objective is to minimize the total cost including generating cost, reserve cost, emission cost, loss of load cost and penalty cost for not using the available wind power capacity, is proposed. This model is applied to IEEE 30-bus system. The real load fluctuations, the wind power output and the fault outage of generators are simulated hourly. Then the optimal allocation of generators and minimum total cost are obtained by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, based on Monte Carlo simulation, previous steps are repeated for 1000 times to achieve the final cost and its relationship curves with both the IL capacity and compensational price.

Purpose
A substantial clinical need exists for an alternative to vitamin K antagonists for treating deep-vein thrombosis in cancer patients who are at high risk of both recurrent venous thromboembolism and bleeding. Low-molecular-weight heparin, body-weight adjusted, avoids anticoagulant monitoring and has been shown to be more effective than vitamin-K-antagonist therapy.
Subjects and Methods
Subjects were patients with cancer and acute symptomatic proximal-vein thrombosis. We performed a multi-centre randomized, open-label clinical trial using objective outcome measures comparing long-term therapeutic tinzaparin subcutaneously once daily with usual-care long-term vitamin-K-antagonist therapy for 3 months. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 12 months.
Results
Of 200 patients, 100 received tinzaparin and 100 received usual care. At 12 months, the usual-care group had an excess of recurrent venous thromboembolism; 16 of 100 (16%) versus 7 of 100 (7%) receiving low-molecular-weight heparin (P = .044; risk ratio = .44; absolute difference −9.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], −21.7 to −0.7). Bleeding, largely minor, occurred in 27 patients (27%) receiving tinzaparin and 24 patients (24%) receiving usual care (absolute difference −3.0; 95% CI, −9.1 to 15.1). In patients without additional risk factors for bleeding at the time of randomization, major bleeding occurred in 0 of 51 patients (0%) receiving tinzaparin and 1 of 48 patients (2.1%) receiving usual care. Mortality at 1 year was high, reflecting the severity of the cancers; 47% in each group died.
Conclusion
Our findings confirm the limited but benchmark data in the literature that long-term low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective than vitamin-K-antagonist therapy for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer and proximal venous thrombosis.

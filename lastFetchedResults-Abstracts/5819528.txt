Insomnia is common psychophysiogical disorder, characterized by sleeping difficultly or lightly, restless sleep and early awakening, usually with a series of disease, such as neurasthenia, anxiety, depression and so on. Nowadays acupuncture is a complementary therapy for insomnia which is regarded as one of most effective, widely used and well-accepted method. However, acupuncture is usually used independently. In this paper, we present a research protocol designed for a parallel, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the acupoint injection combined with acupuncture treatment for insomnia with cardiac-splenic asthenia. In our study, the objective is to evaluate the clinical effect of the acupoint injection combined with acupuncture treatment compared with the acupuncture used independently.

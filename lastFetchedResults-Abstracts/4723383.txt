A polygeneration system based on a coal integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) for coal gas, heat and power is proposed. State parameters and procedure parameters for the polygeneration system were obtained by flow simulation using Aspen Plus as a platform. The initial performance of the system was evaluated in terms of the thermal efficiency of the combined cycle, the integrated energy utilization coefficient and the profit per day of operation of the polygeneration system; the simulation results gave values for these parameters of 38.41%, 76.06%, and 816,070 $/day, respectively. Optimization models with seven operating variables and different optimization objective functions were established in order to realize flow optimization. The optimum values of the thermal efficiency of the combined cycle, integrated energy utilization coefficient of the polygeneration system, and the profit per day of operation of the polygeneration system after optimization were 44.99%, 81.3%, and 897,700 $/day respectively, corresponding to increases of 17%, 7%, and 10%, respectively.

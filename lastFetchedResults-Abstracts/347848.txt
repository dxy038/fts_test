Objective: We investigated the effects of a go/nogo task on event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by somatosensory stimuli.
Methods: ERPs following electrical stimulation of the second (go stimulus) or fifth (nogo stimulus) left-handed digit were recorded from 9 subjects. The recordings were conducted in 3 conditions: Control, Count and Movement. The subjects were instructed to count the go stimuli silently in Count, and respond to the go stimuli by grasping right hands in Movement. Go and nogo stimuli were presented at an even probability.
Results: N140 was recorded in all conditions and P300 in Count and Movement. The mean amplitudes of the nogo stimuli in the interval 140â€“200 msec and nogo-N140 amplitude were significantly more negative than those of the go stimuli in Count or Movement. Nogo-P300 was larger in amplitude than go-P300 in Movement but not Count. The effect of P300 was applied to Fz and Cz, but not at Pz.
Conclusions: In the present study, effects of a somatosensory go/nogo task on ERPs were investigated, and our findings were very similar to those of previous studies using visual and auditory go/nogo tasks. Therefore, we suggest that cortical activities relating to go/nogo tasks are not dependent on sensory modalities.
Significance: The present study showed for the first time the go/nogo effects on somatosensory-evoked ERPs. These effects were similar to those in visual and auditory ERP studies.

Study Objective
To estimate the success rate of conservative medical management and indications for surgery in cases of recurrent and/or persistent labial agglutination.
Design
A retrospective chart review was performed of girls treated for labial agglutination between 1996 and 2004. Records were reviewed for age, length of time of symptoms, previous treatments, results of topical estrogen therapy, and indications for surgery.
Setting
The study was performed in a tertiary care teaching university hospital.
Participants
Charts of 67 girls with labial agglutination who were treated at the pediatric and adolescent gynecology clinic between 1996 and 2004 were reviewed. The average age was 4.1 years (range 0.6â€“14 years).
Interventions
None.
Main Outcome Measures
Improvement of persistent or recurrent agglutination labial agglutination with estrogen.
Results
Out of the 67 charts reviewed, 48 had recurrent or persistent disease. Within those 48 girls, initial treatments included: topical estrogen in 40 (83%), oral and topical estrogen in 1 (2%), topical estrogen in addition to manual separation in 5 (10%), and treated with manual separation alone in 2 (4%). Five girls were immediately treated surgically due to urinary problems or parents declining further topical treatment. Forty-three were treated with topical estrogen therapy with the following results: 15 opened either partially or completely, 9 required surgery, and 19 did not follow up. In the subset of girls with prior manual separation, 2 had resolution of adhesions with estrogen, 3 required surgery, and 2 had no follow-up.
Conclusion
This study suggests that re-treatment of persistent or recurrent labial agglutination with topical estrogen therapy following detailed application instruction leads to avoidance of surgical intervention in at least 35% of cases. Even in cases which previously required manual separation, an attempt at conservative medical management may be considered.

Integration of wind farm in territory is an actual and complex problem. Try to resolve it, with chances that a project is politically and socially accepted, recovers not from a technical method where the researcher remains isolated of regional and local actors. If the investor has for first purposes the maximization of production and profitability, citizens have for main objective the not deterioration of their living environment (mainly, visual and noise impacts). Other actors, private or public stakeholders, can pursue individual or collective interests, occurring as location criterion of wind farms. So, in this context of multiple actors more or less in conflicts, look for an optimal project is little realistic. The way of integrated wind farm, best compromise of stakeholdersÂ´ preoccupations concerning a territory, is more reasonable. Present contribution underlines how some tools of physical sciences can be used, adapted, and find their necessary complement in participative governance analysis.

The aim of this article is to consider the concept of wholeness as one of the shaping principles of the city. According to this concept all sensible entities are coherently and harmoniously integrated to each other and a notion that all these fragments are separately existed is evidently an illusion. Considering whole as one thing and not separated parts and the position of the observer and the observed, leads to different approaches of wholeness. Wholeness which explains the relation between parts of the object in objective-oriented approach, is clarified relation between parts and the observers mind in subjective-oriented view.
The paper consists of three major parts. First
wholeness in general view (meaning of wholeness and wholeness world view), second wholeness in special view (wholeness perception), and finally the wholeness concept in the city and different urban design view points meaning city as a whole.

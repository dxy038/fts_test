The shortest routing problem is revisited for the case of a dynamically changing environment in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) exploration mission. The latter is represented by energy graphs motivated by [1] and [2]. It is assumed that information about the map is received while on flight due to environmental events. In addition, UAVs are required, while on mission, to &#8220;explore&#8221; the map which involves extracting as much intelligence as possible and traversing it in the most safe flyable manner. Hence, the UAV should be capable of integrating knowledge from a variety of sources and re-plan its mission, in order to fulfil objectives. Furthermore, prior knowledge is considered to reduce computational costs. Depending on the decision making process, the notion of a &#8220;temporary&#8221; optimum path can be of physical and functional sense. The problem is modeled as a multistage decision making process, where each stage is triggered by an event. Given the current availability between paths, the objective is to devise a policy that leads from an origin or current known location to a destination node while traversing the unknown region of interest with the minimal energy requirements.


Objective- To determine the effect of selected bone graft on the compression properties of radial
bone in rabbit.
Design- Experimental in vivo study.
Animals- A total of 45 adult male New Zealand white rabbits.
Procedures- The rabbits were anesthetized and a one-cm-full thickness piece of radial bone was
removed using oscillating saw in the all rabbit. The rabbits were divided into 5 groups on the
basis of the material used to fill the bone defect: group 1: the paste of bone cement calcium
phosphate; group II: the paste of calcium phosphate mixture with type I collagen; group III:tricalcium phosphate mixed with hydroxyapatite (TCP & HP) with 5% porosity; group IV: the
same scaffold as group III with 10% porosity; and group V: the same scaffold as group III and
IV with 20% porosity, with 9 rabbits in each group. Subsequently subdivided into 3 subgroups
of 3 rabbits each.
Results- There was a significant increase in compression properties of radial bone in the group II
and V in 2nd and 3rd months as compared with groups I, III and IV. The mean endurable crackstrength
in group II and V were slightly higher than that of normal radius (P<0.05).
Conclusion and Clinical Relevance- Application of calcium phosphate paste with type I
collagen and scaffold of tricalcium phosphate with hydroxyapatite having 20% porosity
indicated to have positive effect in integral formation of qualitative callus at the site of fracture
and early re-organization of callus to regain mechanical strength too.

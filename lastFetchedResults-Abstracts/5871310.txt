Statistical data shows that most of the accidents in Chinese coal mine enterprises are caused by human unsafe behavior. Therefore, establishing a sophisticated assessment index system can effectively predict human unsafe behavior. The traditional method is to use AHP-Fuzzy to evaluate human unsafe behavior. But this approach is one-sided, because its result is easily affected by decision-makers subjective factors. Based on GB6441-86, this paper establishes a safety index system for identifying unsafe behavior of coal mine enterprises, and uses DEA method to establish a safety assessment model. By the contrast between affiliated mines of a certain large state-owned coal group, using DEA method is more specific and objective to evaluate the effectiveness of these mines in safety management of unsafe behavior. The purpose of this paper is to help to reduce the accidents caused by unsafe behavior and to achieve optimal safety production in coal mine enterprises.

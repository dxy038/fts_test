The pervasive adoption of video surveillance systems demands tools for protecting the privacy of the persons being monitored. Current solutions are either nai&#776;ve or they lack of important characteristics, such as reversibility or visual quality preservation. In this paper, we propose a novel scrambling procedure for protecting privacy sensitive image regions, which encodes the sensitive data in a parametric form, exploiting the visual information in the remaining part of the image. The encoded data is encrypted with a secret key. Partial knowledge of encryption key gives a protected version of the original image at variable levels of scrambling, while the knowledge of the full key allows decryption to a quality level suitable for people identification. To evaluate the proposed approach, we apply our scrambling filter to the AT&amp;T face recognition dataset and we measure the resulting quality with an objective metric.

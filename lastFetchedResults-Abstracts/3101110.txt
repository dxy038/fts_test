The purpose of this paper is to use the Analytic Hierarchy Process to build up a model on identifying the strategic risk. The new model is based on Baird and ThomasÂ´ Contingency model which is in accord with the strategic management of the traditional mode of thinking. At the same time, on the basis of systematology we use the multi-objective fuzzy optimization theory as strategic risk measurement methods, to enable the enterprises from the perspective of the overall strategy to identify and measure strategic risk, to determine or measure the quantity of risk of strategic management.

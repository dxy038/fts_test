Planning and dimensioning air interface of the evolution of UMTS networks based on HSPA techniques is crucial for mobile operators. The objective of this paper is to present simple and accurate planning models and methodologies integrating advanced aspects for the new standardized RF evolved HSPA beyond 3G techniques. We suggest and compare three dimensioning methods for HSPA based UMTS networks using different scheduling techniques. Analytical detailed modelling support is given for the introduced methods. We also extend ldquofair throughputrdquo scheduling technique to enhance dimensioning performance. The last one is evaluated and it is shown to improve cell size and capacity by outperforming other suggested methods based on classical scheduling techniques.

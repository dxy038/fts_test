Objective
We examined the effects of virgin olive oil (VOO) triacylglycerols (TGs) on the lipid composition of human very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).
Methods

Twenty-one normocholesterolemic, normotensive, non-diabetic elderly subjects were recruited for the study. Two VOOs (VOO1 and VOO2) of the same variety, with an equivalent composition in minor components and differing only in the oleic and linoleic acid concentrations, were administered for 4 wk each to assess the effect of their TG molecular species compositions. Blood was collected after an overnight fast, VLDLs were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and lipid classes, TG molecular species, and TG fatty acid composition were determined.
Results

Dietary VOOs significantly differed in TG molecular species composition. VOO1 represented larger amounts of triolein (P < 0.01), whereas VOO2 was significantly enriched with dilinoleoyl-oleoyl-glycerol, linoleoyl-dioleoyl-glycerol, and linoleoyl-oleoyl-palmitoyl-glycerol (P < 0.01). For VLDL, intake of VOO1 caused an increase of total TG (P < 0.01) due mainly to increases in triolein and linoleoyl-dioleoyl-glycerol. Conversely, VOO2 increased VLDL cholesteryl esters (P < 0.01) and TG rich in arachidonic acid (P < 0.01).

Conclusions: The different TG molecular species compositions of dietary oils may be an independent determinant of the lipid composition of VLDL in elderly people and therefore may play a role in regulating lipoprotein metabolism in these subjects.

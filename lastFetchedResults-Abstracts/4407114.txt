Gamification in education refers to the application of game dynamics, mechanics into the teaching and learning engagement. This paper makes a case for viewing the objective of Educational Gamification as a Gameful Educational User Experience. In an effort to facilitate the integration of tablets in the teaching and learning environment of rural schools, gamification was used as one of the design tenets to engage and motivate teachers. The Gamification of the ICT4RED Teacher Professional Development Course as an instance of the Mobile Learning Curriculum implemented is outlined through the UX lens of the user, system and context.

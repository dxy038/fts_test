The objective of this paper is to present the state of the art of different drive train qualification and parameter sets on the topic of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Focus is set on a Quadrocopter UAV model; the involved electrical and mechanical systems are analysed. Principal components of the system such as the BLDC motor, the propeller as well as the control systems are studied in depth. Complementing with the analysis of different possible test benches and evaluating the influence on their drive train qualification and parameters. Also, a practical case study of a motor-propeller configuration is provided, analysing its mechanical and electrical performance.

This paper describes the use of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (SmartParks) as Shunt Active Filters (SAF) to provide Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) services to the grid such as reactive power compensation and harmonic elimination. The bidirectional converters used in these parks are used to charge the batteries during off-peak hours, support the grid by providing compensation when demanded and also supply the stored renewable energy to the grid if the parks use solar energy for charging. The complete simulation of the hysteresis current controlled voltage source converter (VSC) acting as SmartPark is presented using modified ICos&#934; controller. Simulations are performed in MATLAB for inductive and non-linear loads under steady state as well as transient conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the viability of this simple and efficient controller to be used as SAF.

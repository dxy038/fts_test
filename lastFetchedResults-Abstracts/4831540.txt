This paper presents the construction of symmetric and asymmetric substitution boxes using an analytical approach. The objective of this work is to generate s-boxes that meet the Strict Avalanche Criteria (SAC) that are non-linear and have a high degree of resistance to differential cryptanalysis. Our approach shows that it is possible to generate s-boxes that exhibit a SAC compliance of around 70% without compromising on the robustness.

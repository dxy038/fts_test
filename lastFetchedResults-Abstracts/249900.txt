The volume fraction of constituent particles in functionally graded materials (FGM) varies continuously
and functionally, and its optimal tailoring could be made by the numerical optimization incorporated
with the  nite element method. In such a case, the mesh density in  nite element discretization of
the volume fraction  eld in uences the  nal design quality such that the further objective function
reduction requires the re nement of volume fraction meshes. However, the uniform re nement of the
volume fraction mesh is not e ective, from the numerical point of view, particularly when the  nite
di erence scheme is employed. This numerical ine ciency could be resolved by locally increasing
the mesh density only where more volume-fraction  exibility (i.e. more mesh density) is required. In
this paper, we propose an e ective volume-fraction optimization procedure by applying the irregular
h-re nement to the volume fraction discretization

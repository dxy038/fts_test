Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare motor pool excitability as measured by the H-reflex during lying prone and sitting in a semi-reclining position.
Design and method: Twelve volunteer subjects were measured for maximum M-wave and H-wave during sitting and prone lying to determine an H/M ratio. Latency of each H-reflex was also measured. H-reflex responses were recorded during a control and a vibration condition in the two positions. A double-stimuli H-reflex recovery curve was also plotted for each subject in each relaxed position of sitting and lying.
Results: No significant differences were observed between the prone lying and sitting positions for the any of the variables measured.
Conclusions: The present results showed no difference in H-reflex responses between sitting or lying and it is suggested that the subject/patient should be tested in a position which is most comfortable.

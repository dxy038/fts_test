In this paper we shall present a serial driver chip creation on FPGA. We created this serial driver chip for the RS-232 interface and we programmed it to 115200 baud rate to be able to communicate with the Lynxmotion AL5 type robotic arms. This serial driver chip was made for bidirectional communication to be able to send and receive SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) commands on the serial interface. If we create the layout of this chip we can create our own ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) and this way we shall have a standalone chip which can control a robotic arm.

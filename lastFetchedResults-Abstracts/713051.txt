The genetic organization of hepadnaviruses is unusual in that all cis-acting regulatory sequences are located within genes. Thus, in the mammalian hepadnavirus genome, the presurface, surface, and X transcript promoters reside within the polymerase gene while the pregenome transcript promoter is located within the X gene. In this study we have identified two additional promoters within the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) X gene that stimulate production of transcripts in vitro. First, we cloned regions of the WHV X gene into a promoterless expression vector (pGL2) to examine their ability to promote expression of firefly luciferase and mapped a previously unidentified promoter to positions 1475–1625 of the WHV8 genome. Deletion analysis revealed that the essential domain of this promoter, termed the ORF5/ΔX transcript promoter, mapped to nucleotides 1525–1625. Analysis revealed that this transcript initiated at nucleotide 1572 in both human (HuH-7) and woodchuck (WLC-3) hepatoma cell lines. Consistent with this finding, DNA footprinting analysis revealed protection of nucleotides 1567–1578 on the positive strand of the WHV8 genome. The function of this transcript in vivo is unclear, however, it may be used to produce a truncated form of the X protein that initiates at an AUG codon at position 1743–1745 on the WHV8 genome. Next, a second promoter was identified at positions 1625–1975 that was responsible for production of an antisense transcript. The activity of this promoter was comparable to that of the previously characterized surface transcript promoter of WHV in the absence of an enhancer. The antisense transcript promoter resides immediately upstream of open reading frame (ORF) 6, a previously identified ORF on the strand opposite of the known WHV protein-encoding sequences, that is thought to represent a vestigial gene. Analysis indicates that the antisense transcript had multiple start sites: nucleotides 1683 and 1762 on the WHV8 genome when assayed in HuH-7 cells, and nucleotide 1786 when assayed in WLC-3 cells. These data are consistent with footprinting analysis of supercoiled WHV DNA that revealed that the regions encompassing nucleotides 1696–1685, 1781–1766, and 1801–1787 on the negative sense DNA strand were protected from nuclease degradation. It is possible that such a transcript was once used in protein expression in an ancestral virus and may now be used for genetic control of WHV replication and/or gene expression. Overall, these data are consistent with the presence of a bidirectional promoter complex within the WHV X gene.

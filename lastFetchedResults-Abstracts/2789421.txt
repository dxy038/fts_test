In this paper, a method which employs Modified Teaching-Learning Based Optimization (MTLBO) algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal placement and size of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) units in distribution systems. DERs are commonly connected near the load in electric power distribution systems and include renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, fossil-fuel-based generation such as micro turbines, and other distributed energy storage elements. Loss minimization and voltage profile improvement as objective function and for every combination of DERs, impact indices, active and reactive losses and voltage profiles is studied on different load models. For all cases current injection distribution load flow method is used and tested on 84-bus Taiwan Power Company distribution system using MTLBO algorithm.

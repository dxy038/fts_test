One objective of the French-funded (ANR-2006-SECU-006) ISyCri Project (ISyCri stands for Interoperability of Systems in Crisis situation) is to provide the crisis cell in charge of the situation management with an information system (IS) able to support the interoperability of partners involved in this collaborative situation. Such a system is called Mediation Information System (MIS). This system must be in charge of (i) information exchange, (ii) services sharing and (iii) behavior orchestration. This paper presents the first step of the MIS engineering, the deduction of a collaborative process used to coordinate actors of the crisis cell. Especially, this paper give a formal definition of the deduction rules used to deduce the collaborative process.

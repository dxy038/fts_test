The main objective of the semantic Web is to make the interoperation among services or between users and services more flexible and automated. The basic step toward this interoperation is that users or services can discover the services according to their requirements. In this paper we present a practical application on semantic Web and Web services concepts where a flexible and automatic matching procedure in e-learning is shown. We illustrate how the requirements, Web services and domain knowledge are described in machine-understandable form to support the automatic and flexible discovery of Web services. Then a matchmaking algorithm based on the semantic information is proposed. Finally the design and implementation of a prototype of Web service automatic discovery is described.

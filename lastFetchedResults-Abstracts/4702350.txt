This paper presents a comprehensive simulation model of DC transit system with VSI-fed induction motor driven trains created using Power System Blockset (PSB)/MATLAB software package. The substation rectifier, the accurate track, the VSI-fed induction motor train and a detailed traction load are included in the model. The objective of this model is to study the short circuits faults that happen within the system. The model is used to simulate the train starting-up process, internal faults across DC-link capacitor and external faults across the third rail and the track. Analysis and conclusion of the simulation results are given, which shows the ineffectiveness of the conventional fault protection scheme in the DC transit system.

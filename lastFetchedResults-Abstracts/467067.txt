Objective: Our aim was to determine the impact of freezing, thawing, and subcutaneous transplantation on follicular development in grafted mouse ovaries. Study Design: The mice were divided into 3 groups: control (group 1), frozen-thawed grafting (group 2), and frozen-thawed grafting with human menopausal gonadotropin injection (group 3). After freezing and thawing, the ovaries were transplanted into the subcutaneous tissue. Two weeks after transplantation, grafted ovaries and blood samples were collected. Results: Ovaries from group 3 contained significantly more follicles (246 Â± 43 follicles) than group 2(P < .05). The pattern and intensity of Cx37 immunohistochemical staining was similar in all groups. Follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations were significantly decreased in group 2 after ovarian grafting. Conclusion: In mice, gonadotropin treatment before subcutaneous grafting improved the survival of growing follicles. Subcutaneous ovarian transplantation may restore ovarian function and could obviate many of the problems that are related to ovarian banking for humans. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;187:370-4.)

Surface Electromyography (SEMG) analysis of dynamic contraction is becoming more important to understand the muscle condition in real life activities. The objective of the study is to discover the relationship between the changes of amplitude and frequency at high and low frequency bands. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is utilized in order to process the SEMG data in both time and frequency domain. The result shows the potential to estimate the force level by analyzing the amplitude of high frequency band. However the influence of muscle fatigue and force variation should be identified during dynamic contraction. The proposed method provides an alternative solution for analyzing SEMG signals in different perspective.

Background: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a mood disorder characterized with physical and affective symptoms during the luteal phase of susceptible women. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of Dopamine D3 receptor (DRD3) polymorphism, and Cannabinoid receptor Type 1 (CNR1) polymorphism with PMDD. Materials and Methods: Fifty one participants with documented PMDD according to the DSM IV criteria and 51 healthy controls were included in this cross sectional study. Symptom severity was measured with daily self-rating, monthly premenstrual assessment forms and psychiatric interviews. The genotyping of DRD3 receptor and Cannabinoid type 1 receptors were performed using Taqmanfluorogenic assay method. Results: Distribution of DRD3 and CNR1 polymorphism was not different between patients and controls. Conclusion: These findings do not support a major role of DRD3, and CNR1 polymorphisms in contributing to susceptibility to premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

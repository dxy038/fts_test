In this paper, we measure performance of multiband camouflage screen by a new hybrid model based on bi-objective super-efficiency DEA. We propose super-efficiency DEA theory to improve conventional DEA with non-Archimedean infinitesimal, and then we take bi-objective issue into consideration to formulate a hybrid model. The proposed model has three main advantages in assessing multi-band camouflage screen performance: (i) it applies super-efficiency DEA to realize sufficient ranking of performances; (ii) non-Archimedean infinitesimal utilized in DEA can give slacks and projections, which provides optimal condition those indexes of inefficient DMUs can be attained; (iii) bi-objective DEA can offer more comprehensive evaluation from both input-orientated and output-orientated perspectives. We illustrate the application of the proposed approach by a numerical example with a set of experimental data. The example shows the effectiveness and practicability of the new approach.

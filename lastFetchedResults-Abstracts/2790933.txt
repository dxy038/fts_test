With increasing demand for higher data rate, better quality of service, and higher network capacity, there is a migration from Single Input Single Output (SISO) antenna technology to a more promising Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna technology. On the other hand, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique has emerged as a very popular multi-carrier modulation technique to enhance the data rate of future broadband wireless communication systems. Applying these technologies with a wireless relay network where multiple user pairs conduct bidirectional communications via multiple relays based on OFDM transmission. The joint optimization of channel and relay assignment, including subcarrier pairing, subcarrier allocation as well as relay selection, for total throughput maximization is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. Using a graph theoretical approach, we solve the problem optimally in polynomial time by transforming it into a maximum weighted bipartite matching (MWBM) problem. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the network total throughput versus transmit power per node and the number of relay nodes.

Background and Objective: Psychological hardiness has a relationship with various aspects of physical, psychological and social health of people, and it seems that high level of that may lead to a decrease in death anxiety and an increase in life quality in nurses. Hence, we aimed to determine the relationship of psychological hardiness and quality of life with death anxiety in nurses.
Material and Methods: This correlational study was conducted on 273 nurses selected via simple random sampling in both state and private hospitals of Gorgan, Iran, in 2013. The instruments were psychological hardiness, quality of life and death anxiety questionnaires. To analyze data, we used Pierson correlation coefficient and multiple linear regressions.
Results: There was significant relationship between psychological hardiness and death anxiety (r=-0.220, p < 0.001); between quality of life and death anxiety (r=-0.227, p < 0.001). Based on concurrent multiple linear regression, only psychological hardiness and social performance (one of the sub-scales of quality of life) had a meaningful relationship with the death anxiety.
Conclusion: It seems that high psychological hardiness may lead to decreased death anxiety and increased quality of life in nurses.

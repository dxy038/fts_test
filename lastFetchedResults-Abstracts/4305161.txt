In this paper we propose a game-theoretic approach for characterizing WiFi network performance in presence of intelligent nodes employing cognitive functionalities. We assume that a cognitive WiFi node is aware of its application requirements and is able to dynamically estimate the network status, in order to dynamically change its access strategy by tuning the contention window settings. We prove that, for infrastructure networks with bidirectional traffic and homogeneous application requirements, selfish access strategies are able to reach equilibrium conditions, which are also Pareto optimal. Indeed, we show that the station strategies converge toward values which maximize a per-node utility function, while maintaining performance fairness.

E-commerce is becoming more widespread as its ability being recognize to rapidly respond to requests and as more products and services become available. At the present time, only human beings are able to understand the services and product information published online. This cause unnecessary delay in decision making and increase the efforts of humans. In current e-World agents are replacing humans to perform the same tasks in much smarter ways. They negotiate, decide and perform on behalf of humans. Nevertheless, price is the one of the major criterion by which agents are created. This factor is easy to measure and automate. In this paper, we present an agent based model for B2C e-commerce, which deploys intelligent agents to facilitate autonomous and automatic on-line searching by intelligent agents which quickly responds to customers requests. System rests on 3-tier application and ontology of books and implementation of searching and comparison module to gain the deep perspective of domain. Implementing the architecture for online services, that is, searching the product from online web sites and comparing that product amongst different web sites and getting the result of cheapest price at the run time is our main objective. We analyzed the effectiveness of the model by customer-driven web site which provided information about products in an efficient way. The basic purpose was to satisfy our customers and search the product in cheapest price.

Background
The objective of this study was to compare the motility of a gastric substitute after jejunal interposition without a pouch and jejunal interposition with a pouch and to evaluate the relationship of both methods with nutritional outcome.
Methods

Twelve patients with gastric cancer treated by total gastrectomy and reconstruction with jejunal interposition without a pouch (J-I) and 14 patients treated by total gastrectomy and reconstruction with jejunal interposition with a pouch (J-P) were investigated in regard to the motor activity of the interposed jejunum and changes in body weight and dietary intake.
Results

Phase III of the interposed jejunum without a pouch was observed over a 3-month follow-up, but phase III of the interposed jejunum with a pouch was not observed in any patient within 3 months of surgery. In the fed state, the motor activity of the interposed jejunum without a pouch increased significantly in patients within 12 months of follow-up, but in the interposed jejunum with a pouch, it did not. The amount of food consumed by the J-I group was significantly greater than that consumed by the J-P group.
Conclusions

This study demonstrates that the interposed jejunum with a pouch shows marked disturbances from the motor pattern of a normal jejunum during the fasting and fed states. These motor abnormalities may be responsible for insufficient food intake of the J-P group.

This research has mainly focused on the practice of knowledge management in Thai construction projects at the on-site work level. The main objective was to identify whether or not knowledge factors influence on-site execution of works. A combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches was employed. The focus group interview with 16 construction managers was conducted to gather in-depth information related to practice of project knowledge management. This data was used to develop the questionnaire to explore key knowledge factors. The questionnaire was sent to 103 participants in 70 construction projects in Thailand. The survey data were analyzed by factor analytic techniques to identify key knowledge factors influencing on-site construction works. The findings showed that there were six key knowledge factors: (1) visionary leadership, (2) reward or incentive, (3) collaboration, (4) trust, (5) information technology, and (6) individual competency or skills.

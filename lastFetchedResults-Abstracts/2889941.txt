The objective of this dissertation is to investigate the potential dispensation and electric stress dispensation of porcelain disc insulator. The Insulator banks used for suspension of overhead power transmission lines constitute most important part of the transmission system. Insulators plays multiple role in power transmission system, they provides mechanical support to conductors and are used to decrease leakage current from live phase to earth. Potential dispensation and Electric stress dispensation throughout insulator bank is greatly uneven. In the present work a prototype of the 132KV insulator string in both 2-Dimension &amp; 3-Dimension was set up using OPERA, a finite element environment for the complete analysis and design of electromagnetic applications. The OPERA ST and Lossy Dielectric are used to return the field values of the electric stress and potential dispensation on the surface of the insulators. The results obtained from both 2-D and 3-D are compared.

The idea of the scientific justification of the Quran's miraculous nature has heated supporters and rejectors, and this reveals the significance of such a study. Thus, the main objective of this essay is to reach to an absolute resolution by relying on the "external reality of the Quran". To reach this resolution, first the reason of those who are for and against it are given as a sort of introduction. Then the possibilty of the scientific justification and the theoretical study of the Quran's relationship with experimental sciences, within the confines of intellect, is studied. Meanwhile the distinction between the scientific hypothesis and the scientific law, and also between the ambiguity and certainty of the Quran's literal denotations should always be kept in mind. It has been maintained that if the Quran has explicitly stated an issue and it has also scientifically been proven, this justificatin is not only permitted, but also highly recommended.

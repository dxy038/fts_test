BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Considering, the great importance of nasal morphology, it is important to define morphology and age changes of the nose objectively, instead of usual subjective definitions. Objective description of morphology and age changes of the nose (and other facial structures), support diagnosis and clinical practice of nasal morphologic abnormalities (and other facial dysmorphic signs). In addition, it enables to define standard sizes of nose and other facial structures in some syndromes (medicine) as well as in some human races (anthropology).
METHODS: In this study, four parameters including distance and angular measurements were done on frontal and profile photos of 100 normal Tehranian children aged 4-14. The indices have been shown by a scatterplot for each parameter separately to indicate dispersion of values and the age changes. Data were analyzed by Excel and scatterplot was plotted and regression line and correlation coefficient was determined for each of them.
FINDINGS: The results, present clinical and objective description of morphology and age changes of the nose of Tehranian normal children. Normal range and abnormal sizes for each parameter is presented. With increasing age, nasal root gets more prominent (r =-0.54), length of the back of the nose increases (r = 0.60), nasal base gets more inverted (r = 0.45), and interalar distance increases (r = 0.23).
CONCLUSION: Based on the results, using this method enable to define normal (standard) and abnormal sizes of facial structures in population of some human races as well as some facial dysmorphic syndromes, and support the diagnosis.

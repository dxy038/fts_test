In industries, Preventive Maintenance (PM) is not a new practice to minimise the sudden breakdown of production machine. PM will be performed at predetermine intervals to provide a balance between failure cost and component utilisation (aging). However, most of PM interval is based on experience or original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommendations. Consequently, the benefits from PM are not fully obtained because the current machine state is not considered. The aim of this paper is to propose a maintenance management decision model for PM application. The main objective of the model is to revise the PM interval based on current machine state. The proposed model provides step-by-step procedure from data identification, classification, evaluation until determination of the revised PM interval.

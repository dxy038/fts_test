In this paper, a method to identify synchronous machine parameters from on-line measurements is shown. The method is based on least squares estimation and a simple formula for the derivative operator. The method is developed to be used with a Visual C++ engine and graphic user interface (GUI), so that the practicing power engineer may link machine measurements taken in an on-line environment with the estimator. A major objective is to develop the GUI application which will be. user friendly and self guiding so as to enable prompt estimation of the desired parameters. In this way, possible fault conditions can be detected and remedy action can be undertaken. Moreover, it is desired that an algorithm be developed such that it will enable bad measurement detection and rejection so as to increase the reliability of the results.

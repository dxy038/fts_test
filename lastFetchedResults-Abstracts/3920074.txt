In this paper, a new type of AC/AC power converter is proposed. The proposed converter is capable of direct AC/AC power conversion and, except for a few small snubber elements, it does not require the use of any input inductors or a DC-link capacitor. In contrast to the matrix converter, which requires bidirectional switches, the proposed converter consists of only unidirectional switches such as insulated gate bipolar transistors. The converter has a unity input displacement power factor, and its input line current waveform is similar to that of a diode rectifier with a DC-link inductor. The proposed converter has been validated experimentally using an induction motor driven with field-oriented control

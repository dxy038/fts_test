For the sake of researching the relationship between the velocity and quality of the steel ball and the morphology of broken vehicle windshield glass, a relationship model between the velocity and quality of the steel ball and the morphology of broken glass was established by image processing technology. Three different types of steel ball, in five different velocities are selected to simulate the collision process. The results show that, the concentration area of broken vehicle windshield glass is decided by the velocity and quality of the steel ball: the heavier the steel ball, the faster the velocity, then the larger the area; the morphology of broken vehicle is related to the velocity and quality of the steel ball: with the rise of the velocity and quality, the morphology from no trace, radial trace, sparse arc trace and radial trace to intensive arc trace and radial trace. Good idea is given to reconstruct the speed and quality of the collision objective based on the morphology of broken glass.

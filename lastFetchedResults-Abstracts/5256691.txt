Probabilistic methods for reliability evaluation of power systems are more consistent than deterministic ones. This is due to the stochastic nature of power systems. However the application of such methods to practical systems require the availability of the relevant reliability data. Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) has started the process of evaluating such data for its generating system. The objective of this paper is to perform statistical analysis on collected data over the period 1989-1993 in order to estimate the outage rate and duration of the components of the 132 kV Jordanian Transmission System which is run by JEA

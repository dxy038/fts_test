Objective(s): To study the prevalence of Stereotypic Movements (SM) in children.
Methods: Using a multistage sampling method, we selected 300 children from 13 day care centers and primary schools in Urmia (Western Azerbaijan Province). Data collection involved parent interviews in the presence of the children.
Results: Three hundreds children (167 boys and 133 girls) were included in the study. Nearly 50% (149 out of 300) had one type of SM. The prevalence of different type of stereotypic movements were as follows: bruxism 16%, head banging 13%, hair pulling 8%, nail biting 7% and thumb sucking 6%; each of the affected subjects had only one type of SM .There were not any significant relationships between sex and various SM varieties- except for head banging, which was more common in boys (P<0.001). There were no significant associations between parents' education or occupation and the presence of any type of SM (P> 0.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of Stereotypic Movements is high in children. To confirm the findings more comprehensive studies are recommended.

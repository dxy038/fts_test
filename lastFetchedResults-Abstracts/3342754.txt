In this paper, we develop the design of the multi objective optimal controller for electromagnetic suspension, based on the reduced order observer. First, we derive the static output feedback system with the reduced order observer for EMS systems. The control gain is determined by solving numerically the optimization problem with respect to the multi-objective performance with mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm, subject to LMI constraints. The proposed method simultaneously guarantees the stability and H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm bounds of the transfer function between exogenous inputs to desired outputs such that the characteristics of single objective methods with H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controllers can be considered as performances.

Objective
ght to determine health promotion behavior (HPB) in women with chest pain (CP), and to explore the best predictors of HPB.
s
mple included 39 women without previous coronary heart disease (CHD), between ages 30 and 65 years, who were admitted with low-risk or intermediate-risk CP. The Health Promotion Lifestyle Profile II, the CHD Knowledge Tool for Women, and the Benefits and Barriers Scales were used to measure HPB, CHD knowledge, benefits, and barriers to risk modification for the study.
s
had low HPB scores ( X ¯ = 127.3 ± 23.5). The best predictors for HPB (adjusted R2 = .44) included educational level (β = .34, P = .010), hyperlipidemia (β = −.25, P = .05), benefits (β = .33, P = .017), and barriers to risk modification (β = −.41, P = .004).
sions
do not practice HPB regularly. Women with less education, hyperlipidemia, lower perceived benefits, or higher perceived barriers to risk modification are less likely to practice HPB. Barriers exert the strongest influence on HPB.

Introduction
Pulsed dye laser (PDL) treatment is based on the principle of selective photothermolysis and is widely considered to be the treatment of choice for a variety of cutaneous vascular lesions.
Objective

To review the indications and outcome of PDL treatment and summarise new developments.
Method

A literature-based study has been conducted entailing the review of publications over the period January 1993â€“December 2003 using the databases Medline and Cochrane CENTRAL.
Results

The PDL was found to be effective in port wine stain, facial telangiectasia, leg telangiectasia <0.5 mm, scars, hypertrophic scars and ulcerated haemangioma.
Discussion

Essential characteristics of lesions suitable for PDL treatment are discussed and guidelines are presented for future research

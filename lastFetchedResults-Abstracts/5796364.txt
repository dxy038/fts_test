A new method for characterization of simultaneous intra-atrial and ECG recordings during atrial fibrillation (AF) is presented. With different preprocessing, both types of signals are characterized using a logarithmic time-frequency distribution from which trends of frequency, regularity, morphology (only ECG) and signal quality are extracted. The objective of the study is to relate ECG measures of rate and morphology to measures of intra-atrial organisation. The algorithm has been tested on a database with simultaneous ECG and right atrial recordings from 34 patients with drug-refractory AF. The average frequency in lead V<sub>1 </sub> was 5.91 Hz (std=0.94) and the average exponential decay of harmonic magnitudes (reflecting the morphology) in V<sub>1</sub> was 1.31 (std=0.38); their correlation coefficient was 0.53 (p&lt;0.001). The correlation coefficient between spatial frequency dispersion in the right atrium and harmonic decay was 0.53 (p&lt;0.005). More organized AF, observed in patients treated with amiodarone, was reflected by a lower frequency, smaller right atrial frequency dispersion and lower exponential decay

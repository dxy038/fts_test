Objective
To determine the changes in thyroid function tests in children who underwent
antiepileptic therapy in Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Kashan, in 2008.
Materials & Methods
This analytical-observational study was carried out in a cohort fashion without
an external control group (self controlled) on 45 children with new onset epilepsy
who had not been previously treated with antiepileptic medications. Three
subjects were excluded from the study because of presenting clinical symptoms
of hypothyroidism. Plasma levels of TSH, T3, FT3, T4 and FT4 hormones were
measured and compared at baseline and 3 and 6 months after treatment.
Results
The results of Mann-Whitney statistical analysis suggested that the increase in
the plasma level of TSH was significant only in the Sodium Valproate group.
The plasma level of T3 significantly decreased 3 and 6 months after treatment in
the Phenobarbital group while the plasma level of FT3 significantly decreased
only in the Sodium Valproate group. The decrease in T4 plasma level was
significant in all groups (Carbamazepine group, Sodium Valproate group
and Phenobarbital group) 3 and 6 months after the onset of treatment but the
decreasing in FT4 plasma level was only significant in the Carbamazepine
group 6 months after the commencement of treatment.
Conclusion
Phenobarbital had the least effect on thyroid hormones. Considering the effect
of such medications on thyroid function tests, it seems necessary to check the
plasma levels of hormones periodically after beginning the treatment.

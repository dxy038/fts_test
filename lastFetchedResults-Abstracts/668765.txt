This paper describes a new model for evaluating the (relative) environmental efficiency of the seven AgipPetroli oil refineries set up in Italy during the 4-year period (1993â€“96). In particular, the environmental impact is considered in terms of air emissions. The Data Enveloped Analysis is proposed as an objective benchmark. This multi-criteria technique makes it possible to evaluate the relative environmental efficiency considering six different types of emissions (CO, CO2, SO2, etc.) and the annual quantity of oil processed.

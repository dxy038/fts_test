On the introduction of the definition and properties of the variables, T-fuzzy variables are drawn into a geometric programming model before a multi-objective geometric programming with the variables is built. The programming is determined on the condition that the variables are handled in a non-fuzzification way. Besides the programming is changed into an ordinary geometric programming dependent on the cone index J before a dual form is acquired corresponding to the primal posynomial geometric programming with T-fuzzy variables. Therefore lots of results concerning geometric programming can be completely transplanted. Based on this, the author first discuses a dual problem. Then he elicits the relation between the primal posynomial geometric programming with T-fuzzy variables and its dual form. Third he develops primal and dual algorithms to the programming. And final he verifies the model and algorithms through numerical examples.

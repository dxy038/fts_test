The intended objective of this work is the route lookup optimization in a data transmission network taking into account its structure (deployed elements and their features), its technological characteristics (including boundary conditions, especially the energy cost of the elements belonging to the route with the best energy efficient path). This optimization also will be carried out in terms of time reduction, so it has a practical application in network management, contributing to obtain more resilient networks.

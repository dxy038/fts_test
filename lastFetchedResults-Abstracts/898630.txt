Purpose: The Objective pursued by the current research is to evaluate the Qom Islamic Sciences software packages in the fields of Quran, Hadith, and fiqh & ahkam. The focus is on their search capability features. These features were derived from English & Persian authoritative sources.
Methodology: The method used in this research is based on the Evaluation Methodology. The evaluation was conducted through 91 parameters in two parts:  search options & features of the search results.
Findings: The results indicate that the software packages for Islamic sciences are scaled 2.01 from the Likert's Scaling System point of view. This value is not considerable. The search capability of the following packages is respectively more: 'Jam Altafasyr Noor', 'Mujam Baharalanvar'& 'Nuralfaqhahe3'. On the other hand, the following ones respectively have fewer capabilities: 'Taranom Vahy', 'Mujam Ahadith Alamam Mahdi' & 'Resale'. Findings show that the search power of Hadith packages is more than Quran and Fiqh & Ahkam ones. The search capability of packages that are produced by different organizations significantly varies. 
Originality/value: The current research categorized the Islamic science software packages into three main areas: Quran, Hadith, Fiqh & Ahkam. In addition, its novelty is use of checklist as a tool for multidimensional evaluation of search capabilities.

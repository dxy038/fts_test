Objective: One of the most common symptoms of the women referring with breast problems is detection of a palpable mass. These masses are benign or malignant. Benign masses are often common in the reproductive age. In this study we try to evaluate prevalence of breast mass with regarding of age and the type of breast mass.

Subjects and Methods: In this retrospective study which was carried out over 9 years from 1370 to 1378 (1991 to 1999), was based on histopathological reports of biopsy samples in Imam hospital of Ahwaz.

Results: From a total of 787 biopsy reports on breast tissue, 29 % were fibrocystic, and 24.5% were fibroadenoma. Thirty percent of biopsies were from patients in the 3rd decade while 23% of the samples were taken from patients in the 4th decade of life. In the age group lower than 30 years, 95% of the masses were benign, while 100 % of these masses were malignant in the age group above 80 years old women. The most common histopathological type was invasive ductal carcinoma (71.7 %).

Conclusion: Benign breast mass is seen in a period of life in a lot of women .The majority of breast masses in females was seen in reproductive ages and the incidence of malignant masses increases with age. The results of this study showed that although the commonest masses in females in the 3rd and 4th decade of life were fibroadenoma and fibrocystic but the percentage of malignancies were significantly higher than reported globally. We therefore, advise early screening and more careful physical exam of young woman at lower age than is practiced in western countries.

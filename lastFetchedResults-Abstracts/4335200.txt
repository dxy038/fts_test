The objective of this paper is to investigate whether the vehicular traffic patterns affect the undesired &#8216;disruption&#8217; in WLAN-based vehicular communication. Stochastic models are first developed to describe connectivity patterns in normal and dense traffic conditions. Hidden Markov model techniques are then used to measure the variation in estimated disruption with changing traffic conditions.

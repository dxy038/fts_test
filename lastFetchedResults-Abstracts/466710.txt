Objective: Previous reports from our laboratory have shown that thrombin is a potent uterotonic agonist; those studies have suggested a role for thrombin during parturition, especially with regard to intrauterine bleeding. Thrombin activation can be quantified in peripheral blood by measurement of thrombin–antithrombin III (TAT) complex levels. This study sought to determine whether thrombin activation, as measured by thrombin–antithrombin III levels, is associated with premature labor. Study Design: Thrombin–antithrombin III levels were measured in patients and control subjects with preterm labor. Quantitative TAT levels were determined by use of an enzyme-linked immunoassay with a working range from 0 to 60 ng/mL. All patients were monitored for pregnancy outcome. Receiver operating curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal TAT cutoff values. Further statistical analyses with one-way ANOVA, the χ2 test, or the Fisher exact test were performed to determine statistical significance (P< .05). Results: Patients admitted with preterm labor who were subsequently delivered within 3 weeks had significantly higher mean TAT levels (7.80 ± 2.86 ng/mL; P< .05) than control subjects (5.77 ± 1.43 mL) or patients with preterm labor who were not delivered within 3 weeks of presentation with preterm labor (5.57 ± 1.69 ng/mL; P< .05). Given a diagnosis of preterm labor, a TAT level of 8.0 ng/mL had a positive predictive value of 80% for delivery within 3 weeks of enrollment. Conclusions: This study showed that TAT levels are elevated in patients with preterm labor who are destined to deliver before term. These results suggest that preterm labor resulting in premature delivery is associated with the activation of thrombin. Future studies will further elucidate the role of thrombin in preterm parturition and confirm whether tests for thrombin activation can accurately identify those patients destined for preterm delivery.

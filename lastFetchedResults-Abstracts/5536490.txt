Being able to work effectively in teams is an important learning objective for software engineering students. Although many programs today make team projects fundamental elements of their curricula, few actually teach teamwork and communication skills directly. Consequently, students may gain experience working in teams but may not learn the skills necessary to perform effectively in a team environment. In previous studies it was shown that both team synergy and basic software engineering knowledge correlated significantly with team project success. This paper examines additional factors that have the potential to affect group performance. In particular, this study looks at gender, age, cultural diversity, previous work experience, and the degree to which work is equitably shared among team members as possible factors affecting success. Based on the results of this study, suggestions are made for both team formation and designing appropriate assignments to enhance the teamwork skills of students.

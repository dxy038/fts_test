In this paper, a class of bidirectional associative memory (BAM) networks with transmission delays and nonlinear impulses are studied. Some new sufficient conditions are established for the existence and global exponential stability of a unique equilibrium, which generalize and improve the previously known results. The sufficient conditions are easy to verify and when the impulsive jumps are linear or absent the results reduce to those of common impulsive or non-impulsive systems. Finally, an example is given to show the feasibility and effectiveness of our results.

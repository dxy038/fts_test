The present paper deals with robust and transparent video watermarking in the MPEG-4 AVC domain. It reconsiders and extends an insertion technique previously presented by the authors in order to increase its overall performances (transparency and robustness against re-encoding attacks). In this respect, an objective study on the practical impact of the errors induced by the MPEG-4 AVC (iterative) decoding/re-encoding is carried out. The experiments are performed on the MEDIEVALS corpus (more than 1h of video). The results show an increase of the PSNR of about 1.3dB and a decrease of the BER by about 10%.

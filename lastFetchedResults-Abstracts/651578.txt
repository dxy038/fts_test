Policy tools form one of the key components in the forest policy process. The main objective of this paper was to highlight national innovations in application of forest policy tools, and in doing so, to present national decision-makers with a broader variety of instruments available for solving issues of concern in the national forest sectors. This study at a general level of classification found almost no differences between the sets of policy instruments used in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. However, analysis of individual elements comprising each forest policy tool led to the identification of some national peculiarities. Based on the differences in application of elements of individual policy tools, innovative approaches in individual countries were provided.

This paper analyzes some aspects of integrating the matrix converter (MC) bidirectional switches into a power module. The analysis produces two optimal topologies for a power module: one for low-power and another for medium/high-power MCs. A new power module topology for a low-power three-phase-to-three- phase MC is proposed. By using bootstrap circuits to feed the gate-drivers, the proposed configuration requires only three insulated power supplies for a complete MC. This proposal constitutes a solution recommended in the low-power range, where low cost and low volume are the main objectives. Furthermore, a configuration of a power electronic building block for MCs is proposed. This includes the commutation control logic and the overcurrent protection, provides safe operation, and eliminates the specific problem of operating the bidirectional switches

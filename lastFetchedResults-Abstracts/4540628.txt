Increase of safety and comfort is a main objective of car manufacturers as well as of their suppliers and a substantial distinguishing feature in the international competition. Active safety systems as well as driver assistance systems are becoming more and more important. They help to recognize dangerous situations at an early stage, and thus, help to avoid accidents or at least to reduce the accident severity, especially within the permanently increasing traffic density. Radar sensors play a decisive roll for the environment perception. After an introduction to the evolution of automotive systems, commonly implemented functions using radar will be discussed. Finally, as an example, the arrangement of the radar sensors in the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class and their role in the adjacent environment perception system - as a part of the safety and comfort functions - will be outlined.

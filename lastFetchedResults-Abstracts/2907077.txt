ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most used standards for low-power applications. However, full function devices must be always active to route data in a mesh network. The objective of this work is to implement a sleeping technique at the application layer that enables sleep mode for all nodes of a ZigBee network. A time synchronisation mechanism to deal with the clock drift of the sensor nodes was developed. The technique also enables the recovery of lost messages. A large network is organised into smaller groups to reduce latency and packet collisions. The active interval of each node is dynamically adapted to the network operation to optimise the energy consumption. The proposed technique was applied to a real testbed and the increase in energy efficiency was evaluated. The results demonstrated energy savings of about 95% for networks containing up to 20 nodes per group and wake up periods longer than 2 min.

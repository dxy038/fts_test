This contribution gives an overview of the project “Prototype W7-X control system”. The objective of this prototype project is to demonstrate the applicability of the segment orientated control system at a running fusion experiment including steady-state operation, interaction of all relevant components, real time control, data acquisition and on-line data analysis. Furthermore, the W7-X safety concept will be implemented at WEGA and tested.

In order to real-time gathering the images of underwater sediment, an optical imaging system should be designed for the optical imaging of the sediment. As water and air has a different refractive index, so when light from the aqueous medium aiming at the phenomenon of refraction of air will occur, the objective lens´s angle of vision will become smaller (focal length), magnification decreases, aberrations have also changed, in which color deviation and distortion significantly increased, so that deterioration of image quality, image distortion and resolution reduction. In order to solve the above problems, the underwater sediment illumination imaging system designed in this paper using active illumination imaging systems, and analyzed imaging focal length, imaging distance, Light source and camera angle etc. in the imaging system. Because of the Water absorption of light, scattering, and changing refractive index, this optical imaging system designed for specific using environmental of river sediment camera dedicated optical imaging system to ensure the system´s image quality.

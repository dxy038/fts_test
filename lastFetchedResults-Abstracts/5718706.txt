It is a general requirement in the software engineering field that quality and productivity should be taken into consideration. Software development tools can have significant impacts in assuring the quality of a software system and productivity of the development process. In a rapidly evolving engineering field such as software engineering, it is therefore important to select appropriate development tools. This paper discusses the reverse engineering tool as a quality software development tool. An introduction to the reverse engineering tools, their impact on the development environment and their functionality in general are cited before a MECCA-model for assessing specific tools is proposed. The main objective is to introduce the reader to how a reverse engineering tool can be assessed in terms of quality and productivity

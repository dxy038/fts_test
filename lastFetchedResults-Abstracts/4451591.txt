After brief analysis of the current evaluation ways of the pavement performance, the integrated evaluation method of the pavement performance based on entropy weight radar chart theory is proposed in this study. In order to get objective, accurate evaluation results, after the analysis of radar chart theory and the improvement of the evaluation method of the traditional radar chart theory, a new evaluation method of the pavement performance based on entropy weight radar chart theory is built. Finally, by practical application, the reliability of this method is verified, which provides the reference and basis for evaluating pavement performance accurately.

Robotic cells consist of a flow-shop with a robot for material handling. A single part is to be produced cyclically and the objective is to minimize production rate. This document introduces basic concepts and tools for dealing with cyclic production. In particular, it concentrates on image-cycles which are production cycles where exactly image parts enter and leave the cell. One defines the cycle function image which is the smallest value of image so that the set of all image-cycles up to size image contains an optimal cycle for all instances. Known results and conjectures on these functions are given for the classical case where parts can remain on the machine waiting for the robot and for the no-wait case where parts have to be removed from the machine as soon as their processing is finished.

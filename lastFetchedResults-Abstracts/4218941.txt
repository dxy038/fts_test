A multi-objective hybrid genetic based optimization algorithm is proposed according to the multi-objective character of inverse planning. It is based on hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm, which combines the simulated annealing, uses adaptive crossover and mutation, and adopts niched tournament selection. The result of the test calculation demonstrates that excellent converge speed can be achieved using this approach

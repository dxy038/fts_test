This study manufactured an environmental finishing material composed of Reddish Residual Soil, water and water-soluble resin. The objective was to make an environmental finishing material with an optimum ratio and evaluate its usability for wall applications. The viscosity of the Reddish Residual Soil finishing material was altered with water. Finishing material with a higher water content had better application abilities than with a low viscosity. But over 1.3 wt.% water blending with Reddish Residual Soil and a vinyl type water-soluble adhesive resulted in an unsuitable application of flowing on a substrate. The manufactured finishing material that was suitable for wall applications was not only evaluated for physico-mechanical properties like impact testing, wet abrasion testing and internal boding testing, but also testing environmental properties such as emission of formaldehyde, TVOC, far infrared radiation and radon.

A novel quantum series resonant converter (QSRC) topology for an AC chopper is proposed. It has three bidirectional switches and operates at high switching frequency with low switching loss. Bidirectional power flow is possible, and the switches can operate in either zero current switching (ZCS) mode or zero voltage switching (ZVS) mode by a slight modification. QSRC is thought to be suitable for such a system with a fixed voltage conversion ratio. The proposed converter is applied to an electronic 220 V/110 V transformer. Detailed analyses and experimental results for 1 kVA are presented

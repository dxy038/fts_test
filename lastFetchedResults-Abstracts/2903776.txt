Numerous applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in harsh terrains are constrained by the sensorsÂ´ battery-power and face the difficulties of data collection. In this paper, we propose to exploit wireless power transfer technology to replenish the energy of sensor clusters and develop an efficient data collection scheme for those wireless rechargeable senor clusters deployed in harsh terrains. In view of the harsh terrains, we employ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to travel to the sites of sensor clusters, collect data, and recharge the sensors in corresponding clusters. With joint consideration of data collection characteristics, wireless power transfer features and travel time, we mathematically formulate the data collection in rechargeable WSNs into an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing data collection utility. Based on the matching theory, we also develop a one side matching algorithm and a greedy algorithm to solve the problem in distributed manner. Through simulations, we show that UAVs are not always matched with nearest sensor clusters, the solution of the proposed greedy algorithm is optimal, and the sensed data can be efficiently collected.

In this paper we are interested in the modeling and the control of a public transport system. We use the timed event graph and the (max, +)-algebra to evaluate the performance of this system. For this objective we propose a control synthesis. We mainly based the research of this control on an algorithm that aims at improving the network timetable such that: the waiting time at the exchange points of the network becomes as weak as possible.

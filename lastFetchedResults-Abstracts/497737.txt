In Kalidar and "the empty place of Soluch" a great part of the fictional realities including characters, actions objects and the scenes in addition to the direct indication to objective and visible realities have deeper meanings within them which are generally called implicit signification . These concepts are metaphorical, allegoric, symbolic, allusive, and figurative signification. Allegory doesn't have a high status here due to the fact that except for two or three occasions these two novels are considered as belonging to realistic literature. Metaphor in specific and literary sense is in the realm poetry and in its common sense is so general that one should look at other figurative significations like symbol, allusion and metonymy fro its manifestations and subdivisions. Within these two novels allusive and symbolic realities in addition to their real and factual indications refer to a reality beyond their superficial level because of the specific situation in which they are allocated within the story and hence can enter into the realm of figurative signification. The most frequent figurative significations of these two novels are the use of symbols and allusion from which a great number of examples have been studied here.

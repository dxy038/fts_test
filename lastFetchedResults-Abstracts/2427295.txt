Shallow landslides usually occur during hevy rainfall and result in casualties and property losses. Thus, the possible locations where landslides are likely to occur must be identified in advance in order to avoid or reduce the harm they cause. When performing a slope-instability analysis, soil thickness is an important factor; however, soil thickness information from landslide-prone areas is rarely obtained. The objective of this study is to realize the influences of spatial distribution of soil thickness on shallow landslide prediction. Three different spatial soil-thickness distributions were applied to perform a slope-instability analysis, and uniform-distributed soil thicknesses from 0.4 m to 2.0 m were also applied for comparison. Geomorphologic information and hydrological records from a landslide-prone area in southern Taiwan were collected. Results show that the spatial distribution of soil thickness related to wetness index provides a reasonable estimation in order to avoid an over-prediction for landslide-prone areas or an under-prediction for stable areas. The analytical procedure used in this study is a simple way for assessing hillslope instability for shallow landslide prediction.

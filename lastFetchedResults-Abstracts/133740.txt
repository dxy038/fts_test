Immunity against tuberculosis with consideration to pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is closely related to activity of phagocytic cells, particularly monocyte - macrophage class.
Activation of cell mediated immunity (CMI) in this infection is achieved following interaction of T-Lymphocytes and macrophages through three phases of (I) antigen presentation, (II) activation of T-Cells and production of lymphokines and (III) finally, promotion of bacteriocidal function of macrophages.
There are various reports on alteration of phagocytic activity of these cells in patients with tuberculosis. In this study, the phagocytic activity of circulating blood monocytes and granulocytes in 30 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was studied by flow cytometry compared with 30 healthy cases (Control group). The test procedure is based on the rate of phagocytosis of opsonized E.coli (With antibody and complement) that previously conjugated with fluorescien isothiocyante.
The results of our experiment are as follows:
(I) The percentages of phagocytic activity in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was significantly decreased as compared with healthy individuals.
(II) The decrease in activity of monocytic population is clearer as compared to granulocytic population (38.81% and 81.97% for patients and controls monocytes with S. D. of 12.1 and 4.44 respectively, for granulocytes 45.76% and 86.5% in patients and controls with S.D of 11.44 and 4.21 respectively, p<0.001).
(III) The decrease of phagocytic activity is related to clinical conditions of patients, for example stage of disease and period of treatment.

In the last 10 years we have provided an interactive online course on Computer Architecture and Organization, which uses Online Learning and Interactive e-Assessment technology to support easier learning. The technology enabled an interactive environment which, checks studentÂ´s knowledge and enables continuation to the next learning environment based on decision making criteria to check if sufficient knowledge is acquired by the student for a given learning objective. The system works in such a way, that the decision is made based on three correct answers in a row for questions set in a given area. Our experience shows that establishing interactive environment for online learning helps the students to gain knowledge and skills more easily, and improves the overall understanding and knowledge discovery and construction for the given course.

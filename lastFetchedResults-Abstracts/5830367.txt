In contrast to most widely-used electricity generation technologies, photovoltaic (PV) systems produce little or no environmental pollution at the point of use, contributing to their market status as an environmentally preferable product. However, there are numerous materials and energy inputs that go into the fabrication of the components of PV systems that may carry significant environmental burdens. As the PV industry attempts to scale from the global production of gigawatts to the global production of terawatts, it will become increasingly important to minimize these other impacts. The objective of this study is to take a full life-cycle view of the environmental impacts of photovoltaic (PV) energy production, and to present a best-case system design representing the most preferable choices in PV manufacturing, design and installation. In this effort, we systematically examine the technology possibilities and design options from feedstock to integration in order to identify current and future opportunities for minimizing environmental impacts. Adherence to these choices can further strengthen the environmental stance of the PV industry

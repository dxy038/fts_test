Background and Objective: Study findings have demonstrated that increasing FFA availability increases fat oxidation and decreases carbohydrate use in skeletal muscle. This study was performed with purpose to determine the effect of L-carnitine supplementation plus heparin infusion on fat metabolism and aerobic capacity. Materials and Methods: 30 healthy untrained male students cycled for 20 min according to Astrand submaximal ergometery protocol. This study performed in two separate stages: 1). Pretest: Exercise protocol without infusion heparin or L-carnitine ingestion in experimental (n=15) or control (n=15) groups: 2). Post-test: Exercise protocol with infusion heparin + L-carnitine ingestion in experimental group and placebo (Lactose) in control group. Blood samples were drawn immediately followed up exercise for the purpose of calculation plasma free fatty acid (FFA), triglyceride (TG). A Sample t test was used to determine significant differences between the two groups (P<0.05). Results: FFA increased significantly and TG decreased significantly in experimental group. The rest heart rate decreased and Vo2max increased in experimental group (P<0.05). All variables unaffected in the placebo trial. Conclusion: Our results showed that heparin infusion plus L-carnitine supplementation lead to increase FFA concentration and aerobic capacity. These finding suggested that increase availability and mitochondria transport FFA lead to enhancing in fat metabolism and improving of endurance performance.

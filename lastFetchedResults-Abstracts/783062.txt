Objective This paper extends previous epidemiological
findings linking panic attacks with future
episodes of depression and examines whether this relationship
is independent of the effects of gender and neuroticism.
Methods Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (CIDI) DSM-IV diagnoses from a stratified
multi-stage population survey of 10,641 Australian
adults were analysed using logistic regression to examine
the relationship between lifetime panic attacks, gender,
neuroticism and mental disorders. Results People
who experienced full CIDI DSM-IV panic attacks more
than 12 months ago were 4 times more likely to meet criteria
for current Depressive Disorder than those who reported
no attacks. Those with panic attacks in the past
12 months were 13.3 times more likely to report current
Depressive Disorders.A similar pattern was also present
for non-panic Anxiety Disorders (odds ratio=7.5 for
lifetime, but not 12-month panic attacks, and 21.46 for
12-month panic attacks) and for Substance Use Disorders
(2.1 and 4.6, respectively) suggesting a broader relationship
with psychopathology than previously reported.
For each of these groupings of mental disorders,
panic attacks accounted for significant variability over
and above the effects of gender, neuroticism, and comorbid
Anxiety Disorders. Conclusions Panic attacks
are associated with current and future Anxiety, Depressive,
and Substance Use Disorders, and this relationship
is not solely accounted for by differences in gender and
neuroticism

Through the analysis of two different Industrial Ethernet protocols, this paper mainly researches EPA and Modbus/TCP Industrial Ethernet communication gateway, including design and implementation of ARM embedded system and &#956;C/OS-II real-time operating system. The Industrial Ethernet communication gateway can perform bidirectional data transceiving on EPA protocol and Modbus/TCP protocol, which provides a secure, stable, real-time and flexible solution for process control of power station. Meanwhile, the communication gateway platform is compatible with other Industrial Ethernet protocols, and it supports users to research and develop different types of communication gateways between more Industrial Ethernet technologies.

One of the most important jurisprudence principles that its objective realization in the Muslim community is a barrier against the unbelievers, is "Denying the dominating of unbelievers over believers". According to the mentioned rule, God has obstructed every path that lets the unbelievers dominate over the believers, especially in the domains of legislation, creation, and station of argumenting. It should me mentioned that, although each of the discussed strategies in the field of international relations are near to the provisions of the "denying the domination rule", these strategies are not fully in accordance with it. The "denying the domination rule", however, is beyond the international strategies and represents the absolute independence of the Muslims.

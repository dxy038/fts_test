This paper presents a recently introduced switching principle for emerging monolithic bidirectional devices. Based on the hypothesis that those switches may overcome conventional diode type solutions in power converters, an active self-switching process becomes compulsory. Its principle relies on the measurement of both voltage and current polarity, in order to allow a natural switching as commonly used in matrix conversion. A self-switching method, implemented close to the switch, allows the detection of both short-circuits and open circuits. The accuracy of the presented system is experimented and validated in a 1kVA buck converter where the free-wheeling path is performed by a synthesised diode. The results that are discussed in this paper open a new perspective by introducing the principle of a so-called bidirectional diode as well as the commutation of sources of a similar nature.

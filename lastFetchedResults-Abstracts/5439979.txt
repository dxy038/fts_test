The main objective of a course in programming language concepts and paradigms is to introduce the future engineer to the syntax, semantics and pragmatics of programming languages. The emphasis is not put upon a particular language but on the ability to analyse any new one. Thus, an important goal of this kind of course is to furnish the student with critical thinking related to programming languages and programs. Nevertheless, it was very difficult to achieve this goal when a traditional format was used. During the last terms we tried a different format, based on active and cooperative learning. Students work in teams and each team specialises in one language (usually new for them) through the entire course. When new concepts are introduced they confront "their" language with these concepts. They are also invited to look for innovative characteristics in their languages. Each team communicates these explorations through papers, oral expositions and debates.

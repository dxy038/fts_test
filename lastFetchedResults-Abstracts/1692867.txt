This study presents genetic programming (GP) soft computing technique as a new tool for the formulation of martensite start temperature (Ms) of Fe–Mn–Si shape memory alloys for various compositions and heat treatments. The objective of this study is to provide a different formulation to design composition at certain ranges and to verify the robustness of GP for the formulation of such characterization problems. The training and testing patterns of the proposed GP formulation is based on well established experimental results from the literature. The GP based formulation results are compared with experimental results and found to be quite reliable.

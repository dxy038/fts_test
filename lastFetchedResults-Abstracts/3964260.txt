It is shown that an incorrect parameter limit in the existing Pspice pulsewidth modulated (PWM) switch model has been detected. The main objective of this work is to alert users of such models to a potential source of simulation error under certain parameter specifications as shown here. Simulation of the boost converter operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) based on the incorrect model results in either convergence problems or wrong results. Correction of the model is provided and its validity is verified using a specific converter example. The results illustrate how the old and corrected models produce different results when the boost converter is subjected to some transients under sudden load variations

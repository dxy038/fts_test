Automatic document summarization is a highly interdisciplinary research area related with computer science as well as cognitive psychology. Here, we introduce an intelligent algorithm, the event indexing and summarization (EIS) algorithm, for automatic document summarization, which is based on taking into account a cognitive psychological model, the event-indexing model, and the roles and importance of sentences and their syntax in document understanding. The EIS algorithm involves syntactic analysis of sentences, clustering and indexing sentences with the five indices from the event-indexing model, and extracting the most prominent content by lexical analysis at phrase and clause levels. After thorough implementation and objective evaluations, the algorithm has now shown good performance in multidocument summarization.

The objective of the study was to develop a measurement system for blood glucose and lactate and to evaluate a portable blood withdrawal system. For the blood withdrawal system a double lumen catheter was used. The inner lumen of the catheter was perfused with heparin solution and the outer lumen was used to collect the blood samples into 56 vacuum tubes at variable volumes and time intervals. A sensor flow chamber incorporating a thin-film amperometric glucose/lactate sensor was connected to the blood withdrawal system. The device was evaluated in 10 clinical experiments which demonstrated the stability of the sensors during a 6 hour period. In conclusion, on-line ex vivo glucose and lactate monitoring in blood is feasible with a portable blood withdrawal system

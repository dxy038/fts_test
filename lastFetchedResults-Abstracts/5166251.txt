The idea of simulation analysis and multi-objective evaluation was applied in parameter optimization for business process. By analyzing the parameters in business, four mainly optimal parameters and their corresponding optimization problems were determined. Some indexes for synthetically evaluating the performance of process were given, which could provide choice criteria for optimization. Aiming at the characteristics of multi-parameter and multi-objective of business process, a multi-layer iterate optimization method based on Genetic Algorithm was provided, which layered disposal solution space according to the type of optimal parameters and could not only enhance the flexibility of selecting parameters but also avoid the analysis for invalid parameter combinations. The simulation results proved that this method could supply balance and reasonable parameter configuration scheme for enterprise decision-maker.

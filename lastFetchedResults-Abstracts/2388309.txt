Changes in the dynamic properties of structures indicate an occurrence of
damages in them. In this paper, the dynamic properties of damaged structures under
dierent scenarios are obtained using suitable nite element modeling. An optimization
technique is then used to minimize the dierence between experimental and modeled data,
i.e. to minimize the value of the objective function. In this paper, the Charged System
Search Algorithm (CSS) is used for the optimization process. For enhancing the search
algorithm, the input data is modied in a recursive process utilizing the results of previous
iterations. Natural frequency and mode shapes are used in the objective function. A
beam and two frames are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Results show
that this algorithm is eective in damage detection and its performance is better when
a curvature mode shape is used in place of a displacement mode shape. Increasing the
element or the number of damaged elements does not aect the eciency of the algorithm,
and only increases the number of iterations

Objective: To evaluate the gender influence in diagnostic and prognostic value of Holter-detected ST-segment deviation. Methods: Two-hundred seventy-seven consecutive patients (196 men) who underwent coronary angiography for evaluation of chest pain were studied with 24-h Holter monitoring within 72 h of coronary angiography, and were followed up for 65Â±21 months. Results: Men had a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (169 of 196, 86%) compared to that of women (54 of 81, 67%), p<0.00025. Thirty-three (17%) men and 15 (19%) women had ST-segment deviation during 24-h recording. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of ST-segment deviation (elevation, depression, or both) for the detection of significant coronary artery disease were similar in men and women. The negative predictive values were significantly higher in women than men for ST-segment deviation (36% vs. 15%, p<0.001), ST-segment elevation (35% vs. 14%, p<0.001), and ST-segment depression (34% vs. 15%, p<0.001). Similarly, the diagnostic accuracies were significantly higher in women than men for ST-segment deviation (44% vs. 29%, p<0.025), ST-segment elevation (38% vs. 19%, p<0.001), and ST-segment depression (40% vs. 24%, p<0.025). There was no significant difference in composite end-point of events (mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and coronary revascularization) in men versus women with ST-segment deviation (elevation, depression, or both). Conclusion: Holter-detected ST-segment deviation has a higher negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy for detection of significant coronary artery disease in women than in men, although the prognostic values are not significantly different between men and women.

The research object of our study is oil sludge produced in petrochemical wastewater treatment. A technical option is proposed in conditioning and dewatering of oil sludge, recycling of gas condensate and malysite so as to minimize the oil containing sludge, fully utilize resources and to protect environment. Results show that the structure of oil sludge is improved and the dewatering effect of oil sludge by flocculants conditioning. The sludge dewatering rate can increase about 22% and the gas condensate content is reduced to 0.086g/g after ultrasonic treatment. The malysite recovery and the total solid reduction are improved to 72.15% and 46.41% under the synergistic effect of acidification and ultrasonic wave. Finally, the excess sludge solidification by using solar drying method can reach landfill atandard. The objective of this paper is to establish a technique of the oil sludge treatment, which can be used for reference in the recycling utilization of oil sludge resource.

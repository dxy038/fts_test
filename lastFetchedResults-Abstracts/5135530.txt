Synthesis of case studies is different from synthesis of purely quantitative studies, for example, in that sampling and analysis in primary studies have been carried out differently, and that primary results are of a different nature. The objective of this research is to identify what challenges should be considered when choosing and using a method for synthesis of case studies. We collected experience from independent synthesis of two published case studies (on trust in outsourcing) by two teams, one team applied cross-case analysis, the other team applied thematic synthesis. The two teams reached both supporting and complimentary conclusions. Identified challenges relate to the goals and research questions of the cases to be synthesized, the number of case studies, temporal and spatial variations, and access to raw data.

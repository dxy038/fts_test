Introduction & Objective: The most common causes of inflammation of conjunectiva are
bacterial and viral infections. Because of the antimicrobial quality of black tea, the aim of this
study is to compare the effects of brewed black tea with boiled water as adjunct treatments on
infants' conjunectivitis.
Materials & Methods: This is a randomized control clinical trial study that was carried out
on110 infants referred to Pediatric Clinic of Amir Kabir Hospital in Arak on 2011. The
subjects were randomized into 2 groups of intervention (receiving brewed black tea plus
antibiotics) and control (receiving boiled water add antibiotics). The severity of
conjunectivitis and duration of treatment were determined in both groups at first, third and
seventh days of treatment and compared with each other.
Results: At the first day there wasnâ€™t seen any significant difference between the groups, in
terms of the severity of conjunctivitis. At the 3rd day 74.5 % of infants in the intervention
group and 18.2 % of infants in the control group had been cured which showed a statistically
meaningful difference (P=0.001). 100% of infants in the intervention group and 32.7% of
them in the control group had been cured at the seventh day (P=0.001).
Conclusion: Because brewed black tea plus antibiotics decreased the severity of infants'
conjunctivitis and reduced duration of treatment, it is suggested to be used as an adjunct
treatment in the case of infants' conjunctivitis.

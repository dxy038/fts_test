The paper presents two inverse scattering models to achieve through wall imaging in the frequency domain. One model treats the wall as a part of inhomogeneous background medium and consequently the GreenÂ´s functions for inhomogeneous background are numerically calculated. The other model treats the wall as a known scatterer placed in a homogeneous background medium and then the permittivity of the wall is excluded from the retrieving process by a proper reformulation of the objective function. The advantages and disadvantages of the two models are discussed. Numerical simulations are performed to test the performance of the two models. Super-resolution imaging results are reported.

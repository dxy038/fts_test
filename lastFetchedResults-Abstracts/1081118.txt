The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of operating modes, membrane materials and pore size on natural organic matter (NOM) fouling. A range of flat sheet microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes were tested under conditions of various constant pressure and constant flux filtration modes. Based on experimental filtration profiles, molecular weight (MW) distributions of NOM obtained using high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and autopsies of fouled membranes using force emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), it was concluded that medium to low MW component of NOM (300–1,000 Da) is responsible for the initiation of fouling, where bulk of the fouling observed is due to very high MW ‘colloidal’ NOM (>50,000 Da). This two stage fouling phenomenon was in good agreement with classical blocking laws. As a general observation hydrophilic membranes were less prone to NOM fouling. A comparison of constant pressure and constant flux tests confirmed that modest constant flux, as used in industry, provided the most beneficial conditions.

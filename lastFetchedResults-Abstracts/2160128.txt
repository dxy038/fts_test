The shelf-life of ready-to-eat vegetable salads established by manufacturer is usually 7–14 days depending on the type of vegetable, and is determined by loss in organoleptic qualities. A more objective method to predict shelf-life and spoilage would be desirable. The present study monitored the evolution of spoilage organisms in a mixed salad of red cabbage, lettuce and carrot stored at 4°C, 10°C and 15°C. Changes in carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations and pH were also monitored. Predictive modelling was used to establish a theoretical shelf-life time as a function of temperature. Lactic acid bacteria at levels of 106 cfu/g appeared to be related to both spoilage and theoretically-predicted shelf-life values.

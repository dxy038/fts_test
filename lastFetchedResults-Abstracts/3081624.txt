In this paper, we consider the problem of association of wireless stations (STAs) with an access network served by a wireless local area network (WLAN) and a 3G cellular network. There is a set of WLAN Access Points (APs) and a set of 3G Base Stations (BSs) and a number of STAs each of which needs to be associated with one of the APs or one of the BSs. We concentrate on downlink bulk elastic transfers. Each association provides each ST with a certain transfer rate. We evaluate an association on the basis of the sum log utility of the transfer rates and seek the utility maximizing association. We also obtain the optimal time scheduling of service from a 3G BS to the associated STAs. We propose a fast iterative heuristic algorithm to compute an association. Numerical results show that our algorithm converges in a few steps yielding an association that is within 1% (in objective value) of the optimal (obtained through exhaustive search); in most cases the algorithm yields an optimal solution.

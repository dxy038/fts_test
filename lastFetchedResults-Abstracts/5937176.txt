A system identification method is proposed which can be used to characterize the distribution system load as a function of the substation voltage. The primary objective of this technique is to capture the dynamic variation of the composite system load on distribution feeders so that the most effective substation voltage level can be obtained and applied to conserve energy over specified control periods. The proposed system identification method is implementable on actual distribution systems by utilizing existing capabilities of the distribution automation hardware. Also, the impulse response of a space heating load is identified using the proposed technique to demonstrate the applicability of the identification method

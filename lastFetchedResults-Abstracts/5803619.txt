The objective of this study is to show the applications of the simulation implementation of QNX identified model combining with Matlab/Simulink platform, QNX C/C++ compiler and QNX real-time operating system. The HIT/DLR Hand II dexterous hand QNX real-time simulation model is generated by the Simulink platform and QNX C/C++ compiler link files. Moreover, this model can be implemented in the QNX real-time system. Simulations in the QNX real-time system show that the HIT/DLR Hand II dexterous hand QNX model which based on the methods in this research, was able to offer an attractive performance during both real-time simulation and feedback operations.

A discrete-events simulation course should develop in its students not only the abilities related to the programming language and statistical analysis, but also the ability to create an abstract of a real system into a model system. Thus, this paper has the objective to develop and evaluate an educational dynamic project for discrete event simulation courses, which are capable of developing the student´s ability to perform abstraction and representation of real systems in a conceptual and computational model. To meet this objective, Lego&#174; was used in the educational dynamic. For the evaluation of the motivation presented by the students in the dynamic, the ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction) technique was used together with an Instructional Materials Motivational Survey (IMMS) questionnaire. An indicator was established to measure the student´s utilization and/or knowledge gained. The results demonstrate that the dynamic reached its objective, presenting a high utilization in the motivational criteria analyzed.

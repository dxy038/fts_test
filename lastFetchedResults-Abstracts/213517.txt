Background: Knowledge of infertile couples about ass isted reproductive technology is a
fundamental parameter to optimize the infert ility treatment and conduct it cooperatively.
Objective: To evaluate knowledge and attitude of infertile couples about assisted reproductive
technology we designed a descriptive cross- sectional study.
Materials and Methods: 400 infertile patients were investigated by a self- administered structured
questionnaire about demographic data, infertility history, and several relevant variables in an out
patient infertility clinic of a university hosp ita l.
The main outcome measurements included scoring the answers in the questionnaire regarding
knowledge, and grouping the answers regarding attitude. Resulted data were analyzed in relation to
patient's gender and treatment history, and educational, ethnic and religious gro ups.
Results: Of 400 cases (251 women and 149 men) 167 patients (41.7%) were scaled to have good
knowledge and 223 patients (55.7%) had a poor knowledge about ART. 14.6% of patients with
advanced education and 30.3% of patients without advanced e Iucation were scaled to be good in
knowledge. 45.6% of men, 43.4% of women and 64.8% of patients with a history of passing
previous ART cycles had a good knowledge. The source of information was mentioned to be the
ART centers in 73% of cases. 95% of patients disagreed to have sperm or ovum donation or to
undergo surrogacy. 22% of all patients (27.5% of women versus 12.]% of men) agreed with
embryo reduction. 94.5% of patients mentioned the ART expenses not to be affordable readily.
Conclusions: Less than half of patients presented to be knowledgeable about ART. Not a great
portion of the patients agreed with sperm donation . ART expense is mentioned to be burdensom by
nearly all of the patients.

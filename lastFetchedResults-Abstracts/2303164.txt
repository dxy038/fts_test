ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In the patients diagnosed with abnormal uterine bleeding, if the patient does not respond to drug treatment or is not a good candidate for hysterectomy, endometrial destruction is recommended. The aim of this study was to evaluate complications, blood loss and patient satisfaction regarding this method of treatment.
METHODS: This retrospective study was performed on 56 women who admitted to Ayatollah Roohani Hospital of Babol and Imam Hossein Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Upon the diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding, they underwent a treatment called "endometrial destruction by thermal balloon". A questionnaire including the following items was completed after the sugery: demographic characteristics, menstrual status, postoperative complications, treatment success and a 12-month post-surgery patient satisfaction. In order to assess the patients’ satisfaction, 4 questions were asked (excellent, good, fair, poor). Successful treatment was defined as 6 months of amenorrhea  after treatment with cavaterm and a reduction in the menstrual blood loss in the form of spotting or volume degression.
FINDINGS: Of the 56 patients who were treated with balloon thermal endometrial destruction, 4 were excluded due to the lack of follow-up. The mean age of the patients was 91/5±38/43 years. No complications occurred in any of the new patients, and the percentage of amenorrhea was 23 after the treatment. Twelve months after the surgery, the success of treatment was reported in 46 patients (5/88%) and patient satisfaction was also rated in 45 of the patients (5/86%).
CONCLUSION: The results of the study showed that the thermal balloon treatment had no major side effects. Thus, it could be inferred that the study was a success in terms of the outcomes and high patient satisfaction. This method could be taken into consideration before a hysterectomy. 
KEY WORDS: Hysterectomy, Endometrial destruction, Uterine bleeding.

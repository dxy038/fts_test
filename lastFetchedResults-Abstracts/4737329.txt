Nowadays, it is paramount to study and develop robust algorithms to detect the very existence of hidden messages in digital images. In this paper, we provide two data sets for the unseen challenge of the First IEEE workitorial on vision of the unseen (WVU). Example usage of the data sets is demonstrated with the steg detect analysis tool, with surprising results reported. Our objective is to challenge researchers to assess their Digital Image steg analysis state-of-the-art algorithms.

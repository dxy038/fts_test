The article presents solution procedure of geometric programming to solve the structural model with imprecise coefficients. We have considered a single objective structural optimization model with weight as an objective function. Geometric programming provides a powerful tool for solving a variety of imprecise optimization problems. Here we use nearest interval approximation method to convert a triangular fuzzy number to an interval number. In this paper, we transform this interval number to a parametric interval-valued functional form and then solve the parametric problem by geometric programming technique. The advantage of this technique is that we can find directly optimal solution of the objective function without solving two-level mathematical programs.  Numerical example is given to illustrate the model through this approximation method.

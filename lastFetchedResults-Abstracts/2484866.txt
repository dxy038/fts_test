Objective (s): The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a sex education program on sexual function in menopausal women with sexual dysfunction in selected health centers in Tehran, Iran.
Methods: This was a randomized trial. Women who had sexual dysfunction and did not have depression were chosen and randomly assigned into two groups: the intervention and control groups (50 women per each group). The intervention group received a training program in 4 sequential weekly sessions. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Beck Depression Inventory were used to collect data. Sexual function in postmenopausal women was evaluated two months after the intervention in the intervention and control groups. Then, initial assessment was compared to the follow-up data.
Results: The overall mean score of sexual function (P=0.001) and desire (P=0.002), excitement (P=0.046) vaginal luubrication (P=0.012), sexual satisfaction (P=0.003) and dyspareunia (P=0.035) were significantly better among intervention group. However, there was no statistical difference between two groups in orgasm (P= 0.059).
Conclusion: The finding suggest that four sequential weekly educational sessions can improve sexual dysfunction in menopausal women suffering from sexual dysfunction.

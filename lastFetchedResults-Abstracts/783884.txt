Background Little is known about the mortality differences
in psychiatric disorders (PD) between countries
according to multiple-cause-of-death (MCOD) data.
Objective To compare mortality differences in PD
between Taiwan and the US according to MCOD and
underlying-cause-of-death (UCOD) data and factors associated
with the reporting of PD and assigning PD as the
UCOD.
Method MCOD data of Taiwan and the US for years
2003 through 2005 were used for analysis. Deaths per
100,000 population for various PD by age and sex were
calculated for each country. Mortality rate ratios between
Taiwan and the US were computed to examine the extent
of mortality differences between the countries. Odds ratios
in reporting PD and assigning PD as the UCOD by age and
sex for each country were estimated according logistic
regression model.
Results According to UCOD data, the PD mortality was
3.6 per 100,000 population in Taiwan and 21.9 per 100,000
population in the US, a sixfold difference. The mortality
differences increased according to MCOD, which was 10.3
per 100,000 population in Taiwan and 115.4 per 100,000
population in the US, an 11-fold difference. Exception
dementia/Alzheimerâ€™s disease, the mortality differences
between the countries increased in schizophrenia, mood
disorder/depression, use of alcohol and use of drug
according to MCOD data compared with those according
to UCOD data. The percentage in reporting PD among all
deaths in the US (13.9%) was higher than those in Taiwan
(1.4%); however, the percentage in assigning PD as the
UCOD in Taiwan (35%) was higher than those in the US
(19%).
Conclusion MCOD data could be used as a complement
to UCOD data to provide more information (such as percentage
of reporting PD and assigning PD as the UCOD) in
interpreting mortality differences in PD between the
countries

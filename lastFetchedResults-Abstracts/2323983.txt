Inroduction & Objective:Recently herbal plants were used extensively in various fields, especially in the control of bacterial infections. But the toxicity of probably side effects caused very concern in the use of these materials in various fields of medicine. The aim of this study was clarify some of these ambiguities and investigation the effect of injection of Eukalyptus globulus extracts on mouse biochemical and hematological parameters.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 25 adult male rats were randomly divided into 5 groups. Group 1 was sham. Control group 2 and group 3 to 5 experimental groups were treated respectively with aquatic, ethanolic and acetonic extracts of Eukalyptus globulus extracts. Mice treated for 10 days. On the eleventh day the rats were killed by diethyl ether anesthesia. Blood samplesweretakenfrom theheart. Then the biochemical and hematological parameterswereevaluated.
Results:The results showed nosignificant changesinbiochemical factors. Blood parameters includes: white blood cells, red blood cells,platelets, hemoglobin and hematocrit percent donâ€™t show any variation. Platelet levels increased significantly in the experimental mice.
Conclusion:Intraperitoneal injection of Eukalyptus globulusextracts in mice does not affect biochemicaland hematological factors.

Chemical pollutants presence in water may induce severe ecological
consequences and consequently affecting aquatic ecosystems integrity. Heavy
metals are dangerous pollutants for aquatic inhabitants that have a great stability.
Heavy metals contamination (pollution) of the surface waters happens widely by
discharge of mill effluents. The objective of the present study was to determine the
50% lethal concentration (LC50), Mercuric chloride (HgCl2), Lead chloride (PbCl2)
and Zinc chloride (ZnCl2) on survival goldfish (the average weight 10±0.25 gr and
mean length 6cm). Fish fry were exposed for 96 hours in 5 treatments lead
chloride, mercuric chloride and zinc chloride for 8 treatments. These experiments
carried out in static condition and based on TRC standard method. On the base of
obtained results by Probit program LC50 value of Lead chloride, Mercuric chloride
and Zinc chloride in 96 hours were 88.8±0.05, 0.87±0.41 and 92.6±0.05 mg/l on
Carassius auratus, respectively. Based on 50% lethal concentration, the toxicity of
materials was determined include mercury chloride, lead chloride and zinc
chloride, respectively in goldfish and also Mac (Maximum allowable
concentration) value of mercury chloride, lead chloride and zinc chloride were
determined 0.087, 8.88 and 9.26 mg/l for goldfish, respectively.

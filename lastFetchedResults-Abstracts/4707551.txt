In this paper an approach to supervisory control of multi-stage industrial control systems is presented. This approach is based on the notion of an internal reference model, and further makes use of a fuzzy multi-objective optimization strategy to compute the control action via an iterative approach. This framework has been shown to be effective in the operation of an energy management and control system (EMCS) used in climate control and may offer similar advantages in other situations as well

Objective- Cardiac hydatid cyst is an uncommon disease, its prevalence being about 0.5â€“2%. 90% of parasites which are digested orally are removed by the liver and lung, 10% enter the general circulation and 1% enters the coronary arteries. Its cause is echinococcus, which is found in animals such as sheep and dogs. The mortality rate of disease is 10.2%. The aim of this study is to present the results of 10 cases with cardiac echinococcosis operated in Shaheed Madani Heart Hospital in Tabriz. Methods- From 1992 to 2004, ten cases of hydatid cyst of the heart underwent surgical excision. For collecting data a questionnaire was used and statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software and was done through descriptive statistical method. Results- There were 7 females and 3 males (F/M ratio = 2.3/1). The mean age of patients was 25.6 years old. All patients were operated through median sternotomy with CPB. Surgical treatment included puncture of the cyst and sterilization with hypertonic saline solution and total cyst extirpation. There was one perioperative mortality and one case with cerebral hydatid cyst one year later. All patients received albendazole pre- and postoperatively. Conclusion- Surgical treatment of cardiac hydatid cyst is safe. It is recommended that patients receive mebendazole or albendazole 30-40 mg/kg for 6-24 months postoperatively. Reduction of serum levels or achievement of negative test results indicates positive therapeutic effects (Iranian Heart Journal 2006; 7 (4): 67-71).

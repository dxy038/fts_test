A hybrid methodology is presented for the solution of the problem of the optimal allocation of reactive power sources. The technique is based upon a modified genetic algorithm, which is applied at an upper level stage, and a successive linear program at a lower level stage. The objective is the minimization of the total cost associated to the installation of the new sources. The genetic algorithm is devoted to defining the location of the new reactive power sources, and therefore to handle the combinatorial nature of the fixed costs problem. At the lower level, the variable cost problem is solved by calculating the magnitude of the sources to be installed at the previously determined locations by means of a linear program iterated successively with a fast decoupled load flow. Results are presented for the application of the proposed methodology when applied to the Venezuelan electric network

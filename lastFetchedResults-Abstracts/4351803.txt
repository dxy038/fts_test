This paper describes cockpit display processor research and development being conducted at the Wright Laboratory. The objective is a compact, high performance, cockpit avionic display generator. The resulting system will generate 1.5 million triangles per second and manipulate high resolution video. The design is based on a pipeline of custom VLSI geometry processors and smart memory. The application of this advanced system is to enhance the situational awareness of pilots flying tactical fighters. However, the WL graphics processor design will be available to the tri-services and NASA

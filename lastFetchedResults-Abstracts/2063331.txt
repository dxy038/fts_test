TRIPOLI is a Monte Carlo particle transport code simulating the three-dimensional transport of neutrons and photons with the Monte Carlo method, and it can be used for many applications to nuclear devices with complex geometries; however, modeling of a complex geometry is a time-consuming and error-prone task. The recently developed functions of Monte Carlo Automatic Modeling (MCAM) system, which is an interface code that can facilitate Monte Carlo modeling by employing the CAD technology, have implemented the bidirectional conversion between the CAD model and the TRIPOLI computation model. In this study, different geometric representations of CAD system and TRIPOLI code and the methodology of bidirectional conversion between them were introduced. A TRIPOLI input file of International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) benchmark model, which was distributed to validate the Monte Carlo modeling tools, was created and applied to simulate Dâ€“T fusion neutron source sampling and calculate first wall loading. Then the results were compared with that of Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) and the good agreements present the feasibility and validity.

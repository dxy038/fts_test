Limiting short circuit current and increasing power system stability is a contradiction. An optimization and decision model for limiting short circuit current considering sensitivity ranking is established. Firstly, the influence on impedance matrix caused by current limiting measures is analyzed, and a variable selection strategy considering the sensitivity relation between current limiting measures and node self-impedance is proposed. Secondly, the objective functions which minimize the total investment costs and the short circuit capacity margin are presented, and an adaptive hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to find a scheme set. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation model is established based analytic hierarchy process and the systematic and quantitative assessments are realized by the fuzzy algorithm. Simulation results of the practical power grid demonstrated the efficiency and speediness of this proposed model.

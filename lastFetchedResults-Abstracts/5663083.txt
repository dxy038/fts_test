For the reason of practical use in propeller design for low-dynamic aircrafts in Near Space, it is very important to have high-performance low-Reynolds-number airfoils which should have high lift-drag ratio, high endurance factor and high maximum-lift-coefficient, etc. Multi-objective optimal design can effectively solve the multiple design-points problem, which is an effective means and methods for optimum aerodynamic design. The paper attempts to present effective and practical multiple-objective optimization design method for low Reynolds number airfoils in Near Space. The results of two representative design cases are presented, which fully demonstrate the validity of the multiple-objective optimization design method presented in this paper.

With the evolution of network technologies, integrated services networks make possible real-time multimedia applications. However, the delay jitter and the absence of a physical global clock may disrupt the temporal relationships among media units composing theses multimedia applications. The &#916;-causal ordering is designed to ensure real-time delivery of messages by respecting the causal order. This &#916; value represents the limited lifetime during which a message m can be used by a destination process. In this paper, we develop a new real-time causal ordering concept, in the context of multicast communication, where all participants can start to playback the same message. We validate this model by using CPN (coloured Petri nets) tools to obtain a state space graph. The objective is to study the behavior of this model, by verifying different properties such as, boundedness, and liveness. The simulation result shows that this model respects the real-time causal ordering, in the context of multicast communications

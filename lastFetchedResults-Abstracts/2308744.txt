Introduction: Recently, such alternative methods for tooth preparation as laser irradiation have been studied increasingly, though limited numbers of studies have been conducted in regard with primary teeth. Microleakage  involves one of the prominent criteria in evaluating success of adhesive restorative materials. Therefore, the objective of this in vitro study was to compare marginal microleakage of three restorative materials in cl V cavities prepared by Er:YAG laser in primary teeth. 
Methods: Forty five primary canine teeth were randomly divided in 3 groups. Class V cavities were prepared via Er:YAG laser on buccal surface. The groups 1,2,3 were restored according to the manufacturer's instructions with resin-modified glass ionomer, composite resin and compomer respectively. Then all specimens were polished, thermocycled, and immersed in 2% methylene blue solution and sectioned buccolingually. The specimens were assessed under a stereomicroscope(X20). It should be noted that microleakage assessment was performed by two evaluators who were cognizant of micro leakage scoring (0 to 4). Moreover, the study data were analyzed by applying Exact-test.
Results: The study results revealed no significant difference between microleakage of three groups (P-value =0.422) 
Conclusion: These three restorative materials(resin-modified glass ionomer, composite resin, compomer) were proved to be proper for restoring  cl V cavities prepared by Er:YAG laser in primary teeth.

Objective: Alpha-synuclein is a major component of protein plaques in synucleinopathies, particularly Parkinsonâ€™s disease. The purpose of this study is to assess the inhibitory effects of cuminaldehyde on the fibrillation of alpha-synuclein. 
Methods: Alpha-synuclein was expressed in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified. For the process of fibrillation, purified protein was incubated at 37?C and pH 7.2. Fibrillation was analyzed by the standard fibril methods. The effects of different concentrations of cuminaldehyde (20-500 ?M) on alpha-synuclein fibrillation were studied by assessment of the cytotoxic effects of samples on the neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-MC. To study the protein aggregation forms that were generated in the presence of cuminaldehyde, SDS resistance and induced fibrillation (seeding) methods were employed. For studying its specificity on alpha-synuclein, the effect of cuminaldehyde on lysozyme fibrillation was also examined.
Results: We showed, for the first time, that cuminaldehyde inhibited fibrillation by more than 80%. The highest inhibition was observed at the ratio of 5-15 moles of drug to protein. The viability of the treated cells with inhibited proteins was more than 90%, whereas non-inhibited samples caused a decrease in viability by 50%. Inhibited samples were not resistant to SDS and they were unable to induce fibrillation. Cuminaldehyde did not inhibit lysozyme fibrillation.
Conclusion: Cuminaldehyde inhibited fibrillation of alpha-synuclein which was accompanied by small amorphous aggregated particles of alpha synuclein. The inhibited protein samples did not induce aggregation. Thus, cuminaldehyde can be considered as a candidate to inhibit the formation of alpha-synuclein plaques.

Steel beam-to-column joints are often subjected to a combination of bending moment and axial force. Current specifications for steel joints do not take into account the presence of axial forces (tension and/or compression) in the joints. A single empirical limitation of 5% of the beam’s plastic axial capacity is the only enforced provision in Eurocode 3—Part 1.8. The objective of the present paper is to describe an experimental program carried out at the University of Coimbra on extended endplate beam-to-column joints to try to extend the component method philosophy to the combined action of bending moment and axial force. To fulfil this objective, a set of seven extended beam-to-column joints were tested. This paper provides a detailed description of this experimental programme focusing on the moment–rotation curves and individual component assessment. Finally, it reveals that the presence of an axial force on the beam significantly modifies the joint response.

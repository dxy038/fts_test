Objective
 is known about the course of body image dissatisfaction following disfiguring injury or illness. The objective of this study was to test a proposed framework for understanding the trajectory of body image dissatisfaction among burn survivors and to longitudinally investigate the role of body image in overall psychosocial functioning.
s
le of 79 survivors of severe burn injuries completed the Satisfaction with Appearance Scale (SWAP), the Importance of Appearance subscale of the Multidimensional Body–Self Relations Questionnaire, and the SF-36 in the hospital and at 6 and 12 months postdischarge (SWAP and SF-36). A repeated-measures analysis of covariance model was used to assess the course of body image dissatisfaction over time, and a path analysis model tested the role of body image dissatisfaction in mediating the relationship between preburn and postburn psychosocial functioning.
s
 sex (P&lt;.05), total body surface area burned (P&lt;.01), and importance of appearance (P&lt;.01) predicted body image dissatisfaction. From hospitalization to 12 months postdischarge, body image dissatisfaction increased for women (P&lt;.01) and individuals with larger burns (P&lt;.01) compared, respectively, to men and individuals with smaller burns. In the path analysis, body image dissatisfaction was the most salient predictor of psychosocial function at 12 months (β=.53, P&lt;.01) and mediated the relationship between preburn and 12-month psychosocial function.
sion
gs from this study suggest the importance of routine psychological screening for body image distress during hospitalization and after discharge.

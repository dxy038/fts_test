Objective: To investigate the presence of sharp pin inhalation in tracheo-bronchial tree in women wearing a hijab. Methodology: This was a descriptive study that was conducted in the thoracic surgical department in al-sader teaching hospital, Basra from February 2010 to March 2011. Detailed history was taken from all the patients. Clinical examination, chest radiography and rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia were done to all the patients included in the study. In those, where rigid bronchoscopy failed to remove the pin, thoracotomy was done. Results: The mean age of the sample was 19.5 years. All females presented with cough while two of them had hemoptysis (5.5%) and five had unilateral wheeze on chest auscultation (13.8%). The majority (n=28, 77.8%) of pins were located in the left main bronchus. The rest were either in the right main bronchus (n=5, 13.8%) or in trachea (n=3, 8.4%). Pins from 32 (88.9%) patients were removed by Negus rigid bronchoscopy. In only 4 (11.1%) patients, thoracotomy was done to remove the foreign body. Conclusion: Sharp pin inhalation is a serious hazard and can have lethal outcome. It commonly occurs when women hold the pins in their teeth while wearing the hijab and talking to others at the same time.

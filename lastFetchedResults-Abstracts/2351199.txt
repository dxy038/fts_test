The objective of this work was the study of the selectivity of apatite flotation in a column by means of kinetic analysis. The recovery and apatite content in the concentrate were correlated to the collector dosage, depressant dosage and air flow rate. The test results were subjected to statistical analysis aimed at identifying the experimental conditions producing the best P2O5 content and recovery.

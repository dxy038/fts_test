Background
With recent improvements in cerebral protection during aortic arch repair, total aortic arch replacement has become an accepted surgical method for acute type A aortic dissection involving the aortic arch. Our surgical strategy is to perform total arch replacement with a branched graft using antegrade selective cerebral perfusion for the patients with type A aortic dissection involving the aortic arch. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy on late outcome.
Methods
From October 1988 to April 2003, 46 patients underwent total arch replacement for acute type A dissection involving the aortic arch. Operations were performed with hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, antegrade selective cerebral perfusion during the arch repair, and open distal anastomosis.
Results
Hospital mortality was 6.5% (3 patients), and permanent neurologic dysfunction was observed in 1 patient. During the follow-up period (mean, 5.4 years; range, 13 months to 15.6 years), 2 patients died, but the causes were not related to the aorta or aortic valve. Survival rates at 5 and 10 years postoperatively were 89.6% ± 5.2% and 82.7% ± 8.2%, respectively. Of the 41 survivors, 3 patients underwent successful reoperation for the distal thoracic aorta. Freedom from reoperation was 93.6% ± 4.6% and 88.7% ± 6.5% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The residual false lumen in the thoracic aorta was frequently thrombosed (76.2%).
Conclusions
Total arch replacement for acute type A dissection may decrease the risk of late complications related to the false lumen and lead to excellent long-term survival.

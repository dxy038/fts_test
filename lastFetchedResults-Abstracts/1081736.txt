The underlying objective governing the management of radioactive waste is protection of human being and the environment, now as well as in the future. As a waste management philosophy, utmost emphasis is given to waste volume minimization at all stages of design, operation and maintenance [1]. The development of innovative treatment processes for low and intermediate level wastes (LLW and ILW) in recent times has focused on volume reduction as one of the main objectives [2]. During reprocessing of spent fuel, an optimized mixture of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) and dodecane is used as an extracting agent for actinides. During their repeated use, solvent undergoes chemical/radiolytic degradation, loosing its efficiency and hence to be discarded as spent organic solvent waste. This waste is presently being treated by alkaline hydrolysis process where spent solvent is refluxed with concentrated sodium hydroxide solution at 110Â°C [3]. TBP component of the spent solvent waste gets hydrolyzed and is converted into sodium salt of di-butyl phosphate (DBP). The other products obtained during hydrolysis include sodium salt of mono-butyl phosphate (MBP), butanol and phosphoric acid. Dodecane component of the spent solvent waste does not take part in the hydrolysis reaction and appears as a clear phase. The dodecane waste thus separated is subjected for thermal destruction by incineration. The emulsified aqueous layer thus obtained retains most of the activity present in the spent solvent waste. The present paper describes experimental studies performed to look for various approaches for management of this type of waste.

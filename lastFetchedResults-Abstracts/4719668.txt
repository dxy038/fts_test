River water quality systems with a serial interconnection structure are analysed with the objective of multivariable control. For the resulting block triangular system, a control design methodology is proposed in such a way to permit that from multivariable input-output data for such a type of system, both the identification by a subspace methodology previously developed be made as the corresponding decentralized control.

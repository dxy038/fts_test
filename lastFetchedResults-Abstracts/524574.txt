Background – Hypertension is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases. Research has shown that medication noncompliance is the most important reason for poorly controlled hypertension. The objective of this study was to determine the factors, which are associated with medication compliance among hypertensive patients registered in an outpatient clinic. This study was conducted from 23rd July 2002 through 12th April 2003 among 532 hypertensive patients attending the Health-Care Center of Shaheed Motahari Clinic in Shiraz. Method – We carried out a standard interview with 250 patients who met our study inclusion criteria. The data collection included information about sociodemographic variables, variables related to disease and treatment, and patients’ knowledge and attitude. Compliance was defined as the proportion of amount of drugs used by patients compared to the amount of drugs, which had been prescribed. Results – The study group comprised 25- to 65-year-old patients with mean age of 50.6 (SD = 9.7). In 60.4% of the patients compliance was less than 90%. Medication compliance was better among patients who were older than 50 years, were insured, had a good understanding of hypertension and a positive attitude toward antihypertensive drugs, had visited their doctor in shorter intervals, had complications due to hypertension, used other drugs, and had taken antihypertensive drugs for more than 5 years (p < 0.05). In a multiple logistic regression model, having a positive attitude toward antihypertensive drugs and the interval between visit to physician of less than 3 months were two independent predictors of compliance (p < 0.01). Conclusion – Patient’s medication compliance is a multifactor behavior in which the role of patient’s attitude is very important. In order to assess other factors, it is necessary to conduct further research on the patient-physician relationship and methods of providing health care to patients.

A BiCMOS low-power, 5-V, single-chip read channel IC is presented. This device contains all the functional blocks needed to implement a high-performance read channel, including the AGC (automatic gain control) programmable active filter, pulse detector, servo demodulator, data separator, and time base generator. External components are minimized for small-form factor evolution and cost reduction. This versatile device supports 8-24 Mb/s data rate operation in 1,7 RLL format. It also supports constant density recording. Typical power dissipation is 400 mW. The programmability, testability, and configuration of this device are achieved by a bidirectional serial microprocessor interface and internal registers

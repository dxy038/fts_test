Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare learning satisfaction and effectiveness using traditional lecture or educational game in teaching medical students about ectopic pregnancy.
Study design
Third-year medical students were randomized to instruction about ectopic pregnancy through either standard lecture or educational Jeopardy style game. Students in each group completed a pretest, posttest, and satisfaction survey. Experts in ectopic pregnancy validated the pretest and posttest. The satisfaction survey was taken from published validated tests. Paired samples t test was used to compare pretest and posttest scores. Independent samples t tests were used to compare test scores and satisfaction responses between groups. Chi-square tested dichotomous satisfaction responses.
Results
All 104 students in both groups showed significant improvement in learning about ectopic pregnancy (P< .001) on pre- and posttest comparison, with scores being almost identical. Students in the group randomized to game format rated it higher in stimulating faculty/student interaction, helping retain information, and overall enjoyment than students participating in the lecture method (P< .001). In addition, students in the game group responded positively that the format was interactive, stimulated their interest, and kept them engaged in class content (P< .001).
Conclusion
The innovative educational game format was as effective as standard lecture in educating students about ectopic pregnancy, while being more enjoyable and stimulating. Based on these conclusions, we hope to motivate other teachers in obstetrics and gynecology to use innovative teaching methods to provide a more enjoyable, stimulating, and active means of effective medical education.

The objective of this paper is to investigate a methodology, which can extract approximate results from non-anechoic measurements. Using impulse response both in time and angular domain, the environment has been successfully described. Simulated data has been used to illustrate the applicability of this new methodology and its improved performance over the conventional FFT-based methods.

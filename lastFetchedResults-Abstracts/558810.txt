This study intended to analyze the direction of Granger-causality between energy consumption and employment in public and private sector. We have adopted DL approach for Granger-causality analysis. We found from the whole analysis that there is evidence of bidirectional causality between energy consumption and employment in organized public and private sector. Therefore our study supports for our third testable hypothesis i.e., "feedback hypothesis"

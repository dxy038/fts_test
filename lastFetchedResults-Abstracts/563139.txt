Along aquaculture, ornamental fish culture has been shown a tremendous growth during these years. The huge attention toward dried food in ornamental fish culture is caused by the difficulty related to live-food preparation. The main objective of this study is to adapt fighter to the dried diet. Experiment was conducted in identical conical vessels with volume of 600 ml. Fish were fed by three diets including died artemia, live artemia and dried feed. The diets were assigned to conical vessels with 15 fish each, with two replicates for each diet. The result revealed that growth and survival rate improved (P < 0.05) in fish fed by live or died artemia compared to fish fed by dried feed. Natural behavioral pattern was also affected by the type of the food. Feeding by dried feed reduced aggressive behavior compared to arteimia containing food. In conclusion, adaptation to dried feed caused a reduction in growth rate and also occurrence of stereotype behavior in fighter. This condition suggests that fighter hardly accepts dried food in the early life stage.

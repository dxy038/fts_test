Background:  It is now evident that adipose tissue functions as an endocrine organ by releasing 
adipokines, and the levels of a number of inflammatory markers elevated in overweight and obese 
individuals. The objective of this study was to examine the association between inflammatory markers 
(IMs) including C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Homocystein (Hcy) and obesity 
variables in Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) adults.  
Methods:  In this cross-sectional study, 352 individuals (132 men and 220 women), age ≥19 years, 
were randomly recruited from among TLGS population. Individuals were categorized based  on the 
waist circumference. The serum levels of  IMs  were determined using the Enzyme Linked 
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method.  
Results: The mean age of participants was 46.1±16.1years and Abdominal obesity were present in 
199(56.5%) individuals. The levels of hs-CRP and IL-6 were higher in abdominally obese group 
(1507±3.3 vs. 577.8±4.3 ng/mL p<0.001) (3.6±3.3 vs. 1.9±3.8 pg/mL p< 0.001), and in the same 
group, the best predictors (based on the adjusted R2) for hs-CRP, IL-6 and Hcy were waist (WC), 
waist to height ratio (WHtR) and wrist, respectively. Hip and WHtR were the best predictors for Hcy 
and hs-CRP in normal group; there was no variable significantly correlated with IL-6, therefore it was 
not possible to consider an independent predictor for IL-6. 
Conclusion: According to this study, obesity is associated with IM levels, and in abdominally obese 
group, the best predictor for Hcy, hs-CRP and IL-6 were Wrist, waist and WHtR respectively.

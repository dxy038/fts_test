The conventional economic dispatch problem in electric power generation is mainly concerned with minimizing operating cost. This study presents a multiple PSO algorithm of solving the multi-objective power dispatch problem that minimizes both the fuel cost and environmental impact from emission. An integrated factor is used to combine the multiple objective functions. The PSO method and a distance index are applied to obtain the multiple candidate particles, and then, the global optimal solution is searched by a direct approach method. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed method can provide outstanding solutions with reasonable performance.

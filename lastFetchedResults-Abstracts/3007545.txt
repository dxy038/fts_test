An unsupervised approach to image segmentation which fuses region and boundary information is presented. The proposed approach takes advantage of the combined use of 3 different strategies: the guidance of seed placement, the control of decision criterion, and the boundary refinement. The new algorithm uses the boundary information to initialize a set of active regions which compete for the pixels in order to segment the whole image. The method is implemented on a multiresolution representation which ensures noise robustness as well as computation efficiency. The accuracy of the segmentation results has been proven through an objective comparative evaluation of the method.

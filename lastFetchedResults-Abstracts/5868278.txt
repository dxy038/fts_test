Cement manufacturing, like most other industries, is striving to become more optimal. This optimization implies the factory be controlled and managed as one integrated entity, where all operations and factors affecting production are managed in such a way so as to maximize production within business, quality and operational constraints. A key to achieving this objective is the use of advanced technology, specifically intelligent control systems (ICS) that allow for the embedding of process, business and other knowledge so that the interaction and consequences of all events and states on the plant can be understood and taken cognizance of. Such intelligent automation systems have been installed on a number of plants within the PPC group in South Africa. These systems provide an intelligent and unified view of the total plant where most operations are controlled and managed from the same console. This includes all basic and advanced process control process optimization, as well as logistics. Because such systems are continuously being upgraded and expanded, they are always relevant, up to date, and keep up with the changing needs of the cement company, always adding value

Background: In recent years, troponin I has been a prognostic factor of myocardial cell injury. Also, regarding the importance of leptin measurement in coronary artery disease investigations are being performed. In addition, CK-MB has been a "gold standard" test for this disease. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the biochemical markers Troponin I, Leptin and CK-MB in coronary artery diseases.

Methods: This was a study on 100 patients who suffered from coronary artery disease. Following blood collection, the serum sample was tested to determine the concentration of troponin I, Leptin, and CK-MB. Troponin I level was measured by two-site immunoluminometric assay. Leptin and CK-MB levels were detected by ELISA. Statistical t-test was employed to analyze the data. Findings: The data obtained in the present study was indicative of a significant correlation between troponin I and Leptin among the patients (p=0.01). Also, a significant relationship was observed between troponin I and CK-MB in our study population (p=0.01). In addition, there was a significant relationship between both leptin and troponin 1 and the gender (p<0.001; p<0.016). Leptin was also found to have a significant association with age (p=0.018). Finally, a significant correlation between the history of myocardial infarction and gender was demonstrated (p<0.002). Conclusion: Our results showed that the measurement of troponin I in combination with CK-MB, as gold standard, could be considered as an appropriate diagnostic method for progress of myocardial infarction. Leptin and troponin I are also suitable biomarkers in diagnosis of coronary artery diseases. Due to lack of troponin I in other body tissues except for cardiac tissue, troponin I is proposed as an ideal marker for definite diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.

An important consideration for landfill liners and covers constructed in the frost zone of cold climates is the possible deterioration in performance due to freeze-thaw cycling over the design life of the liner or cover system. Several examples in the literature show that geosynthetic clay liners can withstand a limited number of freeze-thaw events, but data on long-term freeze-thaw performance are lacking. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term performance of geosynthetic clay liners exposed to repeated freezethaw cycles, encompassing their application as a final cover as well as a bottom liner. Measurements of hydraulic conductivity were performed after as many as 150 freeze-thaw cycles, with no appreciable increases observed.

A method for reflector detection, based on the instantaneous phase of the aperture data for ultrasonic images, is proposed. The instantaneous phase (IP) image is obtained by replacing the amplitude information by the instantaneous phase in the delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming. From the analysis of the IP image, a threshold level is defined in terms of the number of signals used for imaging. This threshold is applied to the IP image, resulting in a two-level image which gives a statistical indication of whether the pixels of a region in the image are related to a reflector or noise/artifacts. Because the proposed method uses only the instantaneous phase of the signals, it is less sensitive to attenuation than conventional DAS amplitude images. The point spread function of a 32-element array with half-wavelength pitch at 5 MHz in water is simulated and the reflector is detected for signal-to-noise ratio values larger than -29.6 dB. A phantom and an aluminum plate with artificial defects are tested with the proposed technique, using linear arrays of 64 and 16 elements, respectively. When compared with DAS amplitude images and with two-level images obtained by thresholding the amplitude images using empirical threshold values, the proposed technique reduced artifacts and dead zone, and detected all reflectors, increasing reflectorsÂ´ detectability and decreasing the occurrence of false indication of reflectors. The proposed technique can be used as additional information for amplitude image analysis, with the advantages that it does not need time-gain compensation and that it considers an objective threshold value.

In view of the existing fuzziness and randomness in the training effect comprehensive evaluation, an index system, which comprises the first class indices such as training condition, training management and training effect, was put forward; and then a two stage fuzzy assessment model for training effect evaluation was established by applying the theory of fuzzy mathematics. The concept of entropy in information theory was also used so as to obtain the objective weight of each index and avoid subjective effect. The application of this model to the safety training quality evaluation of certain training organization shows that its training quality is ldquogoodrdquo. The research proves valuable to improve the performance of enterprise quality training.

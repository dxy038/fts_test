In wireless ad hoc networks some links may be unidirectional due to the hidden terminal problem or due to disparity between the transmission power levels of the nodes at either end of the link. But most of the existing routing algorithms for wireless ad hoc networks tend to assume that all links are bidirectional. In this paper, we propose Loop-Based Clustering Routing (LBCR), a new on-demand routing protocol for wireless ad hoc networks with unidirectional links. The novelty of the LBCR protocol is to implement clustering based on loop and all the nodes in the same cluster can know routing each other. Therefore, LBCR can achieve to transmit route request message and route reply message in a smaller range instead of broadcasting, and the route control overhead is alleviated. In this paper, we also analyze the routing storage overhead and the communication overhead of route reconstruction. We compare LBCR with UANR and ULNR and find that LBCR has better performance than these two protocols.

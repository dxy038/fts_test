Our objective is to estimate and clarify the factors that determine the degree of importance of information by extracting the words that characterize the degree of importance and to construct a system for automatically estimating this degree of importance. We studied the degree of importance of information by using machine learning. We first performed experiments using newspaper documents (D<sub>n</sub>). In this experiment, we assumed that a document on the front page or at the top of the front page is important. We were able to identify important documents with a precision of 0.9 by using machine learning. We found that in the case of a newspaper, the degree of importance can be estimated with high precision. Next, to estimate the degree of importance that people attach to a document, we conducted experiments using questionnaire data (D<sub>q</sub>) as test data. In these experiments, the subjects were asked to identify which document from a pair was more important, and a high accuracy of 94% was obtained with more than 80% of them responding with the same answer. Furthermore, on using newspaper documents (D<sub>n</sub>) as training data, we could obtain (i) the same accuracy by using D<sub>n</sub> only instead of using D<sub>n</sub> with D<sub>q</sub> and (ii) a higher accuracy on using D<sub>n</sub> and D<sub>q</sub> instead of using D<sub>q</sub> only. This observation is useful because preparing questionnaire data (D<sub>q</sub>) can be an expensive process, whereas (D<sub>n</sub>) is free. Finally, we extracted the characteristic words that differentiated important information from less important information by calculating the parameters of the features in machine learning (maximum entropy (ME) method).

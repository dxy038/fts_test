: Although ursodeoxycholic acid is effective for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis, some patients do not respond to this treatment. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of additional administration of colchicine in ursodeoxycholic acid-treated patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.
Methods: Twenty-two patients with primary biliary cirrhosis treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (600 mg/day) for 30 months were randomly assigned to two groups: group 1, colchicine (1 mg/day) and ursodeoxycholic acid (n=10); group 2, ursodeoxycholic acid alone (n=12).
Results: In group 1, there were significant decreases in mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, Î³-glutamyltranspeptidase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and IgM, and these changes were more remarkable in those who responded poorly to ursodeoxycholic acid. In contrast, there were no significant changes in those values in group 2.
Conclusions: Additional administration of colchicine to ursodeoxycholic acid may be beneficial for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, especially those who respond poorly to ursodeoxycholic acid. It is necessary, however, to further confirm the efficacy of colchicine by examining histological changes and following the patients for longer periods.

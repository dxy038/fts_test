Repugnancies often appear between control behaviors of the real time optimal dispatch and the reserve regulations (containing primary, secondary and tertiary regulations). Real time optimal dispatch push the power system operating point toward the optimal point, but reserve regulations pull it deviated from the optimal point, it induces that the most operating points become non-optimal points. With the continuous increment in penetration of wind energy, the contradiction becomes gradually serious. Based upon the analysis of optimal point neighborhood, further research on the contradictions mentioned above is made in this paper. There are two important characters of the optimal point neighborhood: the broad characteristic of optimal point neighborhood and the non-sensitive characteristic of objective functions in optimal point neighborhood. In this paper these characters of optimal point neighborhood are opened out to deepen the understanding of the problems and point out the correct way of treating with the relationship between the real time optimal dispatch and the reserve regulations.

Nowadays energy is one of the most essential needs of human being and it can be considered as the basic prerequisite of social and economic development.  Hence, many of the correlations and legislations of a country are affected by it. Since Iran has huge source of gas and oil, it has turned to a fossil fuel oriented county. But as oil and gas sources are non-renewable ones and cannot be replaced, it is essential for every country to focus on Renewable Energy Sources (RES). So today is the time of studying and investing on RES to be able to exploit them in the time of oil and gas crisis. In the past, the choice among alternative sources was based on the cost minimization, but ranking the RES optionsâ€™ is a complex task. The objective of this paper is determining the best renewable energy alternative for Sistan \& Baluchestan province of Iran by using interval Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) method. In the application of the proposed methodology the most appropriate renewable energy alternative is determined fuel cell and biomass for the mentioned province.

Presence of the distributed generation (DG) in electric systems can represent a significant impact on the operational characteristics of distribution networks. This paper presents a study aimed at the appropriate choice of parameters used in a multi-objective analysis considering the optimal DG placement. Thus, this paper develops a multi-objective approach to define qualitative and quantitative parameters using the fuzzy logic and the Bellman-Zadeh algorithm to determine optimal DG location in distribution systems. Therefore, this study allows the energy supplying companies may guarantee an appropriate selection of their own parameters according to an optimal DG location. This also allows a structural rethinking of the electric utility, diversifying and deploying electrical energy sources at many generation sites, thus providing increased planning flexibilities. These locations are determined both for the distribution system feeders, as well as for nodes inside of a given feeder. Considerations and results described in this paper are part of the Research &amp; Development Program developed by the State Company of Electric Energy (CEEE) and the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Brazil.

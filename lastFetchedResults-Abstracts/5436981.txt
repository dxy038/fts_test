Shipbuilding is a complex systematical work, therefore planning and controlling shipbuilding course is a big system engineering. In order to legitimately plan and control ship construction procedure, we employ process modeling technology, process programming technology and conflict resolution mechanism, which are at the base of the time database. We also apply the Kanban management based on WBS (Work Breakdown Structure). In the display boards, different color reveals the processing state of each division, which help the relevant principals have a objective understanding of the shipbuilding procedure. The theory introduced in present paper aim to realize process planning and time controlling of shipbuilding procedure, and to ensure controlling the productive time will be come true.

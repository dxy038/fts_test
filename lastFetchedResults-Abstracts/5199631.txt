Mean-square practical stability for stochastic large-scale dynamical systems is studied. The vector Lyapunov functions and the basic comparison principle of stochastic systems as well as the decomposition-aggregation method for large-scale systems were used to obtain results for various types of mean-square practical stability of nonlinear stochastic large-scale dynamical systems. The objective is to analyze stochastic large-scale systems in terms of their lower-order subsystems and in terms of their interconnecting structure. These results make it possible to determine the mean-square practical stability of stochastic large-scale dynamical systems by testing the corresponding practical stability of the auxiliary deterministic systems

The objective of this study is the assessment of the accuracy of the operation of three indoor localization platforms based on wireless short range technologies: platform of UWB-based localization, platform of RFID-based localization and domotic platform based on BUSing protocol. The tests of location were performed in a simulation environment whose size was proportional to a real home. A route consisting of a sequence of rooms was defined. Each platform under test was installed in the tested environment, and the predefined route was realized by a volunteer three times, once to test each platform. The platform that presents the best results was those based on BUSing protocol and UWB technology, with an error rate of localization of 4.25%. Taking into account that the application context is the monitoring of elderly, the advantages and disadvantages of the tested platforms were also evaluated.

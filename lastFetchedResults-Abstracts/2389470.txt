This research examines the behavior of soil-reinforced piles and applied loads based on the analytical method and by using the numerical results of FLAC3D software for comparison with the analytical results. The analysis was based on a method called virtual retaining wall, the following into consideration: an imaginary retaining wall that passes the footing edge; the bearing capacity of footing on reinforced soil with piles, which was determined by applying equilibrium between active and passive forces on virtual wall; and a pile row that exists beneath the shallow foundation. To calculate the lateral pile resistance here, an analytical equation was then required. The main objective of this paper is to determine the percentage of applied load on pile. Similarly, the effect of adding pile in various positions relative to the present footing (underpinning) was studied in this research. The various parameters of this study included pile length, vertical distance of pile head to shallow footing, pile distance to center of footing and location of the pile. Finally, the findings were compared with the numerical results of FLAC3D and the formerly presented experimental results. Results show that the analytical method, while being close to other methods is more conservative.

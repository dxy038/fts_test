The objective of this contribution is the optimization of the response of a piezoresistive pressure sensor integrated into a heat spreader for microelectronic applications. Finite element analysis (FEA) calculations are employed to simulate the sensor behavior taking into account mechanical, thermal and electrical effects. The small sensors membrane area (150times150mum<sup>2</sup>) imposed by the heat spreader geometry, requires the use of an ultra thin membrane (thickness less than 1mum) for an optimal sensitivity. SOI technology is used in order to insure a better uniformity over the wafer. A double-side oxidized membrane configuration is analyzed in order to reduce the effects of the residual stress present in the membrane

Progress in the field of structural optimization naturally leads to an increasing number of structural models and optimization algorithms that need to be considered for design. Software architecture is of central importance in the ability to account for the complex links tying new structural models and optimizers. An object-oriented programming pattern for interfacing simulation and optimization codes is described in this article. The concepts of optimization variable, criteria, optimizers and simulation environment are the building blocks of the pattern. The resulting interface is logical, flexible and extensive. It encompasses constrained single or multiple objective formulations with continuous, discrete or mixed design variables. Applications are given for composite laminate design.

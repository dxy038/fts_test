Objective
In a previous study on of polymerization contraction stress determinations of adhesives bonded to dentin a continuous decline of stress was observed after the adhesives had been light-cured. The decline was ascribed to stress relief caused by diffusion into the adhesive layer of water and/or solvents, left in the impregnated dentin surface after drying and/or evaporation in the application procedure. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the contraction stress of adhesives bonded to enamel will not decline after light-curing, based on the assumption that water and/or solvents are more efficiently removed from impregnated enamel surfaces in the drying and/or evaporation step.
Materials and methods

Contraction stress was determined in a tensilometer for three total-etching adhesives Scotchbond multi-purpose, Single bond and One-step plus and four self-etching adhesives Clearfil SE Bond, Clearfil Protect Bond, AdheSE, and Xeno III. The adhesives were placed in a thin layer between a glass plate and a flat dentin or enamel surface pre-treated with phosphoric acid or self-etching primer and light-cured under constrained conditions.
Results

All adhesives bonded to enamel showed a stress decline, but significantly less than for dentin with the exception of two self-etching adhesives. The greatest decline was found for the total-etching adhesive systems bonded to dentin. The presence of hydrophobic monomers in the adhesives had a significant influence on the decline.
Significance

The experiments indicate that fluids are withdrawn from the resin impregnated tooth structures, which may result in small defects in the toothâ€“resin interfaces.

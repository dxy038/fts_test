A robot-computer interaction is presented. Its main objective is that of milling solid shapes and figures that could be presented to blind students. The proposed package is tested on a number of CAD packages. Logic and analog circuits can be easily transformed from the screen into a grooved piece of wood that the trained blind may follow. A nonmatching general scanning approach is implemented through a package called PICTURE MAKER. The instructor or tutor may draw any shape on the screen by using a mouse or keyboard. The resulting illustration may be dumped later to be duplicated on a hard surface to assist in the special education of the blind

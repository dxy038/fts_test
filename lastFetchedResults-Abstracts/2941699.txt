An antenna module suitable for a satellite/indoor wireless interconnect is proposed. The configuration is low cost, unobtrusive and consists of two antennas, one for the transmit band of frequencies and the other for the receive band. Since the module consists of two separate transmit and receive antennas, bidirectional transmission over optical fibre can be easily implemented between the satellite terminal (located at a good reception point) and the proposed indoor base station site. Among other advantages, the optical fibre has low loss, small size and light weight. This paper describes the antenna module and presents its characteristics, including input impedance behaviour and far-field radiation patterns. The current prototype is appropriate for the Australian MobileSat system (transmit frequency band: 1.5450-1.5590 GHz and receive frequency band: 1.6465-1.6505 GHz).

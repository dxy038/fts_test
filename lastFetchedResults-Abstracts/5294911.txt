Power supply voltages continue to migrate to lower nodes to support the current low-power high-performance applications. While some devices can run at lower power supply node, but other devices may not have this capacity. To achieve switching compatibility between these devices, the output of each driver must drive the receivers with compatible inputs. There are many level-shifting scheme used to implement the connection among these devices. Depending on the application needs, some way may be more suitable than other methods. Dual-supply level converter can perform bidirectional level translation in a variety of voltages nodes. Experiments show that dual-supply level converter has low power consumption and a current drive capability. Its propagation delay is short. Open-drain device can be use as up and down conversion, when power is not an important consideration in the application areas.

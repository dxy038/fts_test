This paper considers a multi-objective integrated production-distribution problem (IPDP) for multi-product and multi-production facility with limited capacity vehicles over a multi-period horizon in a two-level supply chain. In order to consider uncertainty of a real supply chain, some fuzzy parameters are considered for costumer demands, machine and labor levels of each manufacturer. The proposed model minimizes total production, inventory and distribution costs and total delivery time, simultaneously and the performance of the proposed model is evaluated on several randomly generated instances. The results show that integrating production and distribution decisions is more efficient than making these two decisions, separately.

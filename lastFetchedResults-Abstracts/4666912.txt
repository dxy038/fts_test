Large installations use different shielded, or EMC, zones to separate regions, such as in the integrated mast onboard naval vessels. Multiple cable transits are being used as a standard decoupling measure between the zones. Cables shields are connected in the cable transits with the objective to short-circuit cable sheath currents to the wall. Measurements have been performed to check the quality of the installation. The test procedure and some measurement results are described. It is shown that the effectiveness of a cable transit can be completely nullified if a single cable is not treated properly.

A precise event detection is a fundamental step in many applications. For instances, moving object detection is a fundamental task for a variety of traffic monitoring applications. Wavelets have been widely used for this purpose. However, The selection of the proper type of mother wavelet strongly affects the results of the analysis and processing. In this paper, the wavelets of the Daubechies family are exploited for extracting the relevant movement information in moving image sequences using 3D wavelet. The proposed algorithm is applied for traffic monitoring systems. The objective and subjective experimental results obtained by applying the wavelet types are compared and interpreted in terms of the wavelet properties and the characteristics of the image sequences. The comparisons show the superior performance of the low order Daubechies wavelets in the presence of noisy images and changing lighting conditions when compared to the application of high order Daubechies wavelets.

We consider queueing systems in which the service rate is the controlled variable. The cost depends on the queue length and selected rate. The objective is to choose the service rate dynamically, based on the state of the system so as to minimize the average cost over an infinite horizon. Six classes, either known in the literature or new, are studied in detail: queueing systems with vacations, single-server queueing systems with and without switching costs, and tandem queueing systems with and without service costs. A novel approach is presented here using fuzzy control to solve these problems. Simulation shows that the approach is efficient and promising, especially in cases where analytical solutions do not exist

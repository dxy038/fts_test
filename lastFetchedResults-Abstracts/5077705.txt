In this paper, evolutionary algorithms are explored with the objective of demonstrating that they offer the most efficient and adequate solution to the Index Selection Problem (ISP). The final target is to develop a self-tuning database system requiring little (or no) intervention from experts in physical design. Following the evaluation of the proposal and the discussion of experimental results, conclusions are made regarding the possibilities presented by evolutionary algorithms for future projects.

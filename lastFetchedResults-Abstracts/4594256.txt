As a key technique in Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) system, Coordinated multi point transmission/reception (CoMP) can mitigate the inter-cell interference, and improve both average and cell-edge throughput. Choosing the proper cooperating cells for CoMP operation is a very important problem in CoMP. In this paper, factors which affect the performance of CoMP are analysed and a dynamic cell selection scheme based on multi-objective decision-making method are proposed. A multi-object decision matrix is created in this scheme to evaluate the effect of different factors on CoMP performance in order to choose the best cooperating cells. The system level simulation results show that our proposed dynamic cell selection scheme, compared with other CoMP schemes, can bring more performance gains.

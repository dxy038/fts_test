Dynamic models of the human trunk have been extensively used to investigate the biomechanics of lower back pain and postural instability in different populations. Despite their diverse applications, previous models rely on intrinsic upper body segment parameters (UBSP), e.g., each segment's mass-inertia characteristics. However, a comprehensive UBSP set allowing state-of-the-art, three-dimensional (3D) dynamic modeling does not exist to date. Therefore, our objective was to establish a UBSP set of all vertebral trunk segments that is accurate and complete. Based on high-resolution, transverse color images, anatomical structures of the Male Visible Human (MVH) were digitally reconstructed via commercial software. Subsequently, we identified the 3D spinal joint and 3D center of mass coordinates, the mass, and the moment of inertia tensor for 24 vertebral trunk segments and 4 upper limb segments (two segments per arm). Since the MVH images are public domain, the parameters are uniquely verifiable and expandable to also include lower limb parameters. To demonstrate the UBSP set's practicality, the parameters were finally implemented in a previously proposed inverse dynamics model of the upper body. Our findings reveal that an accurate and complete UBSP set has been obtained that will be beneficial to (1) systemize thinking in postural control studies; (2) quantify the effect of impact forces on the head and trunk (e.g., during whiplash); (3) suggest population-specific experiments based on theoretical insights into trunk dynamics (e.g., regarding lower back pain); or (4) assess the feasibility of new surgical techniques (e.g., spinal fusion) and neuroprostheses (e.g., after spinal cord injury).

This paper presents a new soft switching bidirectional buck or boost DC-DC converter. Compared to the traditional bidirectional DC-DC converter, the new topology can be used as a buck converter or a boost converter in bidirectional cases for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) and Electrosorb Technology (EST) etc. This new converter has the advantages of simple circuit and control strategy, soft-switching implementation without additional devices, high power density, low cost, light weight and high reliability. The operating principle, theoretical analysis, and design guidelines are provided in this paper. The simulation and the experimental verifications are also presented.

A novel model updating technique is presented such that the parameters in an analytical finite element (FE) model can be updated in a robust way in presence of random errors in measured data and systematic errors in the analytical model. For efficient and robust updating, Taguchi method is applied to the optimization of the objective function, which is defined by the difference between measured and analytical vibration data. As reference data for updating, both cases of using frequency as well as modal data are discussed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, FE models of truss structure and cantilever beam are used for numerical simulations of model updating in presence of random and systematic errors.

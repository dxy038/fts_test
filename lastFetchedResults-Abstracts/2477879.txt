Background and objectives: Because of problems dealing with bioremediation including being time consuming, low efficiency and toxicity to biota, application of advanced oxidation processes with higher efficiency and shorter remediation time have been considered for removal of hydrophobic hydrocarbons from contaminated soils. A great interest has been directed to Fenton oxidation because of its simplicity and high oxidation potential. The objective of this study was to determine the Fenton-like oxidation efficiency for pyrene removal from soil using iron nano oxides and Fe2+. Material and Methods: The H2O2/Fe molar ratios of unadjusted with native Fe content of soil, 10, and 20 H2O2 concentrations of 0 â€“ 500 mM pH 3, 5, and 7 and soil samples containing Fe2+, native iron and iron nano oxides were investigated for removal of 100 mg/kg pyrene according to Taguchi experimental design. Results: Fe2+, H2O2/Fe molar ratio of 20, pH 3 and H2O2 concentration of 500 mM were determined as optimum conditions. Under optimum conditions, S/N ratio increased to 39.322 and the pyrne removal reached to 86 % for Fe2+ and 83 % for Fe3+ respectively, after 2 hours of reaction time and pH 3. Conclusion: Fenton oxidation using iron nano oxides under defined optimum conditions and neutral pH, can be a suitable alternative to conventional Fenton for remediation of soils contaminated with pyrene.

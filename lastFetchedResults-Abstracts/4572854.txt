Systematic design methodologies for wireless transceivers require an efficient design of integrated inductors. Early availability of feasible trade-offs between inductance, quality factor and area, is a key enabler towards the improvement of such design methodologies. This paper introduces such an approach in two steps. First, a Pareto-optimal performance front of integrated inductors is obtained by embedding an electromagnetic simulator into a multi-objective optimization tool. Then, starting from the obtained optimal samples, a surrogate model of the performance front is obtained. Experimental results in a 0.35&#956;m CMOS technology are provided.

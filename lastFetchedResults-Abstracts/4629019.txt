Usability is an important quality attribute for APIs. To create APIs with good usability, appropriate measurement methods are needed. But currently available methods are cost- and time-expensive and the results are not objective and therefore hard to quantify. API design guidelines give a good overview about important usability factors, but lack a scientific basis. When looking at scientific API usability studies, only a very small area of API design has been researched yet. Existing results donÂ´t give enough basis for a good API usability measurement method. In this paper we identify influencing usability factors for the two most common concepts of APIs: classes and methods. We therefore conduct a study with 20 programmers and 2 different API variants and evaluate how differences between the APIs influence usability when instantiating classes and calling methods. The results build a basis for API usability measurement methods and should help design more usable APIs.

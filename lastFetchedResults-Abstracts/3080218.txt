Bidirectional matching (BM) is an effective technique for area-based binocular stereo vision for maintaining one-to-one correspondence, detecting half-occlusions and discarding false matches. This paper presents an extension of BM to trinocular stereo vision and proposes its memory-efficient implementation that maintains locality of memory access and thus enables the use of SIMD instruction sets of CPU for high time-performance. By using this scheme together with several other implementation techniques, 50fps throughput in generating disparity maps of approx. 320 times 240 sizes has been attained with ordinary PC workstations

Although bidirectional parent and child influences
have been incorporated in theoretical models pertaining to
the development of internalizing and externalizing behaviors
in youth, studies have historically focused on the socializing
influence that parents have on their children. This has left
several important research questions unanswered about the
nature of bidirectional parent–child relations across development,
including how these bidirectional effects are related
to different types of child and adolescent psychopathology.
The goal of this special section is to examine some
longstanding issues regarding the nature of bidirectional
parent–child effects across time using a diverse array of
longitudinal datasets. The results from these studies emphasize
the importance of considering bidirectional effects in
developmental psychopathology research, particularly the
often overlooked influence that children and adolescents
have on their parents’ behavior and emotional well-being.
Following these empirical articles, an expert in the field
provides a scholarly commentary designed to outline the
progress that has been made in understanding bidirectional
parent–child effects across development as well as to
propose fruitful areas for future research

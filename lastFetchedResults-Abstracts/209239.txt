Introduction & Objective: Human exposure to environmental
noise increases day to day and noise is currently a very important
stressful factor. One of the common sources of noise is
transportation vehicles. Undesirable impacts of traffic persuaded
governments to set rules for the problem and when civil planners
and road engineers decide to construct highways, they must be
sure that the related standards and rules have been mel. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the rate of noise pollution in crowded
areas of Yasuj.
Materials and Methods: Noise measuring was done by using B&K
Sound Level Meter (model 2230). Noise descriptors (Leq, Max,
Min) were measured for 10 minutes of any hour during daytime
and night in selected areas (11 stations). One station was also
selecfed as reference point and noise measurement was carried
out for the whole week in this station.
Results: Leq was found to be 72±4.4 dB (Max) and 65.4±7 dB
(Min). Recorded maximum and minimum noise was 99.7 dB (at 1718
o'clock) and 34 dB (at 4-5 o'clock), respectively.
Conclusion: Comparing the findings of this study with standard
scales indicates that Yasuj is experiencing high noise pollution

A training program proposed by Brazil at a 1990 International Space Year (ISY) conference is described. The course was inspired by the success of the PRODES deforestation project, which is developing a methodology to map, estimate, and monitor deforested areas in Amazonia. The objective of the course is to train project managers in subregion (state or country level) deforestation assessment using remote sensing, mapping, and geographic information system techniques in the pan-Amazonian region.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

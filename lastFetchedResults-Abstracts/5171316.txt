Robot-assisted rehabilitation can complement conventional rehabilitation after stroke, by increasing the duration and intensity of therapy and providing precise and objective measurements of interaction dynamics and performance. Such information can be used to drive assist-as-needed control strategies or to complement clinical assessments by reconstructing the scores from robot data. This paper presents the ReHapticKnob, a new end-effector-based hand rehabilitation robot with unique sensing and actuation capabilities for therapy of grasping and forearm rotation tasks. A compact design with high stiffness and high-fidelity instrumentation is presented, allowing for precise assessment and dynamic interaction. The device has two degrees of freedom (DOF), allowing independent control of hand opening/closing and forearm rotation. Each degree of freedom is equipped with a brake to allow independent training of either DOF or to assess isometric force through the two six-axis force/torque sensors located beneath the exchangeable finger fixations. The design, safety features and performance evaluation of the device are discussed and preliminary results from a study on grasping performed with healthy subjects are presented.

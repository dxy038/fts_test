The objective of the paper is to apply the concept of exact stochastic feedback linearization to design a nonlinear excitation controller for a single machine-infinite bus power system. Simulations are carried out and the performance of the proposed controller is compared to a well known existing controller (PSS). The results confirm that the proposed control design increases the stability margin of the system, while maintaining good performance in the presence of major disturbances

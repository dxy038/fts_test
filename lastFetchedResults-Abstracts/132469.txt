Objective: Cultivation of Pneumocystis carinii on Vero and MRC-5 cell lines and use of RBK Cell in Iran
Materials and Methods: Six Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Razi Vaccine Institute were immunosuppressed using methylprednisolone 40 mg/kg subcutaneously, weekly, for 8 weeks. The animals were maintained under near-sterile conditions to prevent secondary bacterial and fungal infection. After sacrifice, the lungs were removed and homogenate was prepared. Then relative purification of trophozoite occurred. The tissue culture flasks were inoculated with trophozoite.
Results: Five days after incubation 3, 3 and 3.75 fold respectively, increased in Vero, MRC-5 and PBK.
Conclusion: This study can be a starting point for developing an extraction, cultivation and purification method of Pneumocystis carinii in Iran.

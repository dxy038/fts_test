A novel bidirectional ac-dc MOSFET converter for energy storage system applications is proposed in this paper. The reverse recovery dissipation of the active switch is greatly reduced because the current does not flow through the body diode of power MOSFET. Detailed power stage operating principles and energy transfer mechanism are described. With magnetic integration, the power density is significantly increased while system size and cost are reduced. An admittance compensated quasi-proportional-resonant controller is adopted to ensure high power quality and precision power flow control. A 1-kW experimental prototype has been designed and implemented to validate the operation and performance of the circuit.

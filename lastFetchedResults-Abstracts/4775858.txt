Object oriented systems are particularly difficult to comprehend because of the distribution of functionality and polymorphism which limits the effectiveness of conventional static analysis methods. The paper proposes a dynamic analysis approach using animation to simulate the use cases in a financial application system. The objective is to offer maintenance programmers a means of familiarizing themselves with complex C++ code while at the same time validating the correctness of the code. For this purpose, control flow slicing and concept lattices are used

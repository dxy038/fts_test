Common variable speed drives usually do not feature regenerative braking. The energy produced during deceleration is dissipated through braking resistors. In this paper, a bidirectional converter designed for use with variable speed drives, adding the capability of regenerative braking, is presented. Hardware design and control algorithms are analyzed and comparison with similar proposals is made. Finally, simulation verification and experimental results are presented.

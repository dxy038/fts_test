The development of intelligent microgrids with renewable energy sources increased significantly nowadays. The present paper examines and compares analog and digital control of a bidirectional phase shift converter in order to find out which is best suited to be used in intelligent microgrid applications. New small signal models for the direct and reverse power flow transfer modes of the converter were also developed in order to determine the compensation transfer functions. The study uses IIR filters for the implementation of the digital control loops.

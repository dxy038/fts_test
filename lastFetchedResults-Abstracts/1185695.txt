The study of the effect of bonding between concrete and composite plates, when epoxy adhesive is used, is the objective of this paper. The results of an analytical and experimental study on the behavior of concrete blocks joined with carbonâ€“fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates are discussed in this paper. For it, several specimens were tested through adherence tests. Numerical analyses included nonlinear finite element modeling incorporating a damage material model for concrete. In general, good correlations were obtained between the experimental and the numerical results.

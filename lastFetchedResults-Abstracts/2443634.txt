The objective of this paper is to optimize the process parameters by combined approach of  VIKOR and Entropy weight measurement method during Electrical discharge machining (EDM) process of Al-18wt.%SiCp metal matrix composite (MMC). The central composite design (CCD) method is considered to evaluate the effect of three process parameters; namely pulse on time (Ton), peak current (Ip) and flushing pressure (Fp) on the responses like material removal rate (MRR), tool wear rate (TWR), Radial over cut (ROC) and surface roughness (Ra). The Entropy weight measurement method evaluates the individual weights of each response and, using VIKOR method, the multi-objective responses are optimized to get a single numerical index known as VIKOR Index. Then the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique is used to determine the significance of the process parameters on the VIKOR Index. Finally, the result of the VIKOR Indexed is validated by conformation test using the liner mathematical model equation develop by responses surface methodology to identify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

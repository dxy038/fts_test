In this article the effect of adding motion cues to a car simulation on human operator behavior and simulator acceptance was researched. This was done by performing a car driving experiment, in which three different settings of the classical linear washout algorithm were used. These settings were: no motion, no tilt-coordination and full motion. Objective measures on human control input and driving performance showed that the addition of motion cues positively affected the driving behavior and improved performance. Subjects also subjectively preferred the conditions where all motion cues were present over the conditions without the presence of motion cues.

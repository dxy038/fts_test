The objective of this article is to study gas temperature estimation in a partially filled rotating
cylinder. From the measured temperatures on the shell, an inverse analysis is presented for
estimating the gas temperature in an arbitrary cross-section of the aforementioned system. A
finite-volume method is employed to solve the direct problem. By minimizing the objective
function, a hybrid effective algorithm, which contains a local optimization algorithm, is adopted
to estimate the unknown parameter. The measured data are simulated by adding random errors to
the exact solution. The effects of measurement errors on the accuracy of the inverse analysis are
investigated. Two optimization algorithms are used in determination of the gas temperature. The
conjugate gradient method is found to be better than the Levenberg-Marquardt method, since
the former produces more accurate results for the same measurement errors. A good agreement
between the exact value and the estimated result has been observed for both algorithms.

Selecting a procurement strategy for construction projects is inherently subjective. The decision is often intuitively based on the previous experience and knowledge of the decision maker. An objective-subjective procurement selection method is proposed. The method takes into account the need to have an objective base for strategy comparison through the use of multiattribute utility technology. Allowing the decision maker to assign importance ratings for the selection criteria also accommodates individual preferences and project specificities. The analytical hierarchical process based importance ratings assignment method improves both the objectivity and the reliability of the assessment. Applications in real cases suggest positive potential use of the method.

Objective: In Nigeria, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in majority of the regions. Late presentation has also been reported for about four decades. This study assessed the women's risk factors for breast cancer and predictive factors for the practice of breast examinations. The findings will be of help in enhancing early detection of the disease and reducing mortality from the disease. Methods: Utilizing a multi-stage sampling method, 420 women were selected at Akinyele Local government area of Ibadan. Data was collected with questionnaire. The risk factor was evaluated using the breast cancer risk assessment tool based on the Gail model. Six demographic factors, plus four covariates: knowledge of BSE/CBE, knowledge of the cause of, symptoms and signs of and treatment of breast cancer, were regressed against two dependent variables of practice of BSE and CBE using linear regression and binary logistic analyses respectively. Results: Only 386 questionnaires properly filled were analyzed. The mean age of respondents was 37.3 (SD = 13.1) years. They were of low educational status and were mostly traders and married. Only 190 of the women fulfilled the criteria for assessment with the Gail model. Most of the women, 180 (94.7%), had five years and 184 (96.8%) had lifetime risks lower than that of the average woman of the same age. Four significant predictors of BSE were marital status (p = 0.004), educational status (p = 0.018), knowledge of treatment of breast cancer (p = 0.029) and knowledge of BSE/CBE (p = 0.0001) while no formal education status and being a farmer were the only significant predictors of CBE. Conclusions: The findings are useful for planning interventional studies to enhance early detection in a low resource country.

Color filter array (CFA) used in CCD and CMOS-sensor to acquire color images determinate the end quality of the image. In this paper the question of the requirements for the CFA to provide both high sensitivity and resolution is discussed. By optimizing the key parameters of the CFA new filters are obtained. The computer simulation proved that proposed CFA outperform known CFA by meanings of objective and subjective image quality.

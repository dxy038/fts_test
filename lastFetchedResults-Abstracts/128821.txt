Background&Objective: Major 13 thalassemia is the most common form of anaemia, which has a relatively high prevalancy especially in the northern part of the country one of this disease side effect the hearing abnormality. This study has been carried out in Dorgan for the determination of the hearing level of 13 thalassemic patieints, and its relation with the level of serum ferritin, the rate and the duration of blood transussion and dyspheral.
Materials&Methods: In this study 95 patients with major 13 thalassemia have been studied for the rate of hearing level. The variation parameter include age, gender, ferritin level, the rate and duration of disferal consumption. Aduiometry, tempanometry and physical examination carried out on all the patients. The findings from this research gathered and were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software.
Results: 95 patients (190 ears) with age 3-29 year of old were gone under this study and only 72 ears had the thershold over 15 decibell, from this 43.9% were from sensorineural type of hearing. The $0% of ears's thempograms were type A. the results from this study showed that there is a meaningful statistical correlation between the hearing loss and serum ferritin level. The rate of dyspheral consumption, in each time and its duration (P<0.05).
Conclusion: This study showed that high serum ferritin level and the increased length of dyspheral consumption lead to the hearing loss in major (3 thalassemia, therefore clinical examination of hearing interrally has to be carried out.

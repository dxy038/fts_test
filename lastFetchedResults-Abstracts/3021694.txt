This paper presents a process combining range and intensity based techniques, in order to get better 3D models than those obtained using these techniques separately. The procedure needs an initial estimation for internal and external camera parameters for two or more intensity images. The technique uses passive triangulation to refine initial camera calibrations and ensure a good registration of range and video data sets. Afterwards, corresponding points from the intensity images are triangulated and introduced in the original range cloud of points. The objective is to complete the models in areas where data is missing or to increase the resolution in areas of high interest and 3D contents.

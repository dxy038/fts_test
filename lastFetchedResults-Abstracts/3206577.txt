This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) approach for the dc-dc boost converter. Based on a hybrid model of the converter suitable for both continuous and discontinuous conduction mode an objective function is formulated, which is to be minimized. The proposed MPC scheme, utilized as a voltage-mode controller, achieves regulation of the output voltage to its reference, without requiring a subsequent current control loop. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the merits of the proposed control methodology, which include fast transient response and robustness.

In this paper, a high performance de-interlacing algorithm is proposed to reduce the artifact effects produced by interlaced scanning TV systems. In the proposed algorithm, a moving-stationary detector is presented to determine where the missing pixels belong to moving or stationary region. If the missing pixel belongs to the stationary region, the temporal-wise interpolation is adopted; otherwise, the spatial-temporal-wise interpolation is applied. In addition, the proposed algorithm has simple operations chiefly involves addition and subtraction. This simple computation conducts the proposed algorithm to real-time applications efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the subjective and objective qualities compared with other de-interlacing algorithms.

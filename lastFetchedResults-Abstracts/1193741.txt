Several experimental techniques were used to characterise steel rebars embedded in concrete for 70 years and exposed to mountain weather conditions in a sulphur-containing environment. The research has the objective of understanding the stages of rusting of steel in concrete in a non-conventional environment. Such understanding would provide information concerning the nature of the corrosion products formed on the steel rebars in order to make accurate predictions by means of analytical models.

Objectives
The objective of this study was to compare the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) among U.S adults during the years 1988 to 1994 with that among U.S. adults during the years 1999 to 2002.
Background

A decline in deaths as the result of CHD has been reported. Data about changes in actual risk of developing CHD among U.S. adults are sparse.
Methods

Data for noninstitutionalized U.S. residents ages 20 to 79 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)-III (1988 to 1994) or NHANES 1999 to 2002 were examined to compute 10-year risk of developing CHD using modified Framingham risk score, as adopted by the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III.
Results

Most participants in both surveys had a low (<10%) 10-year risk of developing CHD. The proportion of participants at intermediate (10% to 20%) and high (>20%) 10-year risk of developing CHD also was similar.
Conclusions

Data from national surveys conducted approximately a decade apart showed no appreciable difference in the distribution of 10-year risk of developing CHD. Greater efforts are needed to reduce the risk of developing CHD among U.S. adults.

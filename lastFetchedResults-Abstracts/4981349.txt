Multilevel inverters have been used widely because of their high power capability, lower output harmonics and lower commutation losses and so on. Their main disadvantage is their complexity, requiring a great number of power devices and complex control method. In this paper, a new topology is proposed based on H-bridge cascaded inverter. The new topology produces a significant reduction in the number of power devices and simply topology structure using a bidirectional auxiliary switch. A new step pulse PWM method is proposed for the new topology using selective harmonic elimination pulse-width modulation (SHE-PWM) to eliminate lower order harmonics. Lastly, an experimental 9-level voltage-source inverter system is built to verify the topology and PWM control method.

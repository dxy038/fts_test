Background/Objective: This study was performed to report the ultrasonoqraphic finding and final diagnosis of a group of primary amenorrhea patients.
Patients and Methods: Pelvic ultrasonography (US) was employed as the first diagnostic modality to evaluate primary amenorrhea in 53 patients who were admitted to gynecology or endocrinology clinics at Taleghani hospital from 2002 to 2006. US was based upon the presence or absence of the uterus and ovaries and any other abnormal sonographic findings. Karyotype analysis was also performed for all the patients.
Results: The uterus was not visualized in 16 (30%) patients: due to mullerian agenesis in 14 and testicular feminization and true hermaphroditism in two other patients. Mullerian anomalies with hematometrocolpos or hematometra were seen in 5 (9%) patients. Thirty-two (60%) patients had a normal or hypoplastic uterus. Pelvic US showed that ovaries were in normal limits in 39 (73%) patients; they were not visible in 9 patients. The report of pelvic US was not conclusive in 3 patients; 2 had an ovarian tumor or cyst. Irrespective of the presence or absence of the uterus, all patients with visible ovaries (except one) had a normal karyotype. Conclusion: US of the pelvis can be the initial diagnostic modality. Based on US findings, we can make decision for further work ups; there is no need to perform all paraclinical investigations for each patient.

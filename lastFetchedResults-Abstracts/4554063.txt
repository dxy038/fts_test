The recent development in the field of Web services technology has transformed the software industry radically by integrating a wide range of web users, vendors, and enterprise applications worldwide. There are various research initiatives made in Web services security which is an emerging trend in the field of Web services technology for the development of a large variety of enterprise applications. However, none of the initiatives made an attempt for the development of web applications intended for the academic institutions using integrated Web services technology. Extensive studies reveal that there is no attempt made so far to provide multi-level security for such web applications. The main objective of this paper is to propose a generic architecture called Multi-Level Secure Architecture (MLSA) exclusively for the academic institutions that provides integrated web services in a secured manner. In addition, MLSA has been designed to integrate as well as distribute a variety of web services to the users with multi-level security.

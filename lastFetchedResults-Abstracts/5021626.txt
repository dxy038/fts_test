Permanent magnet synchronous machines can be designed to obtain high efficiency and high torque density. Recently, there has been intense interest in the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) to design either part or all of the machine. In this work a highly structured approach to PMSM design which encompasses the machine and the machine control is considered. The number of parameters to be determined is over twice that of most previous work. The procedure set forth is explored for both single and multi-objective optimizations

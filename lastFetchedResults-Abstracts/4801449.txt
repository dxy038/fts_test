The virtual reference feedback tuning (VRFT) is a data based method for the design of feedback controllers. In previous papers, the VRFT has been presented for the solution of the one degree of freedom model-reference control problem in which the objective is to shape the I/O transfer function of the control system. In this paper, the VRFT approach is extended so that it can be used for the shaping of the sensitivity function

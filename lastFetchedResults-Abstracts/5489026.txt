In accordance with the familiar power quality problem, such as voltage sag, flicker, harmonic suppression and short circuit fault, this paper designed a novel series voltage quality regulator in medium voltage for the multiple objective control basing on the cascaded multilevel H-bridge method, and analysis its working principle in detail. A Short-circuit current limiter is designed in this paper, the control strategy multiple objective control is proposed as well. The simulation model is established by PSCAD/EMTDC. Finally, the rationality of the main circuit topology design is tested through low-voltage experiment. The simulation result and the text show that the design of voltage regulator and the control strategy this paper proposed can compensate the voltage feasibly and efficiently.

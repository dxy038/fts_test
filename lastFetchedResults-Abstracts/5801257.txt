The objective of the research described is to develop an integrated process planning and scheduling system of machine products, aiming at realizing flexible production control in holonic manufacturing systems. The basic architecture of the holonic manufacturing system is discussed from the viewpoint of the integration of the process planning and the scheduling systems. Procedures are proposed to select suitable machining sequences of machining features and suitable sequences of machining equipment, taking into consideration future schedules of machining equipment. A combined method of genetic algorithm and dynamic programming is applied to selection of the machining sequence and the sequence of the machining equipment

Introduction: MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs that inhibit protein expression by posttranscriptional inhibition. They are fundamental regulators of diverse cellular processes; whose deregulation contributes to many human diseases including cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the genes encoding miRNAs can alter miRNA expression and may influence cancer risk.
Objective: To determine the relationship between miR-423 (rs6505162 C > A) polymorphism and women breast cancer risk.
Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, the genotypes of 353 women with breast cancer and 353 healthy women were compared. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. The miR-423 rs6505162 C > A polymorphism was determined by PCR-RFLP using RsaI enzyme. The data analysis was performed using the MedCalc software. 
Results: The prevalence rates of genotype frequencies of the CC, CA and AA were 60.34%, 35.41% and 4.24%, respectively, in those with breast cancer, whilst in controls were 51%, 38.81% and 10.20%, respectively. The AA genotype and A allele of rs6505162 C > A had a decreased risk to develop breast cancer (OR=0.35; 95%CI 0.18-0.66; P=0.001; OR=0.66; 95%CI 0.52-0.85; P=0.00, respectively). 
Conclusion: our data demonstrated that miR-423 rs6505162 should be a protective factor for breast cancer. Further studies involving different ethnicities are required to verify our conclusion.

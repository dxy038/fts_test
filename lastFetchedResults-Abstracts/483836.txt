Background and Objective: There are different methods to improve sperm parmeters including swim up.Sperm washing is a basic step in This method during 2007. It seems that two times w ashing cause bether result especially in high viscosity sample and sample it is not liqufy. The aim of this study is to compare the single and double washing swim up method on sperm parameters.
Materials and Methods: This study was carried out on 50 semen samples referred to Fatemeh- Alzahra infertility center of Babol University of Medical Sciences during 2007. Semen samples had the following characteristics: volume 2-5ml, count>20 million/ml, motility>50% and normal morphology>14%. Sampling condition were completely considered. Sperm parameter analysis carried out after two times washing. Data entered to SPSS-10 and analyzed by repeated measurement and paired T-Test and p-value<0.05 considered statistically significant.
Results: Semen volume mean was 4.050Â±1.006. Mean sperm motility in one and two times washings increased (P<0.05), but there was not statistically significant differences between one and two times washing. In grading analysis, by increasing the washing, grade III, IV increase and grade I decrease (P<0.05). Sperm morphology mean increased with washing but it is not statistically different between one and two times washing.
Conclusion: This study showed that swim up method is effective method for sperm preparation and two times washing cause recuperation of sperm parameters

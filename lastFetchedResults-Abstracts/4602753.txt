There are many examples of natural processes in which a substance must travel a trajectory, avoiding obstacles to reach an objective, using a mechanism for orientation and navigation. Such mechanism can be implemented using attraction by autowaves. The linear theory [1],[3],[6] lets to predict the conditions in which a reaction-diffusion system [1]-[12] has a raising oscillating behavior in the initial phase. In this paper a model is described for the production of autowaves [2],[4],[7]-[10], in agreement with the linear theory. Some results of simulation obtained with the model are shown.

An altered sleep pattern is often one of the general symptoms experienced by people with dementia. The quantity and quality of sleep may be a reflection of their dementia condition and affect the quality of life for people with dementia. In this paper we present our research in using sensor based technology for a telecare service to monitor daily activities over a period of three months for one healthy elderly client and one client with early dementia using assistive technology. We analyze their sleep patterns, propose a set of measures to assess the quantity and quality of sleep, and visualize the sleep patterns for a telecare service provider and carers to support users with dementia. Results show that people with early dementia have more alternations of sleep-wake cycles than healthy elderly people, and assistive technology can provide objective and ubiquitous monitoring of sleep patterns for health care purposes.

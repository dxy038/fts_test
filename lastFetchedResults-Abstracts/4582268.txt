In systems with regenerative loads, bidirectional converters are used in order to manage the power flow between the sources and the loads. This paper is focused in the dynamic performance of the Synchronous Buck converter applied to Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) regenerative power systems. Some simple design rules are given in order to reach the best dynamic performance in the system, regardless of the power flow direction.

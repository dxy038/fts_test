The objective of this work is to investigate the accuracyof the Adeline lighting software in simulating the illuminance distribution from
daylighting and the electrical lighting consumption of an existing atrium building. The case study is an enclosed atrium space equipped
with an automatic on=o2 lighting control system and roofed by a skylight made of several glazing systems. Field monitoring of the atrium
space was conducted during summer and winter and included measurements of horizontal indoor and outdoor illuminance, solar radiation
and electrical lighting system time-of-use. The computer simulation included the creation of one simple and one complex computer model
used to simulate the daylighting performance of the atrium space. The software accuracy was evaluated based on comparisons between
the predicted and the on-site measured illuminance distribution and lighting energyconsumption.

The main problem in performance-based structures is the extremely high
computational demand of time-history analyses. In this paper, an ecient framework
is developed for solving the performance-based multi-objective optimal design problem
considering the initial cost and the seismic damage cost of steel moment-frame structures.
The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is employed as the optimization
algorithm to search the Pareto optimal solutions. For improving the time eciency of
the solution algorithm, the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is utilized
as the meta-model for tness approximation, and a specic evolution control scheme is
developed. In this scheme, in order to determine which individuals should be evaluated
using the original tness function and which by the meta-model, the Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM)
clustering algorithm is used to choose the competent individuals rather than choosing
the individuals randomly. Moreover, the computational burden of time history analyses
is decreased through a particular wavelet analysis procedure. The constraints of the
optimization problem are considered in accordance with the FEMA codes. The results
obtained from numerical application of the proposed framework demonstrate its capabilities
in solving the present multi-objective optimization problem.

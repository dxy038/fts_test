Monocrotophos is the single largest selling agrochemical in India. Sensitive biomarkers to study the genotoxic effects caused by monocrotophos in aquatic organisms, especially fish, are lacking. The fish used in this study are Tilapia mossambica, which are edible, commercially valuable and distributed all over India. The objective of this study was to study DNA strand breaks induced by monocrotophos in T. mossambica in vivo using single-cell micro gel electrophoresis/comet assay. Tilapia were treated orally with 0.313, 0.625, 1.25, 1.875, 2.5, 3.125, 3.75 and 4.375 ppm of monocrotophos and the assay was performed on nucleated erythrocytes after 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. A significant increase in mean comet tail-length (5.21–7.46 μm), indicating DNA damage, was observed at all the doses with monocrotophos when compared to controls (3.36 μm). The mean tail-length showed a dose-related increase and time-dependent decrease. The maximum increase in mean comet tail-length was observed at 24 h. Relative to these effects, reductions in mean comet tail-length were seen at 48 and 72 h. By 96 h, values had returned to control levels at all doses, indicating repair of the damaged DNA and/or loss of heavily damaged cells. The study reveals that the comet assay is a sensitive and rapid method to detect genotoxicity of monocrotophos and other environmental pollutants in sentinel species.

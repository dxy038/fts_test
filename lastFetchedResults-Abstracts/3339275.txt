Reconfiguration is an economic and appropriate method for minimizing power loss, improving power quality and increasing security and reliability of distribution system. By implementation of the smart infrastructure in distribution system, online reconfiguration is a suitable control tool in normal and abnormal conditions. This paper presents a heuristic method for real time multi objective reconfiguration based on fuzzy set objectives. In this method the number of switching operation is minimized and, hence, the search space and computational time are reduced. In another part of the work, Enhanced Genetic Algorithm (EGA) is used to obtain more precise solution and then these two methods are compared.

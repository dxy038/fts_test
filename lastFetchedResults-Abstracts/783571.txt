Objective To investigate the contribution
of processing speed in the prediction of various
domains of outcome in psychosis. Method Data were
drawn from the UK700 Case Management Trial of 708
patients with chronic psychotic illness. Regression
analyses were applied to investigate cross-sectional
and longitudinal associations between processing
speed at baseline and measures of service use, social
outcome and subjective outcome, taking into account
current psychopathology and adjusting for baseline
values of the outcome measure. Results Cross-sectionally,
processing speed was associated with all
three domains of outcome, although only associations
in the social and subjective outcome domain
remained significant after controlling for psychopathology
and the effects differed between and within
domains of outcome. Prospectively, only the subjective
outcome measure of number of met and unmet
needs (CAN) was weakly associated with baseline
neurocognitive performance after adjustment for
baseline needs. Other associations disappeared after
adjustment for the baseline measure of outcome and/
or baseline psychopathology. Conclusion The finding
of weak cross-sectional associations in the absence of
specific and unconfounded longitudinal associations
suggests that processing speed is an independent
dimension of disease severity rather than a causal
factor impacting on social outcome. Nevertheless,
longitudinal change in patient reported needs may be
weakly sensitive to baseline cognitive impairment

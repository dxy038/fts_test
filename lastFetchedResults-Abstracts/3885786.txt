This paper is one of a series prepared for use in Current Operational Problems (COPs) forums with the goal of focusing the attention of the industry on high priority problems faced by those who are involved in the actual operation of power systems. The following five ``short note reports´´ provide viewpoints on human factors considerations in electric utility dispatch control centers. The short notes focus on human factors from the points of view of power system operation information management, information presentation, and stress indentification and alleviation. A common denominator in the first four short note papers is stress in system operations. The fifth paper discusses what to do to overcome stressful situations in system operations. The short note reports presented here are intended to clarify the nature of operational concerns and problems. It is the objective of COPs forums to solicit discussion and stimulate others to devise responsive solutions.

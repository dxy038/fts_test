The petrochemical industry makes environmental impact and land suitability assessment is important for the petrochemical industry. The objective of this research is to develop a model to analyze the land suitability and site selection for petrochemical idusrty through a spatial-geographical study and environmental palnning and management approach. To this purpose, the land suitability and site selection were performed using the PROMETHEE II and ELECTERE III methods in combination with GIS. These methods were used to undertake the study objective in three stages. Firstly, a review of the literature led to the formulation of analytic land suitability importance for site selection of petrochemical idusrty. Secondly, the major factors influencing the identification of suitable locations for petrochemical idusrty were identified using experts. The outranking methods were used to determine final zoning map. The final zoning map shows about 16% ( 45.207 Km2) by PROMETHEE II and 10% ( 29.207 Km2) by ELECTERE III is suitable for development of petrochemical industry. Sensitivity analysis shows suitable area is consistent with each of input factors in the model. So, this model is suitable to analyze land suitability and site selection for petrochemical idusrty.

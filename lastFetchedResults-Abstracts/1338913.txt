Our objective was to compare the invasiveness of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and multiport laparoscopic surgery (MLS) for ovariectomy in 5 standing healthy adult Thoroughbred mares. First, laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed by SILS or by MLS on the right paralumbar fossa region in a standing mare. One month after surgery, ovariectomy by the other method was performed on the left side. For surgery evaluation, the surgical time, length of incision, and amount of lidocaine used were recorded and compared between SILS and MLS. Physical examination (body temperature, heart rate, and respiration rate) and hematology (number of leukocytes and hematocrit) were performed before surgery and every day for 7 days after surgery. Similarly, the degrees of swelling, heat, pain, and incisional wound healing were evaluated (grades1-4). The length of incision and amount of local anesthetic for SILS were significantly less than those for MLS. Moreover, the scores for swelling, heat, and pain in the SILS group tended to be lower than those in the MLS group for several days after surgery. We concluded that SILS was less invasive than MLS and is therefore useful for ovariectomy in mares.

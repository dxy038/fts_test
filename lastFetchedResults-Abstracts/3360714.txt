Local dc distribution systems or dc nanogrids for residential and commercial buildings are growing popular due to the increased focus on energy savings. Using low-voltage dc for the nanogrid provides various advantages such as easier integration with renewable sources and battery banks, increased savings, etc. Future systems would use renewable sources and storage devices to become self-sufficient in generation with bare minimum consumption from the grid. The objective of this paper is to develop an energy management system (EMS) to provide uninterrupted power supply to the dc loads and achieve self-sufficiency by minimizing grid power consumption. This is achieved by developing a control scheme for a cascaded two-stage bidirectional converter interface between the nanogrid and the ac distribution network. In addition, an empirical relation for power flow through the converter is obtained, and an optimal capacitor link voltage range is derived to achieve power transfer between rated limits. The efficacy of the proposed control algorithm for the EMS is analyzed and proved to be well suited for the self-sustained dc nanogrid. A 5-kVA prototype of the converter is designed and developed in hardware, and the system operation is verified with experimental results.

Bidirectional beam propagation method is modified to describe wave field interference in laser cavity with multiple quantum wells. Properties of optical modes are found numerically for cylindrical vertical cavity surface emitting laser with above threshold e-beam pumping and external mirror. The stability limits of single-mode operation are determined.

The demand to detect coating stealth targets has presented serious challenges to the design of conventional detectors illuminating targets with electromagnetic waves, since the objective of the coating stealth technology is to reduce the radar cross section (RCS) of targets by absorbing the incident energy and reducing the reflected energy. The research of detecting coating stealth metal target on the ground by means of millimeter-wave (MMW) radiometer is carried out in this paper. The methodology is described in detail based on both the analysis to the operation principles of radiometer and the interpretation to radiation characteristics of coating stealth metal target which is under various conditions. And at the same time, some theoretical results are also given. Furthermore, a series of simulative detection experiments are conducted on the basis of the fabrication of a total-power radiometer operating at 3 mm band. Ultimately, the experiment results are presented and analyzed to demonstrate the significance of this methodology.

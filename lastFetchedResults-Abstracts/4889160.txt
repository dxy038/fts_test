The primary motive for large transmit array of parabolic reflectors, also known as uplink array, was to explore alternate methods in order to replace the large 70m antennas of deep space network (DSN) such that the core capability for emergency support to a troubled spacecraft in deep space is preserved. Given that the Uplink Array is a new technology, the focus has always been on its feasibility and phase calibration techniques, which by itself is quite a challenge. It would be interesting to examine, however, what else could be accomplished by the uplink array capability other than the emergency support to a troubled spacecraft in deep space. Although the uplink array calibration and demonstration for proof of concept is still underway at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), knowledge of various potential meaningful application scenarios as well as operation concepts of uplink array is equally important to better understand and fine tune the high level architectural requirements of this big evolving system of systems. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to discuss a few application scenarios and the corresponding operation concepts, such as lunar positioning system, high EIRP uplink and the synergies with solar system radar, and high power RF beams

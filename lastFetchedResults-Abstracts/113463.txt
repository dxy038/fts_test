The purpose of this paper is to optimize the preliminary selection, sizing and placement of hydraulic devices in a pipeline system in order to control its transient response. A global optimal solution is sought using both genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) approaches involving an unknown combination of hydraulic devices to cope effectively with water hammer conditions. In this exploratory study, three simple objective functions are considered: (1) to minimize the maximum head; (2) to maximize the minimum head; and (3) to minimize the difference between the maximum head and minimum head in the system. Several case studies are tested numerically using different protection strategies. This study shows that the integration of a GA or PSO with a transient analysis technique can improve the search for hydraulic protection devices in a pipe network. This study also shows that the selection of an optimum protection strategy is an integrated problem, involving consideration of loading conditions, device and system characteristics, and protection strategy. Significantly, simpler transient control strategies are often found to perform better than more complex ones.

The paper gives a succinct but comprehensive overview of an experimental set-up, salient features and initial results of a satellite downlink propagation experiment at 40 GHz and referred to propagation and communication-related results. The global objective of the research aims at a better understanding of dynamic fading and C/N<sub>0</sub> ratios, whether due to cloud attenuation and its variability, or to rain plus tropospheric (clear air) scintillations and sky temperature fluctuations

The positioning of sensors in Wireless Sensor Networks WSNs affect coverage, communication cost and resource management. The effectiveness of these networks is determined to a large extent by the coverage provided by the sensor deployment. Coverage is an important optimization objective in WSN deployments. Sensor positioning alludes to the capabilities of WSNs to `adapt´ and `respond´, in order to provide an unobtrusive service. In this paper we propose a distributed self-organizing deployment scheme for WSN to maximize coverage of a randomly deployed network. Our scheme is completely distributed and self-adaptive. It requires a node to posses only the local information and is being able to transparently encompass several modes of operations. A node explores an uncovered region around itself. It uses this heuristic to move in the direction where the FoI is uncovered. This proposed technique performs consistently to suit the pervasive needs of an application with centralized [1] and decentralized control for deployment. Extensive simulation results and their comparison with other distributed algorithms show that the performance of D-UREA is efficient with respect to communication and computation.

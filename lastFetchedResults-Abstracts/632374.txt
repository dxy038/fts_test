Microorganisms adhere to non-living material or living tissue, and form biofilms made up of extracellular polymers/slime.
Biofilm-associated microorganisms behave differently from free-floating bacteria with respect to growth rates and ability
to resist antimicrobial treatments and therefore pose a public health problem. The objective of this study is to detect the
prevalence of biofilm producers among Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens, and
to study their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The study was carried out from October 2009 to March 2010, at the
Department of Microbiology, Army Medical College/ National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST),
Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Clinical specimens were received from various wards of a tertiary care hospital. These were dealt
by standard microbiological procedures. Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria isolated were subjected to biofilm
detection by congo red agar method (CRA). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of those isolates, which showed positive
results (slime production), was done according to the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique. A total of 150 isolates were
tested for the production of biofilm/slime. Among them, 81 isolates showed positive results. From these 81, 51 were
Gram positive and 30 were Gram negative. All the 81(54%) slime producers showed reduced susceptibility to majority of
antibiotics. Bacterial biofilms are an important virulence factor associated with chronic nosocomial infection. Detection of
biofilm forming organisms can help in appropriate antibiotic choice.

A technique is proposed for tuning stabilizers in order to enhance the electromechanical transient behavior of power systems. Their parameters are assessed through solving an objective function based on eigenvaluesÂ´ second order sensitivities subject to nonlinear constraints that indirectly take into account power system security considerations. Two different solution methods are attempted to solve the problem. Two power systems with embedded FACTS devices are used to test the performance of the technique; results show the feasibility of this one.

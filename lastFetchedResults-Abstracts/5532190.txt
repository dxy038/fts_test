The NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) Facility objective is to identify potential defects in flight software using independent analysis techniques. This paper describes the tailored IV&amp;V techniques that have been developed in support of critical interactions on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) project, scheduled to launch in November, 2011. The IV&amp;V techniques for interface analysis use independently developed sequence diagrams of critical scenarios. The results from these analyses have had a positive impact on the requirements flow down, consistency amongst MSL requirements and identification of missing requirements. The results of these analyses and the positive impact to the MSL project are provided.

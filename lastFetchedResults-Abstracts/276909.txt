Joint kinematics and contact mechanics dictate the success of current total knee replacement (TKR) devices. Efficient computer models present an effective way of evaluating these characteristics. Predicted contact stress and area due to articulations at the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral interfaces indicate potential clinical performance. Previous finite element (FE) knee models have generally been used to predict contact stresses and/or areas during static or quasi-static loading conditions. Explicit dynamic FE analyses have recently been used to efficiently predict TKR kinematics and contact mechanics during dynamic loading conditions. The objective of this study was to develop and experimentally validate an explicit FE TKR model that incorporates tibio-femoral and patello-femoral articulations. For computational efficiency, we developed rigid body analyses that can reasonably reproduce the kinematics, contact pressure distribution, and contact area of a fully deformable system.
Results from the deformable model showed that the patello-femoral and tibio-femoral kinematics were in good agreement with experimental knee simulator measurements. Kinematic results from the rigid body analyses were nearly identical to those from the fully deformable model, and the contact pressure and contact area correlation was acceptable given the great reduction in analysis time. Component mesh density studied had little effect on the predicted kinematics, particularly for the patellar component, and small effects on the predicted contact pressure and area. These analyses have shown that, at low computational cost, a force-control dynamic simulation of a gait cycle can yield useful and predictable results.

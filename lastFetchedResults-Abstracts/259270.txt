In spatial models of political competition, parties select multidimensional platforms with the objective of garnering votes. If parties have limited information and are constrained to move locally, i.e. if they are adaptive, then the slope of the multidimensional landscape on which they choose positions becomes important. In this paper, we formally derive a relationship between voters' preferences and the slope of the electronal landscape.

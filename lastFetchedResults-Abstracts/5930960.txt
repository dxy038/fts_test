To analyze the irregularly spaced tracks of freely drifting surface buoys, objective analysis techniques were applied to produce optimal estimations of forecast surface current fields on a regularly spaced grid. With the interpolation of raw data to the grid points, further analysis can be done with other computer programs. A computer program using this technique has previously been successfully applied to large oceanographic data sets of many drifter tracks. The objective analysis program has been converted for use on Hewlett-Packard microcomputers and applied successfully to much more limited data sets of from one to six drifters

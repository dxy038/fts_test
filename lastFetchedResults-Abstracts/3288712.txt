This paper presents the development of bio-mimetic robot with helical coil as the thrust generating element and its control algorithm. The design and development of bio-mimetic robot adopts the bacteria inspired flagellum mechanism. Direction of the robot is controlled by rudder using a servo motor. Minimum force required to move the vehicle depends on the pressure drag acting on the body and its inertia. CAD model is generated and flow analysis is carried out to find the thrust developed by the helical coil which acts as a propeller. The thrust generated by the helical coil depends on the speed of the motor. The main objective of this work is the study of controlled locomotion of untethered micro-robots in a liquid environment and its application in biomedical field. Drilling mechanism at the front of robot is for clearing the blocks in the passage is also demonstrated.

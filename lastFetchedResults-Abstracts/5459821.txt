In this paper, a complementary damping controller is presented for the Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC). Power system stability improvement by SSSC-based damping controller and Power System Stabilizers (PSSs) thoroughly scrutinized. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) due to its being immediately perceptive, ease of performing, and the ability to impressively solve the highly non-linear objective has been certified in the academic environment. Coordinated design problem of SSSC-based damping controller and PSSs is formulated as an optimization problem. GA optimization technique is employed to solve the optimization problem and optimize the parameters of SSSC-based damping controller and PSSs. Also, performance of damping controller and PSSs is evaluated under a severe disturbance condition in transmission line for multi-machine power system. The nonlinear simulation results shows that by coordinated design of SSSC-based damping controller and PSSs, inter-area and local modes of oscillations are exceptionally damped.

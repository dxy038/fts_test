The objective of this paper is the implementation of a three phase 5-level cascaded H-bridge inverter connected to the grid. A voltage oriented control (VOC) based on space vector pulse width modulation technique (SV-PWM) is used for the control of the converter by using only a single DSP. A feedforward modulation index compensation is applied to overcome the problem of voltage imbalance among the different phases. Simulation and experimental results of a system with a 5-level CHB (Cascaded H-Bridge) inverter and grid connection are presented to validate the proposed topology and control method.

Wireless audio service attracts increasing attention both in mobile and in home audio market. For high quality audio service especially on wireless network, the audio codec with low latency is indispensable since the latency prevents a user from being immersed in the service. This paper presents a low latency audio coder design with a short length window. Side effects due to the short length window are mitigated by the proposed coding tools such as pitch coding and low frequency masking threshold control. The audio quality assessed by the objective and subjective manners shows that the proposed design outperforms the well-known commercial codec.

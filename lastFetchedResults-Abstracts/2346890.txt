In highly flexible and highly integrated manufacturing systems such as semiconductor manufacturing, the dynamic interactions between equipment condition, operations executed on the tools and product quality necessitate joint decision-making in maintenance scheduling and production operations. To address these problems, we devise an integrated decision-making policy optimizing a customizable objective function that takes into account operation-dependent degradation models and production target. Optimization was achieved using a metaheuristic method based on the results of discrete-event simulations of operations of the underlying manufacturing system. The method was applied to optimization of maintenance on a generic cluster tool routinely utilized in semiconductor manufacturing. The results show that operation-dependent maintenance decision-making outperforms the case where maintenance decisions are made without considerations of operation-dependent degradation dynamics.

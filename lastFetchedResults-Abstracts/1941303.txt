The objective of this study was to explore the magnitude of Zimbabwe's biomass resources available for energy production using thermochemical conversion route. This involved estimation biomass from crops, forestry, livestock and Municipal Solid Residues (MSR). A model for estimating biomass energy potential was developed in Microsoft Excel. The crop and forestry production and livestock data used as a basis of calculations was obtained from FAOSTAT. The biomass residues available for energy production were calculated from residues produced considering economic and environmental concerns associated with the removal of crop residues from land and current residue uses. The energy content was obtained by multiplying the available biomass by specific biomass energy content.

tal biomass energy was estimated at an annual average of 413.2 PJ but only 279.5 PJ (23.8% crops, 17.8% crop residues, 45.2% forestry resources, 12.2% livestock residue and 1.0% MSR) is sustainably available. Of this energy 189.3 PJ (26.3% from crop residue, 47.9% from woodfuel, 6.4% from forestry residue, 18.0% from livestock residue and 1.5% from MSR) can be used for energy production without competing for resources with food/feed production and other biomass applications. This can meet approximately 48% of the current energy consumption.

Background and Objective: The history of psychology is full of concepts evolved to upgrade and improve therapies and mental health. The Compassionate Focused Therapy (CFT) model is rooted in the concept of self-compassion in modern psychology. The purpose of this research was to study the effectiveness of CFT on depression, anxiety, and rumination of depressed patients according to their self-compassion trait.

Materials and Methods: This study was designed as an experimental pretest-posttest with an equivalent control group. Nineteen depressed patients with available sampling were selected from a psychiatric clinic and randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group participated in 12 sessions of Compassion Focused Group therapy (CFT). All participants were assessed by Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Anxiety Scale (AS), Rumination Scale and Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) at the beginning, final session and two months after the intervention (follow-up study). Data were analyzed by ANOVA and independent samples t-test with SPSS 18.

Results: According to data analysis, depression and anxiety of the experimental group significantly decreased in the follow-up study (p < 0.05). In addition, the interaction between intervention and self-compassion was significant on the rumination.

Conclusion: This study showed that CFT could be an effective therapy for depression and anxiety of depressed patients. In addition, people who had higher levels of self-compassion benefited more from our intervention and their rumination decreased. On the other hand, people who had lower level of self-compassion experienced increased rumination.

Non-specific lipid-transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are a family of pan-allergens present in foods and pollen. However, sequence homology among them is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the IgE-mediated cross-reactivity between nsLTPs from different sources and evaluate the allergenic properties of LTPs from peach (Pru p 3) and pellitory (Par j 1/Par j 2), major fruit and pollen allergens. Both proteins were purified and characterised.

reactivity studies among nsLTPs from different foods and pollens were performed by immunoblot inhibition using sera specific to peach or pellitory pollen. Cross-reactivity with Pru p 3 was observed in hazelnut, onion, corn, peanut and apple while in pollens, none of the extracts was inhibited with Par j 1/2.

clusion, Pru p 3 did not inhibit LTPs from most fruits. Therefore, although Pru p 3 covers the largest number of epitopes, diagnosis with only this allergen may not detect all LTP sensitivities.

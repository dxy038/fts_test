The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) has emerged as next generation value added communication services including mobile multimedia broadcasting, multimedia conferencing, push to talk and presence etc on top of all IP networks. Offering multimedia streaming services across heterogeneous fixed and mobile networks have faced many challenges e.g. security, QoS, mobility and services management. In this article our objective is to identity vulnerability threats and attacks, and to study existing potential solutions for mobile multimedia broadcasting. The attacks possibilities are from multiple communication protocols suite i.e. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used for session management, Diameter is used for authentication and authorization, Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) &amp; Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) are used for media streaming on top of transport and IP infrastructure, therefore facing security challenges from three protocols domains. We will also present extended security by developing Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP) System to secure IMS based Mobile Multimedia Broadcasting communication from Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

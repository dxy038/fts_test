This paper proposes the combination of histogram based methods in order to achieve an improved contrast enhancement technique. In the proposed method, at first the histogram is modified in a way that deals with the histogram spikes with less computational complexity. A method is then utilized to preserve the mean brightness of image. In addition, black and white stretching is applied to increase quality of the resulting image. A method is also introduced so that the stretching parameters can be selected proportional to the intensity distribution of each image. The proposed method is robust against noise and is fully automated and still user-friendly. Experimental results indicate efficiency of the new technique from both of the objective and subjective viewpoints.

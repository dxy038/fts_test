The objective of this study is selection of optimum repair and maintenance strategies for a group of bridges. For this purpose, influential factors on safety of users, performance and speed of bridges’ failure, were identified. Then, the weight of mentioned factors or in fact the effect of each one of these factors on the users’ safety, performance and speed of bridges’ failure was obtained by Fuzzy Verbal Method, based on experts’ ideas and through filling the relative questionnaires. At the next stage, evaluation of bridges in Mazandaran Province in terms of each one of the mentioned  factors, the priority index and prioritization of bridges was determined based on their need to repair and maintenance. Ultimately, a mathematical planning model was presented and considering the budget limitation, the priority index extracted from previous stages as well as the cost and effectiveness of repair and maintenance methods specify which bridges and by which method will be remedied. This approach has been evaluated successfully by actual and simulated data.

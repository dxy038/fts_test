We consider a single-machine scheduling problem in which the processing time of each job is a simple
linear deteriorating function of its waiting time. The machine is subject to an availability constraint. Jobs
interrupted by machine unavailability can resume their processing. The objective is to minimize the
makespan. We first show that the problem can be solved optimally by 0â€“1 integer programming. We then
prove that the problem is NP-hard in the ordinary sense and there exists a fully polynomial time approximation
scheme for it.

The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effect of high voltage stimulation (HVS) on the process of healing of crural ulceration. Three comparative groups of patients, A, B and C, were drawn at random from patients with venous crural ulceration. Thirty-three patients in group A were subjected to treatment with HVS. In the course of treatment, doubled-peak monophasic impulses of a total duration of 0.1 ms and frequency of 100 Hz were applied. The voltage was 100 V. Group B, made up of 32 patients treated with topically applied medicine, and group C, made up of 14 patients treated with Unna's boot were used as control. In all patients in all groups (A, B and C) a significant reduction in wound size in relation to baseline was found. The rate of wound area change was highest in group A. The rate of pus cleansing was significantly highest in group A. The degree of granulation after 2 weeks was significantly greater in group A than in the other groups (P&lt;0.003). High voltage stimulation was an efficient method of enhancement of the healing of crural ulceration.

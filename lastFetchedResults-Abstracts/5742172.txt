The Government Information Centre (GIC) was launched in Sri Lanka on August 2006, with a view to dissemination of government information to every citizenÂ´s fingertips through a common interface, in a convenient, comprehensive and friendly manner. The GIC call history analysis of 2009 indicated a fluctuation in the usage pattern, which motivated the researcher to conduct this study. Hence, the key objective of this research is to identify the factors which affect the usage of GIC, also to analyze their impacts and thereby suggest recommendations for improvement.

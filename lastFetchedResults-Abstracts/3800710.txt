The purpose of the paper is to describe physically based electrical models of heating, ventillation and air conditioning residential loads. These models are based on energy balances between the internal air, the dwelling constructive elements, the conditioner appliances and the external environment through a discrete state-space equation system. The main objective of these dynamic models is to evaluate load management programmes, above all direct load control actions. The models have been implemented and tested to assess their accuracy and suitability in this specific kind of applications. In this way, simulated results have been compared with data collected over a period of one year in different cities and for different load performances - steady state as well as response to remote control actions. The advantages of the models proposed here are also compared with models previously developed and described in the literature.

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become focus of attention for governmental organisations, and healthcare and ICT researchers. AAL includes methods, products, services, and software systems to support the everyday lives of elders. To develop AAL software systems, reference architectures (i.e., a special software architecture that guides the development, standardization, and evolution of systems architectures) have been proposed. Despite of the existing reference architectures, their use is a difficult task, due their high level of abstraction. Moreover, these architectures do not support the development of systems for telemonitoring and self-management of chronic diseases at home. The main objective of this project is to propose a reference architecture for Healthcare Supportive Home (HSH) systems. With this project we will contribute in promoting and reusing the knowledge of expertise and in supporting the development, standardization, evolution, and quality of HSH software systems.

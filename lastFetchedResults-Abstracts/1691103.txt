Inroduction & Objective: Propofol is an intravenous anesthetic agent that is very useful today and is administered intravenously. Effect of Vitamin C on the central nervous system are similar to amphetamines is the moderation of central nervous system. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of propofol anesthesia following treatment with vitamin C in male dogs.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 25 dogs were divided into 5 groups. Group 1 as control (no treatment), and group 2 and anesthetic with propofol group 3 to 5, respectively treated with 100 ,250, 500µg/kg of body weight dose of vitamin C and then anesthetized with propofol. Pre and postoperative vital signs including heart rate, respiratory rate, and rectal temperature were recorded during anesthesia. Before and after anesthesia vital signs including heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature and anesthesia time were recorded.
Results: The comparison of parameters before and after of anesthesia induction don’t show significant differences between the experimental and control group. Moderate doses of vitamin C leads to a decrease in body temperature after the anesthesia induction. On the other hand, high doses of vitamin C leads to a reduction in the duration of anesthesia compared with control group.
Conclusion: High-dose of vitamin C can be used as pre-anesthetic in dogs which there are long-term risks of anesthesia.

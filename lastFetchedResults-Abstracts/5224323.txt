Service-Oriented Software Engineering is based on concepts and principles for constructing complex enterprise systems in which services as building block of the system, are distributed in large networks. The main goal of the service-oriented methodologies is to define a process for development and maintenance of service-based systems. Most of the Service-Oriented methodologies are not mature enough compared with traditional software development methodologies such as Object-Oriented or Component-Based. Hence, defining an evaluation framework will be useful for comparing methodologies for identifying their strengths and weaknesses, defining new methodologies or extending existing Service-Oriented methodologies. At the time being, there is no complete evaluation framework for evaluating Service-Oriented methodologies. The principal objective of this paper is to introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating Service-Oriented methodologies. This evaluation tool is appropriate for methodology engineers to develop new methodologies, as well as project managers to select an appropriate methodology at a specific project.

The authors describe the process used to specify a robust network using the Spec specification language, which is intended for giving black-box specifications of large software systems in the early stages of software design and in the software evolution process. The underlying computational model of Spec combines temporal events with message passing to support system descriptions. The authors illustrate the use of the Spec language to define the behavior of a robust distributed system with timing constraints. The robust network specified is a simplified bidirectional-ring network

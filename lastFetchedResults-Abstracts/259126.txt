The objective of this paper is to test for the sustainability of the current account deficits in the United States and Canada over the 1973â€“1994 period. Using various unit root and cointegration tests, some of which allow for structural changes, we conclude that the real current account-deficits-to-GDP ratios are not sustainable.

Innovative Software Technology has been effectively used to assist the Community Health Upliftment (CHU) program in Thane district, India. The main objective of the CHU is to drastically reduce the incidence of future disabilities and the correction of existing disabilities. This is in line with the International Initiative against Avoidable Disablement promoted by UNDP, WHO and UNICEF. The field work is carried out by Impact India Foundation in association with the Govt. of Maharashtra, India.

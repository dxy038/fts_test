Unlike traditional distribution generation (DG) units, the production of photovoltaic DG (PVDG) units is non-dispatchable and largely driven by the rates of solar irradiance fall on its PV array. In this work, a suitable procedure for optimal sizing and location of single PVDGs on radial distribution feeders has been developed. It goes along with the current trend of interfacing renewable energy generators with the grid due to global warming concern. The procedure applies single PVDG unit at points on the feeder while allowing reverse power flow (RPF) within the feeder line sections. The optimisation objective is to minimise the accumulated line power loss over the day (line energy loss) along the feeder, while keeping the voltage profile along the feeder within permissible limits. A method has been applied to rate the line energy loss considering one time interval, namely feasible optimisation interval. The procedure has been applied to an actual 11 kV feeder in Abu Dhabi city. The application showed obvious benefits in terms of line loss reduction and improvement of the voltage profile. The procedures also resulted in alternative feasible solutions in case the optimal solution cannot be applied for any reason - like inconvenience/limitation of land or investment.

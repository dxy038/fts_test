With empirical data being scarce, much of input information to human reliability analysis (HRA) is dependent on the analystsÂ´ subjective judgment. In order to obtain more objective HRA results and for the analysis of error causes and provision of error reduction measures, data extracted from real events are essential. This paper presents the result of human performance analysis on emergency tasks in nuclear power plants (NPPs). Data was collected from the full scope simulator of Younggwang (YGN) NPPs and analyzed to extract information on the human performance of Korean operators. More than 100 cases with six emergency scenarios were recorded on video tape and analyzed to generate performance data such as diagnosis time, step execution time, observation parameters, types of irrelevant response, and so on.

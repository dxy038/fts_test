A new augmented electric gun system has been commissioned. This system, called HART I (hypervelocity augmented railgun test), is built around a double-augmented rail arrangement with a 1.27 cm square bore. It is powered by the SUVAC II 5.6 MJ distributed capacitor power supply. This arrangement allows operation in a simple, series-augmented, or transaugmented gun system configuration. The objective of this facility is to perform materials research, augmentation studies, and armature development in the 10 km/s regime. Armature masses of 2 to 4 g will be accelerated in a 4 m long barrel. Baseline bore materials will begin with conventional G9/GlidCop systems and then move into pyrolytic boron nitride/refractory materials. Hybrids, plasma, and ablation stabilized armature systems are planned. The gun system is instrumented with plasma and rail B-dot probes for in-bore velocity measurements. In addition, breech and muzzle voltages, currents, and external velocities are measured. The HART I system is currently performing hypervelocity experiments to verify the augmentation models

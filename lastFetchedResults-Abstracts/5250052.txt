This paper proposes a new authorizing registration scheme for the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv<sub>6</sub>) route optimization between the correspondent node (CN) and the mobile access gateway (MAG) on behalf of the mobile node (MN) in wireless access networks. Two scenarios are considered according to the type of CN. The tradeoff between security and QoS during the PMIPv6 route optimization procedure is briefly discussed. For the proposed scheme, the proxy home test and the concurrent care-of test are defined newly with parameters specified by information on candidate MAGs. The proposed authorizing registration scheme is performed before actual handover for candidate MAGs where the MN can attach newly. Therefore, the proposed scheme can reduce authorizing registration latency, which can reduce handover latency and thus enhance throughput degradation caused by the bidirectional tunneling via the local mobility anchor (LMA).

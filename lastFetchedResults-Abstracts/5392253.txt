Home automation systems have been developed by many researchers. However, the installation and operational cost of such system is relatively high. In this paper, development of two remote monitoring systems using cell phone with a major focus on cost reduction to allow wider utilization even in undeveloped and developing countries are discussed. The first system has relatively simple features and designed with objective of keeping very low operational cost using novel concept of miscalls. The second system incorporates additional security features like image capture and transmission for intrusion detection. Based on commands received from user cell phone and present sensor conditions, micro controller system send signals through its ports to switch on/off appliances like AC, lights, fan, siren, etc. The sensors used in the system are microphone, temperature sensor and passive infrared (PIR) intrusion detector sensors. The system informs user about any abnormal conditions like intrusion, temperature rise, etc. through miscall or SMS.

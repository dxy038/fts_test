This paper demonstrates an IPv6 self-powered bidirectional wireless network system solution, compatible with indoor conditions, based on a IEEE 802.15.4/802.14.4e 2.4GHz radio (5.4mA Rx / 7.3mA Tx) and a 130nA quiescent current Power Management Unit (PMU). Other key elements are a 32bits Cortex M3 microcontroller and MEMs for sensors. This chipset enables self-powered sensors and actuators as well as over-the-air programing. It is able to sustain a working/home environment (100 lux CLF light during 6 hours a day), able to harvest as low as 1uW energy, and keep operating in the dark during more than 2 months.

This paper presents a new technique for moving-obstacle avoidance generating online piecewise Bezier curves. Briefly, this technique consists in calculating a new trajectory for the robot if a safety distance is not respected; otherwise the robot follows a straight line to its objective. The piecewise Bezier curve is generated on line with significant control points, one of which is used to avoid the detected obstacle. This avoidance point is calculated automatically according to the instantaneous position of the robot, the moving obstacle and their directions. The tracking control of the trajectory is ensured by a flatness-based feedback control associated to a Kalman-Luenberger observer. In order to show the efficiency of the proposed method, some simulation results are given.

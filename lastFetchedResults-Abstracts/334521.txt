Management of non-resectable pelvic tumours by intra-arterial local chemotherapy was shown to be beneficial but systemic toxicity limits its use. To overcome this problem isolated pelvic perfusion (IPP) was introduced as an alternative. This study summarizes our preliminary experience with IPP in the treatment of 18 non-resectable pelvic tumours recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma (six), soft tissue sarcoma (STS) (five), bone tumour (three), epidermoid carcinoma (two), prostatic adenocarcinoma (one), malignant melanoma (one). Results of IPP were regarded as complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD) and disease progression (DP) according to the changes in three parameters including; scoring in pain, tumour marker and tumour size measurements. Complete and partial remission were established in five (27%) and seven (39%) patients respectively indicating a benefit ratio of 66%. Objective pain relief was encountered in 53% of the cases. All patients with STS had undergone further surgical treatment after IPP with successful curative resections in four. No residual tumour was found at the laparotomy of the fifth patient. Presenting symptom of the prostatic adenocarcinoma patient was symptomatic hypoglycaemia which resolved completely after IPP. To our knowledge, this represents the first case reported in the English literature in whom tumour related hypoglycaemia was successfully managed by IPP. In conclusion; management of non-resectable pelvic tumours by IPP seems to offer serious palliation and increase in the quality of life without any systemic toxicity. Our preliminary experience suggests even resectability may be achieved in a number of patients especially in those with STS.

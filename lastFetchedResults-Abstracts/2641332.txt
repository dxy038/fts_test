This paper presents a lifetime efficiency index model and a developed crow search algorithm (DCSA) in order to achieve optimal maintenance for the power transformer. Not doing maintenance on the power transformer, resulting in instability of the transmission system and not to supply consistently electric energy in the load points. In other words, deterioration of the transmission system effects on the status of distribution system and the consumers of electrical energy may face blackouts. Therefore, a maintenance strategy is required in order to reduce the failure rate and increase the reliability of power transformer. The maintenance strategy for power transformer consists of preventive and corrective maintenance. In this paper, the failure rate of power transformer is modeled by an appropriate Weibull distribution and the lifetime of power transformer is modeled using the Taylor series in Weibull distribution. The maintenance strategy should be optimized for the minimum maintenance cost under the required reliability condition. In order to solve this objective problem, a DCSA is used and results are evaluated with other methods. The results show that the proposed DCSA was indeed capable of obtaining higher quality solutions than other methods for the optimal maintenance problem.

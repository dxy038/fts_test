In recent years, with the increasing level of competition in the global construction market, several research efforts have focused on the application of information technology (IT) as a way to improve the integration process of construction supply chain management (CSCM). Visual representation of the process can provide an effective tool for monitoring resources in the CSCM. In order to support this objective, this paper integrates building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) into a unique system, which enables keeping track of the supply chain status and provides warning signals to ensure the delivery of materials. First, the proposed methodology is implemented by using BIM due to its capability to accurately provide a detailed takeoff in an early phase of the procurement process. Furthermore, in order to support the wide range of spatial analysis used in the logistics perspective (warehousing and transportation) of the CSCM, GIS is used in the present model. Thus, this paper represents the integrated GIS-BIM model manifesting the flow of materials, availability of resources, and “map” of the respective supply chains visually. A case example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the developed system.

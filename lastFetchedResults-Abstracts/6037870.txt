This paper proposes an optimization scheme with regard to camping along the Colorado River, relevant data comes from MCM(The mathematical contest in modeling)2012<sup>[1]</sup>, problem B. With purpose of precise formulation for the drifting-tour on the Colorado River<sup>[2]</sup>, a multi-objective optimizing model is established with consideration of 4 factors. In particular, an intelligent match-search algorithm is designed to figure out the model solution. A series of flexible-pattern drifting approaches are finally worked out with the simulation and available for crafting-customers to select the crafting method. In the end, Robustness Analysis is completed as to verify the scheme.

Results are presented of measurements made by the synthetic aperture radiometer, ESTAR, during the Southern Great Plains experiment in Oklahoma during the summer, 1997. The objective of the Southern Great Plains experiment (SGP97) was to study passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture on a spatial and temporal scale representative of future observations from space. To this end, ESTAR flew at high altitude (7.6 km) and mapped a swath about 50 km wide (east-to-west) and about 300 km long. The area mapped extended west from Oklahoma City to El Reno and north from the Little Washita River watershed to the Oklahoma-Kansas border. Data was collected almost daily for one month (from June 17 to July 17) and includes several examples of wetting by rainfall followed by a period of drying

A multimode model based on the rate equation approximation is presented in order to simulate the mode dynamics of 1.55-mum InGaAsP-InP microring lasers. A detailed characterization is performed including calculated optical spectra, time traces and relative intensity noise spectra. Different operation regimes are observed, bidirectional multimode with/without alternate oscillations, unidirectional single mode, bidirectional single mode and mode hopping. The boundaries of the above operation regimes are investigated with respect to the current level, bus waveguide reflectivity and ring radius. Varying the current level a transition from multimode to single mode and eventually mode hopping operation is observed. Increasing the bus waveguide reflectivity a transition from unidirectional to bidirectional operation is revealed, while the use of nonequal reflectivities between the two facets, promotes unidirectional operation. Moreover, the ring radius is proved to be a critical parameter for the extent of each operation regime since it directly influences the modal wavelength separation

Objective: To prospectively examine the associations between zinc intake, the zinc to heme iron ratio
and the incidence of hyperglycemia in Chinese. Methods: We followed 1056 healthy adults aged 20 and older
from 2002 to 2007. Dietary data were collected using 3-day food record and food frequency questionnaire.
Hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose >5.6 mmol/l. Results: During the 5 years of follow-up, we
documented 125 incident cases of hyperglycemia. Zinc intake alone was not associated with the risk of
hyperglycemia. The zinc to heme iron ratio was inversely associated with the risk of hyperglycemia: odds ratios
(OR, 95% CI) across increasing quartiles of the zinc to heme iron ratio were 1.00, 0.78(0.44-1.37), 0.40(0.19-
0.83), and 0.21(0.08-0.54)(p for trend= 0.001). Adjustment for lifestyle covariates did not significantly change
the associations. Conclusions: This cohort study suggests that the zinc to heme iron intake ratio was significantly
associated with a decreased risk of hyperglycemia in Chinese adults.

In this paper, we present a heuristic algorithm for single-row routing. Our approach is based on the interval graphical representation of the given net list. The objective function for minimization is the street congestion. The problem is known to be intractable in the sense of NP-completeness, thus a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm is proposed. It has been implemented and tested with various examples. So far it has always produced optimal solutions.

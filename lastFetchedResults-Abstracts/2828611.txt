The objective of the proposed method is to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of a scene in real-time via moving a low-cost RGB mono-camera by hand. Only simple and fast algorithms are used for the purpose of real-time with a decent structure resolution. To compensate the defects of the cheap algorithms, the scene structures will be buffered and used only when they are considered as a good case, and they will be smoothed to decrease the effects of the structural defect. Even if only a minority of overall cases are good cases, a complete scene structure can still be obtained with small amounts of different views. The proposed method can be applied into embedded systems after optimization and adjustment.

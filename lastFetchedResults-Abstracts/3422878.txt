Networks that use the timed token protocol (such as the 100 Mbit/s FDDI network) are well suited for real-time applications because they guarantee, to each node, an average bandwidth and a bounded access time to the communication network. This guarantee is necessary but not sufficient for the timely delivery of deadline-constrained messages; protocol parameters must be carefully selected to ensure that these messages meet their deadlines. This paper addresses the issue of selecting the protocol parameters TTRT (target token rotation time) and the synchronous capacities assigned to each node. The objective is to guarantee that each synchronous message is transmitted before its deadline. An upper bound is derived on the worst case achievable utilization (WCAU) of any parameter selection scheme. The WCAU of a scheme is defined as the maximum utilization U such that the scheme guarantees all synchronous messages as long as their utilization is less than U. An algorithm for selecting the above parameters is proposed, The algorithm is shown to have a WCAU that is very close to the upper bound

Bioactive ceramic materials like tricalcium phosphate (TCP) have been emerging as viable material alternatives to the current therapies of bone scaffolding to target fracture healing and osteoporosis. Both material and architectural characteristics play a critical role in the osteoconductive capacity and strength of bone scaffolds. Thus, the objective of this research was to investigate the sintering temperature effect of a cost-effective manufacturing process on the architecture and mechanical properties of a controlled macro porous bioceramic bone scaffold. In this study the physical and mechanical properties of β -TCP bioceramic scaffolds were investigated as a function of the sintering temperature in the range of 950–1150 °C. Physical properties investigated included bulk dimensions, pore size, and strut thickness; and, compressive mechanical properties were evaluated in air at room temperature and in saline solution at body temperature. Statistically significant increases in apparent elastic modulus were measured for scaffolds sintered at higher temperatures. Structural stiffness for all the specimens was significantly reduced when tested at body temperature in saline solution. These findings support the development of clinically successful bioceramic scaffolds that may stimulate bone regeneration and scaffold integration while providing structural integrity.

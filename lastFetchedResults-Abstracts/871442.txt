In this paper we have obtained Fritz-John type necessary optimality criteria for
non-linear programs under the hypotheses that the right differentials, at the
optimal point, of the objective and the active constraint functions with respect to
an arc are convex and the inactive constraint functions are continuous. A Mond-
Weir type dual is associated and weak and strong duality results are established by
assuming the functions involved to be locally P-connected. These results are
further extended and necessary as well as sufficient optimality conditions are
obtained for a weakly efficient solution of a multiobjective non-linear program. A
proper weak minimum is defined and duality results are established by using this
concept

At the end of first and second month after the intervention, the severity of dysmenorrhea was detected and compared with before. Data analized by SPSS, using chi-square, t and paired manwitney tests and P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: Mean of dysmenorrhea scores was similar before the intervention in two groups , but at the end of first month after the intervention, it was 10.67±6.07 in fennel group and 16.11 ±6.35 in placebo group, and after the end of second month following the intervention it was 9.29±6.18 in fennel versus 15.94±7.43 in placebo group (P<0.05).

Over the last decade, the same micromachining manufacturing methods that have made microelectronic circuitry and microcomputer technology possible have also made microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) a reality. Most machines require power and autonomous power is usually most desirable. Because its possible to manufacture machines small enough to fit on a microchip, there is a need for microscopic batteries, which can also reside on the chip, to power them. The ability to store energy in miniature, rechargeable devices, which are integrated into a MEMS circuit, would enhance MEMS technology in several ways. Bipolar Technologies of Prove, Utah, USA, has completed a Phase I, SBIR project which was divided into three specific tasks: (1) preliminary design; (2) development of fabrication processes; and (3) evaluation of test cells. The purpose of the first task was to describe an energy storage approach, suitable for in MEMS, involving microscopic batteries. During the design task numerous electrochemical couples were screened by testing small, flat cells. Developing fabrication processes was an important Phase I objective. It had to be demonstrated that traditional micromachining processes could be devised to manufacture microbattery components. The resultant design activities were followed by the performance of proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of microscopic batteries for MEMS

The objective reality of physico-chemical diagnostics consists of the fact that the change of chemical structure of insulation occurs as a result of ageing in service in electrotechnical equipment. The analytical analysis of the dissolved gases, low molecular hydrocarbons, water, compounds of the furan series and antioxidant provides a basis for high-grade physico-chemical diagnostics for oil-filled electrotechnical equipment (OFEE). An automated chromatographic system has been designed for use in OFEE diagnostics

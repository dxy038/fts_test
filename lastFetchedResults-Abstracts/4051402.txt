The forward march of our technological progress and economic growth requires the services of ever larger numbers of engineers working in industry, education, Government, and private practice. The first step toward increasing the engineering population to meet future needs is to attract additional qualified high school students to the study of engineering. This objective is being carried out by the Guidance Committee of the Engineers Council for Professional Development (ECPD) through a network of state committees which work directly with the schools.

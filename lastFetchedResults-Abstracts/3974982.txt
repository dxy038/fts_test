The problem of reconstructing locations, shapes, and dielectric permittivity distributions of two-dimensional dielectric objects from measurements of the scattered electric field is addressed. A numerical approach is proposed which is based on a multi-illumination multiview processing. In particular, the inverse problem is recast as a global nonlinear optimization problem, which is solved by a genetic algorithm. The final objective of the approach is the image reconstruction of highly contrasted bodies

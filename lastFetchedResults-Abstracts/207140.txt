Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is one of the most important chemical characteristics which influences soil quality from different aspects. At the same time, CEC is an input parameter of many computer models being applied in soil science and agriculture. Methods of CEC determination are always time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, developing a model for CEC estimation from other soil properties is essential. The objective of this study was to understand the associations between CEC (as a dependent variable) and sand, silt, clay, organic matter and ph (as independent variables). In this study 464 soil samples from A, B, and C horizons of different soils were used.
e Results revealed that CEC is negatively correlated with sand (r=-0.389***) and is positively correlated with organic matter (r=0.772***), clay (r= 0.391 ***) and silt (r= 0.233***). No significant correlation was observed between CEC and pH. Stepwise regression analysis showed that both organic matter and clay enter the model and that coefficients of determination (r2) for the multiple models are higher than those of simple linear correlations. Other parameters could not increase the r2 considerably. Correlation analysis on data from A, B, and C horizons revealed that the CEC of organic matter in different horizons are not the same. Separation of Aridisols could not increase the r-2 of the model and. the accuracy of the estimations. Correlation studies in acid soils showed that the contribution of organic matter in CEC is much higher than that of clays.

Membrane based linear gas sensors and fiber optical sensors feature similar geometries and complement each other in quantities to be measured. To the authorÂ´s best knowledge, it is the first time that these sensors are combined to a multifunctional sensor for distributed measuring of gas concentrations, temperature, and strain. Objective is a comprehensive monitoring of underground gas storage areas. In the presented project a 400 m<sup>2</sup> test site and a corresponding laboratory system were just built up to characterize, validate, and optimize the combined sensor. Application of the sensor lines in a grid structure should enable spatial resolution of the measurement data and early detection of relevant events, as gas leakage, temperature change, or mechanical impact. A Calibration routine was developed which can be applied subsequent to underground installation. First measurement results indicate the potential of the method, with regard to highly topical energy transport and storage issues.

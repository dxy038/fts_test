Salinity stress is one of the most important abiotic stress factors limiting the plants' growth. Seed priming is known as a method which improves the germination performance in seeds in stress conditions. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Hydropriming and Halopriming on germination performance of Secale montanum while growing under the NaCl-salinity stress. Hydropriming and Halopriming were used in the study to prime seeds. For the Halopriming treatments, concentrations of 0, 125, 250 and 500 mM of sodium chloride were prepared. This experiment was carried out in four levels of salinity stress. A significant tow-way interaction (priming × stress) was found for all characteristics. Germination percent in Halopriming showed a significant decrease with the increases in duration and concentration of treatments. Higher root and shoot length values of S. mountanum were observed in Hydropriming treatment but as compared to the control, it was not statistically significant. S. montanum appears to be moderately salt-tolerant. The results of this study indicated that Halopriming had a negative effect on the germination and growth of S. montanum. The disadvantage may be due to the varied plant species, imbibing time and seed moisture. On the other hand, these effects are probably due to an excessive increase and accumulation of Na+ and Cl− ions to the seed tissue. From the present study, it can be concluded that seeds of S. montanum are sensitive to priming technique and priming of this species needs to use the other priming methods.

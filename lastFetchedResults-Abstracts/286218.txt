Background:  Test chambers for irritant patch testing are usually larger than those used in allergic patch testing. In general, larger areas show stronger skin reactions than smaller areas. Objective:  This study investigated whether this difference is of practical relevance, when a model irritant is applied in small and large Finn chambers and evaluated by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Methods: Patch testing was performed with 2 concentrations of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) (0.25% and 0.5%) on forearms of healthy volunteers. Large (inner diameter, 12 mm) and small (inner diameter, 8 mm) chambers were used. Results:  A variance analysis (3 factors, 2-tailed) showed that the test outcome, as assessed by TEWL, was strongly dependent on SLS test concentration and test chamber size. The larger chambers gave approximately 30% to 50% higher values than the smaller. Conclusions:  This may be explained by the fact that with the small chambers, the adjacent small area of nontreated skin was also assessed by the evaporimeter, biasing the results. A formula estimating TEWL value of the large chamber from values of the small chambers has been proposed.

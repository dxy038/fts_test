The decentralized distributed system characteristics of ad hoc networks bring up some security problems. To ensure the safe, efficient and flexible data transmission in ad hoc networks, this paper presents a trust routing framework based on topology control theory. This framework establishes a trust topology layer independent of routing layer, and the routing procedure executes over the trust topology generated by a distributed topology control algorithm. And in our algorithm, the trust topology is constructed through trust triangles which are generated by multi-objective decision. At last, a dynamic trust management scheme to update the trust topology is presented. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper performs well and works even more efficiently in mobile scenarios.

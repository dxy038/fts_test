This work considers the problem of power minimization in translucent wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. Our objective is to minimize the energy expended in optical WDM networks by reducing the number of power consuming components such as regenerators, amplifiers, add/drop terminals, etc. In particular, an algorithm for solving the Energy-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (EA-RWA) problem in translucent networks based on Simulating Annealing (SA) meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed. Numerical results show that energy-efficient regenerator placement combined with appropriate routing so as to switch off power consuming components can significantly reduce power consumption in the network.

Objective: We developed and tested the psychometric properties of Spanish versions of the Trait and State Food Cravings Questionnaires (FCQ–T and FCQ–S respectively). Method: The instruments were translated and adapted to Spanish and administered to undergraduate students from a Southern university in Spain (N=271). The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis to compare the factor structure of the English and Spanish versions of both questionnaires. Results: The factors structure of both questionnaires obtained excellent fit indices across their Spanish versions with the one exception that some factors of the FCQ–S were more highly intercorrelated among the Spanish sample than the American. Discussion: This study supports the conceptualization of food cravings as universal multidimensional motivational states that can be reliably measured and supports the use of the Spanish versions of the FCQ.

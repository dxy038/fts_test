To quantify the impact of organophosphate pesticides on aquatic ecosystems requires a mechanistic understanding of their
behaviour in a range of environmental matrices. The objective of this study was to compare the sorption/desorption,
biodegradation and toxic effects of the PestanalR grade and commercial formulation (Ectomort Centenary) of the organophosphate
insecticide propetamphos in river and estuarine sediments. For both formulations, the sorption of propetamphos onto
sediment was initially very rapid followed by a slower sorption phase. Similarly, the initial rate of desorption was rapid,
followed by a much slower rate. In both sorption and desorption experiments, the level of sorbed propetamphos was
considerably higher for the commercial formulation of propetamphos (Kd=7–11) than for the PestanalR grade (Kd=4–10).
The rate of propetamphos biodegradation was sediment dependent but was most rapid where microbial activity and nutrients
were the highest and sorption was the lowest. Propetamphos was more rapidly degraded in sediments under aerobic (t1 / 2=15 d)
compared to anaerobic conditions (t1 / 2=19 d). However, no significant difference in the biodegradation rates of the PestanalR
grade and commercial formulations of propetamphos were observed. The toxic effect of propetamphos on sediment microbial
communities was significantly greater for the commercial formulation than for the PestanalR grade of propetamphos based on
EC50 (21 versus 236 Ag g 1) and EC10 values (0.3 versus 54 Ag g 1). In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of
using commercial pesticide formulations when carrying out ecotoxicological testing.

Objective: We evaluated the relative importance of predictors of hysterectomy. Study Design: A questionnaire survey of an Australia-wide sample of adult female twins was conducted; self-report data were validated against reports from treating physicians. Results: A total of 3096 women (94%) and 366 physicians (87%) responded. The sensitivity of patient report of hysterectomy was 98.2%. Best predictors of hysterectomy were endometriosis (odds ratio 4.85, 95% confidence interval 3.17-7.43), medical consultation for menorrhagia (odds ratio 3.55, 95% confidence interval 2.47-5.12), joint effects of fibroids with medical consultation for chronic or persisting pelvic pain (odds ratio 3.34, 95% confidence interval 1.42 to 7.87), having smoked >40 cigarettes per day (odds ratio 3.24, 95% confidence interval 1.10-9.55), joint effects of fibroids with consultation for menstrual problems (odds ratio 2.61, 95% confidence interval 1.36-5.01), and tubal ligation (odds ratio 1.77, 95% confidence interval 1.31-2.39). Less-important predictors were age and higher education level (protective). Conclusion: Consulting a physician about pelvic pain and menstrual problems, especially heavy bleeding, are recognized steps toward hysterectomy. Of particular interest for future genetic analyses are the high odds of hysterectomy for women with endometriosis, fibroids, or menorrhagia. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:945-54.)

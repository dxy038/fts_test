Objective:
The human occipital condyle is the unique bony structure connecting the cranium and the vertebral column. The progress in neuroimaging techniques has increased interest for aggressive craniovertebral surgery. Such surgery requires the knowledge regarding anatomical aspects of the craniovertebral junction. The aim of the present study is to analyze the occipital condyle morphometrically.
Material and methods:
404 occipital condyles of 202 dry skulls were used for this study. Twenty-seven parameters were measured, including length, width and height of occipital condyle, the distances between the occipital condyle and hypoglossal canal, as well as some important condyle-related angles.
Results:
The length, width and the height of the occipital condyle were found to be 23.4, 10.6, and 9.2 mm, respectively. The anterior and posterior intercondylar distances are 21.0 and 41.6 mm, respectively. Sagittal intercondylar angle was 59.3°. The intracranial orifice of the hypoglossal canal was found in the junction of the second and third quarter on the condyle in more than 55% of specimens. The shape of occipital condyles was classified into eight types as followings—type 1: oval-like condyle; type 2: kidney-like condyle; type 3: S-like condyle; type 4: eight-like condyle; type 5: triangle condyle; type 6: ring-like condyle; type 7: two-portioned condyle and type 8: deformed condyle. The most common type was type 1 (50%), whereas the most unusual type was type 7 (0.8%).
Conclusion:
It is concluded that the occipital condyle may present various shapes, length, width, and orientation, requiring a careful radiological analysis before craniovertebral junction surgery.

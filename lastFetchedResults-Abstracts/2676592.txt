Introduction: Listeriosis is among the diseases occurring to humans, wild and domestic animals. Listeria monocytogenes, the etiologic agent of this disease, is one the most important food-borne pathogens. Given the limited information regarding the effects of various concentrations of different antibiotics on Listeria monocytogenes for in vivo studies, this study is designed. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effects of different concentrations of tetracycline and trimethoprim on the prevention of congenital listeriosis in Balb/C mice.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental-analytical study, the effect of various concentrations of tetracycline and trimethoprim on congenital listeriosis was evaluated in 4 groups of modelBalb/C mice, (treated with tetracycline, treated with trimethoprim, positive control and negative control). Minimum inhibitory concentration for Listeria monocytogenes was determinedin Muller-Hinton broth medium.For in vivo study, different dosages of tetracycline and trimethoprim were administered orally. Clinical evidence, sampling and culture methods were used for listeriosis identification. 
Results: The obtained results showed that the percentage of live birth was higher in the treated mice than in the control groups. Using tetracycline and trimethoprim prevented abortion in treated Balb/C mice. For Trimethoprim and Tetracycline were effective for 100% and 74% prevention in abortion, respectively, as observed. 
Conclusion: Based on the results obtained in this study, it can be concluded thattrimethoprim antibiotic had more inhibitory effects than tetracycline on the abortion prevention in Balb/C mice.

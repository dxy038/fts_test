In the application of case-based reasoning in multi-objective evaluation optimizing setting method, attributes weights of inputs in case retrieval are usually obtained subjectively, thus resulting in deterioration in accuracy of set points. To solve the problem, this paper presents a retrieval strategy based on group decision-making, in which, based on groups of weights by genetic algorithm, the retrieved set points are optimized and determined by group cardinal utility function. So the presented case-based reasoning strategy is applied to multi-objective evaluation optimizing setting problem. Simulation shows that the accuracy of set points is improved by the proposed retrieval strategy based on group decision-making.

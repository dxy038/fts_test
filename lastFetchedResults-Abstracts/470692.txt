Objective
We longitudinally examined the changes of brachial to ankle distensibility using pulse wave velocity (PWV) throughout pregnancy and its difference between normal pregnancy and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) groups.
Study design
One hundred and eighty-three pregnant women were included in this study. The PWV examinations were performed in a longitudinal way during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy, and immediately and 1 month after delivery.
Results
In normal pregnancies, the PWV significantly decreased at the second trimester, increased from the third trimester through immediately after delivery, and decreased again at 1 month after delivery. In PIH patients, it increased in proportion to the progression of gestation.
Conclusion
We monitored the longitudinal changes in PWV and constructed a PWV normogram during pregnancy. The predictive value of PWV and blood pressure for PIH was higher than that of blood pressure alone, suggesting the usefulness of measuring PWV to predict PIH.

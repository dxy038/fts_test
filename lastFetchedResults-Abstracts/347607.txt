Objective: To determine the ERP characteristics and ERP indices of central speech sound encoding and discrimination in young children.
Methods: Auditory sensory event-related potentials (ERPs) and the ERP index of auditory sensory discrimination (the mismatch negativity, MMN) were elicited by vowel stimuli in 3-year-old children. In an oddball paradigm, the standard stimulus was vowel /a/, one deviant stimulus was vowel /o/ (the across-category change), and the other was nasalized vowel /a/ (within-category change). In addition, the ERP changes occurring during the 14 min uninterrupted recording were examined.
Results: As indexed by the sensory P1, N2, and N4 peaks, the 3-year-old children's transient neural encoding of vowels was comparable to that earlier registered in 1-year-old children but also showed vowel-specific characteristics observed in school-age children. The 3-year-old's MMN was comparable in amplitude to the school-age children's MMN and appeared to be sensitive to the across-category aspects of vowel changes. However, its latency was longer in the 3-year-olds than in school-age children. Among the sensory ERPs, only the N4 peak showed significant diminution during the experiment. The across-category change MMN diminished after 10 min of the recording, however, over the frontal areas only.
Conclusions: In the 3-year-old children, the sensory processing of vowels exhibited transitional characteristics between those observed in infants and school-age children. The auditory sensory discrimination in the 3-year-olds appeared to be sensitive to the phonemic aspects of stimulus change. The frontally-predominant MMN diminution during the experiment might indicate the greater refractoriness of its frontal-lobe generators. In general, the auditory sensory ERPs show distinct maturational profiles from that of the MMN.

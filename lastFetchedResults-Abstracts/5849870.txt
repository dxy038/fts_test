Reliability of energy supplies is considered the most important technical and economical characteristic of an electric system. The most efficient solution to increase the reliability in distribution systems, in most cases, is the rational sectioning of the networks. In that direction, the main difficulty in the formation of mathematical optimization models of reliability is the growing complexity of analytical expressions for definition of indicators to represent the system reliability. In this paper, is analyzed an approach to allow construction of objective functions and restrictions containing discreet variables, considering a set of factors such as: statistical data of faults, topology and parameters of the networks, location and characteristics of commutation equipments, etc. However, an attempt to use exact methods of discreet optimization causes an increase in the number of variables and restrictions and, as a consequence, presents insuperable computing difficulties. Therefore, it is proposed and tested a heuristic method of optimization to overcoming such difficulties.

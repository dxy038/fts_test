The objective of this work is to analyze the initial and post-collapse plate deflections based on measurement records of the experiments of three corroded box girders subjected to pure vertical bending loading inducing a compressive stress on deck. The effect of initial imperfections and corrosion degradation on the final post-collapse deformation shape has been investigated and a relationship between different loading responses, shape of initial imperfections and plate slenderness has been derived. Analyzing initial imperfections, plate slenderness and final post-collapse deformations, a slenderness criterion has been established to predict the post-collapse deformation shape.

Background:Carbone’s monoxide is a poisoning gas and a
pollutant of ambient air. Sandstorm is episodic dust-laden that
reinforced CO toxicity levels in the environment. Hospital
healthcare professionals are the first line healthy system
organization and hospital workplace should be safe. The
objective of this study was to determine the threshold levels of
CO toxicity among hospital healthcare professionals in
thesandstorm ambient air pollution through pulse CO-oximetry
method.
Method: Participations recruited base on the designed protocol
and following inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Results:A total of 117 subjects enrolled with means age ± SD;
38.97±9.03 years. It ranged between 20-60 years. Of those, 68
subjects was female and 49 male. Mean level of
carboxyhemoglobin concentration (COHB %) was 2.52±3.40
SD,(P=0.03). 43% of sample study had CO toxicity upper than
the normal set point. COHB% level noticeably increased in
the female sex respect to male subgroups (? =0.019).
Conclusion:The resultant’s study was indicated particularity in
female sex that a significant carboxyhemoglobin concentration
found an above- normal set point level among target of
population. As well as, threshold levels of CO toxicity in the
workplace setting were noticeably high. Intervals of toxicity
are nearby hazardous action level. The outcome of the study
should be considered as an alarm for the public health program
and presenting occult indoor CO poisoning.

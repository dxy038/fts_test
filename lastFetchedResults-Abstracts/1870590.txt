One of the hallmarks of an effective immune response againstMycobacterium tuberculosisis the formation of granulomas containing multinucleated giant cells. IFN-γ and interleukin-3 (IL-3) promote Langhans-type multinucleated giant cell formation and have been identified in T cell clones reacting toM. tuberculosisantigens. The ability of human monocytes treated with IFN-γ and IL-3 to limit the spread ofM. tuberculosisin anin vitroinfection assay was examined. Monocytes were incubated with control medium, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and calcitriol, a combination permissive toM. tuberculosisgrowth, or IFN-γ and IL-3 and infected with a low inoculum ofM. tuberculosis(Erdman). IFN-γ/IL-3 treatment reducedM. tuberculosisCFU relative to both untreated and IFN-γ/TNF-α/calcitriol-treated monocytes. Specifically, CFU were reduced by 79% at 14 days in the IFN-γ/IL-3 treatment group relative to the IFN-γ/TNF-α/calcitriol treatment group, an effect that was not due to toxic monocyte metabolites.M. tuberculosisgrowth restriction by IFN-γ/IL-3-treated monocyte monolayers was associated with the development of Langhans-type multinucleated giant cells. At the light microscope level, dense growth ofM. tuberculosissurrounded by a ring of nuclei localized to the center of individual cells. The intracellular location ofM. tuberculosiswas confirmed by electron microscopy. In contrast, monocyte monolayers treated with IFN-γ/TNF-α/calcitriol consisted of a syncitium of cells containing monocyte aggregates. Nonlocalized linear arrays ofM. tuberculosiswere observed to be growing throughout such aggregates. These results suggest that physical sequestration ofM. tuberculosisby Langhans-type multinucleated giant cells may limit cell to cell spread of this pathogen, thereby restricting growth.

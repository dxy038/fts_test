This Paper describes the grid connected hybrid renewable energy system. The hybrid wind energy conversion system (WECS)/photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cell (FC) system is an excellent option for distributed energy production. Input sources such as wind and photovoltaic are primary power system and fuel cell as a secondary power system. The objective of this paper is aimed at controlling the hybrid system that guarantees the energy continuity. During sudden change in load condition bidirectional support is offered by aptly controlling the inverter. A novel MPPT controller is also established at the inverter side. A Voltage source inverter employing current control is used to connect the proposed system to the grid to achieve stabilization if one or more of the energy sources are diminished. The entire proposed system has been modeled and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink software.

The stated objective is to describe a procedure for determining the symbolic coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a restricted class of <img src="/images/tex/2584.gif" alt="RLC"/> networks through the eigenvalue approach of Bashkow\´s <img src="/images/tex/10.gif" alt="A"/> matrix. Theorem 2 is an algebraic method to determine each coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of an <img src="/images/tex/3025.gif" alt="LC"/> network (called half-degenerate) which has no <img src="/images/tex/27.gif" alt="C"/> -only-circuits nor <img src="/images/tex/11.gif" alt="L"/> -only-cutsets. The method uses Wang algebra but does not have to enumerate trees. Even for a large scale of half-degenerate <img src="/images/tex/3025.gif" alt="LC"/> network each coefficient can be obtained algebraically, as well as individually, from Wang algebra operations of its elements <img src="/images/tex/10323.gif" alt="{C_1,C_2,\\cdots ,C_a,L_1,L_2,\\cdots ,L_{n-a}}"/> . This implies that for its determination the new method requires less effort in computation over the existing tree enumeration methods based on Wang algebra. Theorem 1 is a method to determine the characteristic polynomial of an RLC network which is generated from a half-degenerate <img src="/images/tex/3025.gif" alt="LC"/> network by inserting resistors in series with <img src="/images/tex/11.gif" alt="L"/> \´s and in parallel with <img src="/images/tex/27.gif" alt="C"/> \´s. The significance of Theorem 1 is that 1) the characteristic polynomials of the half-degenerate <img src="/images/tex/3025.gif" alt="LC"/> subnetworks, which are used to express the characteristic polynomial of the <img src="/images/tex/2584.gif" alt="RLC"/> network, can be obtained from Theorem 2 in forms of power series of the complex frequencies variable 2, and then 2) the effect of insertion of loss parameters into a lossless network of order <img src="/images/tex/23.gif" alt="n"/> is clear.

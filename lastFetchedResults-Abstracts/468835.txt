Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficiency after abdominal sacrohysteropexy in women with uterovaginal prolapse.
Study design
We conducted a retrospective chart review at our tertiary referral urogynecology unit. Thirty women of childbearing age with uterovaginal prolapse who wanted uterine preservation underwent abdominal sacrohysteropexy between 1987 and 1999.
Results
The mean age of the women was 35.7 years (range, 29–43 years). All women were parous. Thirteen women had grade 2 uterovaginal prolapse, and 17 women had grade 3 prolapse. In all women, the Burch procedure and posterior colporrhaphy were performed at the same time. Intraoperative and postoperative complications occurred in 2 patients (6.6%) and 4 patients (13.3%), respectively. The mean objective and subjective follow-up periods were 44.5 months (range, 2–156 months) and 94.6 months (range, 8–160 months), respectively. At the time of the last physical examination, there were two cases of recurrent uterovaginal prolapse (6.6%), which was symptomatic in 1 patient and required repeat surgical treatment. At the time of the last questionnaire, apart from the patient who underwent repeat surgery, no patients had any uterovaginal prolapse symptoms. Three women had pregnancies that were conceived spontaneously, which led to three early legal abortions.
Conclusion
The abdominal sacrohysteropexy is effective and safe in the treatment of uterovaginal prolapse in women of childbearing age. This procedure has a high success rate in correcting prolapse without a time-dependent decrease in efficiency.

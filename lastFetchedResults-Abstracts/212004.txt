Background and the purpose of the study: Dihydropyridines having carboxamides in 3 and
5 positions show anti-tuberculosis activity. The purpose of the present study was to
synthesize new DHPs having possible anti-tuberculosis activity.
Methods:   4,5-Dichloroimidazole-2-carboxaldehyde   was   condensed   with   N-arylaceto-
acetamides and ammonium acetate in methanol to give N,N-diaryl-4-(4,5-dichloroimid-
azole-2-yl)-l,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxamides.   All   compounds   were
screened for their antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv).
Results and major conclusion: Some of the new synthesized compounds exhibited a
moderate activity in comparison to rifampicin.

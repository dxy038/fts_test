Speeding of E-commerce and Internet nowadays promote development, reform and recombination of logistics industry. More and more professionals focus here and approve concept of 4PL, which is the integrator of logistics industry, owns obvious advantages, and can play a role in todayÂ´s highly competitive condition. In this paper, a multi-objective and multi-task routing problem of 4PL is considered, and the problem is simplified with mathematic and optimizing methods. To solve this complex mathematical model, this paper proposed a improved ant colony algorithm and compares it with basic ant colony algorithm. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm for the proposed problem.

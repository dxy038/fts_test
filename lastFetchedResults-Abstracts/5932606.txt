Wireless body sensor network is employed into the coal mine rescue system. We present a multi-objective optimization methodology for self-organizing, adaptive wireless sensor network design and energy management, taking into consideration application-specific requirements, communication constraints and energy-conservation characteristics. We use genetic algorithm as the optimization tool. Simulation results show that this method can optimize the power management obviously to improve the network load balance, without lacking of network characteristics that are required by the coal mine rescue system.

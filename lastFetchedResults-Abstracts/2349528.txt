Alkyl hydroxamates are well known collectors for oxide copper minerals as evidenced by the large amount of published literature. Our studies on a wide variety of copper ores from around the world have shown that alkyl hydroxamates will recover most of the “floatable” oxide copper minerals from an ore. They are available commercially, and they offer many advantages over alternative technologies for oxide copper recovery. In spite of this, the full potential of hydroxamates has not been exploited in the industry. The objective of this paper is to provide relevant practical aspects and guidelines to facilitate successful application of hydroxamates in operating plants.

ical analysis of the available information and data, based on several case studies, flotation testing, and microscopic analysis indicates that alkyl hydroxamates can effectively recover well-defined oxide minerals of copper, but not copper occurrences such as Cu-bearing goethite (often misidentified as cuprite) which report as Acid Soluble copper in chemical assays. Prior to any flotation testing with hydroxamates, it is necessary to assess the various modes of occurrence of Acid Soluble copper using microscopic and microprobe analysis.

This paper presents a new control algorithm for utilizing PEM fuel cell and supercapacitors for automotive system. A PEM fuel cell is operated as a directional main power source connected to 42 V dc bus (PowerNet) by boost converter, and supercapacitors is controlled as a fast bidirectional auxiliary power source connected to dc bus by a 2-quadrant dc/dc converter. The system employs a 500 W PEM fuel cell and a supercapacitive storage device, composed of six components (3,500 F, 2.5 V, 400 A) associated in series. The system control structure is realized by analogical for current loop at high dynamics and digital control (dSPACE) for voltage loop and algorithm. The proposed control, illustrated by experimental results, avoids speedy transition of fuel cell current and is based on the power sharing demanded at the dc bus between the main and auxiliary sources

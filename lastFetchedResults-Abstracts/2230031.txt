Objective: Anemia can have multiple adverse effects on pregnancy outcome. Recent studies suggested an association between H. Pylori infection and iron deficiency anemia. The present study aimed to investigate the association between iron deficiency anemia and H. pylori infections among pregnant women referring to antenatal care center of Shahid Akbarabadi hospital during the year 2010, Tehran, Iran.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 180 pregnant women in their first trimester. Demographic data and clinical data were collected by a gynecologist as-sistant in the center, 5 ml blood was collected from women. The hemoglobin level and the ferritin level were measured. The serology test of H. pylori IgG was measured by ELIZA test.
Results: The mean hemoglobin level of participants was 12.03 Â± 1.4 g/dl. Fifty two of the participants (31.0%) had a hemoglobin level less than 11 g/dl. Fifty one of the par-ticipants (30.4%) had a ferritin level less than 15 mg/dl. 91 participants (54.2%) were positive for H.pylori.There was a significant difference in nausea and vomiting and be-ing serologically positive for H. Pylori (P = 0.003).
Conclusion: There was a significant and adverse correlation between being serologically H. Pylori positive and hemoglobin level (P = 0.005, r = -0.218), and ferritin level (P = 0.001, r = -0.263).

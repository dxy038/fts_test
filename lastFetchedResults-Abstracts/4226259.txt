The objective of this research is to specify Ischemic Stroke Area by assigning Threshold level of Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) from CBV (Cerebral Blood Volume) and CBF (Cerebral Blood Flow) images. Our experimental results will be shown in N-Match (normal tissue areas), D-Match (dead tissue areas), Mismatch (blood cot tissue areas) and Undefined area. Then, separate the brain into left and right to specify Ischemic Stroke Area. As a result of experiment in 10 Stroke patients sample by setting CBV Threshold level to 2.5 ml/100g (&#177;1.5) and CBF Threshold level to 20 ml/100g/min (&#177;10), the distribution of N-Match, D-Match, Mismatch and Undefined depends on their threshold. So, it is possible to sort elementary information of left and right side of the brain to specify Ischemic Stroke Area in order to compare the results with brain specialists.

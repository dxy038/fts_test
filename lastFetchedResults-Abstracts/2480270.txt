Tuberculosis (TB) disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains as one of the leading infectious causes of death and disease throughout the world. The history of tuberculosis as a worldwide fatal illness traces back to antiquity, being a well-known disease in ancient civilizations. Presented here, is a brief review of the history of tuberculosis and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine development in the world as well as its historical background in Iran, mainly during the 19th and 20th centuries using a wide range of published information sources until the last months of 2013. TB causative agent remained unidentified until the last decade of the 19th century, when Robert Koch discovered it. At present, preparation of the BCG vaccine, application of the Mantoux intradermal diagnostic tuberculosis test and administration of proper antituberculosis medications have eventually controlled tuberculosis. However, despite these significant advancements, tuberculosis remains a major concern, particularly in developing countries including Iran after the emergence of both multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV co-infection

The design of a fuzzy logic supervisor for a reconfigurable flight control law is described in this paper. The objective of the supervisor is to maintain the original performance of the aircraft after effector failure by adjusting the gains of the existing control law. In this design the pitch axis control of the unmanned research vehicle was selected as the test platform. The set of fuzzy rules obtained ensures the even distribution of control authority to the remaining healthy effecters. A comparison of the reconfigured aircraft response with and without the fuzzy logic supervisor is presented. Simulation results show an improvement in the reconfigured response using a fuzzy logic supervisor

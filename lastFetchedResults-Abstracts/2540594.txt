Purpose: Knee osteoarthritis is one of the most common musculoskeletal problems and knee varus is one of the most common lower limb disorders in people with knee osteoarthritis which can affect the elderlys` daily activities, pain, and posture control. The objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of core stability exercises on the balance and pain in eldery people with knee varus and osteoarthritis. Methods: In this semiexperimental study, 24 women (age range: 5065 years, average: 55.62 years) with knee varus and osteoarthritis wanted were recruited and divided randomly into two groups of experimental and control groups. The amount of patients` pain was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS). Moreover, the BIODEX device was used to measure the level of balance. The experimental group performed core stability exercises for 8 weeks, every week, and three sessions. For statistical analysis, dependent and independent T student tests were employed. Results: Static balance and pain in the experimental group showed a significant change after eight weeks of core stabilization exercises compared to pretest (p&lt;0.05). Changes between groups for pain scale also showed significant differences (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that a period of core stability exercises may influence the static balance and pain in elderly people with knee varus and osteoarthritis. Also core stability exercises can be used as a method for reducing the amount of pain in knee joint and making stability and improvement in balance in elderly patients with knee varus and osteoarthiritis.

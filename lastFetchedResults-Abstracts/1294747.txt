In this paper we propose an exact method able to solve multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems. This method is an extension, for any number of objectives, of the 2-Parallel Partitioning Method (2-PPM) we previously proposed. Like 2-PPM, this method is based on splitting of the search space into several areas, leading to elementary searches. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated using a multi-objective flow-shop problem.

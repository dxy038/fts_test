Tradeoffs in the design of the timing recovery functions in a subscriber loop receiver are analyzed. The techniques considered are applicable to both the echo cancellation (EC) and time compression multiplexing (TCM) methods of full duplex transmission. Emphasis is on those techniques that lend themselves to implementation in MOSLSI technology, where the objective requirement is that timing recovery be implemented on a sampled-data signal (with the minimum possible sampling rate where EC is used). The wave difference method (WDM) for timing recovery appears to be the best candidate. A detailed study of its performance is carried out analytically and by computer simulation for the case of binary and alternate mark-inversion (AMI) line coding. A closed form expression describing the binary jitter performance of the WDM and its continuous time counterpart, the spectral line technique, is used to compare the two techniques. Analytical and simulation results for recovered phase and jitter are presented for various cable pulse responses carefully chosen to represent worst-case or nearly worst-case conditions. Two methods for including frequency detection in the WDM, the quadricorrelator and the rotational detector, are also simulated.

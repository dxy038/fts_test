This paper addresses the transmit power control with multiple antennas. A theoretical comparison of transmit diversity and beamforming techniques in the presence of fading correlation at an antenna array and handoff is presented. The objective is to investigate transmit power of both system and investigate the effect of array perturbations that exist in practical applications of antenna arrays. The perturbations are modeled as additive random errors, following complex Gaussian multivariate distribution, to the antenna array steering vectors. Using the outage probability of the instantaneous channel capacity and transmitter power as performance measures, we conclude that by overlooking array perturbations the performance evaluation tends to underestimate and overestimate, respectively, the transmit diversity and beamforming systems in practical application environments.

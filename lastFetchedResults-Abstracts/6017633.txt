This paper describes the application of two multi-objective optimisation techniques to the high efficiency deep grinding process. The process is modelled using a fuzzy expert system. This allows understanding gained through theoretical analysis to be combined with empirical data in a solitary model. The objective is to simultaneously minimise the surface temperature and specific grinding energy. A problem constraint is represented within the fuzzy model. It forms an objective representing the degree of feasibility of the solution.

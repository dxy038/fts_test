This paper presents the multi-objective design of concentric ring antenna arrays for isoflux radiation. The purpose of this paper is to present the application of an evolutionary multi-objective optimization technique to design concentric ring antenna arrays for isoflux radiation in GEO and MEO satellites. This multi-objective design of concentric ring antenna arrays considers the optimization of the spacing between rings and the amplitude excitation across the antenna elements. The objective designs are the isoflux radiation desired and the side lobe level.

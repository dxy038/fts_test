Reverse micellar extraction (RME) of enzyme provides an attractive option for conventional method with the potential to achieve purification and concentration in a single step with high yield. This study presents a methodology for optimization of RME with Pseudomonas lipase as model system. Fold-purification, percent recovery and extraction time were the objective functions while the type and concentration of surfactant, contact time, pH, ionic strength, and the ratio of organic to aqueous phase were the decision variables. Under optimized conditions, the AOT (Aerosol OT (bis 2-ethylhexyl) sodium sulfosuccinate)â€“isooctane system gave a 15-fold purification, 80% recovery and 2.5-fold concentration of the Pseudomonas lipase with process time of 45 min.

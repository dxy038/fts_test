Backgrand: Cotinine (COT) is a major degradation product of nicotine (NIC). The
participation of leptin in female reproduction is well-established, but any role in
male reproductive function is at the best tenuous.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in-vitro effects of nicotine,
cotinine and leptin on sperm parameters in normal semen of non-smokers fertile
men.
Materials and Methods: Ten healthy nonsmokers aged 25-40 years old were
devided into 7 groups, Thier semens were divided into 7 aliquots. (A) was layered
with basal solution 70 ng/ml NIC, (B) 35 ?g/ml NIC, (C) 300 ng/ml COT, (D) 200
?g/ml COT, (E) 30 ng/ml leptin, (F) 300 ng/ml leptin respectively and (G) was
layered with mHTF. After migration, the samples were examined at time 0, +1, +2,
+4, +8, and + 24 h of incubation.
Results: These findings were obtained: sperm count: 75.66±66.25x10 6 /ml, forward
motility: 75.55±14.80%, progress: 33.66±13.01, VSL: 51.58±6.99 ?m/s, VCL:
103.33±14.52 ?m/s, ALH: 4.33±0.77 ?m, BCF: 25.60±2.97 HZ, STR: 79.33±8.04
%, LIN: 52.55±10.52 %, ELO: 74.22 ± 12.76 % and ARE: 3.04 ± 1.50 u/sq. The
parameters were similar before 8 hr and were being decreased after that.
Conclusion: According to the results. nicotin and cotinin have negative effects on
the sperm parameters but despite the positive effect of leptin, there is no correlation
between leptin concentration in semen and its physical characteristics.

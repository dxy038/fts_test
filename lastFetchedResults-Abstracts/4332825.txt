High Definition (HD) content delivery over IP networks is now a reality in the entertainment marketplace. Such networks can suffer packet loss, especially on the last mile link. This results in time-variant video quality. In this paper we first present an analysis of the human perception of network impairment on HD IPTV quality. Second, we propose a method, based on common objective measurements, to estimate subjective judgments of time-variant quality. A testbed was deployed to emulate a real use case of delivering high definition TV material over an IPTV network. The quality of the delivered H.264/AVC encoded video was evaluated objectively in an emulated environment where packet loss impairments were generated. Objective measurements were then compared to continuous subjective quality ratings. Based on the obtained results, highly correlated models were developed for the estimation of instantaneous user judgment of impaired HD broadcast IPTV.

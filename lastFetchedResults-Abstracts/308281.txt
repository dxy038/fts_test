The present meta-analytic review examined the relationship between interpersonal violence and psychological distress, utilizing 50 published or prepublication empirical studies. Studies were included in the review if they quantified psychological distress following childhood sexual or physical abuse, rape, criminal assault, or partner (domestic) physical abuse or rape. The overall effect size, though heterogeneous, was clinically and practically significant, demonstrating empirically that interpersonal violence has deleterious effects on psychological functioning. Within victimized groups, specific objective and subjective stressor-related factors were examined for the magnitude of their effect on resulting psychological distress. Subjective factors, such as general appraisal, self-blame, and perceived life threat, contributed twice as much to the magnitude of psychological distess as did objective factors, such as physical injury, force, and use of a weapon. Generally, psychological distress in the domains of intra- and interpersonal functioning emerged as theoretically and clinically important avenues for further research.

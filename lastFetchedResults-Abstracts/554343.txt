In a general, the phonetic correction contains activities that would be briefly presented in each method. But, nowadays, in a more profound and more serious study of phonetic correction, which is considered as a scientific branch in the methodology of language and teaching, we observe that a profound survey on the purposes, principles and the way and techniques of each method needs a scientific research.

In this research, the major objective is to find a scientific way to describe and analyze separately, the current methods, thus, all the positive and critical points in each method. Following this principle, the aim of the authors was to find out which method would be adapted among the existing methods in phonetic correction,

Among the five current methods in an international area, the following conclusion was resulted: Even if the application of laboratory method and articulatory method is easy to be realized (which is considered as principal reason in their development), we observed that the verbo-tonal method would be more efficient. In the end, an educational perspective is presented following the chosen method.

In this paper a binaural noise reduction system based on the adaptive matched filter array (MFA) and post-filtering is presented. The binaural MFA filter is formed using the interaural impulse response between left and right microphone signal which is estimated by means of the NLMS algorithm. The residual noise reduction by three post-filter types is then compared and evaluated according to objective and subjective measures. Furthermore, the performance of the algorithm for preserving binaural cues is discussed.

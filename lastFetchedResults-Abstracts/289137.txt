Objective:
We studied the etiology, clinical features and outcome of patients with bacterial meningitis from an urban Chinese city over a 10-years period.
Methods:
We reviewed the files of all persons aged 15-years old or above diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial meningitis from a regional hospital. The clinical findings, relevant laboratory and imaging results as well as outcome were recorded in cases with microbiological evidence of meningitis. Neurosurgical and pediatric patients were excluded.
Results:
Sixty-five patients between the ages of 15 and 86 years of age (mean 52 years) were identified of whom 18 (28%) died. The four most common causes were Mycobacteria tuberculosis (46%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), Streptococcus suis (9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%). Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae were rare pathogens. The annual incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis was 1.27/100,000 adults. Delay in treatment was associated with a poorer prognosis (p < 0.001, OR = 38.84, CI = 7.33â€“205.80).
Conclusion:
The causative organisms found in this region of China differ from that reported from Europe and the US; tuberculous meningitis is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis.

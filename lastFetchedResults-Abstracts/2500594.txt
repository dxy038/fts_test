Introduction: Many employees in different professions including nurses work with shifts.
On the other hand, different and long shift work can endanger physical and mental health
of nurses. This study, according to ergonomic standards, aimed to design a model for shift
working in order to minimize the problems caused by shift work.
Methods: In this study, all 35 nurses working in the emergency ward of Imam Sajjad
(AS) Hospital of Ramsar city, Iran, were considered. Then, the information gathered
from answering the Morningness-Eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) (Circadian
rhythm) and Survey Sampling International (SSI) (personal and social charactristics)
questionnaire were changed to a model and then reconstruct after comparing it again with
circadian rhythm principals. The final model was implemented with GAMS (gammaglutamylaminomethylsulfonic
acid) and at the end, shift working with ergonomic criteria
were proposed.
Results: Shift working were designed for each nurse. Also, the obtained objective function
value (Z=1.110223e16-) showed that the designed model was really close to ideal model.
According to hospital rules and policies, if five more nurses get added to the currently
employed ones, the proposed working program on one hand will improve satisfaction and
efficiency of nurses and on the other hand it can decrease the effects of disorders on shift
work.
Conclusions: Hospitals can have healthy and motivated workforce by applying the
scientific approach to adjust a suitable working plan for their nurses and decrease the
number of disabilities and also the rate of early retirement.

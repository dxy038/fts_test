Objective
The objective of the present study was to verify the effect of a dietary oil, consisting mainly of diacylglycerol (DAG) oil, in a typical meal on postprandial changes in serum triacylglycerol (TAG) and remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) compared with dietary triacylglycerol (TAG) oil.
Methods

In a double-blind, randomized, crossover design, 43 healthy Japanese men and women ingested test meals (2093 kJ of energy, 30 g of protein, 19 g of lipids, and 51 g of carbohydrates) containing 10 g of DAG oil (DAG meal) or TAG oil (TAG meal). Blood samples were collected in a fasting state (0 h) and at 2, 3, 4, and 6 h after ingestion of the meal.
Results

Postprandial TAG, RLP-C, and chylomicron TAG concentrations were significantly lower after the DAG meal compared with the TAG meal. In 29 subjects with fasting serum TAG levels of at least 1.13 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), differences in postprandial serum changes between meal types were even more remarkable and the incremental areas under the response curve (0 to 6 h) for serum TAG and RLP-C concentrations after the DAG meal were significantly smaller than those after the TAG meal.
Conclusions

These results suggest that DAG oil in the daily diet is useful for the prevention of postprandial hyperlipidemia and related disorders.

The selection of optimal wastewater treatment alternative involves multiple objectives and/or criteria and hierarchy process. This study integrates analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and grey relation analysis (GRA) for optimal selection of full scale tannery effluent treatment plants. For this purpose, seven tanneries and their effluent treatment facilities are studied in detail in Southern India. The objective hierarchy criterion is considered based on three factors; economic, technical, and administrative, each of which again involves hierarchy of indices. A realistic treatment alternative selection is obtained since all the data used is on actual basis. The biggest advantage of this approach is that it provides the information regarding the scope for further improvement in existing treatment options. The study indicates that the AHP and grey relation analysis are powerful tools that can be used for implementation of appropriate wastewater treatment technology.

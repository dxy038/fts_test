The objective was to know about the various prognostic factors affecting the outcome of surgical procedures while treating typhoid enteric perforation.Ninety~eight patients, suspected having typhoid perforation by their history, clinical examination and operative findings were included in the study. The main prognostic variables were age, sex, duration of illness, peritoneal contamination (amount of fluid/pus), number of perforations and general condition of the patient. The complications like wound infection, wound dehiscence, residual abscess, faecal fistula, renal failure and mortality were all recorded. No significant association was observed with age and sex, while duration of illness, number of perforations, amount of peritoneal soiling and the general condition of the patients were the major variables affecting the outcome. Those patients having single perforation and presented early in the course of their disease with minimal amount of peritoneal soiling and in good general condition suffered minimal complications,

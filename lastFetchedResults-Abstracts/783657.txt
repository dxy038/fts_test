Objective Gender ratios of suicide rates
differ greatly across countries. Victoria has a high male:
female ratio in suicide that is typical in English-speaking
and European countries, while in Hong Kong the low
ratio is similar to other SouthEast Asian countries. This
study investigates the effect of gender in the psychiatric
and non-psychiatric populations to examine how psychiatric
history may modulate the effect of gender in
these two different communities. Method Review of
coronial documentation of all suicide cases in 2000 in
Hong Kong and Victoria, Australia. Log-linear model
was used to test the gender-psychiatric history-location
interaction. Results Gender difference in suicide was
narrower in victims with psychiatric history than those
without in both communities, albeit gender remained
to have an effect even among those with a psychiatric
history in Victoria. The impact of cultural- and genderspecific
factors is most apparent in suicide cases with
no prior psychiatric history in Victoria: the male:
female ratio was as high as 8:1 in this group of victims.
Log-linear model results show that the gender-psychiatric
history-location interaction was statistically significant.
Conclusions The gender differentials in
suicide rates in these two communities are mainly
driven by gender’s effect in the population with
no psychiatric history. Severe clinical conditions
can override some, but not all, of gender’s effects
in Victoria. Suicide prevention effort should target
gender-specific factors to prevent suicides in men
without history of psychiatric disorders.

Access control is always essential for safe and security access to the system resource. Role based access control (RBAC) model is widely used in large enterprise software systems. The quality of the RBAC policy design especially role definition has great impact on the system security policy implementation. In this paper we propose a novel role engineering methods with security KAOS (SKAOS), which guide the engineering process via keeping decomposing the functional requirement objective and combining the system security requirement. SKAOS not only simplifies the system userpsilas involvement in the role engineering process via supplying with the objective decomposition but also reduces the complexity of the operation analysis. After building the objective decomposition and activity analysis diagrams, the role definition can be delivered. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method via analyzing a real world requirement problem.

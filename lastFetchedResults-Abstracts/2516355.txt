Background and Objective: One of the antioxidant enzymes in Organisms is (SOD), which is involvedin the production ofH202. HeatShock Protein70 (HSP70) created in stress conditions and It has anti-inflammatory effects andtoprotectcellsagainst oxidative damageto nucleus and lipid cell membrane. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of six weeks of endurance training and Silymarin supplementation on SOD and HSP inof unathletes men students.
Subjects and Methods: in this study students of all Islamic Azad University of chalous branch were investigated. The subjects in this study was concluded of 32 unathletes male with age of 20Â±2years was selected from randomly. Subject selection of samples in four groups of 8 individuals included: endurance (E), endurance and Silymarin consumption (ES), Silymarin consumption (S) and control (C). Results by The t-test and one-way analysis of variance were used. To determine the difference between the groups, Tukey test was used to show the significant changes in each of the groups.
Results: The study of SOD and HSP70 in   subject groups before and after training show that these values were in order significant increase and decrease in ES and S groups (p?0/05).Studies of Dependent variables show that levels of SOD between any of the groups of subjects no significant difference but amounts of HSP70 between subject groups were significant. Tukey's test showed that the values Between E-S and ES-S was significant.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that six weeks of selected endurance training and Silymarin supplement consumption Cause of Increase the antioxidant capacity of the body.

Objective
The potential hypolipidemic effect of a new cocoa product rich in dietary fiber (DF) naturally containing antioxidant polyphenols (cocoa fiber [CF]) was studied in a rat model of dietary-induced hypercholesterolemia.
Methods

For 3 wk animals were fed normal, cholesterol-free diets or diets supplemented with cholesterol to evoke hypercholesterolemia. Control diets contained 10% cellulose as DF, and test diets were supplemented with 165 g of CF per kilogram (providing 10% DF). Lipid profile, total antioxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde were measured in serum in addition to the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase and concentrations of glutathione and malondialdehyde in the liver.
Results

Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia were established as a consequence of the cholesterol-rich diets. CF showed an important hypolipidemic action, returning triacylglycerol levels in hypercholesterolemic animals to normal values. The hypocholesterolemic effect was also patent, reducing total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, yet basal values were not attained. Decreased lipid peroxidation in serum and liver as a consequence of CF intake was patent not only in hypercholesterolemic but also in normocholesterolemic animals. No apparent effects on serum total antioxidant capacity or on the activity of antioxidant enzymes and hepatic levels of glutathione were observed. These effects might be attributed to the high DF content of CF and to the natural presence of antioxidant polyphenols.
Conclusion

The consumption of CF with a hypercholesterolemic diet improved the lipidemic profile and reduced lipid peroxidation, suggesting that CF might contribute to a reduction of cardiovascular risk.

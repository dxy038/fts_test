Herein we develop a psychophysical model of decision making based on the difference between objective clock time and the human brainâ€™s perception of time. In this model the utility function is given by the survival probability, which is shown to be a generalized hyperbolic distribution. The parameters of the utility function are fit to intertemporal choice model experimental data and decision making is determined to be a 1/f-noise process.

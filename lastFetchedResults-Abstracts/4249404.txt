One of sustainable concrete engineering criteria deals with founded new alternative materials can be used in concrete mixes or structures. The objective of this study is to develop normal strength concrete using local crushed Al-Ma´mora stones and to evaluate the effect of a new coarse aggregate on mechanical and physical properties of produced concrete, also compared with normal (conventional coarse aggregate) concrete mix. In general, a new concrete mix shows higher than strength of normal concrete due to low porosity, particularly, when crushed coarse aggregate is used. However, the compressive strengths of new concrete mix using Al-Ma´mora and conventional (reference) aggregates are improved by 20%, due to texture modification. Also, the flexural strength of this concrete was higher than the reference concrete by 51.7%, and the splitting strength Almaamora stone concrete was higher than the reference concrete by 42.4%.

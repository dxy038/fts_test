This paper presents the first successful application of multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) to transmission line modeling. Conventionally, it is difficult to simultaneously realize high-accuracy transmission line simulations for both the frequency and time-domains. In order to overcome the problem, this paper proposes the application of MOGA to transmission line modeling. The proposed modeling method has two distinctive features: (1) Simultaneous modeling of both frequency and time-domain characteristics. (2) Selection of conventional model from among set of Pareto optimization solutions based on simulation objectives. The results of an experiment with a micro-strip line demonstrate that the proposed method accomplished a transmission line simulation up to 2.54 times more accurate than conventional methods.

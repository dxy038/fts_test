Rangelands have covered the majority of the continents and 43 percent of the all lands round
the world cattle; so. they are very important in production and protection of water resource, soil
and plant cover. The vast areas of rangelands of Kurdistan province are grazed by cattle. The
main objective of this study was to determine the cattle grazing intensities effect on the soil of
Charandoo rangelands which is located 23 km north of Sanandaj. Three different grazing site of:
reference (light grazing) ere chosen as the study area. Forage production and physical soil
factors such as bulk density, percent of porosity, water content and aggregate stability were
measured by standard methods. Ten replications were used in this experiment. The statistical
results show that cattle grazing have a significant effect on the plant cover and production. The
soil bulk density increased significant with intensive grazing. The water content, percent of
porosity and the proportion of the aggregate stability decreased as the result of intensive
grazing. The final results indicate that cattle grazing may cause rather big changes on the
physical properties of surface soil. As the project region enjoys suitable yearly rainfall, if the
intensity of grazing is in a moderate level, the region will be ale to recompense and to make
better tolerance the damages arisen from cattle trampling

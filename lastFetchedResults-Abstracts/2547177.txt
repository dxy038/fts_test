Objective: This project aimed to study early maladaptive schemas in adults with parents afflicted with schizophrenia.&nbsp;
Methods: In a causal-comparative study, a sample of 39 adults with one schizophrenic parent as the experiment group and 40 students without schizophrenic parents as the control group were selected. Both groups completed early maladaptive schema questionnaire. Descriptive statistics as well as multi-and single-variable analysis of variance were applied.&nbsp;
Results: Significant differences were found in early maladaptive schemas of rejection/disconnection, impaired autonomy/performance, and over vigilance/inhibitions as well as in the subscales of emotional deprivation, defectiveness/shame, failure, and unrelenting standards.&nbsp;
Conclusion: Feelings of failure and insecurity leads to formation of early maladaptive schemas in children of schizophrenia. The chronicity of schizophrenia, patients&rsquo; behavioral difficulties, and stigmatization lead to feelings of defectiveness and lack of security in children and early maladaptive schemas.

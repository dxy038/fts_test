One of the main challenges in Irans auto industry is goal setting in various functional domains.
Managing costs of supply chains requires recognition of cost drivers and mathematical modeling for
target setting. Realization of the main elements of supply chains and setting logical relations among
variables and parameters in the form of a mathematical model are of the main purposes of this research
paper. The main question is how it is possible to bring con
ict goals of a supply chain together in
a mathematical model with the help of goal programming. The relations among 10 au (1)1to part
suppliers, 1 warehouse, 3 auto manufacturing plants and 3 agencies are investigated in this study.
After collecting data of model parameters, model is solved through application of LINGO software
and the following results are revealed. The positive goal deviation of the rst objective is equal to
2500 million Rials. The negative goal deviation of the second objective is equal to 1750 million Rials.
The positive goal deviation of the third objective is 1250 million Rials.

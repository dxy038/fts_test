We present an error concealment method to recover damaged blocks for block-based image coding schemes. The recovery problem considered in our method is to estimate a larger block, which consists of a damaged block and the undamaged neighborhood, from the undamaged neighborhood. To find an accurate estimate, an overcomplete basis is introduced and an estimate is expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors. The projections onto the overcomplete basis algorithm is proposed to find the projection coefficients to minimize the squared difference of an estimate and the undamaged neighborhood information. The reconstructed images by the proposed method provide a good subjective quality as well as an objective one

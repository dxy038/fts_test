Objective
rpose of this study was to clarify the effect of the body profile on the whole saliva flow rate in healthy male and female subjects.
design
ole saliva flow rate was evaluated under unstimulated (UWSFR) and stimulated conditions by the gum test (SWSFR-GT) and Saxon test (SWSFR-ST), and its correlation with body profiles such as body height (BH), body weight (BW), body surface area (BSA) and body mass index (BMI) was analysed in 100 male and 100 female subjects.
s
erages of UWSFR, SWSFR-GT and SWSFR-ST and those of BH, BW, BSA and BMI were significantly larger in males than in females (p &lt; 0.0001). No correlation was observed between any of UWSFR, SWSFR-GT and SWSFR-ST and any of BH, BW, BSA and BMI for either males or females. However, UWSFR, SWSFR-GT and SWSFR-ST were significantly correlated with BH, BW and BSA when data from male and female subjects were combined.
sion
ole saliva flow rate from an individual should only be compared with the data from the group of the same gender.

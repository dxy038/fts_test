SIMMOS is a multiple-delay logic simulator for MOS VLSI circuits based on the switch-level model. In addition to finding the ternary logic state at each node, SIMMOS estimates the time delay required for that state to become valid. The delay calculation method, based on the theory of RC trees, is introduced as a natural extension of the dominant-path algorithm used for node state evaluation. Multi-level simulation in SIMMOS is achieved by using special models for gate-level primitives, and the ability to drive, and be driven by an RTL simulation environment. For test-pattern grading, SIMMOS uses a probabilistic fault analysis algorithm, modified to operate on bidirectional as well as gate-level models.

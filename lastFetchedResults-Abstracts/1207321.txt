The need to have efficient storage schemes for spatial networks is apparent when the volume of query processing in some road networks (e.g., the navigation systems) is considered. Specifically, under the assumption that the road network is stored in a central server, the adjacent data elements in the network must be clustered on the disk in such a way that the number of disk page accesses is kept minimal during the processing of network queries. In this work, we introduce the link-based storage scheme for clustered road networks and compare it with the previously proposed junction-based storage scheme. In order to investigate the performance of aggregate network queries in clustered road networks, we extend our recently proposed clustering hypergraph model from junction-based storage to link-based storage. We propose techniques for additional storage savings in bidirectional networks that make the link-based storage scheme even more preferable in terms of the storage efficiency. We evaluate the performance of our link-based storage scheme against the junction-based storage scheme both theoretically and empirically. The results of the experiments conducted on a wide range of road network datasets show that the link-based storage scheme is preferable in terms of both storage and query processing efficiency.

A new approach to the model matching problem of linear time invariant (LTI) systems is given based on an algorithm for poles assignment of linear discrete periodic systems. In contrast to previous frequency-domain methods, a consideration from time-domain viewpoint is discussed. Through periodic state feedback, the matching problem of LTI systems is solved by solving an optimal problem, whose objective function is related with eigenvectors of the closed-loop systems generated by parametric poles assignment algorithm for linear discrete periodic systems. A numerical example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

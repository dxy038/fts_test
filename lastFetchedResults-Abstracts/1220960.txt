Reservoir characterization plays an important role in different parts of an industrial project. The
results from a reservoir characterization study give insight into rock and fluid properties which can
optimize the choice of drilling locations and reduce risk and uncertainty. Delineating hydrocarbon
bearing zones within a reservoir is the main objective of any seismic reservoir characterization
study. In the current study, using limited well control and seismic data, an attempt was made to
predict the productive zones of a reservoir using elastic impedance inversion. Elastic impedance logs
at near and far angles of incidence have been crossplotted to find the desired productive parts of the
formation. Two partial angle stack seismic data have been inverted using a model-based post-stack
seismic inversion. The crossplot of the two inverted volumes is interpreted based on the results from
the well location. Finally, the hydrocarbon bearing zones of the reservoir was delineated according
to the seismic crossplot analysis.

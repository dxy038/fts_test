Customers of telecommunication services are strongly interested in the service outage time. In order to respond to these requirements, the following measures are now being investigated. The first is to keep the frequency of outages of which the duration time exceeds a certain length under a certain level, and the second is to inform the customers of the residual outages time when a service outage occurs. The evaluation and design method of the frequency of long outages has been developed in order to achieve the first objective. The prediction method of the residual outage time has also been developed for the second objective. Moreover, the software tool for assisting one to carry out those measures are also being developed. The outline of those evaluation and prediction methods and the software tool is described.

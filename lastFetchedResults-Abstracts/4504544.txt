The Kazakh language was under the unofficial ban in the Soviet period. In recent years, Kazakh-language segment of the Internet is developing rapidly. The development of the Kazakh language has become the first priority of the government. The most successful and large-scale project on revival of the Kazakh language was the creation of WikiBilim fund. The main objective of the fund is to increase the articles in the Kazakh language on Wikipedia. Also, the fund is actively assisting in the creation of digital library, online translator and dictionary. Will WikiBilim be a salvation of the Kazakh language on the Internet?

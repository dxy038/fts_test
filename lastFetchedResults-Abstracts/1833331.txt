Aim and objectives: Comparison of duration of symptoms and type of symptoms in patients diagnosed with a mass in right iliac fossa.
Materials and Methods
Total of 50 cases were included in the study. Detailed history was taken from all the patients. Based on the clinical diagnosis the patients were divided into Appendicular mass, Appendicular abscess, Ileocaecal tuberculosis, Carcinoma of caecum and others. In each of the cases duration symptoms and type of symptoms were noted at different time intervals. Presence of a mass in the right iliac fossa was confirmed in all the patients. The data of the patients were expressed in number and percentage.   
Results
In 50 patients 44% were diagnosed to have appendicular mass and 21 out of the total of 22 patients had symptoms for 2-30 days duration. Most others had symptoms for 1-3 months. Fever (63%) was the major symptoms observed in appendicular mass patients. In all the cases loss of weight was a minor symptom compared to fever and vomiting. There was significant difference in incidence between patients who presented with mass per abdomen as a symptom ranging from 9% (Appendicular mass and Appendicular abscess) to 36.40 % (Others). 
Conclusion 
The study results explained that symptom of mass was present for a duration of 2-30 days in patients with appendicular mass with fever as a major symptom as compared to others. Similar type of studies required to get more information related to symptoms in patients with a mass in the right iliac fossa. Such studies would help physicians to improve the quality of treatment.

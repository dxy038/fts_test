In this paper we study different modeling strategies for reparable systems, that have more than one aging parameters. We propose four approaches that use Monte-Carlo simulations, proportional hazards models, multi-variate Weibull along with numerical optimization methods and maximum likelihood estimation. The objective of this study is to investigate modeling strategy that predicts systemÂ´s reliability and availability more accurately and to see if different strategies fit well on different systems based on the interactions among aging parameters. This study will provide a comparison of modeling strategies to estimate reliability and availability of reparable systems.

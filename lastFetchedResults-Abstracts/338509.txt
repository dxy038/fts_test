Objective
Progenipoietin-1 is an agonist of both the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 receptors capable of inducing the proliferation of multiple hematopoietic cell lineages. The potential of progenipoietin-1 to mobilize transplantable hematopoietic stem cells into the peripheral blood was evaluated.
Methods

Cohorts of donor mice were treated with either progenipoietin-1, fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 ligand, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, or a vehicle control. Hematopoietic progenitor/stem-cell activity in donor blood was assayed by radioprotection, multilineage reconstitution, secondary transplantation, and competitive repopulation.
Results

Only 1 μL of peripheral blood from progenipoietin-1–treated donors was required to protect 80% of lethally irradiated mice, while in contrast 1 μL of peripheral blood from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor–treated donors failed to protect any recipients. The radioprotected recipients of progenipoietin-1–treated donor cells showed donor-derived (Ly5.2) multilineage hematopoietic reconstitution for up to 6 months. Serial transplantation studies using bone marrow from radioprotected, chimeric recipients demonstrated long-term donor-derived hematopoiesis, indicating the successful transplantation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells. The engraftment potential of progenipoietin-1 donor-derived cells was directly compared with donors treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 ligand alone or in combination. Both spleen colony-forming activity and competitive repopulating activity was highest in the blood from progenipoietin-1–treated donors.
Conclusion

These studies demonstrate that progenipoietin-1 is a potent mobilizer of transplantable hematopoietic stem cells and indicate that this dual-receptor agonist has greater biologic activity than its constituent molecules.

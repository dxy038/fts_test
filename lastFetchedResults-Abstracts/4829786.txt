The SPANEX software has been developed for the extraction of phonetic patterns from different corpuses. It provides a means of editing and analysing speech signals. The objective of this software is to increase the efficiency of acoustic-phonetic analysis of speech. Using this tool one can record and play back sentences, compute, display, and analyse spectrograms or pitch contours as well as perform the labelling of speech utterances. Moreover, coarticulation phenomena can be studied, the voiced/unvoiced error can be edited graphically and submitted to a smoothing procedure. Each speech segment may be zoomed in context, displayed and examined. Hence, SPANEX is an efficient and easy-to-use tool for the development of algorithms in speech recognition and synthesis

Two-way relaying is a promising scheme to achieve the ubiquitous mobile access to a reliable high data rate service, which is targeted for future mobile communication systems. In this contribution, we investigate two-way relaying with an amplify and forward relay, where the relay as well as the terminals are equipped with multiple antennas. Assuming that the terminals possess channel knowledge, the bidirectional two-way relaying channel is decoupled into two parallel effective single-user MIMO channels by subtracting the self-interference at the terminals. Thereby, any single-user MIMO technique can be applied to transmit the data. We derive an algebraic norm-maximizing (ANOMAX) transmit strategy by finding the relay amplification matrix which maximizes the weighted sum of the Frobenius norms of the effective channels and discuss the implications of this solution on the resulting signal to noise ratios. Finally, we compare ANOMAX to other existing transmission strategies via numerical computer simulations.

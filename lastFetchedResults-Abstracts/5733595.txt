The authors researches the grey multi-attribute problem, in which the attribute weights and the attribute values are interval numbers, and states the decision-making method based on two-phase optimization. Firstly, a linear objective programming model is established by considering in local, and ideal attribute weight of each alternative is obtained by solving the model. Secondly, a quadratic programming model is established by considering in whole, and the solving formula of the attribute weights is given. Therefore, the complex attribute value of each alternative is obtained. Based on these values, the prioritizing or optimization for alternatives is made. Finally, a practical example is given to show the feasibility and availability of the method.

Background : Drug addiction is a destructive misfortune that leads to recession in all fields. Accordingly , proper treatment of addiction is of great importance.
Objective : To evaluate the efficiency of TENS and ICWS on reduction of withdrawal syndrome signs of morphine.
Methods : Four groups of Spruge-Dawley type rats were dependent with morphine subcutaneosly in a standard condition. After dependency , the first group was considered as the control , the second and third group were affected with high frequency of TENS and ICWS respectively and the forth group was affected by ICWS and TENS together. In all groups naloxone was injected in the peritonium and the withrawal syndrome signs of morphine were studied. Statistical analysis were done by ANOVA , LSD , Kruskal-Walis and Mann-Witny.
Findings : TENS was very effective in reduction of jumping and climbing and also ICWS was very effective in reduction of petosis and rearing (P< 0.05). The interacted effect of TENS and ICWS didnot reduce some of the signs for example jumping , rearing , petosis and climbing. On the contrary , diarrhea , weight loss , yamning , abnormal posture and facial fasiculation were reducted significantly.
Conclusion : The interacted effect of TENS & ICWS reduced only few signs and each method could reduce the signs seperately. More studies on human mechanism is suggested.

We formulate a block processing objective function for the bit error rate (BER) cost function and present a nonlinear optimization strategy for its rapid minimization. The resulting algorithm is called the block Shanno minimum BER (BSMBER), which is conducted in the context of DS-CDMA with beamforming applications. Simulation analyses show the enhancements in convergence rate and BER performance of the proposed BSMBER over the popular MMSE and other minimum BER (MBER) based algorithms. In addition, the proposed algorithm has faster convergence rate over the gradient Newton algorithms while maintaining linearity in complexity.

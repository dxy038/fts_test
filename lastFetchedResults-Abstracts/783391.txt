Objective To investigate the incidence of
coercive measures in standard psychiatric care in
different psychiatric hospitals. Methods We developed
a common documentation of mechanical restraint,
seclusion, and medication by coercion, and
introduced it in 10 participating hospitals. We
developed software able to process the data and to
calculate four key indicators for routine clinical use.
Results 9.5% of 36,690 cases treated in 2004 were exposed
to coercive measures with the highest percentage
among patients with organic psychiatric disorders
(ICD-10 F0) (28.0%). Coercive measures were applied
a mean 5.4 times per case and lasted a mean 9.7 h each.
The incidence and duration of coercive measures
varied highly between different diagnostic groups and
different hospitals. Use of detailed guidelines for
seclusion and restraint was associated with a lower
incidence of coercive measures. Discussion Data
interpretation should consider numerous confounding
factors such as case mix and hospital characteristics.
Suggestions on how to cope with ethical and
technical problems in the processing of large multisite
data sets in routine clinical use are made.

The paper presents a weighted-norm approach for solving the multiobjective VAr planning problem. First, the weak bus-oriented criterion is used to determine the candidate buses for installing new VAr sources. Next, a weighted-norm (WN) approach based on simulated annealing (SA) is applied to solving general multiobjective VAr planning problems by assuming that the decision-maker (DM) has goals for each of the objective functions. Given the goals specified by the DM, the interactive algorithm can search for a satisfying noninferior solution for the DM. The method presented can obtain a desirable, global noninferior solution and reduce the solution space. Results of application of the proposed method to multiobjective VAr planning are presented

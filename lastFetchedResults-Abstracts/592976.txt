The Stewart platform manipulator is a fully kinematic linkage system that has major mechanical differences from typical serial link robots. It is a six-axis parallel robot manipulator with a high force-to-weight ratio and good positioning accuracy that exceeds that of a conventional serial link robot arm. This study examines the dynamic equations and control methodology for a Stewart platform. Because manual symbolic expansion of Stewart platform robot dynamic equations is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to errors, an automated derivation process is highly desired. The main goal of this work is to present an efficient procedure for computer generation of dynamic equations for a Stewart platform manipulator. As MATLAB has a powerful signal processing toolbox along with symbolic processing capabilities and is widely used as a common technical computing environment in many universities and research laboratories, the objective of this study was to develop a MATLAB-based approach for symbolic computation for a parallel linked robot. Additionally, a computed-torque control methodology is utilized for such a structure. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology.

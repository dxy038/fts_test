Objective Evaluate the frequency of
current smoking in elderly people living in urban
areas of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Methods Crosssectional
design. A representative sample of 6,961
elderly, randomly selected subjects, living in a community,
was examined to estimate the frequency of
current tobacco smoking. Tobacco use was measured
by means of a household questionnaire administered
by trained interviewers that inquired about current
tobacco use, sociodemographic characteristics, selfrated
physical and health status. Mental health was
evaluated using the Short Psychiatric Evaluation
Schedule (SPES). Results The prevalence of tobacco
use was 28.9% among men, 13.6% among women and
18.8% for both sexes. Male gender (OR = 3.25), low
income (OR = 1.52), years of schooling (illiterate)
(OR = 1.35), non-Protestant religion (OR = 2.17) and
absence of physical exercise (OR = 1.21) presented
positive and independent association with tobacco
use. Presence of pulmonary disease (OR = 1.93) and
mental distress (OR = 1.32) and absence of cardiac
disease (OR = 1.51), high blood pressure (OR = 1.51)
and diabetes (OR = 1.50) were independently associated
with an increased chance of current tobacco use.
Increasing age (OR = 0.93) and marital status (married)
(OR = 0.66) presented independent and negative
association with smoking. Conclusion Factors
associated with an increased chance of tobacco
smoking were: being men, illiterate, with lower
income, presence of respiratory and mental disease,
and absence of cardiac disease, high blood pressure
and diabetes. Factors associated with a decreased risk
of tobacco smoking were: aging, exercise, Protestant
religion and marriage

The objective of this paper is to present initial numerical test results for design and analysis of a new small scale self-excited induction generator (SEIG) for a newly designed sea wave energy converter (SWEC) device in the Mediterranean Sea to achieve a high efficiency and power quality. A two dimensional finite element analysis (2D-FEA) is used for numerical computations to consider flux density and circuit parameters of the SEIG for design purpose. This application takes into account the currents induced in the conducting regions (eddy currents) and the electric circuit associated to the SWEC device. The electromagnetic model described by a combined field and circuit equation model is used to perform the simulations and is solved in a finite element environment. The present results demonstrate that the suggested numerical approaches can be some guidelines for development of small wave energy induction generators for effective electricity generation.

Use of multi-objective particle swarm optimization for designing of planar multilayered electromagnetic absorbers and finding optimal Pareto front is described. The achieved Pareto presents optimal possible trade offs between thickness and reflection coefficient of absorbers. Particle swarm optimization method in comparison with most of optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms is simple and fast. But the basic form of multi-objective particle swarm optimization may not obtain the best Pareto. We applied some modifications to make it more efficient in finding optimal Pareto front. Comparison with reported results in previous articles confirms the ability of this algorithm in finding better solutions.

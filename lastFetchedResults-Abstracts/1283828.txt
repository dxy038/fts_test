With the objective to prepare novel non-peptidic thrombin inhibitors, bioisosteres of the inhibitory tripeptide d-Phe-Pro-Arg chain have been examined. Thus, the P1 Arg was replaced with p-amidinobenzylamine, an elongated homologue of the same and with 2,5-dichloro benzylamine. The P2-P3, d-Phe-Pro, was replaced with a novel tartaric acid template coupled to a series of readily available, mainly lipophilic, amines. Some of these compounds exhibit promising thrombin inhibition activity in vitro, IC50 ∼5.9 μM.

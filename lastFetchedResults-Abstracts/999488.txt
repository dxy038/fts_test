In 82% of contacts, carelessness is the underlying cause of exposure. Gown, glove, fume hood and mouth mask are routinely used by 97%, 48%, 34%, 1% of personnel, respectively.  Nearly all of (97%) personnel were vaccinated against hepatitis B and 78% of them have performed routine blood test for detecting any infections.

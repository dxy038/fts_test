Septicemia in neonates is the commonest cause of mortality. Early recognition and diagnosis of neonatal sepsis remains a challenge because of the variable and nonspecific clinical presentation. The laboratory criteria are often non specific and not fully reliable. The objective of this review is to highlight the various hematological and biological markers of neonatal sepsis. We searched PubMed and Elsevier’s web of science from studies evaluating the hematological and biological markers of neonatal sepsis. The key words used were “neonatal sepsis”, “hematological marker” and ”biomarker”. Since a battery of markers of neonatal sepsis are available, it is always better to rely on a combination of markers along with the clinical correlation.

Components on console are usually arranged by manual layout according to ergonomics standards and experiences in nuclear power plant. It is hard to balance many criterions, for it depends much on designerÂ´s judgments and preferences. This method leads to a random layout results. Particle swarm optimization is a solution to complex optimization problems with constraints, and has been applied successfully in layout and optimization fields. Fitness function was structured according to the evaluating indicators which include operation frequency and order and relationships between individuals. The optimization objective was evaluated by the hand moving distance. This method could be adopted to optimize the layout of components on human-machine interface in order to ensure safety and efficiency of the system. The troubles of subjective feelings and randomness are avoided. An example of 13 components is implemented to show the layout procedure.

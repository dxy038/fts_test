The folded waveguide (FWG) antenna is an advanced Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies launcher being designed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in collaboration with Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The FWG offers a drastic increase in radio frequency (RF) power density over typical loop antennas. It also results in internal electric fields of much lower magnitude near the plasma. It is scheduled far installation on either the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) or the Princeton Beta Experiment-Modified (PBX-M) tokamak in January 1996. The design objective is to provide an FWG that can withstand the thermal loads and disruption scenarios and meet the space constraints of both machines. The design is also intended to be prototypical for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The FWG is fully retractable, and maintenance operations can be performed while the vessel remains under vacuum. The FWG can operate in fast-wave mode, or it can be retracted, rotated 90&#176;,and reengaged for the ion-Bernstein wave launch. The polarizing plate completely covers the front of the antenna, except for slots cut at every other gap between vanes. This plate is interchangeable with plates of other configurations such as a 0-&#960; dipole plate

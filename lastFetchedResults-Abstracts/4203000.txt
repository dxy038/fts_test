Time-domain simulation of power system long-term dynamics involves the solution of large sparse systems of nonlinear stiff differential-algebraic equations. Simulation tools have traditionally focused on the accuracy of the solution and, in spite of many algorithmic improvements, time simulations still require a significant computational effort. In some applications, however, it is sufficient to have an approximate system response of the detailed model. The paper revisits the merits of the backward Euler method and proposes a strategy to control its step size, with the objective of filtering out fast stable oscillations and focusing on the aperiodic behaviour of the system. The proposed method is compared to detailed simulation as well as to the quasi-steady-state approximation. Illustrative examples are given on a small but representative system, subject to long-term voltage instability.

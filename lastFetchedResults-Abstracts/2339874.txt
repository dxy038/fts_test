Based on the theory of reliability-based structural shape optimization, exact expressions of the sensibility using the stochastic finite element method for contact problems were derived in detail, and the basic steps of structural optimization were given. A coattail-type tenon/mortise of an aero-engine was optimized. In this model, the maximum equivalent stress of the nodes on the boundary of the tenon was the objective function; the width of tooth's neck and the side surface's slope angle of a tenon were design variables, with constraints of tension stress, extrusion stress and reliability index. The result showed that the distributions of the contact pressure between tenon and mortise, the equivalence stress and reliability index were more reasonable. It validates the correctness of the optimization model and the reliability-based structural shape optimization, and provides valuable references for structural design of the tenon/mortise.

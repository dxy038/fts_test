formations surrounded by two impermeable layers. These aquifers are suitable
for seasonal thermal energy storage. The objective of this research is a parametric study
of the pressure distribution in an aquifer to be employed for thermal energy storage for
air-conditioning of a building complex. In design of an Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage
(ATES), a realistic model is needed to predict the aquifer's behavior. Here, the eects of
operating parameters on pressure distribution are investigated through a three-dimensional
nite dierence model. In an ATES, heat transfer occurs through both convection and
conduction. The convective heat transfer in ATES occurs because of pressure gradient.
Therefore, knowledge of the eects of various parameters on pressure distribution is
necessary. These parameters are: groundwater natural 
ow, the porosity and permeability
of the aquifer, injection and withdrawal rates from wells, the number and the arrangements
(being linear, triangular or rectangular) of injection and withdrawal wells. It has been found
that variation of the pressure drop inside an aquifer with increasing permeability is very
considerable in comparison with other parameters. Moreover, a validation is performed by
using 
uent software to verify the accuracy of the developed method.

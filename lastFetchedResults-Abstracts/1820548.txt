Objective
m of the present study was to assess the salivary levels of MUC5B and MUC7 in individuals with dyspeptic disease and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the stomach, compared to individuals without dyspeptic disease.
s
ividuals with dyspeptic disease, who underwent endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal complaints at Hospital Pedro Ernesto-RJ, Brasil and tested positive for H. pylori, and 23 controls with no dyspeptic disease, with mean age 53.5 ± 4.4 years, were included in the study. Saliva samples and 3 antral biopsy were taken for PCR analysis and histologic examination. In addition, saliva samples were tested by ELISA with F2 monoclonal antibody and EU7A antibody against MUC7, to determine MUC5B and MUC7 levels, prior to endoscopic examination. The expression pattern of the proteins was quantified by comparison to a pooled saliva sample of 19 healthy volunteers.
s
and MUC7 salivary levels were higher in the individuals with dyspeptic disease than in controls (p &lt; 0.0001). 33.3% (9/30) of the dyspeptic individuals and 0% of the controls had H. pylori in the oral cavity.
sions
duals with gastric diseases, with H. pylori in the stomach, showed higher levels of salivary H. pylori receptors–MUC5B and MUC7–than individuals without gastric diseases. These results suggest that higher levels of specific salivary mucins could be useful as risk indicators for infection by H. pylori.

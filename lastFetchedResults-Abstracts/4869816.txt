Multi-objective optimization reconstruction algorithm is one of the main methods to solve the limited angle image reconstruction. However we have great difficulty in selecting the right parameter reasonably because there is not only one objective function. So we give a new method to choose the parameter which was called homotopy parameter based on the theory of homotopy in this paper. Finally, the simulations were carried out to verify the proposed strategy, and the simulation results show that this algorithm is superior to the conventional multi-objective optimization methods in many aspects, such as less reconstruction errors, higher smoothness and gray value resolution.

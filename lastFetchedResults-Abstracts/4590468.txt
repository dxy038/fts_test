Sensors and actuators are used in wide range of applications in industry for monitoring, control and automation. Plug and play is a term used to describe the characteristics of a device specification which facilitates the discovery of a hardware component in the network. Management of the smart sensor nodes, similar to the IEEE 1451 Network Capable Application Processor (NCAP), in a network through plug and play reduces the tedious job of monitoring them manually. The objective of this paper is to extend on our previous work of communication between multiple nodes to show the plug and play capability. The demonstration uses IEEE 1451.1 definitions and architecture from a guideline and perspective point of view. If a universal on-the-wire format has been accepted, this work will be exactly applicable to IEEE 1451 approach.

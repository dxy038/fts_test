It is a U.S. Navy objective to minimize undesirable environmental effects of ships. A brief overview is given of early efforts to reach this goal and of lessons learned, followed by studies on the dispersion of sewage discharged by moving ships, acquisition of a data base and a unique test facility, of the development of sewage treatment systems (collection, holding and transfer; evaporative toilet; biodegradation; vacuum collection/incineration) and others (trash compactors, garbage grinders), of the integration of waste management and energy conservation (showers, laundry) and of reliability/maintainability development. Mention is made of work in progress.

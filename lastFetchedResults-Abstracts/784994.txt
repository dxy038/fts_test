Current research on Alzheimer's disease has been primarily focused on causes and treatment of the
disease and on reduction of costs of the burden of care to society. However, considerable emphasis now is placed
on person-centered care and the need to enhance the quality of life of people with chronic illnesses and
conditions. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias have not been a central part of this discussion despite the
lengthy course of the illness which has been described as the disappearance of the person. The purpose of this
article is to review the current state of knowledge about quality of life of persons with dementia and to
recommend a set of interventions toward enhancing their QoL. Results of the review indicate a set of objective
and subjective indicators of QoL with most interventions focused on compensating for losses related to the
disease. Based on recent research on personhood and on social exclusion, we propose a framework for creating
age-friendly dementia environments. It is based on hypotheses that quality of life can be enhanced through
augmenting personal resources and contexts; and that the progression of the illness results in changes in the 'best
fit' between resources and contexts

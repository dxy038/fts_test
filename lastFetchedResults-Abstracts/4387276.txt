A parametric model to estimate the degradation of objective video quality over error-prone networks is proposed. The model estimates an expected quality degradation in terms of one of the most reliable perceptual quality metrics, structural similarities (SSIMs), for a given encoded video and network condition described by a packet loss rate. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can estimate the expected SSIM degradation of H.264/ advanced video coding encoded videos with high accuracy.

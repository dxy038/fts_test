Reconfiguration of distribution systems is a subject related to operation especially in the presence of automation systems. The reconfiguration can be done with different goals. Ever, various reconfiguration methods presented for unbalanced distribution networks. In this paper, reconfiguration of the unbalanced distribution system in the scheme of multi-objective model proposed to reduce the losses, power imbalances, switching operations and improvement the voltage profile. Bees algorithm has been implemented in MATLAB software to solve the multi-objective reconfiguration problem, as well as Graph theory is used to check the radial structure and being all loads in service. The results of applying the new technique on a sample distribution system are presented and prove the efficiency of the proposed method.

The dynamical properties of two semiconductor lasers subject to optoelectronic feedback and bidirectional coupling are studied, considering a non-zero delay time in the propagation of the signals. The delay introduces an infinite dimensional phase space besides a new source of instabilities not allowed in case it is ignored. Both positive and negative values for the coupling and feedback strengths are considered.

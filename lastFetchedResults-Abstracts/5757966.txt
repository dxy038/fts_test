The objective of this paper is to illustrate how object-oriented programming is used to generate distributed object programming (DOP): a novel framework for developing multi-user distributed applications that exploit WWW (World Wide Web) infrastructure. The paper first briefly introduces notions of HTML, CGI, CORBA, and Java. Next, it describes the development process of a multi-user distributed construct in terms of CORBA and WWW-based Java applets. Finally, it presents an overview of an operational structure of the multi-user distributed system developed. A brief analysis of the DOP related issues, conclusions and recommendations are given

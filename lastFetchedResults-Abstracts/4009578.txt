Heterogeneous wireless systems are envisaged as the integration and joint cooperative management of diverse radio access networks and technologies through which network providers can satisfy the wide variety of user/service demands in a more efficient manner by exploiting their varying characteristics and properties. To achieve this objective, a key tool is common radio resource management technique designed to jointly manage the radio resources from different radio access technologies. In this context, this work proposes and optimizes new common radio resource management techniques designed to efficiently distribute traffic among the available radio access technologies while providing adequate quality of service levels under heterogeneous traffic scenarios. The obtained results demonstrate the ability of the proposed solutions to provide high user/service satisfaction levels while adequately exploiting the overall system resources.

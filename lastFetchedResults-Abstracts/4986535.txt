The theory of fuzzy sets is known to be an instrument for the management of uncertainty. The authorÂ´s objective is to introduce the concept of fuzziness degree, which is a measure of uncertainty, of some collection of fuzzy sets, and to describe its practical applications. The collection of fuzzy sets is defined. Such structures can be interpreted as a set of values of some fuzzy linguistic scale, or as a set of different alternatives in problem solving and decision-making, or as a description of classes in fuzzy classification and clustering, or as a representation of term-sets of linguistic values etc. The problems of using the results in information retrieval systems are discussed

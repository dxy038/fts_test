Ionomers are generally described by copolymers having either acrylic or methacylic acid as one component and the other component is mostly either ethylene or styrene. The objective ofthis research was to study the thermal behaviour and stability ofionomers ofstyrene with some alkali metal acrylates. These materials have been synthesized by neutralization of the respective copolymer containing 40 mole percent acrylic acid with sodium and potassium hydroxides in acetone medium. The copolymer of styrene-acrylic acid was made by solution polymerization in methanol using 2,2 <azobisbutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator under nitrogen blanket at 60 DC. Copolymer composition was calculatedfrom the monomerfeed concentration. The ionomer samples were characterized using FTIR technique. Thermal behaviour of the ionomers has been studied under programmed heating in dynamic nitrogen atmosphere by using differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetry (TG) and in vacuo using thermal volatilization analysis (TVA) techniquessupportedbyproductanalysis. Thethermalbehaviour ofthesodium andpotassiumsalts of styrene-acrylic acid copolymer is found to be rather similar. Infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and GC-MS techniques were used to examine the degradation products from TVA degradation. Quantitative measurements of the main product fractions under normal TVA conditionshave beenmade. Itis foundthat themain decomposition ofthestyrene-acrylic acidsalts copolymers starts at about 350 DC and reaches maximum at 450 DC.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the surgical outcomes of women with moderately enlarged uteri undergoing vaginal hysterectomy with those of women with uteri of normal size undergoing vaginal hysterectomy. A secondary objective was to investigate the roles of uterine morcellation and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy in the treatment of these women. Study Design: Thirty consecutive women during a 2-year period with uterine enlargement to a weight of between 200 and 700 g underwent vaginal hysterectomy or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy limited to lysis of adhesions or adnexectomy. These patients with uterine enlargement (group 1) were compared with 160 women with uteri weighing <200 g who also underwent vaginal hysterectomy or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy during the same interval (group 2). The 2 groups were compared for total complications, operative time, hospital stay, perioperative hemoglobin concentration change, and use of vaginal uterine morcellation and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Results: Operative time for vaginal hysterectomy was significantly longer for women in group 1 than for women in group 2 (66.6 ± 26.2 minutes vs 53.0 ± 25.5 minutes, P = .008). There was a linear relationship between uterine weight and operative time: Operative time = 47.156 + 0.056 × Uterine weight (r = 0.20, F = 7.66, degrees of freedom 1, 188, P = .006). Vaginal morcellation of the uterus was needed in 80.0% of the women in group 1 and in 10.0% of the women in group 2 (P< .001). Two women in group 1 (6.7%) and 9 women (5.6%) in group 2 had laparoscopically assisted procedures for lysis of adhesions, adnexectomy, or both, unrelated to uterine size (P = .69). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to perioperative hemoglobin concentration change or hospital stay. Finally, the rates of major surgical complications were similar in the 2 groups (3.3% in group 1 vs 4.3% in group 2, P> .99, 95% confidence interval –8.1% to 5.9%). Conclusions: Although vaginal hysterectomy requires a modest increase in operative time, it is as safe and effective for the woman with a moderately enlarged uterus as for the woman with a uterus of normal size. Vaginal uterine morcellation is the key to a successful operation and obviates the need for either abdominal or laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy solely to deal with moderate uterine enlargement.

Background and Aim: Circulating concentrations of adiponectin seem to play an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular risk factors throughout life, but the related mechanisms are not well understood. The objective of this study was to compare the serum adiponectin of obese and normal weight males and also the association among anthropometrical and lipid profile with the serum adiponectin in obese males. 
Material and Methods: In the present analytical-solidarity study, the body mass index, some other anthropometrical indexes and also glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low and high density of lipoprotein concentration were measured in 45 adult obese males after 12–14 hours of overnight fasting, and the relationships were determined through serum adiponectin. Fasting serum adiponectin was also measured in 35 normal weight males. Independent T-test was used for comparing the serum adiponectin in obese and normal weight males. Pearson correlation analyses were used to determine the adiponectin in relation to other variables in obese males using SPSS software V.15.0. P values lower than 0.05 were accepted as significant. 
Results: Serum adiponectin measured by Eliza method showed that serum adiponectin was significantly lower in obese subjects than normal weight subjects (5.44±1.23 in obese versus 7.56±1.32 in normal group, (P=0.021). Adiponectin level correlated with total cholesterol (R=0.50), LDL (R=0.56), Glucose (R=0.54), triglyceride/high density lipoprotein (R=0.53), systolic (R=0.57) and diastolic (R=0.45) blood pressures and age (R=0.45) (P ?0.05). 
Conclusion: The findings showed that obesity is associated with low serum adiponectin and this anti-inflammatory cytokine is a predictor index of cardiovascular rick factor in obese subjects.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the biotribological behaviour, in terms of wear and particle release, of bushings and flanges made of carbon fibre reinforced poly-ether-ether-ketone (CFR-PEEK) in articulation with a zirconium nitride (ZrN) multilayer surface coating in a rotating hinge knee system. For the bushings of the rotational and flexion axles and the medial and lateral flanges, a CFR-PEEK with 30% polyacrylonitrile fibre content was used in a new bearing combination with ZrN. In vitro wear simulation was performed for patients with metal ion hypersensitivity, using a new rotating hinge knee design with a ZrN surface articulation in comparison with the clinically established cobalt–chromium version. For the bushings and flanges made of CFR-PEEK subjected to wear simulation, the volumetric wear rates were 2.3 ± 0.48 mm3 million−1 cycles in articulation to cobalt–chromium as reference and 0.21 ± 0.02 mm3 million−1 cycles in the coupling with ZrN, a 10.9-fold decrease. The released CFR-PEEK particles were comparable in size and shape for the coupling to cobalt–chromium and ZrN with most of the particles in a size range between 0.1 and 2 μm. The study reveals comparable low wear and no macroscopic surface fatigue in a new rotating hinge knee design with highly congruent flanges and axles bushings made of CFR-PEEK articulating to a ZrN multilayer surface coating. Favourable wear behaviour of the newly introduced CFR-PEEK/ZrN coupling in comparison with the clinically established CFR-PEEK/cobalt–chromium articulation was found.

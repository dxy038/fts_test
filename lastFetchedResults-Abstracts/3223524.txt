Flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) technology opens up new opportunities for controlling power flow and enhancing the usable capacity of present, as well as new lines. The Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is a most complex power electronic device, which can simultaneously control a local bus voltage and optimization power flows in electrical power transmission system. This paper presents real and reactive power flow control through a 400 kV transmission line by connected the UPFC at the sending and receiving end. The objective are to determine control and performance of UPFC who is intended for installation on that transmission line to control active and reactive power flow. When no UPFC is installed, active and reactive power through the transmission line can not be controlled. Simulations are carried out in Matlab/Simulink environment to evaluate the performance of the UPFC.

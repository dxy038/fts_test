Active Noise Control (ANC) systems are increasingly used to reduce environmental noises. A hybrid ANC system is a combination of feedforward and feedback structures in which the anti-noise signal is generated using both structures. Employing the advantages of feedforward and feedback structures enables a hybrid structure to have a high performance in controlling unwanted noise. The step size of filters used in ANC systems plays an essential role in its performance. Any variation from the appropriate value leads to divergence or inefficiency of the noise controller system. These parameters are often set experimentally, which is a time-consuming task. In addition, there is no guarantee that the system can adapt itself to situational changes. The objective of this paper is to propose a new self-tuning hybrid ANC method. Using this technique, the system continuously estimates the parameters during its operation. Results of computer simulations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.

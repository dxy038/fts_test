Enterprise merger and acquisition has been the highlight of our commercial life. Since China´s Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) took effect, intense conflicts arise among anti-monopoly and those enterprises. Many researchers are interested in dealing with and solving these conflicts. In order to help decision-makers resolve these conflicts, we propose in this paper to use the decision support system based on the graph model for decision aids. The general objective of this paper is employing the graph model to model the Coca-Cola /Huiyuan Juice´s merger case in 2008 and using the decision support system to calculate the stabilities for the case, and then furnish valuable advice for designing merger policies.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mite was one of the most common allergens and the prevalence of allergen in different regions is various. This study was done to investigate mite sensitivity by Prick skin test in children with allergy referred to Amirkola children hospital (Babol, Iran).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed in 2010 on 180 children with asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema and urticaria that referred to Amirkola children hospital. Exclusion criteria were severe asthma attacks, skin lesion and taking antihistamines in the past few days. Mite allergy was done by skin Prick test. Induration more than 3 mm and redness more than 10 mm in 15 to 20 minutes after test defined as positive test.
FINDINGS: The mean age of the cases was 6.8?3.2 years. In gender distribution, 87 (48.3%) were female and 93 (51.7%) were male. There was asthma in 90%, allergic rhinitis in 36.1%, eczema in 4.4% and urticaria in 2.2%. High level of IgE and eosinophilia were shown in 60.6% and 68.9% of studied children, respectively. Skin test was positive in 109 (61%). The rate of mite allergy in children reviewed were 60.6% (CI95%=53.3-67.8). Percentage of mite allergy in children with allergic rhinitis (80% vs 49.6%) and eczema (100% vs 58.7%) and those with eosinophilia (71% vs 37.5%) or high IgE (88.1% vs. 18.3%) was significantly higher than other (p < 0.05). 
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that there was mite allergy in more than half of children with allergy in our region and the patients should consider the ways to control it.

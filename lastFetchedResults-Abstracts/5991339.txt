A type of jet loop membrane bioreactor (JLMBR), which integrating high performance compact reactor with ultra-filtration membrane, was designed and applied in municipal wastewater treatment in this study. The influent wastewater of Shanghai Zhuyuan second wastewater treatment plant was taken as the disposal objective to investigate operation efficiency of JLMBR. A characteristic of withstanding wide range of operational parameters changes appeared in the coupled process, with a steady performance of the COD removal efficiency ranging from 88% to 96%. The optimal operation conditions which was based on COD removal efficiency was determined by orthogonal experiment. In this investigation, the JMLBR achieved highest COD removal efficiency of 96.34% when the parameters of liquid recirculation, air suction and HRT reached 1.5m<sup>3</sup>/h, 0.3m<sup>3</sup>/h and 6h respectively.

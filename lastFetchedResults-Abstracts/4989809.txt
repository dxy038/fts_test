Security screening systems based on imaging technology, like X-ray and gamma-ray based screening systems, are widely used in the field of aviation security. The image quality of the systems reflects detection performance directly. In the paper a set of image quality assessment software based-on human visual sensitivity (HVS) has been developed. The software integrated HVS method in the objective method and overcomes the shortage of both objective and subjective method of image processing. Experiments show that the assessment results are consistent with the perception of operators. With the help of the image quality assessment software, the image quality assessment of the security screening system can be finished justly and efficiently, which contributes the safety of aviation transportation.

This paper presents LEOMIS, a new radiometer concept defined during one of the two parallel studies initiated by the European Space Agency and called: "Pre phase a study of the LEO microwave radiometers for operational meteorological applications and climate research". The first objective was the preliminary design of the microwave radiometer in the post MetOp time frame, i.e. primarily for water vapour and temperature sounding for operational meteorology. Climatology had a lower priority. Nevertheless, the final instrument is useful for climate applications as well, relevant data being collected on cloud properties, precipitation, and surface parameters

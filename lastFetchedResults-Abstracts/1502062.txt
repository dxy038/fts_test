Background: Urinary tract infection, as a risk factor for adverse maternal and prenatal outcomes, is one of the most common bacterial infections during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to determine prevalence of urinary tract infection and its associated risk factors in pregnant women. 
Material and Methods: In a cross-sectional analytical study a total 2496 pregnant women who were underwent prenatal care through July 2011 in three rural and six urban health centers of Ardabil city, were selected by multistage sampling. Data collection was performed using a self designed questionnaire from women's prenatal care records, 240 pregnant women with positive urine culture were considered as a case group and the remaining as a control group.  Data were analyzed through Kruskal â€“ Wallis, Chi-square and Stepwise Logistic Regression statistical tests using SPSS version 16. 
Results: The incidence of urinary tract infection was 9.7%.  Low socioeconomic status  ( p=0.021, OR= 2/338, CI= 1/138-4/766),distance  between pregnancies less than 3 years( p=0.026, OR= 2/137, CI= 1/093-4/141),and hyperemesis gravidarum( p=0.039, OR=2/06, CI= 1/038-4/098)were determined  as  risk factors  that  significantly  contribute to urinary tract infection in pregnant women. 
Conclusion: We conclude that appropriate distance between pregnancies, intensive care of pregnant women with low socioeconomic status and hyperemesis gravidarum may significantly prevent urinary tract infection and its related adverse health effects among pregnant women

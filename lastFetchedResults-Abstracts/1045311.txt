Published studies concerning transport phenomena in micro-channel heat sinks can be divided into those concerning saturated boiling versus those focused on subcooled boiling, with the vast majority related to the former. What has been lacking is a single generalized method to tackle both boiling regimes. The primary objective of the present paper is to construct a consolidated method to predicting transport behavior of micro-channel heat sinks incurring all possible heat transfer regimes. First, a new correlation is developed for subcooled flow boiling pressure drop that accounts for inlet subcooling, micro-channel aspect ratio, and length-to-diameter ratio. This correlation shows excellent predictive capability against subcooled HFE 7100 pressure drop data corresponding to four different micro-channel geometries. Next, a consolidated method is developed for pressure drop that is capable of tackling inlet single-phase liquid, subcooled boiling, saturated boiling, and single-phase vapor regimes as well as inlet contraction and outlet expansion. A similar consolidated method is developed to predict the heat transfer coefficient that is capable of tackling all possible combinations of heat transfer regimes. The new consolidated method is shown to be highly effective at reproducing both data and trends for HFE 7100, water and R134a.

Software reverse engineering can benefit from software performance engineering (SPE) techniques and vice versa. Reverse engineering´s system artifacts satisfy SPE´s need for a sequence of a software system in order to quantitatively analyze the system´s performance characteristics. The code profiling tools used in software performance engineering can assist reverse engineering in understanding the behavior of the source code of a system. The aim of this workshop is to gather together researchers and practitioners working in the area of software performance engineering with an emphasis on code optimization and root cause analysis. We are interested in investigating how performance analysis can benefit from reverse engineering techniques. The objective of the workshop is to find common case studies and compare existing techniques. This workshop will be the first inclusion of this important industrial relevant topic within the software reverse engineering community. We aim to set up a forum for exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new ideas.

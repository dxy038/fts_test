The electromechanical analysis of a scaled-down prototype (0.06 scale in linear dimensions) of the IGNITEX (Fusion Ignition Experiment) TF (toroidal-field) magnet is presented. The objective of the Ignition Technology Demonstration (ITD) program is to design, build, and test the operation of a single-turn, 20-T, TF coil, powered by an existing HPG (homopolar generator) power-supply system. Unlike conventional TF coils that use multiple turns of the conductor, the single-turn coil eliminates the need for turn-to-turn insulation, therefore better utilizing the available area for stress and thermal management. Precooling of the coil to liquid-nitrogen temperature permits the magnet to operate in a wider temperature regime without exceeding material properties. Scaling relationships presented show that temperatures and stresses of a scaled-down coil and their relative distribution will approximate predicted levels of the full-scale IGNITEX device. A finite-element program (TEXCOR) which solves a set of coupled electrical circuit, magnetic diffusion, and thermal diffusion equations with temperature-dependent properties was developed. TEXCOR provides temperatures and magnetic body force densities for stress analysis of the magnet structure. The effect of flatness tolerance stackups in the TF coil assembly is discussed and methods to characterize and minimize the negative effect of nonideal conditions are given. Generator fault scenarios are also addressed. The analysis results presented show the feasibility of a single-turn, 20-T, TF magnet powered by HPGs

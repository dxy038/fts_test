This paper describes the development of the virtual scenography for the opera for choir, narrator and live electronics A Menina da Gotinha de A&#769;gua. The objective of the virtual scenography was to substitute the traditional illumination and scenography systems with projections and also introduce an interactive aspect for the visual elements of the stage. The final visual result was a composition of pre-edited videos, real-time interactive animations and pre-made children drawings that were made interactive. The interaction was divided in two parts: a master controller software with graphical user interface and two Reactables (Reactable Live!)[1] with custom software, through which, a master operator and six children could control images and real-time effects. We conclude that the dialogue between the music, choreography and scenography was enhanced by the use of an interactive virtual scenography. Designing the live visuals to highlight each key moment of the musical and literal text increased the general understanding and appreciation of the opera by the public.

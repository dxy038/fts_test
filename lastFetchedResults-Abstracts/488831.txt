Background and Objective: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common cause of cardiovascular death and the most frequent cause of death following elective surgery. Early diagnosis and anticoagulation therapy can reduce mortality in a significant manner. PE diagnosis often depends on medical imaging. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) was shown to have high sensitivity and specificity in this regard. This study aimed at evaluating the findings of CT pulmonary angiography with 64-slice MDCT in patients suspected for pulmonary embolism.
Materials and Methods: in a descriptive setting, 65 patients with suspected PE referred to Tabriz Imam Khomeini Hospital to be assessed with 64-slice MDCT were evaluated during 12- month period. The diagnosis of PE was based on the results of this modality. The probable accompanying comorbidities or underlying cause of patients' signs and symptoms in non- affected cases was also determined.
Results: sixty five patients, 38 males and 27 females with the mean age of 55.78Â± 16.40 (17-81) years were enrolled. According to the results of MDCT, 25(38.46%) patients suffered from PE. The lower lobe was affected in all patients and 14 cases had bilateral involvement. In patients determined as non-PE cases, 12 patients had no other detectable findings in MDCT report. In the remaining, pleural effusion, infection and tumor were the most common three findings. Treatment with anticoagulation agents was commenced after confirmation of the disease by MDCT. There was 1 (4%) deceased case in this group attributable to the cardiac problems.
Conclusion: This study showed that the 64-slice MDCT is an accurate, noninvasive and safe modality for diagnosis of suspected EP. However, further more controlled studies should be carried out with the golden standard method as the reference in this regard.

Voice communication over Bluetooth wireless links has seen increasingly popular usage in recent years. In practice, wireless voice transmission subjects to frequent packet loss and bit errors in adverse conditions, which significantly degrade voice quality. This paper describes a comparative study of packet loss concealment (PLC) algorithms for Bluetooth CVSD codec. Six algorithms were evaluated, which include zero insertion, hold, decoded domain PLC, coded domain PLC, decoded domain PLC with state update via copying, and a newly proposed decoded domain PLC with state update via decoding. Objective evaluations show that decoded domain PLC algorithms with state update are among the best performers.

Long-distance and large-scale power transmission through ultra-high voltage (UHV) channels is necessary in the foreseeable future of China due to the imbalance between economic development and energy distribution. Mode selection for UHV power transmission, considered as a multi-objective decision-making problem, is the foundation of UHV network planning. Based on the combination weights and the proposed index system and fuzzy optimization techniques, a comprehensive evaluation method of UHV AC/DC transmission modes is presented in the paper. The method has proved its effectiveness in the successful application of Hubei province of China.

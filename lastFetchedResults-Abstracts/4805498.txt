Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA), which improves the efficiency of channel use in cellular mobile communication systems, requires finding an available channel for a new call after the call origination. This causes the delay which is defined as the time elapsing between call origination and completion of the channel search. For system planning, it is important to evaluate the delay characteristic of DCA because the delay corresponds to the waiting time of a call and influences service quality. It is, however, difficult to theoretically analyze the delay characteristics except its worst case behavior. The objective of this paper is to analyze the distribution and the mean value of the delay theoretically. This analysis is based on the Clique Packing model for analyzing the blocking rate performance of DCA

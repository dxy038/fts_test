The authors propose the establishment of a research area called knowledge-based technology transfer. To this end, research and theory are modeled and integrated in the areas of technology transfer and knowledge-based systems. Effective knowledge transfer is a common objective to both these areas of research. Linear models of technology transfer are associated with a knowledge-consulting paradigm. A communication-based model of technology transfer is associated with a knowledge-sharing paradigm. Common to both paradigms is the two-way flow of information between knowledge-transceivers. Such interactive communication is seen to facilitate the convergence of knowledge developers and users in terms of technology developments, acceptance, and application

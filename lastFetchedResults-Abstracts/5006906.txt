The Georgia Power Company (GPC), an affiliate of Southern Company, commission the 0 to +87 Mvar Laurens County static VAR compensator (SVC) in May of 2005. This paper presents the Dublin, Georgia area transmission network, the requirements for voltage support, the planning and engineering studies used in rating the SVC and verifying its performance, and provides an overview of the SVC design and control strategy. The Laurens County SVC will be connected to the 115 kV bus of the North Dublin 230/115 kV substation to provide steady-state voltage regulation and dynamic VAR support following major disturbances in the Dublin area. The SVC control strategy employs steady-state voltage regulation of the 115 kV North Dublin bus by coordinating control of local and remote mechanically switched capacitor (MSC) banks with the objective of ensuring sufficient dynamic VARs remain available for major local system disturbances

Objective
Topical corticosteroids are recommended as initial therapy in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients. We investigated clinical efficacy of monotherapy with topical steroid and combined therapy in AR patients.
Methods
Ninety-five AR patients sensitive to grass pollens according to skin prick test results were enrolled in this placebo-controlled and open study. Patients were divided to four groups. Group-1 received only intranasal mometasone furoate (MF) 200 Î¼g (n = 25), group-2 received intranasal MF and oral desloratadine (DLR) 5 mg (n = 25), group-3 received intranasal MF and oral montelukast (MSK) 10 mg (n = 25), group-4 received only placebo (n = 20). Efficacy was assessed on the basis of total nasal symptom scores, rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire scores and nasal inspiratory peak flow rates.
Results
All groups that received treatment had better results when compared to the placebo group. Significant improvement in total nasal symptom scores was first evident at the end of the 2nd week in group-2. Group-3 had better results than those of the other groups at the end of the 1st month (p < 0.05). Quality of life scores were significantly better in group-2 and -3 when compared to those in group-1 (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Although corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment in allergic rhinitis, montelukast may be considered as an additional agent especially in treatment of patients with impaired quality of life and it may be used to reduce nasal symptom scores.

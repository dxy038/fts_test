Objective: The use of ultrasound in the evaluation of pregnancy and its complications is growing. Determination of fetal gender is important; not only for answering parents curiosity about their fetus gender but is also important for revealing variable medical conditions. In this study we evaluated ultrasound accuracy in determination of fetal gender during 16-40 weeks of pregnancy.

Subjects and Methods: In this prospective and descriptive study, transabdominal sonography performed on 500 pregnant women at gestational age of 16-40 weeks. Sonography reports, obstetric history and parent's tendency about knowing fetal gender were noted. Sonography reports on fetal gender were classified into male or female, possibility of male or female and undetermined. Neonatal gender was confirmed by telephone call after birth and compared with the sonography results. Transabdominal sonography accuracy correlated with gestational age, multifetal, amniotic fluid changes and maternal BMI.

Results: In 500 pregnancies 529 fetuses were seen. Fetus gender was determined as definite in 95.6%, possible in 2% and undetermined in 2.3% of cases. There was only one male case determined incorrectly as female, (it was one of the twins in 19 weeks gestation). Thus, accuracy of sonography in determining male fetuses was 99.6% and in female fetuses 100% and the over all accuracy was 99.8%.

Conclusion: Transabdominal sonography is an accurate and reliable method in gender determination.

Transmission monitoring and control knowledge is more dispersed among human experts or in manuals, than other type of power system knowledge. The reason is most voltage security studies evolve around generators and load buses; less importance was given to transmission security and enhancement. The effect of any compensators is limited to a particular region, which makes some compensators ineffective during a voltage violation. The issue of transmission congestion management is a challenge for operators because of inability adding more transmission losses due to economic and environmental reasons. Hence in this paper, the problem of transmission voltage security monitoring and locating effective controllers for improving voltage security are found by developing a new algorithm which is presented. To meet the objective, we have partitioned transmission lines connected to a sub load center into reactive control zones by identifying the weak and strong transmission line elements. We also developed a methodology to identify suitable reactive power controllers for individual buses present in the network.

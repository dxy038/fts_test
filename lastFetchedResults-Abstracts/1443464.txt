In many areas of control there are gaps between the existing theory and applications. This is more so in hybrid infinite dimensional systems and in particular hybrid systems in which both the actuator and the controller are switched. The main objective of this paper is to start filling in one of these gaps. We present a theoretical formulation and provide methodologies for implementing optimal and switching policies of spatially scheduled actuators for a class of distributed parameter systems (DPS). The optimization method employed is based on finite horizon LQR optimal control. Well posedness and optimality, pertaining to the switching policies of spatially scheduled actuators, are presented and proven. Tutorial examples motivated by thermal manufacturing applications along with extensive simulation results of the proposed actuator-plus-controller switching scheme are presented.

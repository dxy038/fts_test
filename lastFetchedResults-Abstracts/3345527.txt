Aiming at multi-focus color image fusion, An image fusion algorithm based on the Canny edge detection is proposed. Firstly, the color image is converted into grayscale image, then, the Canny edge detection algorithm is used to detect the edge of grayscale image to obtain the corresponding edge image. Secondly, the area of the two edge images is compared and the isolated point is removed. The stripes on the non-focus area of the edge image are eliminated. Then, the black areas of the two images are compared, and the simple decision map is gotten. Finally, the decision map is processed by processing the edge. The value of the edge point is re-determined, and the final decision map is obtained. The multi-focus fusion image is obtained according to the decision map. The experimental results show that, the proposed algorithm is superior to traditional fusion algorithms, in terms of objective criteria and visual appearance.

Objective: To study the effect of hesperidin extracted from the peel of Gannan kumquat on Alzheimer´s disease and its possible mechanisms. Methods: Cellular model of Alzheimer´s disease was established using PC 12 cell induced by serum starvation method and treated by &#946;-amyloid peptide 25-35 (A&#946;<sub>25-35</sub>). Effect of hesperidin on proliferation of PC12 cell induced by AP<sub>25-35</sub> was detected by the MTT method. Effect of hesperidin on apoptosis of PC12 cell induced by A&#946;<sub>25-35</sub> was utilized by the acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining method. Results: PC12 cells stayed at G&#959; stage induced by serum starvation method in order to simulate the neuron in the state of terminal differentiation. After this, the PC cells induced by serum atarvation were treated by A&#946;<sub>25-35</sub> to establish the cellular model of Alzheimer´s disease. After synchronized PC12 cells being pretreated with different concentrations of hesperidin (0-200 &#956;mol/L) for 1 h, and then 30 &#956;mol/L A&#946;<sub>25-35</sub> for 24 h, it was found that the survival rate increased along with the increasing dosage of hesperidin (F = 995.8, P &lt;;; 0.001); however, there was no significant difference between 100 &#956;mol/L group and 200 &#956;mol/L group (P &gt; 0.05). After synchronized PC12 cells being pretreated with 100 &#956;mol/L hesperidin for 1 h, and then 30 &#956;mol/L A&#946;<sub>25-35</sub> for 24h, the cell nuclei were gradually similar to the cell nuclei of control group by by acridine orange/ethidium bromide fluorescent staining.Conclusion: Hesperidin inhibited the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by A&#946;<sub>25-35</sub> and had protection for neurocyte.

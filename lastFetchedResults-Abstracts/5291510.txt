Plasmon-polariton detection by 2DEG has been modelled in several kinds of hetero-structures (AlGaN/GaN, InAlN/GaN, SiGe/Si/SiGe, AlGaAs/GaAs) with grating coupler. The resonances were discussed according to the heterojonction nature, the grating aspect ratio, the thickness of the layer above the quantum well and the sheet carrier concentration in the quantum well (QW) at various temperatures. The objective is to make possible the tuning of the resonances versus frequency in order to facilitate the control of the terahertz detection.

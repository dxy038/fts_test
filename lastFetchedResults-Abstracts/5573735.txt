The main objective of this work is to develop a robotsÂ´ fleet working together to make assistance tasks in a hospital or at home in a collaborative way. This paper presents a method to detect, recognize and track people using mount cameras fixed on a building and an algorithm for collaborative mobile robot localization based on probabilistic methods (Monte Carlo localization). The performance of this system has been tested successfully. Some experimental results and conclusions are presented.

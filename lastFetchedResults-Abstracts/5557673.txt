Real-time monitoring of multimedia Quality of Experience is a critical task for the providers of multimedia delivery services: from television broadcasters to IP content delivery networks or IPTV. For such scenarios, meaningful metrics are required which can generate useful information to the service providers that overcome the limitations of pure Quality of Service monitoring probes. However, most of objective multimedia quality estimators, aimed at modeling the Mean Opinion Score, are difficult to apply to massive quality monitoring. Thus we propose a lightweight and scalable monitoring architecture called Qualitative Experience Monitoring (QuEM), based on detecting identifiable impairment events such as the ones reported by the customers of those services. We also carried out a subjective assessment test to validate the approach and calibrate the metrics. Preliminary results of this test set support our approach.

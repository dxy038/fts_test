The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate and to understand the effect of each common non-idealities in switched-capacitor circuits on sigma-delta modulators. Since quantization process is non-linear in nature, a sigma-delta loop is then inherently non-linear. Therefore, analyzing its non-ideal behaviors would be difficult. A better understanding of these effects can be achieved if each of these non-idealities is studied separately. This paper is an extension and improvement effort of sigma-delta modulator modeling to the one proposed by S. Brigati et al. (1999) using MATLAB and SIMULINK (1997).

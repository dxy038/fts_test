Changes in the quality of vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon (Salmo salar) were evaluated through a systematic study of biochemical, microbiological and sensory analyses during storage at different temperatures (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 °C). TVB, TMA, K value, total aerobic and anaerobic counts and Lactobacillus spp., showed significant correlation (p⩽0.05) with storage time, temperature and sensory quality. Hypoxanthine (Hx), Biogenic amines, molds and yeasts were not considered good objective indicators of sensory quality. Shelf lives of smoked-salmon stored at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 °C were 26, 21, 20, 10 and 7 days, respectively. Lactobacillus spp., were dominant in terms of deterioration in quality. Pathogenic microorganisms (Clostridium botulinum, Salmonella, Coliform, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes) were not detected during the time of storage.

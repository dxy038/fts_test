The monitoring of in situ soil moisture is an important task for hydro-climatic forecasting and the calibration/validation of satellite based soil moisture missions such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. Many techniques have been explored to select a single site for a monitoring station that is representative of watershed characteristics. To objectively design an entire soil moisture monitoring network, this paper presents the dual-entropy multi-objective optimization (DEMO) system using soil moisture data retrieved from SMOS. The resulting optimal networks are created by maximizing the information content and minimizing the redundancy of information in each potential network.

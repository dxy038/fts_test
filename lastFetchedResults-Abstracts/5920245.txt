The objective of this research is to apply the subdivision surface for surface fitting problems when generating surfaces from data points or polyhedral models. The basic idea is to use the subdivision limit position (SLP) to adapt the control mesh of the subdivision surface to the data points. This method is not a time consuming process involving global optimization. It does, however, fail to capture local characteristics of data points. Consequently, the proposed method is not suitable for generating a surface that precisely interpolates the data points, but it will be useful for quickly generating a surface that captures the overall shape constituted by the data points. A prototype system hers been developed to demonstrate several examples for purposes of evaluating the proposed method

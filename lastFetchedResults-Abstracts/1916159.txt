BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now the gold standard for the treatment of symptomatic gallstone disease. Despite the minimally invasive nature of laparoscopy, high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remains a major cause of morbidity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of single dose of dexamethasone on PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
METHODS: This clinical trial study included 92 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We divided the patients into two groups randomly. One group received Dexamethasone (5mg, IV) and the other group received Saline (5cc, IV) 10 minutes before extubation. The patients were observed for any episode and severity of nausea and vomiting or whether the patient required any anti emetic drug in the 24 hours postoperative period.
FINDINGS: Two patients in saline group excluded the study. There were no significant differences between groups regarding to age, gender and body mass index. Incidence of nausea in dexamethasone and saline groups were 34.8% (16) and 47.7% (21) respectively. The difference was not significant (RR=0.73, CI 95%: 0.44-1.20, p=0.310). Also incidence of vomiting in dexamethasone and saline groups were 30.4% (14) and 34.1% (15) respectively, and the difference was not significant (RR=0.89, CI 95%: 0.49-1.69, p=0.884).
CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that a single dose dexamethasone (5mg, IV), 10 minutes before extubation, has no effect on PONV.

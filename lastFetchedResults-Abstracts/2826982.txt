Wireless multimedia sensor network drastically stretches the horizon of traditional monitoring and surveillance systems, of which most existing research have utilized ZigBee or WiFi as the communication technology. Both technologies suffer from the relatively short transmission range. The objective of this paper is to assess the feasibility and explore the potentials of transmitting image information using RF transceivers under a carrier frequency of 433 MHz. Arduino platform will be used for its low cost and simplicity feature. Details of the hardware properties and the equipment setup will be elaborated. The stability of the system will be firstly tested by transmitting simple texts, then the control protocol is written to decompose the image files at the software level for the wireless transmission. Comparison and evaluation will be made for different system settings including image format and serial interface, so that the optimum configuration can be concluded for the future wireless multimedia sensor network experiment.

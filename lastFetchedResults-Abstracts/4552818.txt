We study nonconvex relaxation of the combinatorial &#8467;<sub>0</sub>-minimization for compressive sensing. In an &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-&#8467;<sub>2</sub> minimization setting with p &lt;; 1, we propose an iterative algorithm with two distinct features: (i) use of a proximal-point (P-P) objective function composed of a convex quadratic term and an &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-norm term, and a fast parallel-based solver for global minimization of the P-P function in each iteration; and (ii) a power-iterative strategy that begins by solving a convex &#8467;<sub>1</sub>-&#8467;<sub>2</sub> problem whose solution is then used to start next &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-&#8467;<sub>2</sub> problem with p close to but less than one. The process continues with gradually reduced p until a target power p<sub>t</sub> is reached. By simulations the algorithm is shown to offer considerable performance gain.

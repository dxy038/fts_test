As voice coil motor (VCM) type actuators were miniaturized and high performance was required, the necessity of an integrated design method was felt keenly instead of a general sequential design method. And, it was checked that the integrated design method based on accurate FE analyses were needed in ODD mainly using VCM type actuators as mobile devices were diversified. In this paper, the integrated design method based on the coupled-field-analysis is suggested. First, the coupled-field-analysis that can precisely analyze dynamic characteristics of multi-axis VCM type actuators was systemized through the verification model to obtain the base of the integrated design method. The design procedure that were proper for multi-axis VCM type actuators was analyzed considering design variables, objective functions, and constraints. To check superiorities of the integrated design method, this method was applied to the real development of three VCM type actuators. Finally, it was checked that the integrated design method based on the coupled-field-analysis was superior to the sequential design method through application examples.

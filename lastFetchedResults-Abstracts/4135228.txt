In this paper, a phase-locked bidirectional converter (BC) (PLBC) with pulse charge function is proposed to improve the battery charge efficiency. The circuit topology of the proposed PLBC is the same as that of the current-pump phase-locked loop (CP-PLL). Using CP-PLL inherent characteristics, a pulse current with bidirectional flow can be automatically implemented. A design example for a 42-V/14-V dual-voltage PowerNet is built to assess the PLBCÂ´s performance. Compared with the conventional BC, the battery charge efficiency &#951;<i>b</i> is improved by about 2.8%. Moreover, the battery increased temperature is reduced by about 5.7 <sup>&#176;</sup>C simultaneously.

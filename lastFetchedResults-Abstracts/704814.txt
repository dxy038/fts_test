Objective: To determine the clinical presentation and assess the usefulness of various diagnostic modalities and outcome of treatment of abdominal tuberculosis (TB). Materials and methods: The files of patients admitted to Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH) with a diagnosis of abdominal TB from January 91 to December 99 were studied retrospectively and data abstracted. Results: Eighteen patients were diagnosed during this period, of which ten were males. The median age was 27 years (range 5–65). The common symptoms were fever, weight loss, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Abdominal signs were less frequent and included hepatomegaly and ascites. Eight patients had co-existent immunocompromised disorders; two of these had active pulmonary TB. Diagnostic investigations included gastrointestinal contrast studies in two, ultrasound (US) guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in nine, and laparoscopy and/or laparotomy in seven. All patients underwent antituberculous therapy for 9–12 months, in addition to the treatment of associated disorders. The response to antituberculous therapy was good except in one patient with HIV. Four patients died from associated primary disorders. Conclusions: The clinical presentation was non-specific and nearly half of the patients had associated immunocompromised disorders; thus a high index of clinical suspicion is required. US guided FNAC and selective laparoscopy were the most useful diagnostic modalities. Antituberculous therapy was effective.

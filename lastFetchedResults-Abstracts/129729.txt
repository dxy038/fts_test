Objective: This study was carried out in order to produce FITC conjugated antibody against pestivirus antigens to detect pestiviral infection. This study was begum on Jan. 2000 and it was ended on Oct. 2001.
Design: Field experiment.
Procedure: At first 10 rabbits were immunized with NADL strain of BVDV. The immunoglubulins were conjugated with FITC and were passed on sephadex G25. To obtain a desirable titer of conjugatedsera different dilution of antibody in presence of positive and negative samples a were used.
Statistical analysis: Mcnemar and Chi square tests.
Results: As a result, a titer of 1/20 of conjugate turned out to be desirable .At the last term of study from 210 selected cell culture tube, 140 of them were infected with BVD virus and 70 were kept as control. The results of FA microscopy were indicated a coordination of about ,OIOO between standard (Biox) and our conjugated sera. On 81 fields infected samples examined by 2 antisera, only one sample was negative by our prepared conjugate, although this sample was positive by standard conjugate. Conclusion: Statistical analysis indicated a correlation of %99.6 between two conjugates.

Objective: We evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic hysterectomy over a 2-year period when this new technique was introduced to several hospitals in Finland.
Study Design: A nationwide register was founded and a prospective multicenter survery of 1165 laparoscopic hysterectomies was carried out from January 1993 to December 1994. The operations were performed because of uterine fibroids (54%), menorrhagia (27%), dysmenorrhea (8%), endometriosis (2%), and other reasons (9%) by 68 gynecologists at 30 hospitals.
Results: The mean operation time was 132 minutes. The patients stayed in hospital for an average of 3.3 days, and the mean convalescence period was 17.9 days, half that after abdominal hysterectomy. Complications occurred in 10.2% of the procedures: infections in 5.6%, vascular complications in 1.2%, urinary tract complications in 2.7% and bowel compliacations in 0.4%.
Conclusions: Laparoscopic hysterectomy offers a short hospital stay and convalescence time to the patient, but effective teaching is imperative to minimize, in particular, the risk of urinary tract injuries.

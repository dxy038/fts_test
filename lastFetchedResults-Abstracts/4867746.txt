The optimization method for public traffic line network is studied according to the feature of line network optimization problem. By using system science theory, seven objective functions and three constraints of line network optimization are established. An ideal solution decision method based on entropy weight and multi-objective programming is proposed. The method is simple and easy to use. By using the method combining expert judgment with entropy weight, the indexes weights are determined, which realizes the unity of subjectivity and objectivity.

The background differing has been taken as a very excellent method for dealing with the tracing target, in the field of automated video surveillance application. This algorithm can detect the objective timely and accurately. At present more and more scholars take their attention in subtracting the background more faster and more precisely. In this paper, using the Kalman Filter and getting different parameters to control the background updating. To compare with the UKF model, this method can update faster and has ability to deal with the complicated environments.

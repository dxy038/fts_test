In this study the technical feasibility of implementing thermophotovoltaic (TPV) power generation through the use of GaSb photocells within the chamber of a residential, oil-fired boiler was evaluated. The objective of this work is a self-powered hydronic heating system for which an estimated 200 watts of power is needed. An approach was developed in which direct radiation from the combustion chamber is incident on TPV cells which are protected only by a quartz plate. This work differs from that of previous TPV research in that no stand-alone thermal emitter is used. It was demonstrated experimentally that a power densities greater than 2 watts/cm<sup>2</sup> could be achieved with this "emitter-less" approach. The results of this work also demonstrate that the power density is strongly affected by the burner excess air level.

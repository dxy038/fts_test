The objective of the paper is to introduce a new adaptive filtering algorithm for estimating frequency-domain second-order Volterra filter coefficients. The approach rests upon the normalized LMS (NLMS) algorithm and the frequency-domain block LMS algorithm. The utilization of the normalized LMS algorithm facilitates choice of a proper step size, with which the adaptive frequency domain Volterra filter is guaranteed to be convergent in the mean-squared sense, and improves convergence rate. The frequency-domain block LMS algorithm estimates frequency-domain second-order Volterra filter coefficients which correspond to the DFT of the time-domain Volterra filter coefficients

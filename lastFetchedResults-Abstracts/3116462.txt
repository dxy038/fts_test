This paper presents results for full and mixed resolution stereo video coding including subjective and objective evaluation for 3DTV on mobile devices. For this, objective as well as subjective tests have been carried out with different sequences at different image sizes and evaluated on two different stereoscopic displays. The subjective tests showed, that for uncoded sequences full resolution was rated better, however for coded sequences at low bit rates mixed resolution was rated better. An unsharp masking algorithm for up-sampling the lower resolution view only partially improved the overall quality because coding artifacts were strengthened as well. Objective tests showed that the optimum bit rate distribution for mixed resolution stereo video coding is 30% to 35% of the total bit rate for the lower resolution view (half horizontal and half vertical). Finally, tests showed that mixed resolution stereo video decoding with up-sampling is less complex than decoding full resolution stereo video which is important for implementation on mobile devices.

This numerical study forced convective heat transfer ferrofluid within a circular copper tube including portions of the electromagnetic isolation under an alternating magnetic field is performed. Laminar flows through a tube under uniform and thermal flux passes. The main objective is intensifying transfer of particles and increasing velocity in the boundary layer using nanoparticles to increase the effect of magnetic field onto more heat transfer. Convection regimens resulting from complex interactions between magnetic nanoparticles were studied under different conditions, with the concentration and volume of different heat transfer processes under different frequencies of the applied magnetic field were also studied. Magnetic field effects on the convective heat transfer coefficient at different Reynolds numbers and volume percentages have been studied. Also, when the electromagnetic is insulated pipe parts of have been studied and have been compared with the modes without insulation. Increase in the frequency and volume fraction of magnetic field, resulting in increased heat transfer were better. Magnetic field at low Reynolds numbers have shown a greater impact. To prove the numerical results. The results showed that the modeling data were in very good agreement with experimental data.

The Multi-level Virtual Conductor (MLVC) is a bidirectional DC-DC converter that has been controlled in a designated strategy so as to allow it to behave like a conductor has a voltage difference between its terminals. It is considered, in the MLVC, that both input and output of a bi-directional DC-DC converter are independent current sources. These current sources can be considered as a load or as power supply based on its polarity. Therefore, two control loops are required to stabilize the terminals voltages at a certain voltage difference in between. Accordingly, the controller design becomes a very complicated process. To facilitate this dilemma; one solution is to design the controller according to two stages. First stage: design the controller according to one loop control to stabilize one terminal voltage. While the second stage: design the controller according to one loop control to stabilize the other terminal voltage. Then design the controller of the MLVC based on the design considerations of the two cases. However this solution is an effective one and it begets good results. But, it is a heavy burden to perform the design procedure twice. Thus, this paper presents a unified model for the MLVC in order to ease the design procedures. This unified model helps to simplify the controller design process. The proposed unified model is investigated analytically and experimentally. Moreover, both of the frequency response and the transient response are analytically and experimentally studied, as well.

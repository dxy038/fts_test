This paper presents an application of heuristic optimization techniques such as Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithms (GA) for efficient operation in micro grid. For operational efficiency, the objective function in a diesel generator consists of the fuel cost function similar to the cost functions used for the conventional fossil-fuel generating plants. The wind turbine generator is modeled by the characteristics of variable output. The operating cost in fuel-cell system includes the fuel costs and the efficiency for fuel to generate electric power. The application of the heuristic optimization technique to optimal operation can save the operating costs of the distributed generation and interruption costs in micro grid. The method proposed is applied to the IEEE 13-buses system to compare its solution.

Frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system measures objects and acquires information by changing the sending signal frequency along with the time and by measuring the receiving signalÂ´s frequency with respect to the sending signals. This paper introduces a practical FMCW radar signal processing method and system. This system is mainly used for eliminating noise interference from the sampled signal, checking out the objective signal, and sending the data as the processing results to a computer through the PCI Interfaces. The results are finally processed by the computer and displayed on its screen. This paper analyzes the signal processing algorithm, and applies it to the system implementation. This processing system uses the universal DSP chip as the core device, thus making it easier to use and transplant. This system can be applied to many fields (mini near-distance radar, aircraft carried radar, etc) as long as the front antenna and transceiver system are well organized. It can also be applied to the vehicle carried radar for distance-measuring

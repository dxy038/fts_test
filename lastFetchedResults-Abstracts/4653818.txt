Multisensor image fusion has its effective utilization for surveillance. In this paper, we utilize a fuzzy logic approach to fuse images from different sensors, in order to enhance visualization for surveillance. With the help of fuzzy if-then rules and membership functions designed for the image data set, the fuzzy logic approach can model and combine the images to enhance the contrast of the fused image. Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system is used to combine the images. Subjective and objective image fusion performance measures are introduced to assess the performance of image fusion schemes. Experimental results show that the fuzzy logic approach is effective to fuse images from different sensors.

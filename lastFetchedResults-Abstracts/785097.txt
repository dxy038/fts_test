the resting energetic dispenses on postmenopausal stage should be well known in order to elaborate
obesity prevention programs. Objective: the aim of this study was to compare the resting metabolic rate (rMr)
measured by indirect calorimetry (rMrmeasured) with predictive equations (rMrestimated) and verify which
preexisting equation is more indicated for this population, in inactive, postmenopausal women. Design: 43
postmenopausal women volunteered for the present study. Measurements: rMrestimated value was achieved by
indirect calorimetry. the predictive equations used were: harris-Benedict equation (hB), henry e ree (hr),
Mifflin-St Jeor equation (MSJ), World health organization equation (Who) and Female Brazilian Population
(FBP). Body composition was obtained through skinfolds method. Results: all equations showed significant
difference values for kcal/day (p<0.00001) (hB 1313.07±73.46; hr 1310.95±81.41; MSJ 1207.93±93.17; Who
1375.73±61.01 and FBP 1250.05±73.54 kcal/day) in relation to rMrestimated (1063.79±157.82). the Who
equation was the one which most overestimated the rMr values with a difference of more than 300kcal/day.
Conclusion: none of the equations to approach, in this study showed precision in the estimative of rMr, all
prediction equations overestimated rMr values in Brazilians’ postmenopausal women, although the MSJ
predictive equation showed the greater approximation of rMrmeasured for this population

The subject &#8220;power system analysis and design&#8221; is one of the major undergraduate components in electrical engineering courses. Computer applications in this subject yield significant insight into a complete electric power system. To help students better understand the subject, a computerised program has been developed to illustrate the analytical procedure of power systems. The program is used for teaching the subject from an analysis and design point of view as well as for explaining the structure and operation of the system. In the program, the analytical characteristics of the major parts of the power system are described. The objective of the paper is to present the computerised program developed to teach the fundamentals of power systems and to show the analytical procedures used

Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate wound complications between patients with antepartum HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome with primary closure versus delayed closure and Pfannenstiel versus midline skin incisions.
Study Design: Medical records of patients with antepartum HELLP syndrome undergoing cesarean section were examined for type and timing of skin closure: Pfannenstiel versus midline skin incision and primary versus delayed closure. The immediate (before hospital discharge_ and late (2-week postoperative check_ wound complications were analyzed with respect to timing of wound closure and type of skin incision.
Results: A total of 104 patients were identified; 75 had a primary skin closure and 29 had a delayed closure 48 to 72 hours postoperatively. Immediate wound complications (wound infection, hematoma), occurred in 18 (26%) patients who had primary closure versus 8 (24%) who had a delayed closure, odds ratio 1.13 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 3.27). A late wound breakdown was seen in only 1 patient with primary closure but in none with delayed closure. There were no fascial wound dehiscences. No statistical difference in wound complication was found between midline (primary, delayed) and Pfannenstiel (primary, delayed) incisions, odds ratio 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.23 to 1.88).
Conclusion: In women with antepartum HELLP syndrome delivered by cesarean section the frequency of wound complications is not influenced by type of skin incision or time of skin closure (primary or delayed).

In this paper, we introduce a novel routing algorithm which is based on ant colony system. The objective of this novel algorithm is to solve the problem of energy and congestion control on wireless sensor network routing process. This novel algorithm is able to achieve better load balance and prolong the network lifetime. In this novel algorithm we combine the pheromone released by multi-ant colonies and residual energy as the algorithm control factor. Furthermore, we also introduce the competition mechanism among multiant colonies to avoid the simplex convergence in our algorithm. In this way, the novel algorithm controls the network traffic congestion effectively and balances the energy consumption for sensor networks. Simulation results in this paper demonstrate that this novel algorithm has better performance on load balance comparing with fundamental ant colony algorithm.

Recently RFID technology has made its way into end-user applications, enabling automatic item identification without requiring line of sight. In particular passive tags provide a promising, low cost and energy-efficient solution for inventory applications. However, their large-scale adoption strictly depends on the efficiency of the identification process. A major challenge is how to arbitrate channel access so that all tags are able to answer the reader inquiries and identify themselves over time. This paper stems from the observation that a variety of anti-collision protocols for RFIDs have been proposed in the literature. However, a thorough simulation comparison among them and a clear identification of the mechanisms resulting in better end- to-end performance is lacking. The objective of our work has been to fill this gap. This paper presents the results of a detailed ns2-based comparative evaluation of representatives of all the classes of anti-collision protocols so far proposed. Simulation results show that end-to-end performance of the different classes of protocols in terms of metrics such as the time needed for tags identification differ significantly over what previously found by experiments which only focused on the number of reading cycles for tag identification. Our thorough performance evaluation has highlighted that different solutions are to be used in different application scenarios and that decreasing the collisions (rather than idle times) is the way to go to further improve anti-collision protocols performance.

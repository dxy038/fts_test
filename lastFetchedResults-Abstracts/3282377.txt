In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for multi-frame super resolution (SR) with consideration of scale changing between frames. First, we detect the scale of each frame by scale-detector. Based on the scale gap between adjacent frames, we extract patches and modify them from different scales into the same scale to obtain more redundant information. Finally, a reconstruction approach based on patch matching is applied to generate a high resolution (HR) frame. Compared to original Nonlocal Means SR (NLM SR), the proposed Scale-Compensated NLM finds more potential similar patches in different scales which are easily neglected in NLM SR. Experimental results demonstrate better performance of the proposed algorithm in both objective measurement and subjective perception.

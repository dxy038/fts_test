As a preliminary study for a 4 degree of freedom wafer handling robot, an integrated design methodology for high-speed high precision single beam system is proposed in this paper. Strict mathematical modelling and identification processes of the actuating subsystem are performed. Parametric studies and experiments of step response of the system are conducted to investigate the influence of the interactions between control and mechanical parameters on the system, where the stiffness and inertia of the system is taken as the mechanical design variables. According to the analysis of the system performance, a multi-objective optimization problem together with nonlinear constraints is formulated. Two algorithms to solve such optimization problem, CRS (controlled random search) and SQP (sequential quadratic programming), are programmed and the optimizing results respectively are compared and discussed. Some conclusions was drawn at last.

This article presents the results of a research which objective is to contribute to establish proceedings to guide the effort of measuring voltage harmonics distortions. Here are shown the results of measuring made in university buildings in a range of one up to 24 days. Statistical treatment of these measures allows the establishment of a typical period that better characterize harmonic distortions within a particular building. The results of a meticulous research about the performance of THD (harmonic voltage distortion) existent in study area are presented. From these data, it is possible, including producers, to presented. From these data, it is possible, including producers, to comprehend if theirs specific equipments stand or not for existent THD indexes, in function of time of exposure. Furthermore from this methodology, the reliability of indexes representing average value and P95 % can be evaluated in accordance to the rest of the measurements. In the following, data evaluation is done within the normative index limits proposed by the standard of IEEE, European and BrazilianÂ´s recommendations. Although obtained results can not immediately be a generalization in respect of other loads, the presented methodology may be of great use of companies as well as professionals interested in quantifying and qualifying harmonic current and voltage distortions.

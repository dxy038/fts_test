Summary form only given, as follows. Plasma technology is used in a wide field of applications for example for PECD-deposition, activation and etching. In particular microwave enhanced plasmas are very effective for activation of surfaces. Our objective targets are to construct plasma sources for large area application and plasma sources which can be used in a wide pressure regime as possible up to atmospheric pressure. In this presentation two sources for large area and wide pressure range plasma are discussed. They are based on a coaxial coupling of the magnetron and the antenna.

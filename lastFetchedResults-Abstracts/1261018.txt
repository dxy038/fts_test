Objective/Hypothesis To determine whether a community-based head and neck cancer screening could be an effective method to detect positive findings of head and neck cancer in at-risk populations. Study Design Survey-based study with a nonexperimental intervention component. Methods Five hundred sixty-eight adults were screened for oral and laryngeal cancers by otolaryngologists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons during three National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing race weekend events. A prescreening survey collected demographic information, relevant medical history, and information regarding risk factors for head and neck cancers, including current or past tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and chemical exposures. Signs and symptoms of head and neck cancer were documented during the screening. Results Forty-three percent of participants with a history of smoking had abnormal findings. A Pearson chi-square indicated that the proportion of males who evidenced positive findings was significantly (Pآ <آ 0.05) higher than the proportion of females who evidenced positive findings. For every pack of cigarettes smoked per day, an individual was 1.95 times more likely to evidence abnormal findings even after controlling for alcohol use, family history of cancer, personal history of head and neck cancers, sex, age, and occupation. Conclusions This study is the first to document the results of a large-scale head and neck cancer screening of a population of people known to be at risk of head and neck cancers. The study demonstrates the feasibility of developing and implementing large-scale community-based head and neck cancer screenings, as are often seen in the early diagnosis and education of signs, symptoms, and risks for other cancers.

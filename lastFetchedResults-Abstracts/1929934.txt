The objective of the study was to determine the properties of wild boar semen and their changes in annual cycle. During a 14-month study period, 167 ejaculates were sampled from 3 mature boars. In each ejaculate the volume of liquid fraction, percentage of spermatozoa motility, spermatozoa concentration and the total number of spermatozoa were determined. The activity of acid and alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase in the fresh semen plasma was also measured. It was shown that wild boar ejaculates did not differ from those of domestic boars, and the semen of the highest volume, concentration and number of spermatozoa was produced in late autumn. The spermatozoa motility was the lowest in summer. The activity of aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase in the semen plasma increased with shortening of the light period.

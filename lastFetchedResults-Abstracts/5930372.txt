We present a multi-source/multi-detector optical tomography setup that is capable of fast imaging, thus allowing tracking time varying physiological states. To cancel out varying detector sensitivities and incoupling efficiencies, we developed a calibration protocol for our experiment. Analysis of the variances in the calibration factor of each detector provides an objective measure of the reproducibility of the performed experiments and an opportunity to identify corrupted data sets

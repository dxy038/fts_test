Currently, Internet is considered as the main information source, this information is not directly exploitable by computers, that\Â´s what make the importance of the problem of information extraction from the web. In literature, there is many approaches and methods of extracting data from the web. Our article is about the "gene/Clone" approach that is an approach for extracting information from the web ,it consist on generating a gene from a set of examples instances entered by the user. The gene designate the smallest repetitive structure containing all values of examples instances. The search of the clones of gene allows to retrieve the other instances of the relationship to extract. The objective of this paper is to improve the accuracy of the Gene / Clone approach, so we propose new concepts namely the structural prefix and structural suffix . The use of structural prefixes and structural suffixes allows to increase the accuracy of the gene and so improve the accuracy of data extraction . At the end of this article, we propose a direct use of our approach, in fact, we have developed an application for extracting and gathering data from several social networks in order to generate a meta social network.

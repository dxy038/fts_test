The objective of this work is to study the thermodynamic mechanism and performance of an engine exhaust-powered adsorption refrigeration system using CaCl2 as adsorbent and NH3 as refrigerant. A 6 kW nominal refrigerating capacity adsorption refrigerator was developed. The working performance of the refrigerator is presented. It is concluded that the refrigerating capacity at constant evaporating temperatures varies with the input heat into the generator, and the heat transfer affects strongly the mass transfer in the adsorbent, making it work in different mean generation and adsorption temperatures. A conventional test bed was developed for investigating the properties of CaCl2â€“NH3 adsorption/desorption unit tube. A mathematical model based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed to describe the performances of the adsorption refrigerating system.

The ability to identify and follow a moving object is not only important for human activities, but it is also critical necessity in the use of robots for automation and manufacturing, security applications, and for life sciences. This achieved by using the pan and tilt mechanism with camera. The paper deals with the stability analysis and simulation of two degree of freedom (DOF) robotic system for positioning or aiming a device based on linear model. The 2-DOF robotic system is formed by combining tilt mechanism with pan mechanism. The stability analysis of the pan and tilt mechanism is performed before designing the motion controllers for the 2-DOF robotic system. The state space model and transfer function of the pan and tilt mechanisms were determined. For this purpose dynamical model of pan and tilt mechanisms was determined by using Newton-Euler equation. To perform the analysis and simulation, all the parameters involved in the system dynamics were identified. The robotic system has two degrees of freedom due to tilt and pan mechanisms. Here tilt mechanism has one revolute joint and pan mechanism has also one revolute joint. The objective of this research work is to derive motion controllers for the pan and tilt mechanisms. These controllers make possible for camera to point in a desired direction within allowable specifications. The lead compensators are used as motion controllers to meet the desired specification. The feedback control system is used with lead compensator for the position control of the pan and tilt mechanism in this paper. The advantage of lead compensator is that it can be implemented using passive network.

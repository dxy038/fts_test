The objective of the presented work is the design of flexible data link control (DLC) protocols with the focus on scheduling policies, which combine the information of the time variant radio channel (described by the channel transfer function) and the incoming data streams from real time video applications with variable data rates. The goal is to fulfil the quality of service (QoS) requirements in terms of data rate, reliability and delay for all wireless terminals and to improve the average system throughput. Fairness between the wireless terminals (WTs) is also a very important aspect of scheduling.

Three questionnaires were completed by 109 employees of a government R&amp;D laboratory and 121 employees from 28 industrial R&amp;D organizations. In one questionnaire the respondents expressed their opinions about obstacles and incentives to creativity in the organizations at which they worked; in another they indicated `actual´ and `ideal´ levels of risk-taking situations in their organizations; and in the third they indicated to what extent 15 statements about conflicting objective situations were characteristic of their organisations. The answers seemed to indicate that at the government laboratory there were fewer obstacles to creativity than in industry, that risks were taken oftener at the government laboratory than in industry, and that conflicting objective situations differed between the government laboratory and industry.

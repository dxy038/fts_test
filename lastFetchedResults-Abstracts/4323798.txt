In this paper, the requirements on latency and packet error rate for an IP network based wireless system will be discussed. A TCP model will be used to show the effects of latency and packet loss rate on throughput performance. A survey of published QoS requirements for various portions of an end-to-end IP network with wireless air interface will also be reviewed and compared. The objective is to derive a range of latency and error rate requirements for the wireless air interface for various types of applications, to reduce excess delay or throughput limitation at the TCP layer, and to ensure compliance with the QoS support at the IP network, so as to meet the end-to-end performance requirements as expected by the user, according to the application class.

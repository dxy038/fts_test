In this paper, an optimal design of PID controller used in current control of grid connected inverter system with PID parameters is presented. It can also minimize the reactive power and the total harmonic distortion for the single-phase full-bridge grid-connected system. The results show that multiple objective optimal solution is obtained by using by the fuzzy-based response surface methodology with multiple performance characteristics index. It is very useful to increase the performance the single-phase full-bridge grid-connected system.

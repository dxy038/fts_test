This paper addresses the issue of testing MCMs on large-area substrates. The cost of testing each MCM may be as high as 40% of the total manufacturing cost. It is critical that the test process be parallelized in order that multiple MCMs may be tested for the cost of testing one MCM. With this objective in mind, we propose a distributed probabilistic diagnosis algorithm for MCMs on large-area substrates. Our algorithm performs better than the existing diagnosis algorithms and can correctly identify almost all MCMs even when the yield is very low (35%). Further it provides upto an order of magnitude reduction in test application time as opposed to serial MCM probe test

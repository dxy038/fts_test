Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is fundamental to many biogeochemical processes in soils and natural waters. Despite the large number of studies reporting on DOM losses from forest soils and in surface waters there is little published data on exports from managed grasslands. The objective of our study was to determine the extent of short-term exports of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from managed grazed grasslands and to evaluate the influence of fertilizer management and drainage regime. DOC discharged from grazed grassland plots, with a range of management strategies, was determined over 2 months. Total export varied from 42 to 118 kg C haâˆ’1, and was greater from some plots than literature estimates for annual losses from all catchment types. There was a significant (P=0.048) positive correlation between DOC export and rates of nitrogen application for treatments with no artificial drainage. Increased dry matter production arising from increased fertilizer-N inputs is suggested as an important factor in this relationship. DOC export was significantly (P=0.032) reduced by artificial drainage and adsorption of DOC to soil surfaces and the restriction of decomposition due to waterlogging are suggested as two possible explanations.

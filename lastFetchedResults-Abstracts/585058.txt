A great number of engineering constructions are located on Asmari Formation, but unfortunately, geomechanical data gathered during the construction of these projects, is never used in future projects located on this formation. One of the objectives of the present paper is to find a new methodology to make it possible to use this huge amount of data, in order to decrease the cost and increase the efficiency of next geomechanical explorations. The other objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System in modeling and estimating of compressional and shear wave velocities. At first, the geomechanical laboratory tests results of the samples of 7 damsites located on this formation were gathered. Then, by means of statistical methods, appropriate independent variables and datasets were selected. At last, ANFIS method was employed to predict the compressional and shear wave velocities. The obtained results show that Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System can be successfully used in estimation of wave velocities. Also, using the methodology presented in this paper, data gathered in former geomechanical explorations can be used in future ones, in order to optimize the exploration process.

This paper presents a new design of high frequency DC/AC inverter for home applications using fuel cells or photovoltaic array sources. A battery bank parallel to the DC link is provided to take care of the slow dynamic response of the source. The design is based on a push-pull DC/DC converter followed by a full-bridge PWM inverter topology. The nominal power rating is 10 kW. Actual design parameters, procedure and experimental results of a 1.5 kW prototype are provided. The objective of this paper is to explore the possibility of making renewable sources of energy utility interactive by means of low cost power electronic interface.

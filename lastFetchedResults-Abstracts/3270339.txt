Networks-on-chip has been seen as an interconnect solution for complex system but the performance and the energy dissipation still represent limiting factors for Multi-Processors Systems-on-Chip (MPSoC). The future handheld devices must support multimedia applications for long battery life but this type of application imposes heavy constraints in terms of energy and forces the designers to optimize all parts of the platform to achieve the desirable goals. The objective of this paper is to analyze and assess the energy dissipation for heterogeneous NoC-based MPSoC platform running a video application. It identifies bottlenecks for the entire platform. We showed that the energy dissipation appear to be the most critical factor for memory and caches not for the communication architecture as the common belief. Also, we propose a new modeling and simulation approach regarding the channel width and buffer sizing which have a strong impact on the performance and the overhead of the chip. We showed that there are some hot spots in the system regarding the channel width and buffer size must be optimized to get a better performance.

The objective of this work is to make a Surface Electromyography (EMG) signal detection sensor to test and analyze human motion pattern. EMG signal has a very small amplitude level and a frequency range of 20 Hz to 200 Hz. In order to realize the sensor, a circuit and its single layer PCB has been designed to amplify and filter the differential potential between Ag/AgCl electrodes at different points. After that the signal has been stored in computer using NI ELVIS II (DAQ) and LABVIEW at a sampling rate of 1000Hz. Then the signal has been used to calculate the stride length of a particular foot by a single threshold comparison method. The ultimate result shows that the calculated and actual stride length matches in 89% of the cases.

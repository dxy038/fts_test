Introduction: Due to an increase in the number of laborers in the South Pars Gas Field in Assaluyeh, Iran, the possibility of an increase in the social pathologies is evident. The objective of this study was to assess the situation of drug use and addiction among the laborers.
Methods: The study population consisted of key informants, the laborers and staff of gas and petrochemical complexes, native people, drug users and dealers. Totally, 12 sessions of focus group discussions, 60 in-depth interviews and 377 urine tests for opioids were carried out in year 2007.
Results: Opium followed by alcohol, hashish, heroin and heroin-crack was reported to be the most common drugs of use in the laborers. The prevalence of current opioid use in the laborers is estimated to be 15% - 25%. The main factors related to drug addiction in laborers consisted of drug addiction upon employment, exhausting work condition and climate, high population density in the dormitories with limited monitoring facilities, low attention of the contractor to drug use and limited availability of prevention and treatment facilities. However, since 2006, the speed of construction has been slowed down with a reduction in the size of temporary work force. Consequently, there has been an improvement in drug abuse situation.
Conclusion: In order to control the drug use in the area, it is necessary to have clear policies, and implement a multi-strategic plan. The budget is affordable using a very small portion of the returned profits.

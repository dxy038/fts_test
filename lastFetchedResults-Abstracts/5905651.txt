By exploiting recent advances in both our understanding of pheromone biosynthesis pathways and the detection of molecules in the insect nervous system, we are developing a novel communication system based on functional equivalents of the cellular, sub-cellular and molecular biological machinery. This will form the basis of a new branch of information technology employing infochemical ligands for communication over space and time. In order to achieve this objective, both chemical signal generation and reception are replicated by taking a systematic approach that implements reaction steps as biosynthetic modules, which are then hierarchically integrated as a technological solution towards realising `infochemical communicationÂ´.

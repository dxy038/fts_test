Identification of a set of governing physico-mechanical properties for inflatable seals of Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) and specification of their limits is described based on operating requirements, design practices and results from seal development. The limits of tensile strength, elongation at break, hardness, tear strength, fluid compatibility, compression set and specific gravity defined for the Viton GBL 200S/600S based inflatable seal formulation provide a standardized framework for regular production of reactor seals and a streamlined approach for compounding, design, manufacture and quality control. This assures significant reduction of efforts during the envisaged unification of Fast Breeder Reactor sealing based on four variations of inflatable seal compound which could result in a universal design code apart from significant gains in safety, reliability and life. The property set has potential use in Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor and Advanced Heavy Water Reactor. Inclusion of factors such as batch-to-batch variations of compound properties and their reproducibility during laboratory measurements, hot tensile behavior of fluoroelastomer, long term ageing effects and the margin of safety at the end of seal design life ensures the utility of property set in attaining its intended objective.

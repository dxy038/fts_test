In mobile ad hoc networks, it is crucial to reduce energy consumption satisfying key network properties. In this paper, we investigate the k-connected transmission power assignment problem with the objective of minimizing power consumption. We address this issue from a decision-theoretic point of view. Specifically, the future network behavior is predicted in order to derive an optimal transmission power assignment which tracks the wanted connectivity level minimizing energy.

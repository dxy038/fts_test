Based on the analysis on characters of counterfeit currency in RMB´s circulation, the control criterion of counterfeit currency is proposed. The model for prediction and supervision of counterfeit currency then is established by CARMA model. Predictions on RMB´s counterfeit currency of different area and different value are carried out to verify the efficiency of this model. Pre-decision multi-objective supervision method is studied with this model to satisfy different practical needs for supervision on counterfeit currency.

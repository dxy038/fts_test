A fuel irradiation program is being conducted using the experimental fast reactor ‘Joyo’. Two short-term irradiation tests in the program were completed in 2006 using a uranium and plutonium mixed oxide fuel which contains minor actinides (MA-MOX fuel). The objective of the tests is the investigation of early thermal behavior of MA-MOX fuel such as fuel restructuring and redistribution of minor actinides. Three fuel pins which contained MA-MOX: 2% neptunium and 2% americium doped uranium plutonium mixed oxide (Am,Pu,Np,U)O2−x fuel were supplied for testing. The first test was conducted with high-linear heating rate of approximately 430 W cm−1 for only 10 min. After the first test, one fuel pin was removed for examinations. Then the second test was conducted with the remaining two pins at nearly the same linear power for 24 h. In these tests, two oxygen-to-metal molar ratios were used for fuel pellets as a test parameter. Non-destructive and destructive post-irradiation examinations results are discussed with early on the behavior of the fuel during irradiation.

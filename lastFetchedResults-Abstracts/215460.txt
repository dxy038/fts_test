Background: Hypoxemia is a frequent complication after
general anesthesia. It usually takes longer to recover in individuals
with respiratory problems. Bakers may suffer from
respiratory problems such as asthma. The objective of this
study was to compare the occurrence of hypoxemia and duration
of supplemental oxygen administration during recovery
from general anesthesia in bakers and smokers.
Methods: One hundred and twenty patients (55-70 years) undergone
elective eye surgeries were assigned to four groups
(n=30 each) of cigarette smokers, water pipe smokers, bakers,
and controls. Method of anesthesia was routine and the same
in all groups. The rate of occurrence of hypoxemia in recovery
room was assessed and the duration of supplemental O2 to
treat hypoxemia was measured in each group.
Results Arterial oxygen saturation (Sa02) was above 92%
before anesthesia in all groups. The rate of occurrence of hypoxemia
was significantly higher in bakers (60%) compared to
'cigarette smokers (36.6%), water pipe smokers (40%) or controls
(30%). Mean duration of supplemental O2 administration
was shorter in the control group (J 4(PLUS-MINUS)9 min) compared to those
of cigarette smokers (30(PLUS-MINUS)16 min), water pipe smokers (28(PLUS-MINUS)14
min) or bakers (34(PLUS-MINUS)10 min) . 
Conclusion Bakers are more prone to the occurrence of postoperative
hypoxemia than smokers or normal subjects. However,
both bakers and smokers will need careful Sa02 monitoring
and longer duration of supplemental O2 administration during
recovery from general anesthesia if hypoxemia occurs.

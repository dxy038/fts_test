Analyzing the whispering voice signal, it is considered to be as understandable as normal speech when heard at proximity and can also carry prosodic information. The study introduced here is centered on developing a signal processing application, not a signal recognizing application, where the whispering (non-speaking voice or talk without vocal fold activation) signal is converted to pseudo-real voice signal similar to normal speech. The method proposed in this study tries to achieve its objective without relying on any specific hardware device, making use of the whispering voice signalÂ´s own properties and information. Finally, validation of the proposed method has been conduced and the results analyzed.

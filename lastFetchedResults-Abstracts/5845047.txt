This paper deals with the topic of qLPV state-space model based control design in which LMIs are used to optimize the multi-objective control performance. In this paper we investigate how the convex hull of the polytopic model influences the control performance of the LMI based control design. We examine these influences through the controller and observer design of the two dimensional aeroelastic wingÂ´s example. First we define various TP type polytopic model representations of a wing section whose vertices define different convex hulls. In the second step we investigate how these models change the control performance.

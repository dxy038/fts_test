The development and utilization for our government information resource is lagging for the increase in information infrastructure and aggregate information demand in recent years. This paper proposes model-mechanism-performance incorporate, bidirectional, interactive and circular governance architecture and analyzes the key steps and influential factors in the process of cooperative development and sharing for government information resource. Our study indicates that, (1) in the aspect of model choose, the government should take into account of the characteristics of information resource, building organization, business process, and power structure; (2) in the aspect of mechanism design, the government should import incentive and monitoring mechanisms, market-oriented mechanisms, and pricing and compensation mechanisms; (3) in the aspect of performance evaluation, the government should import the third party performance evaluation mechanism based on capability maturity model, establish performance evaluation index system, and design comprehensive hierarchical and multistage performance evaluation system; (4) the direct and reversed influential relationship of the alignment degree of model, mechanism and performance are formed finally.

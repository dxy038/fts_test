With the objective of stimulating the cultivation and consumption of native Brazilian fruits, the physicochemical composition and antioxidant potential of three native species, namely the araticu-do-mato (Rollinia sylvatica A. St.-Hil.), pindo palm (Butia capitata (Mart.) Becc.) and mandacaru-de-três-quinas (Cereus hildmannianus K. Schum.) were determined in this study. The pindo palm fruit stood out because of its elevated carotenoid content (39.6 μg/g) and greater antioxidant capacity (26 μM trolox/g of fresh sample) by the ABTS (2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic) method, although by the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) method, the pindo palm fruit (3847.5 g of fresh sample/g DPPH) and mandacaru-de-três-quinas fruit (3249.8 g of fresh sample/g DPPH) were considered to have the same antioxidant potential with no difference between them. The mandacaru-de-três-quinas fruit also showed the highest total phenolic compound content (1337.3 mg/100 g). Although the araticu-do-mato presented the highest vitamin C content (0.32 mg/g), it did not differ statistically from the mandacaru-de-três-quinas fruit (0.25 mg/g); on the other hand, it was considered to be equal to the pindo palm fruit (0.23 mg/g). The araticu-do-mato also showed the best result for the TSS/TTA (total soluble solids/total titratable acidity) ratio (41.92), thus it was adequate for in natura consumption and for processing as well.

The world´s population is getting older. As a consequence, certain diseases such as Alzheimer are getting more and more common. On the other hand, we can take advantage of the evolution of new technologies to develop applications with the aim of enhancing and stimulating the cognitive abilities of people suffering from Alzheimer´s in order to counteract the progress of the disease. This paper presents an interactive system based on emerging technologies such as NFC and distributed user interfaces and tangible interaction to conduct cognitive rehabilitation. The main objective is to improve the person´s performance in real-life situations and the associated enhancement in the person´s well-being, selfesteem, mood and behavior.

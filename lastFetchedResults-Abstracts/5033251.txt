It is said that the result of the game of sports is controlled by player´s mental state. Especially, player´s concentration greatly controls the result of the game. Therefore, we think that if player´s mental state under exercising can be evaluated, it becomes possible to guide the player appropriately. Our mental state can be understood from analyzing EEG (Electroencephalogram). Especially, it is said that the change of alpha and beta rhythm of EEG will indicate the change of human´s mental state. Therefore, we think that if EEG of the athlete can be measured under exercising, it becomes possible to evaluate mental state of the athlete. However, EEG is measured in the state of the rest usually, and measuring EEG under exercising is difficult. Because, the amplitude of EEG is very small and high amplification is necessary to obtain observable EEG. A movement of the body causes vibration of electrodes, and these vibration cause artifact of EEG. So, our objective of this study is a development of the new measuring method of EEG under exercising. In this paper, we will talk about our developed EEG measuring system for athletes. This system measures EEG and acceleration of the athlete´s body. These measured data are sent to the receiver by a FM transmitter. Received data are analyzed with the personal computer, and the EEG and the noise are separated. Some normal subjects were tested with our developed system. From these experiments, it was clarified that our system had some problems. However, EEG with little noise was able to be obtained in all cases. Therefore, we think that if these problems are improved, our developed system will become useful for the measurement of EEG under exercising.

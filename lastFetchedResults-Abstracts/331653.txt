Objective: The adaptation of experimental dentine bonding systems has been evaluated in vivo.

Methods: A cylindrical cavity which extended into dentine was prepared in the facial surface of vital teeth that were to be extracted for orthodontic reasons. The preparations were restored with a commercial light-activated resin composite that was mediated by experimental dentine bonding systems. The restored teeth were extracted as soon as possible following polymerization of the composite. The marginal and internal adaptation of the resin composite restoration was observed under a light microscope in both horizontal and longitudinal sections of the teeth immediately after extraction.

Results: Of the experimental dentine bonding systems investigated, those including a primer of glyceryl methacrylate showed complete adaptation whereas those with primers of 2-HEMA showed a contraction gap in three out of 10 specimens.

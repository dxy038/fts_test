A new style engineering education curriculum for mechatronics and manufacturing automation, innovative and practice training course is proposed. This curriculum is centered on advanced laboratory platform from Googol Technology and responsible for accomodating all the junior and senior students of our university for more than ten colleges. Project based learning and individual oriented teaching mode is adopted. Three types of projects are designed as knowledge deepen and extension oriented, science research oriented, and induatrial immersion and perception oriented projects to guarantee the teaching quality and objective implementation. Advantage and deficiencies have been obtained since the courseÂ´s three year execution, and this new style course reveals great potential in engineering education.

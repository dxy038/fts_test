The Taiwanese production of TFTâ€“LCD front-panels comprises a global share of 43%, the highest production rate in the world. Inevitably, a large amount of waste is produced in the fabrication process. How to deal with waste LCD glass is an important work. In this study, the water-to-binder ratios were 0.28, 0.32, and 0.36, and four kinds of sand replaced by glass were used at volume with replacement ratios of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%. Fly ash, blast furnace slag and superplasticizer were added and blended by means of a simple SCC mixing design method. The objective is to recycle waste LCD glasses in SCC. Results showed that the slump flow of self-compacting glass concrete (SCGC) increased with higher glass sand replacement. This is mainly because waste LCD glass is hydrophobic, an increase in efficient water content resulting content. V-funnel testing and U-test indicated that, when the glass sand replacement increases, the time required to flow and pass through the space between the steel bars increases, mainly because the unit weight is reduced. The air content and unit weight would be raised with glass sand contents decreasing. Hence, the partial replacement of sand by waste LCD glass can meet JAPAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL EGINEERS (JSCE) SCC R2 property standards.

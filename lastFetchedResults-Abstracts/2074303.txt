Blueberry is an important source of anthocyanins, which are highly colored substances recognized for their antioxidant activity. One of the drawbacks of using anthocyanins as food colorant is their low stability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the variations found in color and concentration of the compounds (which produce the color) on spray-dried powders, obtained from blueberry extracts with added mesquite gum. Ethanolic blueberry extracts were concentrated until reaching 35% of soluble solids. They were then spray-dried using mesquite gum as an encapsulating agent at 140 and 160 °C of air inlet temperature and 8.5, 9.1 and 9.6 mL/min of feeding rates. The lowest losses in the content of total phenolics, total anthocyanins, and color of the samples were found in samples dried at 140 °C and 9.1 mL/min. The microencapsulates that were stored for 4 weeks at 4 °C in the absence of light presented low degradation of phenolics (10%), anthocyanins (7%) and antioxidant activity (15%). Final color values were L = 39.87, C = 47.83 and H° = 28.59, with a total color difference ΔE = 5.

This paper describes multi-agent based optimal power flow solution in which total production cost is used as the problem objective to be minimized. In this work, simulation of peer-to-peer device coordination has been developed using Java Agent Development (JADE) software package. JADE provides a FIPA-compliant agent platform and a package to develop multi-agent systems used in this paper. Six agent types are established. They are i) load agent ii) power generating plants agent, iii) transformer tap-setting agent iv) reactive power agent v) optimal load-flow agent and vi) management agent. In this paper each agent has been modeled as an intelligent agent, which joins to a container to form the multi agent system for solving optimal power flow problems. In this paper, the standard IEEE 6-bus test power system was employed. The results of this proposed system showed that the use of multi-agent systems enables possibility of applying optimal power flow in real-world applications.

    The meat and eggs of birds, and their products are the major sources of Salmonellae for humen, causing thousands of deaths in the world annually. The objective of the present work was to determine the Salmonella infection status in the eggs of native chickens. From January 2003 to June 2004, 300 eggs with apparently clean shells were purchased from different markets in Ahvaz. Every 3 eggs, as a pooled sample, were put into a plastic bag containing 45ml of tetrathionate broth (TB) with 40 mg/l novobiocin, and massaged from the outside for a few minutes. Then, isolation and identification of salmonela was carried out as recommended by Douglas Waltman. Out of 100 samples, 5 (5%) were known to be infected with Salmonella. Salmonella typhimurium and method Salmonella enteritidis were isolated from the shells (4 cases) and the content (1 case) respectively. As each 3 eggs was considered as a pooled sample, it was concluded that at least 5 eggs (1.66%) were contaminated with Salmonella.

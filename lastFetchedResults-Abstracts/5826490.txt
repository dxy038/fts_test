The technologies of mobile communications and ubiquitous computing pervade our society and wireless networks sense the movement of people and vehicles, generating large volumes of mobility data. Miniaturization, wearability, pervasiveness of mobile devices are producing traces of our mobile activity, with increasing positioning accuracy and semantic richness: location data from mobile phones (Global System for Mobile Communications: GSM cell positions), Geographic Positioning System (GPS) tracks from mobile devices receiving geo-positions from satellites, etc. The objective of this paper is to review the works carried out by different group of researchers using varied techniques in Discovering User context, Mobility Prediction of Mobile users, Discovering social groups, Fraud detection in mobile communications networks etc.

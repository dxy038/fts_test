This paper deals with a flow shop in which each operation needs several resources, some of these resources being polyvalent. The objective is to minimize the weighted number of tardy jobs. This problem represents a real industrial issue. The production system studied can be found in many companies. Currently, the firm that set the problem is using an industrial software. Our aim is to find a quick method to obtain better results than with this software. Because of the problem size and complexity, we decided to use a genetic algorithm to solve it. In this paper, we present this algorithm and we give some results obtained with it. Then we compare these results with those obtained with the software. These results show a clear improvement of the solution quality with the genetic algorithm

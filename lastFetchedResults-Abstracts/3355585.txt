The advancement of Information Communication Technology in recent years and the increase in the number of social networking technologies, has led to educators facing complex choices and challenges when it comes to exploiting the advantages these technologies offer. This hampers the use of social networks to enhance and complement teaching. This may be attributed to lack of knowledge and preparedness for integration, which in turn hinders successful integration of social networks into education systems. The objective of the study was to evaluate the preparedness for social networks integration into teaching and learning for universities. The study also investigated challenges faced in integrating these technologies. A case study approach was taken with the collection of data from lecturers at Inoorero University using the census method. Data was analyzed and presented using frequencies, percentages and tables, by use of SPSS. The study concludes that there is preparedness for social networks integration into teaching and learning at the university. The findings of the study can be used to develop a benchmark for integrating social networks into teaching and learning, and can aid professionals in the education communities in policy development and research.

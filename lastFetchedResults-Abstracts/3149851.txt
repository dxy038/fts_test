To solve multi-objective decision making problems, many of the traditional models have been proposed. But these models donÂ´t include all the possible preferences of decision maker. In this paper, we introduce the concept of weighted-objective similarity degree, and propose a new method of multi-objective decision-making based on weighted-objective similarity degree. We obtain some related properties and applications.

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of different supplements to the basic IVM medium (TCM199) on the efficiency of cattle oocyte maturation and blastocyst production, and the incidence of apoptosis in both oocytes and blastocysts. Two protein supplements (FBS and fafBSA) and a macromolecule (PVP40) were compared in a 3 treatments × 9 replicates design. Cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs) aspirated from slaughterhouse ovaries were matured for 24 h in TCM199 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 6% fafBSA or 4% PVP40 (50–70 COCs in each treatment/replicate), then inseminated and cultured in vitro for 8 days. Immature and mature oocytes as well as Day 8 blastocysts were subjected to TUNEL analysis. Cleavage rate was monitored on Day 2 post-insemination (pi), whereas blastocyst yield on Day 8 pi. The composition of maturation media did not affect zygotic cleavage rate on Day 2 (on average 71.0%), however the blastocyst rate on Day 8 pi was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.001) for embryos derived from oocytes matured with PVP40 (16.0%) than for those matured with FBS (22.4%) or fafBSA (22.1%). The rate of TUNEL positive oocytes differed significantly between immature (1.4%) and mature (11.2%) oocytes (P &lt; 0.01). Supplements to maturation medium were not related to the incidence of apoptosis in mature oocytes (11.2%) and the rate of oocytes at the second metaphase stage (71.5%). Cumulus cell expansion was reduced by maturation in medium supplemented with PVP40. This macromolecule was also correlated with higher apoptotic index in blastocysts (5.8%) when compared to FBS (3.2%) and fafBSA (3.1%; P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, lower blastocyst rate and elevated apoptotic index in embryos derived from oocytes matured with PVP40 may suggest that synthetic macromolecule provides less balanced environment for oocyte maturation and therefore should be treated with caution.

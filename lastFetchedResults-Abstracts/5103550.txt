Modern life has a strong tie with ICT technology, so as to the sensing technology which has played an important role than before. Its application is somewhat more than we have learned, such as education. Meanwhile, with the advance of software/hardware and the popularity of the Internet, e-books have drawn much of attention. With the introduction of the sensing technology to e-readers, it instills e-books the functions of reading or learning behavior. In self-learning situation, learners often suffer from detraction problem which cannot be easily detected and amended. In this study, we proposed a sensor-assisted learning system to monitor a learnerÂ´s retention during the reading or learning process. The system has been incorporated into an e-book platform, or e-reader to become a personalized e-reader system. We proceed to conduct two experiments for sensor-assisted model (SAM) and e-book systems, respectively. The ultimate objective is to establish an adaptive personalized learning system by the feedback of data collected by sensors.

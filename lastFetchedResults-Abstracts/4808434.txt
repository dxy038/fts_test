In Active Vibration Control of smart structures, the actuator and sensor placement is a key point of the control system design. The objective of this paper is to propose an H<sub>2</sub> norm approach for the actuator and sensor placement, which aims not only to maximize the norms of the controlled modes but also to reduce spillover problems by taking into account the residual modes and minimizing their H<sub>2</sub> norms. It discusses optimal actuator and sensor configuration on a finite element model of a square carbon fiber plate fixed on three sides with piezoelectric patch actuators and acceleration sensors. Finally, downstream the actuator and sensor positioning, the well known IMSC control logic have been applied in order to test the optimal positioning.

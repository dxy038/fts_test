Negotiation is a means for agents to communicate and compromise to reach mutually beneficial agreements. To this end, this paper presents a new model for bilateral multi-objective negotiation under fuzzy preferences and time constraints in an incomplete information setting. In this model, the order in which objects are bargained over and agreements are reached is determined exogenously, as part of the bargaining equilibrium. In this context, we propose nine negotiation scenarios based on the agentspsila fuzzy preferences and time constraints. Our analysis on this model shows that the negotiation can reach equilibrium before the deadlines in all proposed negotiation scenarios. This result is checked by using a numerical experiment to simulate the negotiation process.

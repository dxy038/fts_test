The main objective of SWIMSAT is to measure the directional spectra of waves thanks to a space-borne radar. The instrumental concept involves a real-aperture radar using a multi-beam conical scanning, in order to provide measurements of the spectral properties of the wave field, and to estimate the profile of radar cross-section depending on incidence (0&#176; to 10&#176;) and azimuth (0&#176; to 360&#176;). The paper provides an overview of the mission and of the measurement principle, and the status on instrument design.

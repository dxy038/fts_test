According to quota sampling method, the statistical sample was 352, which consisted of 58 blind, 80 deaf and 214 motional-physical people with disability. A researcher-made questionnaire was used for gathering the data. Face validity method and Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha test were used for determining the validity and reliability of the questionnaire.

Results Results of Pearson correlation coefficient showed that there was a significant relationship among variables such as social capital, transportation facilities, manner of spending the leisure, presenting rehabilitation services, training and entrepreneur, social media programs, personality characteristics, family support and acceptance of people with disability (P<0.001). There was no relationship between variables such as type (P=0.108), history (P=0.531) and reason of disability (P=0.427) and acceptance of people with disability in the society. According to the results of variance analysis and t-test in terms of demographic characteristics of people with disability, there was no significant difference between gender (P=0.071) and age (P=0.498) and acceptance of people with disability. But, there was a significant difference between education level, occupation of people with disability, and their societal acceptance (P<0.001). People with disability who were highly educated had a higher acceptance in the society. Also, there was a significant difference between marital status (P=0.032) and education level of spouse (P=0.046) and acceptance of people with disability.

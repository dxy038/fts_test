The purpose of this paper is to provide objective gist for organ differentiation of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In this paper, we collected 803 voice signals of patients with five internal organs illness and 100 voice signals of normal persons. We extracted the sample entropy characteristic of each group when embedded dimension was 2. By analyzing the statistics result, we found: (1) the sample entropy characteristic of six groups were significantly different in multiple frequencies (P&#8804;0.05); (2) the sample entropy characteristic of normal group was much lower than that of patients (P&#8804;0.05); (3) the sample entropy characteristic of lung illness group was much higher than that of other illness groups and normal group (P&#8804;0.05). Finally, using the method of sample entropy combined with the Wuyin theory, we have got some objective gist for organ differentiation of TCM auscultation.

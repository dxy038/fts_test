This paper treats a tuning of PID controllers method using Multi-objective Differential Evolution. The objective was to apply the differential evolution algorithm in the aim of tuning the optimum solution of the PID controllers (K<sub>p</sub>, K<sub>i</sub> and K<sub>d</sub>) by minimizing the multi-objective function. The potential of using Multi-objective Differential Evolution is to identify Pareto-optimal solution. A classic approach based on the Ziecgler-Nichols method is applied to make comparison. Simulation results demonstrate that the new tuning method using Multi-objective Differential Evolution has a better control system performance compared with the classic approach.

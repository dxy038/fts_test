Limitations of current numerical techniques have been outlined. The objective of this article is to point out that these statements of limitations may be applicable for the methodologies like FEM, FDTD and the hybrid MOM technique that the author has considered. Indeed, for such techniques even an analysis of a single Vivaldi element is a formidable problem. However, if one uses a higher order basis in a surface integral equation and solves this using the conventional method of moments with the commercially available code WIPL-D then it becomes clear that even the 2times2 Vivaldi array consisting of 12 elements actually can be solved on a laptop DELL INSPIRON 5150 computer using approximately 2 GB of RAM. With other techniques, such a small computing resource may only be able to model a single element. For complex composite metallic and dielectric structures, the PMCHWT formulation using a higher order basis is an efficient way to solve challenging computational electromagnetic problems

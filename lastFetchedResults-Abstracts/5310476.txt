Matrix converters are gaining attentions due to their direct AC/AC conversion nature, with no need of dc-link. In this study, a method, using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization process is presented, in order to improve the quality of output voltage and input current waveforms. The proposed method results in significant improvement of quality, in terms of total harmonic distortion, in both the output voltages and input currents. The main objective in this study is, to utilize the existing parameters of the input ac filter and the matrix converter, in a Genetic Algorithm process of optimization, in order to decrease output voltagesÂ´ harmonic content. Simulations have been carried out, in MATLAB<sup>&#174;</sup>/SIMULINK&#8482; environment, in order to verify and validate the expected results of the GA optimizations. Venturini algorithm is used to generate the duty cycle for each switch in the model. The results, obtained by this study, prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

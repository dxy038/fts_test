The ability of Vertical and/or Short Take-Off and Landing is the objective of advanced fighter and shipboard fighter. In this paper we proposed a prototype of tailless configured STOVL aerial vehicle. Based on which, the mathematical model was studied by mechanical analysis and CFD (Computing Fluid Dynamics) computation. Besides, an intelligent adaptive based control law was proposed and the optimization approach is employed to solve the constrained control allocation problem. The results show good closed loop performance and validate the intelligent optimization approach of constrained control allocation for flight control.

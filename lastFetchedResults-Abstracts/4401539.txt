Vehicular ad hoc networks are a subclass of wireless networks in which vehicles on the road act as nodes, exchanging traffic and road safety information. The traditional MANET specific routing protocols is not as effective in VANET environment. The occurrence of link breakage is very frequent in VANET when compared to MANET due to the swift movement of the vehicles. Hence, this highly dynamic behaviour of VANETs demands a reliable routing strategy. As of now, not much attention is laid on routing reliability of VANETs in highway environment. Our objective is to propose a reliable routing protocol that minimizes link breakage and thereby increasing the throughput in VANET- variable velocity environment. The mechanism is based on the mathematical model of normal (Gaussian) distribution, which is a continuous probability distribution function. This function is used to estimate the link reliability between the vehicular nodes in the road. Based on the computed link reliability values between the nodes, the system constructs an evolving graph in a dynamic fashion and the route reliability value is estimated from the graph. This route forms the Most Reliable Journey for the data transmission.

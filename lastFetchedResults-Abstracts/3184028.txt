In this paper work, a multi-objective Economic/Environmental power dispatch optimization problem is solved using evolutionary programming by using MAT-lab programming technique. The crux of the objective is to determine the most economic loadings of the generators, such that the required load demands of the generation can be met and the operation such as equality and inequality constraints of the generators including the total emissions within the allowable emission limit for satisfactory operation of the thermal power plant. In this work only one emission of Nitrogen oxide is considered for analysis. The economic/environmental load dispatch is analyzed in two cases. Case one deals excluding transmission losses and case two deals including transmission losses in the system. The standard data of IEEE 30 bus, Six Generator systems has been taken into account and simulated with aid of MAT-lab software and results are obtained. An apposite program has been developed using evolutionary programming technique and which has been verified for various load demand.

The main objective for a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) inverter is to feed the harvested energy from PV panels to the grid with high efficiency and high electrical power quality. In this paper, an improved maximum power point tracking method applied for a quasi-Z-source PV inverter is proposed to track the maximum power of the PV power system. Furthermore, the DC-link stable voltage control and AC-side power control of the entire system are designed. The simulated results illustrate the validity and correctness of the proposed approach, and an efficient method for PV power generation.

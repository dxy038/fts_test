System builders are becoming increasingly interested in robust design. We believe that a methodology for generating robustness metrics helps the robust design research efforts and, in general, is an important step in the efforts to create robust computing systems. The purpose of the research in this paper is to quantify the robustness of a resource allocation, with the eventual objective of setting a standard that could easily be instantiated for a particular computing system to generate robustness metric. We present our theoretical foundation for robustness metric and give its instantiation for a particular system.

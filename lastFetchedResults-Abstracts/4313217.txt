This paper addresses the optimal resource allocation problem for multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems. We apply an optimization algorithm to obtain a joint subcarrier and power allocation scheme based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) combined with dirty paper coding (DPC) assuming instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which is called as DPC-OFDMA. The ultimate objective is to minimize the total transmit power subject to individual required data rates constraints. To reduce the complexity of the optimal solution, the analysis is considered in two stages. The first stage addresses subcarriers allocation, in which users are allowable to share subcarriers. The second stage employs DPC technology to deal with simultaneous transmissions of the users sharing the same subcarriers. An efficient algorithm to choose the best possible ordering for DPC and the optimal precoding design of each user are also involved. Simulation results show that DPC-OFDMA scheme has high spectral and power efficiency than conventional fixed schemes, where fixed power and subcarriers are allocated to each user.

Background and Objective: Peptide as an agent in manufacturing new drugs has recently been taken into consideration. Brevinin2R is a nano peptide with a wide range of biological actions. Thus, the current study was designed in order to evaluate the in vitro effects of Brevinin2R on oral squamous cell carcinoma cells in comparison to normal mice fibroblast cells.

Materials and Methods: In this study, oral squamous cell carcinoma cells (KB) and normal mice fibroblast cells (L929) were cultured and&amp;nbsp; treated with different concentrations of Brevinin2R (0.130 &amp;micro;g/ml) for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Then, cell viability was calculated by MTT method. Data were fed to SPSS software (version 20) via which One Way ANOVA and Tukey tests was calculated for the collected data.

Results: The halfmaximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Brevinin2R for KB cells and L929 cells were 15.48 and 24.14 &amp;micro;g/ml respectively, demonstrating that higher concentration of Brevinin2R is necessary in order to reach IC50 concentration for L929 cells (about 1.5 times).

Conclusion: Results point out that Brevinin2R peptide is more effective on oral squamous cell carcinoma cells compared to normal mice fibroblast cells (L929).

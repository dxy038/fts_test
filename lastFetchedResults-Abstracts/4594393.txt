This paper proposes a robust technique for a sound source localization based on the time difference of arrival in noisy or reverberant environments. A nonlinear minimization problem for estimating source positions is formulated as a constrained optimization problem in consideration of room capacity. Then, a penalty function for a feasible region of this problem is used as the objective function. As a result, only estimation results within the room can be obtained. It is shown by several experiments that, by using the technique, estimation accuracy can be improved more than 25%

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the biosurfactant BS-UC on surface properties of microbial cells and biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. The biosurfactant BS-UC was produced by Candida antarctica from nundecane as the substrate. It was found that the addition of BS-UC influenced positively the emulsification and the biodegradation of a variety of n-alkanes substrates. Besides, BS-UC also changed the hydrophobicity and zeta potential of the cell surface, and thus made the microbial cell attach to the hydrophobic substrate easily. The cell transport experiment also indicated that the addition of BS-UC changed both zeta potential of the cell and that of the porous media, and improved the retention of the cells in the media. So it will make BS-UC a promising choice for use in bioremediation of petroleum contamination.

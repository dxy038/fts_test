According to extent of elcctrical distribution system, always probabilities of severe disturbances are available and this system may experience emergency condition in witch some of variables such as grid frequency , voltage , equipment limits, and etc. may be violated . To control and alleviate the problem and also prevent of electrical distribution system instability (that finally led to system black out) , the control (dispatching) center may using "Load Shedding and Generation Reallocation (LSGR)" terms.
But an important question here is: "how much is the optimum amount of load shedding and also generation reallocation to retrieval the power system to normal condition?"
For answering above question, based on one of the strongest mathematical method (Non linear programming), an effective LSGR optimization problem is proposed in this thesis.
In this mathematical optimization problem (Non linear programming) the
objective function consists of "load curtailment" and "powerplant
reallocation" terms as decision making variables.
Beside various constraints like equipment capabilities, voltage
magnitudes, frequency limitation and load flow equations, the load
dependency of voltage and frequency is considered.
Following, an algorithm is designed and proposed for getting the best
result/conclusion of LSGR optimization problem. Finally the developed
algorithm are tested on typical power system, the result achieved proved
that the technique are highly capable of relieving emergency conditions.

Each woman presents slightly different risk factors that should be considered during mammography image interpretation to reduce the risk of false negative. Given the complexity of the risk situation, and the variety of practical and affordable image processing techniques available, processes and systems sensitive to individual risk factors may reduce false negative reports. Bilateral registration as a process improvement may help to reduce risk of false negative mammography by providing statistical objective metrics to identify regions of interest in screening at risk women for whom historic images are not available, or for whom historic images are not useable.

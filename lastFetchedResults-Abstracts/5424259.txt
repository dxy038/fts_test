The objective is to obtain a control model that enables a mobile robot to follow trajectories that have been defined by path planning. The authors have imposed that the determined path be smoothed during the execution in order to minimize the consumption of energy. At first, they have developed an algorithm of control in an open loop using proprioceptive information. They then consider exteroceptive information in order to carry out an algorithm in a closed loop that allows one to control the motion of the robot on the path that it should follow

This paper presents robust topology optimization of electromagnetic machines by considering the magnetic degradation caused by mechanical and thermal stresses in punching, shrinking fitting, and other manufacturing processes. The topology optimization is performed using two methods: one is the robust genetic algorithm in which random noises are added to the magnetic characteristic parameters and the other takes the deviations in the objective and constraint functions due to the degradation into account. These methods are applied to optimization of the flux barrier shapes in an interior permanent magnetic motor to find that one can successfully realize robust design.

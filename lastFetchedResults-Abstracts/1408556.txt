This paper presents a multi-objective assignment problem (MAP) with interval parameters. Here, the model concentrates on three criteria: total cost, total profit and total operation time of assignment. The proposed model is classified as a nonlinear programming, in which it is difficult to solve. Hence, the model is converted into crisp linear programming problem by applying a substitution variables approach. In addition, a weighted min-max method is applied to transform the multi-objective problem into a single objective optimization problem. Finally, several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the implementation of the proposed approach. The results clearly provide some evidences that the proposed approach was easier to contrast compared with other approaches. The results also indicate that decision makersâ€™ preferences over various objectives could influence on solutions.

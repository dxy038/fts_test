This paper studies the problem of observer-based control of slosh in liquid container transfer via a PPR robot. The control inputs for the PPR robot are two forces and a torque applied to the prismatic joints and the revolute joint, respectively. The control objective is point-to-point transfer of an open liquid container while suppressing the sloshing modes. A full-state feedback that uses a reduced-order observer for the estimation of the slosh state is proposed to achieve the objective. The effectiveness of the proposed observer-based control law is illustrated through a computer simulation.

In this paper, we propose two new threshold based parallel multiuser scheduling schemes, namely (i) an on-off based scheduling (OOBS) scheme and (ii) a switched based scheduling (SBS) scheme. The objective is to reduce the complexity of implementation without a considerable performance loss in comparison with conventional selection based scheduling. While the OOBS scheme schedules all the users with an SNR above a fixed preselected signal to noise ratio (SNR) threshold, the SBS scheme schedules only the K<sub>s</sub> users with an acceptable SNR if there are enough acceptable users. Otherwise, the scheduler selects the best K<sub>s</sub> users. We analyze statistical characteristics and performances of these proposed schemes. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes can offer some decrease in the average feedback load without an important degradation in average bit error rate and average spectral efficiency.

Incorporating computer based multimedia material in college teaching has been almost a trend impossible to refuse. It is important to remember that simply following the trend usually yields poor results and costs far more than anticipated. The paper presents a process of developing multimedia instructional material for a college level engineering course in dynamic systems that did not just follow the trend of squeezing the multimedia into an already intensive conventional course material but rather tried to take unique advantage of the new technology to make the learning of the material more student-active and at the same time reduce the course load. An increased efficiency of the course delivery as means of controlling the escalating cost of the educational process has been an additional objective in this effort

We explore the feasibility of integrating in-situ sensors onto the surface of a silicon wafer, with the objective of placing this wafer into a processing tool to obtain real time measurements. This technique has numerous benefits: increased measurement speed, reduced sensor introduction cost, and increased spatial and temporal information Various sensors and sensor wafers have been developed and tested in a variety of processing tools. Repeatable, real time measurements in harsh environments such as high temperature and plasma have been obtained

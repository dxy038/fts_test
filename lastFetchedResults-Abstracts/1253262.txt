The objective of this paper was to investigate the high temperature phase reactions that take place in a 3TiC/2Si powder mixture during heating. Special attention was paid to the formation of Ti3SiC2 and to the evaporation of gases. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry were used for in situ analysis of the phase reactions. Samples were heated at a rate of 5 K/min to various temperatures between 890 and 1450 °C and then cooled at a rate of 20 K/min. Heat treated samples were analysed by X-ray diffractometry. The first phase to form was TiSi2, which was consumed in the Ti3SiC2 forming reactions. No decomposition of Ti3SiC2 was observed at temperatures below 1450 °C. Evaporation of CO(g) and small amounts of Si(g) were detected at 1430 °C.

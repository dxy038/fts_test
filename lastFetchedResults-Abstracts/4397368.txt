This paper explores different control techniques to control the temperature of material samples in a solar furnace. Solar furnaces provide the means to concentrate solar radiation on samples placed at their foci. The objective of the system is to control the temperature of the samples for testing purpose and the solar furnace are characterized to provide concentrated solar energy for testing applications. Control techniques including PI, PID, Fuzzy MPAC are implemented and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of each methodology.

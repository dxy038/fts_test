A thermal impact welding process has been developed which allows the thermal joining of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) matrix materials with steel and aluminum substrates, respectively. The objective is to render manufacturing of innovative slide elements possible without the need for an up to now commonly used layer of sintered bronze in order to enhance the adhesion of the polymer. It is proven that excellent joining quality and wear resistance of the polymer layer can be achieved without sintered bronze.

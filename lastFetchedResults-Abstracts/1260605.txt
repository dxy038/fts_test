 Objective/Hypothesis: to study the effect of fasting on voice in women: abstinence from food and water intake between 14 and 18 hours. Study Design: a prospective study on female subjects. Material and Method: A total of 28 female subjects were included in this study. Their age ranged between 21 and 45 years. Subjects with vocal symptoms or vocal fold lesions were excluded. The subjects were tested when they were not fasting and while fasting after the first week of intermittent fasting during Ramadan. Each subject was first asked about her vocal symptoms and the ease of phonation or phonatory effort. Then each underwent acoustic analysis and laryngeal video-endostroboscopy. Results: Vocal fatigue was the most common reported complaint (53.6%) followed by deepening of the voice (21.4%) and harshness (10.2%). Self-reported phonatory effort was significantly affected by fasting (P value < 0.001). Out of the 28 subjects, 23 had an increase in their phonatory effort. Vocal acoustic parameters did not change markedly except for the maximum phonation time, which decreased significantly. Laryngeal video-endostroboscopy did not reveal any significant changes during fasting. All stroboscopic parameters were the same except for a decrease in the amplitude of the mucosal waves in one subject and the presence of a posterior chink in three subjects. Conclusion: Fasting affects voice. There is an increase in the phonatory effort, and vocal fatigue is the most common symptom.

Active power line conditioner (APLC) is a type of active filter that compensates for power system waveform distortion. The objective is to develop and illustrate a procedure for calculating the APLC injection current needed to minimize voltage harmonic distortion throughout a power network. The procedure is intended for use with APLC frequency domain correction in networks that are experiencing periodic harmonic distortion. The injection currents are determined using nonlinear optimization theory. The chief contribution lies in developing a simple procedure for finding the Fourier series of the optimum APLC injection current waveform. The procedure is intended to apply in any of the following situations: (1) one single-phase APLC in a single-phase network; (2) one single-phase APLC in a three-phase network; or (3) one three-phase APLC in a balanced three-phase network

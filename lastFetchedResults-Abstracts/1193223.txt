The objective of this paper is to examine the evolution of rheological properties (e.g. yield stress) and to evaluate the use of these properties as a method to monitor structure formation and mechanical property development (i.e. setting) in cementitious materials. The authors utilize the stress growth technique to assess the development of a solid structure in cement pastes. An increase in the yield strength of the system due to cement hydration is identified to occur near the end of the dormant period as identified by chemical shrinkage. The transition from a fluid to a solid state and the development of elastic properties in the material are both noted to occur prior to the time of initial set as identified by the Vicat needle.

Objective
The present study examines the patient's own appraisal of her sexual responsiveness after hysterectomy.
Study design
Four hundred women who had undergone hysterectomy within a 3-year period were selected randomly and asked to respond to a questionnaire that was devised to ascertain the patient's own objective evaluation of self-image, sexuality, and sexual response before and after hysterectomy. The confidential responses were analyzed, noting the presence of any significant divergence between demographic and procedural cohorts.
Results
Of 126 respondents, 48.4% underwent total abdominal hysterectomy; 34.1% underwent vaginal hysterectomy, and 17.4% underwent supracervical hysterectomy. The mean patient age was 49.7Â±8.7 years. No direct correlation was found between hysterectomy type and age. Most women did not report any significant deterioration in mental attitude after the procedure (P = .788). Self and body image also remained consistent, with only 25.3% indicating a change for the worse. Only 10.3% of respondents felt less feminine after hysterectomy; nearly 70% of the respondents did not feel less feminine. Responses that pertained to libido, sexual activity, or feelings of femininity did not reveal significant changes (P > .05). Satisfaction with procedural choice was positive (54.8%), with only 7.1% responding unfavorably.
Conclusion
The responses suggest that neither self-image nor sexuality need diminish after hysterectomy. The type of hysterectomy that was performed did not appear to affect the attitudes of the respondents.

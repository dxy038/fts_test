This paper presents a novel profit-based model for multistage distribution network expansion planning. In the proposed model, some capabilities of the distribution automation system are considered to achieve a plan that is more compatible with the strategic plan towards a smart distribution grid. Moreover, a method for reliability evaluation of a distribution network in the planning studies is proposed. The objective function of the planning problem is the net present value of the companyÂ´s profit. The problem is solved by employing the genetic algorithm approach as a promising technique in solving the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. The proposed method is evaluated on an illustrative test network and the obtained results are presented and discussed.

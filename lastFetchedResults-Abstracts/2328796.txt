
Aims: Students regulate their study approaches based on teacher evaluation practices. Current methods of evaluating the learners’ knowledge have shortcomings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the challenges of evaluation of learning of medical sciences universities’ students and the impact of these challenges on deliberate practice study approach.
Instrument & Methods: This descriptive-survey research was performed in all undergraduate, master, and medical students (basic sciences stage) students of Hamedan University of Medical Sciences in 2014 and 357 students were selected by random sampling. Data were gathered using recognizing the challenges of evaluation of students and Deliberate Practice Study Approach questionnaires. Data analyses were done by descriptive statistics, factor analysis technique and Structural Equation Modeling using LISREL and SPSS 20 software.
Findings: Challenges related to the lack of attention to individual differences (0.81) had the highest and challenges related to the use of non-objective evaluation (0.73) had the lowest loading factor. The effect of evaluation challenges on deliberate practice study approach was -0.74 (p<0.01). Conclusion: More tangible the educational experiences for students and be done in more interactive environment and in a way their individual differences and abilities be identified and recognized, their challenges in the current practices of evaluation of students are minimized, and affected Deliberate Practice Study Approach.

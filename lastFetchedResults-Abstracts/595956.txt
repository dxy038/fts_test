Lymphadenopathy is defined as an abnormality in the size or character of lymph nodes, is caused by the invasion or propagation of either inflammatory cells or neoplastic cells into the node. Numerous factors, such as age, localization, size and consistency, present and previous pathological conditions are very important in order to define the future diagnostic and therapeutic course. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the etiological and clinical characteristics of lymphadenopathy in children in the area of the Tuzla Canton. Patients and Methods: This retrospective-prospective study analyzed the medical records of the Department of Pediatrics in Tuzla of 334 patients in age from 0 to 14 years, in which the clinical signs of palpable lymph nodes of one or more regions was diagnosed in the period from January 1st 1998 to June 30th 2003. The anamnesis data, clinical findings, diagnostic procedures results, therapeutic approach and disease outcome etiology defined lymphadenopathy were analyzed. Results: Out of 334 children, localized lymphadenopathy have been verified in 230, and generalized in 104. Male/female ratio was 1:1.8. Final results of our study have shown the etiologies as following: Infectious etiologies, 79.34%, neoplastic 11.34%, and non-neoplastic 9.28%. In neoplastic etiologies, lymphoblastic leukemia has been the most often verified neoplastic disease (68.4%), not related to the age or sex of patient, and equally presented as localized and generalized lymphadenopathy. In this study lymphomas were presented by generalized lymphadenopathy. Conclusion: The regional and generalized lymphadenopathy in children depends on their etiology and has significant prognostic value for the disease.

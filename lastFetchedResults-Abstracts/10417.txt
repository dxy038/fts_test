This paper introduces an innovative method of in situ water main rehabilitation to solve the metallic pipeline corrosion problem while preventing future lead and lime leaching. The existing main is used as a form, and a thin layer of fiber-reinforced cement mortar lining is applied on the internal surface to form the rehabilitated main. To compare the feasibility of the approach to existing methods of pipe lining, experimental investigations are carried out. The objective is to compare the water quality, pipe friction, and structural strength of pipe sections of the proposed design in contrast to those of existing methods. The results show that the fiber-reinforced lining provides an improved pipeline rehabilitation option, for which the iron content and turbidity of the transported water are much lower than those from other methods. Increased carrying capacity and structural strength, as well as the provision of additional tensile strength for the rehabilitated mains, are also some of the advantages. With this method, a more resilient pipe with protection from water contamination and pipeline corrosion resulted.

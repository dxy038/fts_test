Tuberculosis infects one third of the world population and the leading of death worldwide. Lymphadenitis is the most frequent form of extra pulmonary tuberculosis. Breast tuberculosis is an extremely rare form of extra pulmonary tuberculosis. We introduced a case of breast tuberculo­sis that presented with axillary sinus tract, left supraclavicular lymph node and left breast edema.
A 15 year-old girl with a history of left breast swelling and left axil­lary sinus tract discharge from 2 months ago was admitted to our hos­pital. The physical examination showed left supraclavicular lympha- denopathy (size=l*0.5, fixed, firm with mild tenderness), left breast mass (size=2><2, firm, mild tenderness) with normal overlying skin, left axillary sinus tract with large mass (size=8><8, tender, erythema­tous and firm). She has also edema of the chest wall especially in the left hemi thorax. Chest X-Ray was normal and ultrasonographic study of breast showed an ovaloid mass (13x29) with cystic structure and multiple septations. Abdominopelvic sonography was normal and PPD was negative. Excisional biopsy of left axillary lesion showed granu­loma and caseous necrosis compatible with tuberculosis. Within 2 weeks of anti-TB medication, the patient developed with left breast discharge. After 6 weeks of anti-TB therapy discharge from this site and left axillary sinus tract was stopped.

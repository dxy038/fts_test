In this paper, frequency reconfigurable slot-patch antenna with reflector at the back of an antenna is presented. The proposed antenna consists of a microstrip patch antenna and a microstrip slot antenna where the slot antenna is positioned at the ground plane underneath the patch. Three switches are placed in the slot. The antenna is capable to reconfigure up to six different frequency bands from 1.7 GHz to 3.5 GHz. The microstrip patch antenna produces three different frequency bands with directional radiation pattern while the microstrip slot antenna produces another three frequency bands with bidirectional radiation pattern. Due to the reflector placed at the back of the antenna, the radiation pattern is directional at all frequency bands. Simulated and measured results are used to demonstrate the performance of the antenna. The simulated and measured reflection coefficients and radiation patterns are presented and compared.

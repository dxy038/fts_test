This paper proposes a low-complexity joint source and relay energy-efficient resource allocation scheme for the two-hop multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) system when channel state information is available. We first simplify the multivariate unconstrained energy efficiency (EE)-based problem and derive a convex closed-form approximation of its objective function as well as closed-form expressions of subchannel rates in both the unconstrained and power constraint cases. We then rely on these expressions for designing a low-complexity energy-efficient joint resource allocation algorithm. Our approach has been compared with a generic nonlinear constrained optimization solver and results have indicated the low-complexity and accuracy of our approach. As an application, we have also compared our EE-based approach against the optimal spectral efficiency (SE)-based joint resource allocation approach and results have shown that our EE-based approach provides a good trade-off between power consumption and SE.

The multiparametric 0-1-Integer Programming (0-1-IP) problem relative to the objective function is a family of 0-1-IP problems which are related by having identical constraint matrix and right-hand-side vector. In this paper we present an algorithm to perform a complete multiparametric analysis relative to a generalized min max objective function such that the min sum and min max are particular cases.

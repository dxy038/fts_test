The objective of this study was to control the reproductive cycle of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) through determining the effects of different photoperiods and handling stress on the reproduction quality, timing and quality of spawning, fertilization, sex steroids, and cortisol concentrations. In this study, 72 pikeperch broodstocks with an average weight of 1367 ± 55.3 g were exposed to different photoperiods including constant light (24L:0D), constant darkness (0L:24D), and 12 h of light, 12 h of darkness (12L:12D) for 40 days. Half of the broodstocks of each photoperiod treatment were exposed to handling stress at a specific time of the day. Applying different photoperiods caused changes in the timing of broodstocks’ spawning, so that fish under 24L:0D spawned earlier than those of other photoperiods, and stressed fish of the 0L:24D photoperiod had a delayed spawning compared to others. Also, the spawning of the broodstocks at different photoperiods which were exposed to handling stress was either delayed or did not occur at all. The highest and lowest spawnings were observed in the morning and at night, respectively. Fertilization percentage, number of eggs per gram, sex steroids including estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, as well as cortisol and calcium concentrations did not show any significant difference in different photoperiods and handling stress. In stressed males of the 24L:0D photoperiod, there only was a significant decrease of testosterone concentration compared to the beginning of the experiment. Results indicated that the spawning performance of pikeperch broodstocks could be considerably stimulated using an effective photoperiod. Similarly, pikeperch broodstocks in culture systems are usually affected by handling stress, and this stress could lead to a poor reproductive performance and inhibition of spawning.

Reverberated speech signals in noisy acoustical environments cause some problems such as reducing speech intelligibility, distinguishing speakers, locating source, quality for hands-free telephony, hearing aid, etc. Adaptive filters can be applied to suppress the interfering signals and reduce the reverberation effects or to dereverberate the received speech signals at microphone. In this paper, Bayesian State-Space Kalman and Wiener filters have been employed to reduce the effect of noise on received speech signal and their results are compared. Also, a dereverberation method is proposed by applying an inverse filter to the received speech signals to reduce the effect of reverberation on received speech signal by single microphone. Different values of the Room Impulse Response are used in the dereverberation procedure and the results are compared. The results show a significant improvement in the quality of the received signal for the desired reverberant environment. Furthermore, the mean opinion score (MOS) of subjective listening quality (LQ) and objective quality score from the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) of two different values of RIR coefficient are compared.

The primary function of the RLP is to reduce over the air frame error rate to a level tolerable by data services built over the CDMA air interface. When transmitting data, RLP is a pure NAK-based best effort selective repeat protocol. The main objective of this paper is to study the performance of the radio link protocol (RLP) as in IS 707 to support data services over the IS 95 CDMA physical layer. Since the RLP provides a stream-based in-sequence delivery of data to the upper layers, retransmissions of frames received in error cause delayed delivery of correctly received frames. This delay distribution is analytically characterized for the ARQ strategy used by the different versions of RLP (types 1, 2 and 3). Simulation results to verify the analytical model are also presented

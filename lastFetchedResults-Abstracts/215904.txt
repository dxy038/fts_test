Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma is the sixth most
common malignancy in the world today. ING] b/pJJ is a
newly-discovered tumor suppressor which enhances p5J activity.
Transfer of pJJ protein from nucleu s to cytoplasmic compartment
has been previously report ed in leukemias. The objective
of this study was to determine the correlation between
pJJin gl b cytoplasmic transfer and lymph node meta stasis in
oral squamous cell carcinoma.
Methods: Fifty seven patient streated with surgery alone or
surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy for primary oral squamous
cell carcinoma were enrolled into this study. Immunohistochemi
cal express ion of all of the above-mentioned markers was studied.
Results: Analysis of the sections demonstrated that p5J and
MDM2 were expressed in 45.6% and 68.4% of patients, respectively.
pJJING l b nuclear expression was completely absent
while cytoplasmic translocation was noted in 78.9% of cases.
Positive cytoplasmic expression of pJ JINGJ b correlated with
increased risk of lymphat ic metastasis (p=O.04). No further correlation
with overall disease recurrence or survival was noted.
Conclusion: Apparently, pJJ ING Ib cytoplasmic transfer
correlates with lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell
carcinoma.

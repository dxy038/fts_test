
Introduction: Although extensive research has been conducted on lung cancer markers, a singular clinically applicable marker has not been found yet. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and the specificity of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA and lung-specific X protein (LUNX) mRNA biomarkers in peripheral blood to detect lung cancer individually and simultaneously. Methods: Thirty patients affected by lung cancer and 30 healthy individuals were studied in this research. Three vials of cDNA were made from each sample after taking peripheral blood samples and extracting total RNA. Each sample was examined by the real-time RT-PCR technique. The result from each vial was then compared with the sensitivity of overall marker. Results: The CEA mRNA was positive in 24 out of 30 lung cancer patients. Hence, its sensitivity was determined at 80%, differing significantly from that observed in healthy individuals, where 11 positive cases were seen. The overall sensitivity of this marker was significantly associated with positivity in vials 2 and 3 but not in vial 1. The LUNX mRNA was positive in 21 out of 30 patients, indicating 70% sensitivity. This finding significantly differed from that in healthy individuals. The overall sensitivity of this marker was significantly associated with positivity in vials 1 and 3, but not in vial 2. In 93.3% of the patients, at least one positive marker was observed. Conclusion: The mentioned mRNA could be suggested as sensitive and specific markers in peripheral blood for primary diagnosis of lung cancer. Iran. Biomed. J. 19 (1): 17-22, 2015

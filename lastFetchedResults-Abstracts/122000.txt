Every year the degradation of agricultural soils are increasing due to improper tillage operations. The main objective of this study was evaluation and comparison of shallow and conventional tillage methods and their effects on wheat yield and its components. The study was conducted in three consecutive years with two treatments and four replications. Conventional tillage method comprised of: moldboard plowing at the depth of 20-25 cm, disk harrowing at the depth of 12-15 cm, leveling, following by chemical fertilizer and planting with grain drill. Shallow tillage method was included: disk harrowing in the depth of 6-8 cm after removing residue, disk harrowing in the depth of 12-15 cm in fall, spike tooth harrowing, following by chemical fertilizer and planting with grain drill. The treatments were arranged in a complete randomize block design. The analysis of data indicated that conventional tillage is better than shallow tillage as far as grain yield, number of heads in unit area, number of grain in the head, weight of 1000 seeds, weight of straw and harvesting index are concerned. Significant differences were observed between treatments in some areas. The average wheat yield by conventional tillage was 315 kg more than that of by shallow tillage. This difference might be due to higher plowing depth and better residual burying with moldboard plow. The grain yield in surface tillage was 90% of the yield in conventional tillage. Conventional tillage consumes more energy compared to shallow tillage, takes more time, causes more depreciation of the implements and therefore increases costs. This necessitates more study to obtained correct results. Considering that the farmers often cultivate two times a year, and the time for cultivation is short, and also no significant differences in the yield by the two methods, the shallow tillage can be therefore recommended in irrigated wheat in Iran.

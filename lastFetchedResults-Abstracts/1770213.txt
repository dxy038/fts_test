Introduction: Diabetes Type 1 is one of the most common pediatric chronic conditions. Metabolic control and adherence to medications is weaker in adolescents with diabetes type 1 than preadolescent children. Lack of follow up of treatment regime causes short and long term complications in adolescents with diabetes type 1. So this disease demands special self-care behaviors lifelong. One of the most effective factors on self care is self-efficacy. 
Objective: Present study aims to determine the correlation between self-care and self-efficacy among adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of three months from January to March 2011. Subjects included all adolescents with type 1 diabetes (about 50 patients) who referred to the clinic of Pediatric Hospital in Rasht. Data were collected through interview using a three part questionnaire covering demographic data, self-efficacy and self-care in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 19, and descriptive and analytical statistics (Pearson correlation square, one way variance).
Results: Mean score of samples’ self-efficacy was 32.91± 11.79 and self-care mean was 131.86 ± 15.88. In this study, Pearson correlation square showed a significant positive correlation between self-care and self-efficacy (p < 0.0001). 
Conclusion: This study showed a significant positive correlation between self-care and self-efficacy. Therefore self-efficacy is significant pre factor for successful self-care behavior and promotion of self-efficacy methods can improve self-care of diabetic adolescents.

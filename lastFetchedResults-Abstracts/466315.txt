Objective: This study was undertaken to compare general versus epidural anesthesia during hysteroscopic endometrial resection for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Study Design: In a prospective comparative study, 24 women with abnormal uterine bleeding that was unresponsive to conservative medical management were randomly assigned to undergo hysteroscopic endometrial resection with either general or epidural anesthesia. Results: The durations of the endometrial resection procedure were similar for women who had general and epidural anesthesia (28.3 ± 4.2 minutes vs 27.5 ± 5.4 minutes, respectively). However, there was a statistically significantly lower absorption of distention fluid in women who underwent the procedure with general rather than epidural anesthesia (380.8 ± 158.2 mL vs 648.3 ± 157.1 mL, respectively; P< .0005). Conclusion: A significantly lower amount of glycine distention fluid was absorbed during endometrial resection in women who underwent the procedure with general rather than epidural anesthesia.

Introduction & Objective: Heat shock proteins help the cells’ ability to keep their structures against different stresses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of one ses-sion continuous and intermittent aerobic exercise on blood responses of HSP72, cortisol and creatine kinase (CK).
Materials & Methods: This study is semi-experimental in which 21 male student athletes were divided in continuous group (n=7), intermittent group (n=7) and control group (n=7). Exer-cise protocol of continuous group included 1 hour running with 80% maximum heart rate in-tensity and  that of intermittent group was 3 stages of 20 minute running with the same inten-sity as of  continuous group . Blood sampling of basal, pre exercise, immediately after exer-cise and 90 minutes after exercise were gathered and the amounts of HSP72, cortisol and CK, were measured by ELISA, RIA and Enzymatic methods respectively. The data was analyzed with one way ANOVA and repeated measure analysis of variance at P?0.05 significance level.
Results: HSP72 levels in the continuous group and intermittent group despite an increase in the average did not show a statistically significant difference. Changes between the groups were significant in immediately after exercise and 90 minutes after exercise (P.values respectively 0.017 and 0.002). CK changes in continuous group were significant but cortisol changes in different stages hadn’t significant difference
Conclusion: Exercise with its role associated with cortisol and CK will stimulate HSP72 and continuous exercise will make further increase in HSP72 and CK increasing leads to a greater HSP72 response.

A scheme for very low bit rate coding of images is presented. A pyramidal structure, constructed from the wavelet decomposition of the original image on successive dyadic resolutions, serves as the basic representation of the image. Entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ) is adopted to quantize various subimages lying on the pyramid levels. Optimal entropy coding of the resulted indices can yield very low bit rates at appreciably high objective quality

The design of optimal acoustic sensors for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is studied. Specifications for a typical AUV sensor package are discussed and a qualitative performance objective is developed. A technique for designing optimum projector and hydrophone arrays for a given size aperture is outlined. A brief discussion on how to use the results of the array design study to find the best operating frequency for maximum range detection is presented. Finally, a complete design example is given. Results suggest that it is not adequate to design a system based solely on absorption. In fact. gains in range capability due to increased directivity can significantly offset absorption losses. Thus. it may be possible to use somewhat higher operating frequencies to achieve both enhanced resolution and increased range capability

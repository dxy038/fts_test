Objective
To achieve optimal diagnostic accuracy, measurements of nerve conduction velocity require standardised tissue temperatures. To warm an extremity to a desired temperature that remains constant during the measurement may be difficult, especially in subjects with low finger temperatures. The aim of this study was to investigate if a submaximal bicycle ergometer test before the examination would be a useful method of obtaining high and stable finger temperatures during nerve conduction studies in the hand.
Methods
114 women aged 25–65 (median 44) performed a bicycle ergometer test on an electrically braked bicycle ergometer (Siemens-Elema) before they underwent a nerve conduction test.
Results
Before cycling, the mean finger temperature was 28.1 °C (range 20.5–35.4 °C) and 15 min after the test 35.1 °C (range 30.3–36.9 °C). The levels remained almost constant throughout the nerve conduction examination, which had a duration of approximately 25 min.
Conclusions
A bicycle ergometer test proved to be a simple and effective method of raising hand temperature.

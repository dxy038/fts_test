in the flotation process, the froth structure has a great influence on the metallurgical performance of the cell Moreover, the structure of the froth can he improved by altering the operating conditions. In this work. the effects of parameters such as chemical agent concentration, air flowrate and froth depth on the copper froth strcuture have been ,studied quantitavely To achieve this objective, first and ruder different operating Conditions, froth pictures are taken. J'hen with an image analysis technique the most important indices, such as average size, size distribution and circularity factor of the bubbles are exiracied and a relationship between these indices and the operating parameters is established.

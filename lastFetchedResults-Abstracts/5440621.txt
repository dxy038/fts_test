The aim of this paper was to obtain a practical procedure for processing the experimental data acquired by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system to obtaining optimum precision. A number of more hundred compounds, belonging at different chemical class (including pharmaceutics) were detected as micro-pollutants in surface waters. They are in small concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 of ng/1. The main objective of the papers is precise determination of this compounds using GC/MS area as experimental data. The calibration data are described by three type of function f<sub>1</sub>=ax+b, f<sub>2</sub>=ax and f<sub>3 </sub>=ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c. The obtained precision is discussed in correlation with used function for two compounds, diazepam and triclosan

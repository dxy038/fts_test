Nowadays for power system oscillations damping, besides PSSs, the use of flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices has reached equal importance. A fuzzy controller is a nonlinear controller and it is not so sensitive to system topology, parameter and operating condition changes as the conventional ones. This controller used to design both Fuzzy PSS and Fuzzy FACTS stabilizer in multi machine power system. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the enhancement of damping the power system oscillation via coordinated design of the fuzzy power system stabilizer (FPSS) and fuzzy FACTS device stabilizer(FFDS). It can be achieved by using an opportune local and remote signals for FPSS and FFDS. Simulation results on the multi machine power system illustrate the improvement provided by the proposed synchronized fuzzy Stabilizers on power system dynamic performance.

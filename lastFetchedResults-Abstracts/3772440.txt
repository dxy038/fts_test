Unidirectional oscillation in a ring-resonator-type semiconductor laser was demonstrated in a square-shaped orbiter laser using an optical feedback mechanism. The bistable switching phenomenon between the unidirectional and bidirectional oscillation was observed synchronized with the switching of the longitudinal lasing mode. A longitudinal-mode bistability results from the compound cavity system formed by the orbiter laser and output waveguide. The feedback light from the output waveguide end interferes with the orbiter lasing light. Switching between the unidirectional and bidirectional oscillation was controlled by injecting a current into the output waveguide, which varies the phase condition of the feedback light.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

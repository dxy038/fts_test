The objective of this paper is to propose a new topology of a double - input DC/DC converter for implementation in fuel cell vehicles in order to simplify the power system and reduce the cost of power electronics. The proposed topology consists of two parallel connected buck-boost fused DC-DC converters with fuel cell and battery as voltage sources driving a traction induction motor interfaced through a voltage source inverter. The operational principle of the proposed double - input converter and control strategy are explained. The proposed topology is modeled and simulated in Matlab/Simulink. The characteristics of the fuel cell and the battery are introduced.

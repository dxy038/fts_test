Within the framework of numerical modelling and multi-objective control of partial differential equations, in this work we deal with the problem of determining the optimal location of a new industrial plant. We take into account both economic and ecological objectives, and we look not only for the optimal location of the plant but also for the optimal management of its emissions rate. In order to do this, we introduce a mathematical model (a system of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations) for the numerical simulation of air pollution. Based on this model, we formulate the problem in the field of multi-objective optimal control from a cooperative viewpoint, recalling the standard concept of Pareto-optimal solution, and pointing out the usefulness of Pareto-optimal frontier in the decision making process. Finally, a numerical algorithm – based on a characteristics/Galerkin discretization of the adjoint model – is proposed, and some numerical results for a hypothetical situation in the region of Galicia (NW Spain) are presented.

A new multi-objective formulation named normalized weighting method for the reactive power and voltage control in a distribution system is proposed. Four important objectives include reactive power, feeder loss, voltage deviation and voltage profile are all considered in this paper. These objectives are almost equaled important for electric utility companies, but they are somewhat non-commensurable with each other. In view of this, a normalized weighting method for the multi-objective problem is proposed. It can provide a set of flexible solutions by following the intention of decision makers. To increase the realism for practical use, the load and operating constraints of the system are all considered. Also, the comparative studies on the actual Tai-power system are given to demonstrate the effectiveness on the dispatch scheduling about capacitors and ULTC in a distribution system. The results have shown that the proposed method can provide a promising schedule for the distribution system.

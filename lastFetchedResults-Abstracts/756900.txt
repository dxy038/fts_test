Objective
To detect origin and course and to evaluate viability in patients with anomalous RCA.
Design

3D coronary MR angiography and viability study using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-MRI) was performed.
Setting

A tertiary hospital center.
Patients

Four patients, selected from the catheter lab, were studied.
Results

Anomalous RCA from the left sinus of Valsalva was identified in all patients. Inferior myocardial infarction was documented in three patients.
Conclusions

Magnetic resonance imaging can non-invasively identify anomalous RCA and perform viability study in the same examination.

Smartphones are used as a communication channel for exchanging user data and coordinating their business work. Users are more concerned about their private data that are stored on their portable devices, but unfortunately these devices are more prone to attacks by malicious users. The objective of this paper is to provide a new authentication system based on Color-Code such that it will preserve userÂ´s privacy and improve smartphone security. Every individual person has his own choice to select different colors. A color sequence can be a variety of unique color combinations and they are easy to remember. A user would specify desired Color-Code sequence as a passkey to authenticate user on the device. In order to fortify smartphone security from malicious users, this system uses random colors to increase difficulty of brute force attack. This system is based on multi-phase security schema which authenticates users and safeguards their privacy on a smartphone.

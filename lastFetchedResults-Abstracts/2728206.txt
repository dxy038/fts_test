In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to obtain the optimal operating point of spectrum sensing in overlay spectrum sharing systems. The objective is to maximize the secondary service achievable capacity subject to the primary service collision probability as well as the other system and service constraints. In the related literature the miss detection probability, as the main reason of collision, is often considered to model the impact of spectrum sensing on the achievable ergodic capacity of the secondary service. In this paper, however, we directly consider the collision probability constraint in finding the optimal ergodic capacity instead of considering the miss detection probability. We then propose a framework in which other opportunities which lie in the wireless channel fluctuation and power allocation are also extracted in favor of achieved capacity. In addition to the conventional One-Shot (O-S) scheme, we also propose four novel approaches to solve the optimization problem: Modified-One-Shot (M-O-S) scheme, Multi-Shot (M-S) scheme, Conservative-Modified-One-Shot (C-O-S) scheme, and Restricted-Modified-One-Shot (R-O-S) scheme. Our studies show that the proposed formulation results in a higher secondary service capacity even when compared to the cases with very low miss detection probability. In the proposed schemes in this paper, the main decision parameter is the average (over fading) received interference at the secondary service receiver due to the primary service transmission, I, which can be simply measurable in the secondary transmitter. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to investigate various system aspects. Our studies further suggest that for very low, moderate, and very high values of (I) , the proper schemes are C-O-S, M-S, and M-O-S, respectively.

Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods were originally developed for linear systems of equations with symmetric coefficient matrices. The objective of this paper is to investigate the applicability of the AMG solvers in electromagnetic finite-element analyses, which lead to nonsymmetric matrices. The excellent performances of the AMG solvers are demonstrated in (two-dimensional and three-dimensional) electromagnetic analyses of a magnetohydrodynamic generator and in a three-dimensional eddy-current analysis including a moving conductor.

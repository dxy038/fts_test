In the field of the social security prevention and control, various safety and security measures and installations have come into full play, but in them, there are some weak points, such as improper designs and the separation of people´s prevention from the material prevention and the technical prevention. The effectiveness evaluation on the security and prevention system has often emphasized particularly the aspects of the management and experiences, lacking in the theoretical and technical ways and means to do scientific quantitative evaluations. It is hard to support the formation and establishment of the complete, high-efficient and integrated prevention and control systems, so the research on the prevention and protection capability of security and prevention installations and the risk prediction technology, and the establishment of the objective, efficiency-and-risk evaluation architecture of the system prevention and protection are one of the major strategic tasks in the field of the national security prevention development at present. The thesis makes a complete carding and sum-up of the present theories, ways and means of the effectiveness evaluation, which is of great scientific importance to establishing the emergency public security architecture with scientific prediction, effective prevention and control, and high efficiency.

The skew correction of scanned document images is an important step toward an automatic recognition system. Several techniques have been developed to estimate the skew angle of a scanned document. However, most of these techniques have the problem of expensive computational costs. A variation of a fast method based on parallelograms covering is presented in this article. The objective is to obtain lower computation time and provide a way to work well over noisy images and also over different layouts containing non-text areas with no decrease in performance. Experimental study with different databases achieved results that overcome previous techniques.

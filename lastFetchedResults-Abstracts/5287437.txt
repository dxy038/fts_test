Based on the time-domain analysis, a time-domain mathematical model of three-phase three-wire active power filter (APF) current control loop is established; Predictive control equation and its optimal feasible solution with minimum objective function value are gotten, and the sliding-mode control strategy of current control loop is deduced. A novel optimization-sliding mode control strategy is proposed, with this control strategy the current tracking error can be reduced quickly and the chattering can be reduced effectively. The control performance under the proposed control strategy is analyzed. The proposed control strategy can improve current tracking speed and accuracy, provide both robustness response and a good dynamic response of the current tracking control, and has the characteristics of simple computation and easy application. The simulation and experiment results show its validity and feasibility

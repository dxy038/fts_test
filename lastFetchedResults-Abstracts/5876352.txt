Several issues of public rental housing raised during the construction process have come into notice. An obvious one is that the mode of excessive concentration of indemnificatory housing will exacerbate residential spatial differentiation, resulting in aggregation of poverty. Current strategies applied to deal with this problem, the mode of small-scale "mixed housing between rich and poor," which is lack of maneuverability, will result in a waste of social resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a new mode which adjusts the proportion of public rental housing in a particular region based on the concept of mixed-incoming housing and in line with the "large mixture, small cluster" planning mode. And further, taking Chongqing as an example, we demonstrated how to decide proportion of public rental housing by making an evaluation of 10 regional blocks, so as to promote the development of public rental residential to coordinate with local conditions by presenting evaluations of urban areas according to the demand of target population and the objective conditions of regional resources.

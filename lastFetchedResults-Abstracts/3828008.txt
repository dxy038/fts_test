This paper deals with control of voltage and frequency of an autonomous wind energy conversion system (AWECS) based on capacitor-excited asynchronous generator and feeding three-phase four-wire loads. The proposed controller consists of three single-phase insulated gate bipolar junction transistor (IGBT)-based voltage source converters (VSCs) and a battery at dc link. These three single-phase VSCs are connected to each phase of the generator through three single-phase transformers. The proposed controller is having bidirectional flow capability of active and reactive powers by which it controls the system voltage and frequency with variation of consumer loads and the speed of the wind. VSCs along with transformer function as a voltage regulator, a harmonic eliminator, a load balancer, and a neutral current compensator while the battery is used to control the active power flow which, in turn, maintains the constant system frequency. The complete electromechanical system is modeled and simulated in the MATLAB using the Simulink and the power system blockset (PSB) toolboxes. The simulated results are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed controller as a voltage and frequency regulator, harmonic eliminator, load balancer, and neutral current compensator for different electrical (varying consumer loads) and mechanical (varying wind speed) dynamic conditions in an autonomous wind energy conversion system.

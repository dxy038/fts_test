Purpose – The purpose of the paper is to illustrate the complexity surrounding the meaning of the
terms “economic reality” and “neutral representation” as these terms are applied to the resolution of
financial accounting issues.
Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the concept of epistemological objectivity
in financial reporting through an analysis of issues raised by the US Securities Exchange Commission
(SEC) with respect to accounting for internet activities and the concomitant manner in which the US
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approached these issues.
Findings – An analysis of communications between the SEC and the FASB pertaining to accounting
for internet activities reveals that, while these bodies seek to resolve issues in a manner that is neutral
and objective, they often employ subjective reasoning in pursuing their regulatory purpose, thus
raising questions about the extent of their concern with neutral representations of economic reality.
Originality/value – The paper adds to the criticisms of efforts which claimto be neutral representations
of economic reality.

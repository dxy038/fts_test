We develop an analytical map for a single phase bidirectional boost converter. This map enables the analysis of the dynamics of the converter faster and without any convergence problems. For the closed-loop converter, we show how instabilities can occur on the slow and fast scales. Conventional analyses based on averaged models can not predict the fast-scale instability because such models do not account for the switching frequency ripple

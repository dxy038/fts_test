Objective (s): Given that a significant proportion of traffic accidents deaths in Tehran is related to the pedestrians, this study was conducted to determine high and low risk points leading to pedestrians-related injury in the central area of Tehran, 2014-2015.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The study population consisted of all pedestrian-related traffic accidents that had occurred during April 2014-March 2015 in the district 6 of Tehran. We used police and municipal databases. Zoning maps were used to show distribution of traffic crashes events. Moran index and Getis-Ord G were used for determining the distribution pattern of pedestrian-related traffic accidents and the analysis of hot spots (high-risk areas), respectively.
Results: In all 514 events were reviewed. The most and least frequent crashes had occurred in May (62 cases) and April (22), respectively. 370 (71.9%) events had happened in the main streets followed by secondary streets (133 events, 25.2%) and in highways (11 events, 2.1%). Although Vali Asr street had most frequent events (67 cases), but most frequent rate of crashes had occurred in the Azadi street between Navab street and Enghelab square (18.11 events in each Km). Moran statistic shows that the distribution of events had cluster pattern (P  < 0.001). Getis-Ord General G also indicated that distribution of hot and cold spots of events were statistically significant (P = 0.002).
Conclusion: The results indicated that southern areas of district 6 in Tehran, specifically the leisure and business centers, commercial centers, bus terminals, were the most dangerous areas for pedestrian-related traffic accidents. Considering the results of this study in addition to identifying other environmental and social factors affecting pedestrian-related traffic accidents can help to reduce the rate of pedestrian deaths.

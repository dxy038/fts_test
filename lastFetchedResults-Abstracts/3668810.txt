The Remote Sensing Laboratory of the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya carried out a one-year measuring campaign in the village of Sallent, northeastern Spain, using a polarimetric ground-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor. The objective was to study the subsidence phenomenon induced by the salt mining activity conducted in this area up to the middle of the last century. Zero-Baseline polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data were gathered at X-band in nine different days, from June 2006 to March 2007. In this letter, the problem of extracting subsidence information from fully PolSAR acquisitions for the retrieval of high-quality deformation maps is addressed. After compensating for the atmospheric artifacts caused by troposphere changes, the linear component of the deformation process is estimated separately for each polarization channel with the Coherent Pixels Technique (CPT). Afterward, a novel polarimetric approach mixing the differential-phase information of each polarization channel is proposed. The results obtained in the two cases are quantitatively compared, and the advantages provided by the polarimetric acquisitions are finally stressed.

The main objective of this paper is to examine the issue of sanctions on Iran by the West and Iran#039;s negative action to these sanctions. Since 2002 onwards, the problem between Iran and the West that has become a major challenge. The argument of this article is that Westerns are trying to convince Iran with their various sanctions in line with its strategic objectives. But, Iran has not shown positive action against the Sanctions, so Iran has turned into a negative action. In fact, Western countries, especially America and Europe in dealing with Iran has focused on Western values, such as Considering Israel#039;s security, containing Iran and ignoring Iran#039;s nuclear rights. Against, Iran says these acts and increased sanctions are a step in direction of political instability and reduce their national security coefficient. So the authors tried to reviews this topic from the perspective of Constructivism.

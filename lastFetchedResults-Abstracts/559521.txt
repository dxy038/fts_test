Land suitability evaluation is the fitness of a given tract of land based on its
potential for a defined use. The objective of this study were to define the
qualitative, quantitative and economical land suitability evaluation of Zarrinshahr
and Mobarakeh located at the west of Isfahan province and assessment the
environmental impacts of the questioned land utilization types. The economical
evaluation included collecting the economical data, comparison of inputs and
outputs and analysis of gross income. Potential yield was calculated using the
method proposed by F.A.O. The result of potential yield analysis showed that the
potential yields were determined 9.01 and 11.01 t/ha for wheat and rice production,
respectively. The quantitative land evaluation and their classes were defined
according to incorporating observed yield and marginal yield with the qualitative
evaluation results. The predicted yield varied from 1.3 to 6.7 and from 0.7 to 4.6
t/ha for wheat and rice, respectively. High correlation between the observed yield
and predicted yield indicated the appropriate selection of the factors and evaluation
approach. Based on the quantitative evaluation, most of the land unitâ€™s wheat was
identified that had more suitability in the study area. The cultivation of rice is not
recommended in the study area, because of negative environmental impact
including soil physical destruction, non-efficient water consuming, arising of
ground water surface and increasing soil salinity.

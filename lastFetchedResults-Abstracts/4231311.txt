In order to solve stress problems, researchers have studied healing, especially the music therapy. It is mentioned that objective evaluation of the music therapy is an important assignment, and some researchers have tried objective measurement based on physiological change. In this paper, the purpose is extraction of features that may be influenced by the music. We pay attention to EEG (electroencephalogram) as an objective and absolute scale. This paper proposes a method that extracts features of the EEG by the CDA (canonical discriminant analysis). From the result of the experiment, it is suggested that the CDA extracts the features influenced by the individual and the music type

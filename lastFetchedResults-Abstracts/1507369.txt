The use of 2-chloro-1-methylquinolinium tetrafluoroborate, an ultraviolet tagging reagent, for the ion-pair, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of mesna in human plasma is reported. In order to achieve this objective optimization of the two-step procedure, derivatization and separation of mesna S-quinolinium derivative from that of other thiols present in plasma and internal standard, was investigated. The derivatization was optimized in terms of pH, reagent excess and time of the reaction, and the mobile phase in terms of ion-pairing reagent concentration, pH, organic modifier content and temperature. Baseline separation was achieved on an analytical Waters Nova-Pak C18 (150×3.9 mm, 5 μm) column with a mobile phase consisting of pH 2.3 0.05 M trichloroacetic acid–acetonitrile (89:11, v/v) pumped at 1.2 ml/min. The peak height ratios of the mesna derivative to that of the internal standard (thiomalic acid) varied linearly with the concentration of the analyte added to normal plasma with a correlation coefficient of 0.9997. The lower limits of detection and quantitation were 40 pmol/ml (0.8 pmol on-column) and 160 pmol/ml (3.2 pmol on-column), respectively. The intra-run imprecision and inaccuracy were from 1.3 to 2.4 and from 1.3 to 2.0,%, respectively.

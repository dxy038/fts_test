Introduction: Diabetes mellitus affects the metabolism of components of extra cellular matrix such as Glycosaminoglycans. Although the changes of Glycosaminoglycans have been attended but investigation of the changes of Glycosaminoglycans in the brain tissue of diabetic rat is still in early stages. Objective: Investigation of changes of Glycosaminoglycans in brain of diabetic rats.
Materials and Methods: Based on an experimental study, 20 male Rats (Wistar, weight 200-250 gr) were randomly divided to two groups; experimental (diabetic, N=10) and non-experimental (non-diabetic, N=10). A single dose of Alloxan (120ml/ km) was injected to the experimental group. Three months after injection, the slides were prepared from the brain of the rats and studied after stained by Hematoxylin- Eosin and Schmorl's method and Critical Electrolyte Concentration (CEC 1-4).
Results: CEC staining showed that Heparin sulfate was the only Glycosaminoglycans which have been decreased in the brain tissue of the experimental group and any deposits in neurons, particularly Lipofuscin pigments were not expressed in used of Schmorl's method.
Conclusion: According to the important roles of Heparin sulfate in normal functions of the nervous system and its role in repairing of the nervous tissue's injury, decrease of Heparin Sulfate, a kind of Glycosaminoglycans, could induce nervous injury and disorder in brain functions.

A new model for the spectral samples obtained in the multiband excitation speech coder (MBE) is introduced. Objective and subjective tests show that it compares favorably with the classical linear prediction (LP) model, specially for high pitched speakers. Strategies for efficiently quantizing the model parameters, suitable for low bit rate implementations of the MBE coder, are also addressed

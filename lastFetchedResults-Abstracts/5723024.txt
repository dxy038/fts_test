This paper presents a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) method to realize optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) considering voltage stability improvement. The ORPD problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained multi- objective optimization problem, the sub-objective is to minimal the real power losses, minimal control number and maximal voltage stability margin. The mutation is incorporated into the PSO and a new control strategy using in the MPSO algorithm to prevent particles trapped into local minimal. Cases study with the IEEE30 system and a practical system tested the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed method.

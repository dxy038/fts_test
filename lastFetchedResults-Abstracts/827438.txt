In the cask impact limiter design, the functions of steel case should be evaluated for the protection of the filler materials and the impact energy absorption by the buckling deformation in both the fire and impact accidents. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the beneficial influence of the intermittent weldment of the cask impact limiter case on the cask impact behavior. This paper describes the test results for the joint strength evaluation of intermittent weldment and the cask impact analysis considering the weldment rupture of the impact limiter case. The weldment rupture of the impact limiter case causes to lose their constraining effect for the wood blocks, which are filled into the metal incasement between the case and the gussets. The weldment rupture of the impact limiter case reduces the impact force which acts on the impact target significantly in vertical and horizontal drop impacts. Therefore the beneficial effect of weldment rupture should be considered in the impact limiter design and the cask impact analysis.

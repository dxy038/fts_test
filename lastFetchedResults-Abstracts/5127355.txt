The objective of this study is to develop a 3D ankle-foot model containing toe expression for designing an AFO (ankle-foot orthosis) with a training function. Two experiments were conducted to (1) show the influence of toes by comparing walking with and without an AFO, and (2) clarify the functions of toes during walking by correlating the activity of the major muscles controlling the ankle and the toes to the sole pressure data during walking. By analyzing the results of these two experiments, the necessary components and conditions of a detailed 3D foot-ankle model for developing an AFO with a training effect were clarified. A model was built and examined with empirical facts, and data were collected from the AFO simulation.

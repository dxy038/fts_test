We consider the combined control of mobile stationsÂ´ transmitter power and bit rate in a CDMA microcellular environment. The objective is maximizing the number of QoS-satisfied mobile users in conjunction with minimizing network infrastructure cost. We first review the challenges associated with microcells and user mobility in a Manhattan-like street grid. Next, we discuss the additional aid offered by the combined scheme over the power-only method in utilizing the scarce radio resources efficiently. We demonstrate through link-level and system-level simulations the significant enhancements over the established power-only control scheme. Both coverage and spectrum efficiencies are improved for voice/data services having diverse QoS requirements.

There are many people suffering from hearing impairments. The high cost of assistive listening devices leaves out of reach for many people a technological solution. The main goal of this work is to present a noise reduction algorithm implemented in a low cost hearing aid device, which through digital signal processing techniques can get the basic functionality of a high-end assistive listening device. Objective experiments were performed to analyze the performance of the system.

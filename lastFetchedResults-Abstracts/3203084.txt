For the stacker-reclaimer job optimization problem of sinter material plant in iron and steel enterprises, this paper establishes a multi-objective optimization model for stacker-reclaimer job according to the production planning and locations of stacker-reclaimers and stockpiles, and then proposes an optimization method based on analytic hierachy process(AHP) and linear programming(LP), so as to achieve the goals of the shortest walking path and the maximum utilization of the stacker-reclaimer. Firstly, using AHP method to determine the weights of the various targets in order to change multi-objective optimization problem into single-objective optimization problem; Secondly, using LP method to solve the optimization model. This method has been applied to a stacker-reclaimer job control system in a 360m<sup>2</sup> sintering material plant of an iron and steel enterprise, and the practical result shows that this method can effectively improve the stacker-reclaimerÂ´s job efficiency, reduce the operation waste and decrease the maintenance costs of stacker-reclaimer.

The problem of optimizing the reliability of complex systems has been modeled as a fuzzy multi-objective optimization problem. Three different kinds of optimization problems: reliability optimization of a complex system with constraints on cost and weight; optimal redundancy allocation in a multistage mixed system with constraints on cost and weight; and optimal reliability allocation in a multistage mixed system with constraints on cost, weight, and volume have been solved. Four numerical examples have been solved to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present methodology. The influence of various kinds of aggregators is also studied. The inefficiency of the noncompensatory min operator has been demonstrated. One of the well-known global optimization meta-heuristics, the threshold accepting, has been invoked to take care of the optimization part of the model. A software has been developed to implement the above model. The results obtained are encouraging

Background&Objective: Giardiasis is one of the most prevalent human intestinal parasites, especially among children aged between 2 to 12 years old.
In this study, the effects of giardiasis on serological levels of zinc and Iron elements were determined.
Materials&Methods: A total of 100 children aged under 12 years who were admitted to the Pediatric departments of hospitals affiliated to Mazandaran University with gastrointestinal complain, and diagnosed as having giardiasis by stool examination (direct and formalin -ether technique and trichrome stain) in the parasitology department, were enrolled as the case group. The control group consisted of 100 age - matched healthy children. A questionaire including age, physical growth status and clinical symptoms was completed. Serological levels of Zinc and Iron were measured by atomic absorption spectophotometer in all samples in Shilat of Mazandaran.
Results: In this study, serum Iron levels were 67 ± 25 µg/dL and 77± 23 µg/dL and Zinc levels were 64 ± 20 µg/dL and 96± 23 µg/dL in case and control group, respectively.
Statistical analysis showed significant differences between the serological levels of these elements, which was much higher in serum Iron level (P<0.05).
Conclusion: These results revealed those serological levels of Zinc and Iron decreased during giardiasis due to malabsorption.

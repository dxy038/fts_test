The objective of EMPRESS (expert mission planning and replanning scheduling system) is to support the planning and scheduling required to prepare science and application payloads for flight aboard the US Space Shuttle. EMPRESS was designed and implemented in Zetalisp on a 3600 series Symbolics LISP machine. Initially, EMPRESS was built as a concept demonstration system. The system has since been modified and expanded to ensure that the data have integrity. Issues underlying the design and development of the EMPRESS-I interface, results from a system usability assessment, and consequent modifications are described

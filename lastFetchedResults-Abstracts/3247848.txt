Quality assessment is not only essential on its own for testing, optimizing, benchmarking, monitoring and inspecting related systems and services, but also plays an essential role in the design of virtually all visual signal processing and communication algorithms, as well as various related decision making processes. In the paper, we provide an overview of the quality assessment approaches for traditional visual signals, as well as the newly emerged ones, which covers the subjective quality evaluation and objective quality metrics of scalable and mobile videos, high dynamic range (HDR) images, image segmentation results, 3D images/videos, and retargeted images. Also the challenges for designing effective quality metrics and corresponding applications are discussed.

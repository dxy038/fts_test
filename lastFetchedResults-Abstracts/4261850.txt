A task assigner for a flexible assembly cell (FAC) incorporating multiple robots and a transport system is presented. The FAC can assembly a wide range of products in small batches. Parts are fed on pallets and assembled on fixtures, which can route through the cell. The FAC has a limited buffer capacity. The task assigner determines a schedule for each batch, with minimum assembly time as the main objective. Task assignment is done for a limited time horizon, using a goal-directed search. The time horizon is determined by the limited buffer capacity of the FAC. While assigning tasks to resources in the cell, the task assigner determines an appropriate assembly sequence and allocates tools, such as grippers, to workstations in the cell

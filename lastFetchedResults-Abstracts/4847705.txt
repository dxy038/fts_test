The main contribution of this paper is a new sliding mode design methodology for nonlinear systems, which utilizes the Parallel Distributed Compensation based multi-objective LMI control design for Takagi-Sugeno type polytopic representations of qLPV models. It is partially extension and combination of the classical optimal manifold design for linear (or linearized) system and sector sliding mode control. This new approach enables a systematic design and decomposition of optimal sliding sector by the High Order Singular Value Decomposition based canonical description of a wide class of nonlinear systems. This brings the advantages of the LMI based control design to the field of sliding mode control. The effectiveness of the methodology is validated by simulation results.

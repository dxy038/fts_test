The objective of this study was to develop a scaffold derived from cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) that could be used as a growth factor delivery system to promote chondrogenesis of stem cells. Dehydrothermal crosslinked scaffolds were fabricated using a slurry of homogenized porcine articular cartilage, which was then seeded with human infrapatellar-fat-pad-derived stem cells (FPSCs). It was found that these ECM-derived scaffolds promoted superior chondrogenesis of FPSCs when the constructs were additionally stimulated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β3. Cell-mediated contraction of the scaffold was observed, which could be limited by the additional use of 1-ethyl-3-3dimethyl aminopropyl carbodiimide (EDAC) crosslinking without suppressing cartilage-specific matrix accumulation within the construct. To further validate the utility of the ECM-derived scaffold, we next compared its chondro-permissive properties to a biomimetic collagen–hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffold optimized for cartilage tissue engineering (TE) applications. The cartilage-ECM-derived scaffold supported at least comparable chondrogenesis to the collagen–HA scaffold, underwent less contraction and retained a greater proportion of synthesized sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Having developed a promising scaffold for TE, with superior chondrogenesis observed in the presence of exogenously supplied TGF-β3, the final phase of the study explored whether this scaffold could be used as a TGF-β3 delivery system to promote chondrogenesis of FPSCs. It was found that the majority of TGF-β3 that was loaded onto the scaffold was released in a controlled manner over the first 10 days of culture, with comparable long-term chondrogenesis observed in these TGF-β3-loaded constructs compared to scaffolds where the TGF-β3 was continuously added to the media. The results of this study support the use of cartilage-ECM-derived scaffolds as a growth factor delivery system for use in articular cartilage regeneration.

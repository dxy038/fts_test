This paper describes about the solar photovoltaic cell and its different modelling phenomena. In solar cell modelling generally curve fitting is adopted to calculate or extract the parameter. However for better calculation of error it is not recommended to adopt the curve fitting. the objective behind this paper is to find a suitable optimization technique so that it can be applied to all other models for curve fittings. The reference parameter for evaluating the performance of the grid is taken from the data sheet provided by the manufacturer. two distinct point like zero current voltage point, maximum current voltage point has been chosen for evaluating the best performance. The simulation is performed with a commercially available multicrystalline solar PV cell for simplicity purpose and then it is compared with the reference PV characteristic to check the compatibility of the system. The paper has been organised with three parts, like the 1st part contain some basic part of solar cell modelling and followed by characteristics and model verification. Finally the parameters are extracted from the curve.

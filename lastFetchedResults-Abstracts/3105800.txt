The development of intelligent resource management algorithms has been recently identified as a key technology for exploiting potential system diversity and improving power-spectral efficiency in wireless communication systems, as well as high-performance physical-layer techniques to provide high throughput, efficient resource use, and aggressive multiple access. In this paper, we propose an adaptive subcarrier allocation algorithm for uplink in multi-cell point of view using subcarrier sharing. The objective of this paper is to: 1) exploit the inherent system diversities in the frequency, space, and user domains; 2) minimize the overall transmit power; and 3) improve the fairness among users in power aspect. Numerical results shows that tremendous power gain and improvement of the fairness among users is achieved, compared with inherent system.

The main objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of coupling an electrochemical process with a biological treatment for the degradation of sulfamethazine, a biorecalcitrant antibiotic. The electrochemical behavior of sulfamethazine was examined by cyclic voltammetry, showing an electroactivity in oxidation. The pre-treatment was carried out using an electrochemical flow cell involving a graphite felt electrode of high specific area. After a single pass through the cell, the analysis of the electrolyzed solution showed a promising trend in view of the proposed combined process, namely a high degradation of the target compound (more than 90%) while the mineralization level remained low (it did not exceed 20%). The optimization of the operating conditions, viz. flow rate and applied potential, allowed to improve the biodegradability of sulfamethazine solutions. Indeed, under optimal conditions, the biodegradability based on the BOD5 on COD ratio measurement was improved from 0.08 to 0.58, namely above the threshold limit value (0.4).

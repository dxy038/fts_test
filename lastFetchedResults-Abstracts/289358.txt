This case report concerns a 21-year-old man developing left leg paresis. Evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intramedullary tumor in the conus region. He was planned for surgery but preoperative investigation indicated he had tuberculosis and the tumor was presumed to be a tuberculoma. Antituberculous therapy was started and the patient improved neurologically. The patient was followed clinically and with consecutive MRI during 2 years and the last MRI showed that the lesion had disappeared completely.
Intramedullary tuberculomas are rare but important differential diagnosis in patients with spinal cord mass lesions. The role of medical and surgical treatment of intramedullary tuberculomas is discussed.

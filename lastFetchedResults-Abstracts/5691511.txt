In this paper, a computer-aided method for converting existing continuous control systems into digital control systems with computational delay is presented. The objective of this paper is to obtain the pulse-transfer function of the digital controller so that the performance of the digital control system is as close to the existing system as possible. This is done by matching the frequency response of the digital control system to that of the existing continuous model with a minimum weighted mean-square error. A formula for computing the parameters of the digital controller is obtained as a result. The design method is illustrated with an example.

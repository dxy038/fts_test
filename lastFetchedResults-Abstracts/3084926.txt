The objective of this research is to optimize and characterize the respiratory gated reconstruction protocol in liver FDG PET scans with non-uniform respiration using Monte-Carlo simulations. Assuming externally-tracked motion information and NCAT respiratory motion model, we compare the standard time gating and optimized amplitude gating methods. Two spherically shaped liver lesions with FWHM of 1 cm and 2 cm are used to evaluate the accuracy of each method in determining the size and the position of the lesions with GE Discovery LS scanner.

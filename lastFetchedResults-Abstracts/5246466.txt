The success of an optimal mixed sensitivity robust control design depends, in a large part, on the selection of appropriate weights used in the optimization process. In this paper, we address the problem of selecting appropriate weights in a mixed S/T sensitivity design where improvement of the steady state sinusoidal performance is the design objective. A simple guideline is provided which allows the designer to choose the parameters of the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity weights in an iterative manner. Application of the results in minimizing the tracking errors of a nano-positioning system is demonstrated.

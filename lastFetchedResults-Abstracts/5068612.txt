Grid-converters in applications such as active rectifiers, active filters, uninterruptible power supplies, and distributed generation systems need an optimal control of the active and reactive powers interchanged with the grid. It reduces considerably the total harmonic distortion of grid currents. Anyway, though grid converters have optimal controllers, with a perfect tuning of all constants, the final response can be seriously compromised if the acquired analog signals are very noisy. This situation is very frequently, especially in medium and high power grid converters. This work proposes different algorithms, as digital filters and Kalman filters, which have as objective reduce the noise to the input of converter controllers. In this way, the quality of the current grids improves considerably.

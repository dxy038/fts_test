Wear property of material plays a key role in the service time of workpiece. A major objective in the development of new wheel materials is to improve the wear performance. The wear property of B and B+ grade cast steel materials was reported. The results showed that B+ grade cast steel material exhibited better wear property than the B grade material. Carbon content related to the hardness match was the principal factor affecting the wear properties.

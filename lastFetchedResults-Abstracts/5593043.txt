The design of electrical machines involves several fields of physics, such as electromagnetism, thermics, mechanics but also acoustics. This paper describes the analytical multiphysics models of a computer-aided design (CAD) software which is applied to inverter-fed traction induction machines. The electromagnetic model computes rotor and stator currents, the induction machine traction characteristics, and the radial airgap flux density. The mechanical and acoustic model computes the motor audible magnetic noise level due to Maxwell forces. The thermal model based on 3D nodal network, computes the transient temperature of different parts of the motor. These fast models make it possible to couple the software with some optimization tools. Finally, some simulations are presented on a self-ventilated closed motor, and an example of multi-objective optimization is exposed.

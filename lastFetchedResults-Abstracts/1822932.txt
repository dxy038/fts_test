Objective
revious studies have shown that gingipains, trypsin-like proteases produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis, up-regulate human β defensin-2 (HBD-2) mRNA expression through protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) in gingival epithelial cells. This study aimed at investigating salivary HBD-2 levels and crevicular PAR2 mRNA expression in human chronic periodontitis and evaluating whether periodontal treatment affected this process.
s
ry and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were collected from periodontally healthy (control) and chronic periodontitis patients at baseline and 50 days after non-surgical periodontal treatment. Salivary HBD-2, and GCF TNF-α levels were analysed by ELISA, and PAR2 mRNA at the GCF was evaluated by RT-PCR.
s
givalis was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) more prevalent in patients with chronic periodontitis when compared to controls. This prevalence decreased after periodontal therapy (p &lt; 0.0001). The control group showed statistically significant lower levels of HBD-2, TNF-α, and PAR2 expression when compared to the chronic periodontitis group. In addition, periodontal treatment significantly reduced PAR2 expression and HBD-2 levels in chronic periodontitis patients (p &lt; 0.001).
sions
sults suggest that salivary HBD-2 levels and PAR2 mRNA expression from GCF are higher in subjects with chronic periodontitis than in healthy subjects, and that periodontal treatment decreases both HBD-2 levels and PAR2 expression.

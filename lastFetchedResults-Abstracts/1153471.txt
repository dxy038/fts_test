Ceramic composite materials possess both low toughness and low impact resistance. However, the incorporation of ceramic whiskers into the microstructure of ceramic matrix has been shown to produce a ceramic composite with improved toughness and greater strength. This paper studies both experimentally and theoretically the dynamic behavior of SiCw/Al2O3 ceramic composites under low velocity impact loading. The main objective of this paper is to determine the effects of dynamic flexural stresses on impact resistance, failure modes, and toughening mechanisms of whisker-reinforced composites. To accomplish this objective, several samples of this composite material using different SiC whisker volume fractions were designed and fabricated, and then tested at low-velocity impact loading. A theoretical solution to the transverse impact problem of whisker-reinforced ceramic composite plates by striking these plates with solid projectiles, at low impact velocity was formulated, and its predictions are compared to impact test results. In addition, correlations between impact test results and these compositesâ€™ material properties are also included in this study.

This paper presents a forensic research about evaluating the impact of architectural and physical factors on the performance of human resources in project oriented organizations. The objective is to study how design and planning of working areas can influence the human resources performance. In order to achieve this objective, two stages are presented: analytical and statistical. In the analytical stage (Sections I, II, II), human resources performance, related literature and schemes, and the criteria of office work are briefly studied. In the statistical approach, surveys are carried out and the resulting outcomes are discussed using five graphical representations. This systematic approach would result in a rationally persuasive and theoretically justifiable guideline that can practically be used to improve the efficiency of human resources performance and management.

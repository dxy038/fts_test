In general, the non-sharp distillation columns sequence optimization problem is formulated as a MINLP with a non-linear objective function. This study is an attempt to provide a two- phase approach which categorizes the variables into two classes in order to simplification of the problem. A set of variables are managed and optimized by Genetic Algorithm, the other set of the remaining variables can be solved as a LP problem for estimated values of the first set. The study formulates some mathematical relationships between the first set of variables from the non-linear constraints so that by optimizing some of them, others are obtained with the assistance of the relationships. The method has the ability to obtain the best structure from the overall superstructure directly in short time without using any starting points for ternary separation. Three published examples were used to validate the proposed method.

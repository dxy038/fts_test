Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of working memory (WM) training on&nbsp;WM capacity and performance of novice karate practitioners (karateka).
Methods: Research method is quasi-experimental with a pretest posttest control group design.&nbsp;A total of 24 karate practitioners were selected among Alborz (Alborz Province, iran) novice&nbsp;karateka by convenience sampling method and were randomly assigned into control and&nbsp;experimental groups. They were asked to complete WM capacity test and performance test.&nbsp;Then, the experimental group underwent a 25 session WM training course. Finally, both group&nbsp;completed the tests again. Instruments of gathering data included digit and spatial WM test,&nbsp;performance test, and WM training software. We used 1-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)&nbsp;for data analysis.
Results: Our findings showed that WM training resulted in increase in WM capacity (F=61.87,&nbsp;P&le; 0.01) and performance (F=15.5, P&le;0.01) of the intervention group.
Conclusion: We suggest that coaches ask athletes to use WM training as a complement to&nbsp;physical exercises.

The percentage of malignant transformation of laryngeal dysplastic lesions is difficult to estimate. There is a need for new histological markers which could enable more objective assessment of the premalignant stages of the larynx and help in estimation of the potential of future neoplastic progression. We performed a retrospective study to determine whether immunohistochemical staining for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), tumour suppressor gene protein p53 and anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 may be prognostic factors in laryngeal epithelial lesions. Staining was performed on 57 paraffin-embedded biopsies from patients with clinically detected precancerous stages of the larynx. Histopathologic examination revealed normal epithelium in six cases, mild dysplasia in 20 cases, moderate dysplasia in 18 cases, severe dysplasia in seven cases, CA in situ in four cases, papilloma in one case and CA invasivum in one case. The p53 count in mild and moderate dysplasia was 26.8 and 38.6%, respectively. This difference was statistically significant. There was significant correlation between PCNA and p53 scores. There was also a relationship between the scores of these markers and bcl-2 expression. In ten out of 45 cases of dysplastic lesions the invasive cancer developed in 4 years of follow-up. The correlation between PCNA score and malignant progression of the dysplastic lesions was on the statistical borderline. There was significant relationship between malignant transformation and age of the patients.

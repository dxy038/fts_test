mproving production efficiency is the main objective of
government action to avoid efficiency losses and to increase
the income of farmers. The aim of this study was to analyze
performance levels of farms in the irrigated perimeter of Tadla
in Morocco, according to the source of irrigation water. Thus,
technical, allocative and economic efficiency were analyzed
for farms in this area. To estimate the efficiency indices, the
approach adopted is based on Data Envelopment Analysis
method. Sixty samples of farms were chosen according to the
mode of access to irrigation water. The results showed significant
variability in technical, allocative and economic efficiency between
the observed farms. The source of irrigation water is an
important determinant of farm performance in the Tadla region.
Thus, the average of economic efficiency varies between 45%
and 83% according to the source of irrigation water. In terms
of water valuation, farms that use only groundwater achieve a
better value of irrigation water (2.19 MAD1 /m3) in comparison
with those that combine between surface and groundwater and
those which are limited to the use of surface water.

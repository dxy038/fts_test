Background & Aims of the Study: The wastewater created as a result of stone cutting industries enters some pools for re-consumption so that its suspended solids settle by gravity. By taking to account the high volume of water and sludge, treatment of wastewater and removal of sludge cause many problems for stone cutting units. The objective of this study  was  to  determine  the  quality  of  wastewater  and  to  investigate  the  effects  of coagulants on suspended solids removal efficiency from wastewater of some stone cutting industries (Qom, Iran).

Materials  &  Methods:  In  this  experimental  study,  the  effects  of  different  doses  of coagulants including Alum, poly aluminum chloride, Polymer, Ferric chloride (Fecl3) and Lime on Turbidity, “total suspended solids” (TSS) and “total solids”  (TS) removal were investigated by Jar Test. Removal efficiency of different coagulates was estimated.

Results: The results indicated that lime in dose 100 PPM is the best coagulant for turbidity removal and  the  highest efficiency  for  TS  removal is  related to  using Alum in  dose 100 PPM.

Conclusions:  Considering  the  findings  of  this  study,  it  can  be  concluded  that  using coagulants causes reduction in  settling time and speeds up the return of water to the consumption  cycle  of  stone  cutting  factories,  and  also   increases   turbidity  removal efficiency.

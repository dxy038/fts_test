The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is the architecture merging the Internet and mobile worlds. The IMS enables new business models and allows third-party developers to make their applications available to all IMS users. This paper introduces an IMS testbed called ImsInnovation, which was launched in Summer 2008. The objective of the testbed project is to ease the development of new third-party applications for the IMS. As part of this project we provide Web developers with Java APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that exploit the functionality of the IMS both for the Java Mobile Edition (ME) and the Java Enterprise Edition (EE). The provided APIs are based on existing SIP and IMS Java Specification Requests defined by the Java Community Process (JCP). In this paper we also discuss our experiences from the testbed project and describe a couple of applications deployed in the testbed.

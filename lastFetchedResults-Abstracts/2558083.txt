Background: Call center sector in India is a relatively new and fast growing industry driving
employment and growth in modern India today. Most international call centers in National
Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi operate at odd work hours corresponding to a time suitable for
their international customers. The sleep quality of call handlers employed in these call centers
is in jeopardy owing to their altered sleep schedule.
Objective: To assess the sleep quality and determine its independent predictors among call
handlers employed in international call centers in NCR of Delhi.
Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted on 375 call handlers
aged 18â€“39 years employed in international call centers in NCR of Delhi. Sleep quality was
assessed using Athens Insomnia scale along with a pre-tested, structured questionnaire.
Results: The mean age of respondents was 24.6 (SD 2.4) years. 78% of participants were
male. 83.5% of respondents were unmarried. 44.3% of call handlers were cigarette smokers.
Physical ailments were reported by 37% call handlers. 77.6% of call handlers had some
suspicion of insomnia or suspected insomnia; the rest had no sleep problem. Smoking, poor
social support, heavy workload, lack of relaxation facility at office, and prolonged travel time
to office were independent predictors of sleep quality (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Call handlers have to compromise upon their sleep owing to the contemporary
work settings in call centers. Safeguarding their health becomes an occupational health challenge
to public health specialists.

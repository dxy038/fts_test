Fatigue of human driver (operator) is a major concern as it is a significant cause of road accidents. This is not only applicable in transport industry, but also in aviation, heavy engineering industries etc. In the present work we have applied three objective methods for assessment of fatigue in human operator. These methods are based on Auditory Vigilance test (AVT) and Visual Response Test (VRT), facial image based measurement of fatigue, and Electroencephalographic (EEG) signal analysis. The present paper concludes that the human fatigue should be assessed by Meta-Analysis as it is a complex psycho-physiological phenomenon.

As a specific systematic assessment, many effect factors of coal mine safety evaluation cannot be directly quantified because of their complexities and uncertainties. Generally, a large number of experts are needed for making auxiliary decisions. To a great extent, the dependability of the evaluation results heavily depends on the reliability of the expert decisions. The present paper, based on the similarity and difference of expert decisions, established an expert reliability model. The expert reliability obtained from this model is a kind of objective and dynamic weight which can properly overcome the pitfalls of the static weighting in the traditional method.

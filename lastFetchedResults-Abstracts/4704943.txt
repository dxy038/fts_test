EmailÂ´s text is the main body of an Email. Its content is reflected by semantic body formed by a large number of semantic elements. This paper takes the advantage of HowNet in analysis of semantic element and analyzes semantic bodies in email text, then proposes the method of constructing semantic body and the calculation ways of similarity between semantic bodies based on sentence similarity. At last, we make a study of its application in spam filtering based on the method proposed. The result of experiment shows that this method is more objective in judging email content, when it is compared with the method of traditional email filtering in semantic unit. The proposed method reflects much better in recall rate of discernment of email for spams whose meaning is expressed unclearly.

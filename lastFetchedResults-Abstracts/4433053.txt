A robust sliding mode controller, suitable for the output voltage PWM control of voltage sourced, reversible boost-type rectifiers, presenting no steady-state errors, is described. This &#8220;just in time&#8221; switching controller samples the output voltage and two line input currents, to provide bidirectional power flow, near unity power factor operation, input currents with low harmonic content and fast dynamic response of the output voltage. Simulation results are presented and the performances compared with the behaviour of the conventional proportional integral (PI) output voltage control, aided by inner loops for the PWM current mode modulators. Comparison with other sliding mode alternatives, suggested elsewhere for these PWM rectifiers, shows that this proposal has faster dynamics and does not present steady state errors. The results confirm that the performance of the controller is independent of system parameters and load and far exceeds the performance of existing hysteretic current mode control systems

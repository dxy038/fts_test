Subjectivity of Students within Discourses of Family and School

This article is an attempt to understand the subjectivity of the social subjects (students) within two different effective discourses of the family and school. In this article, the presumption is that these two institutions are not bidirectional and differ in both goals and operations. This difference affects the lives of students and will influence their identity. To determine this purpose a qualitative interview is conducted with 30 students, 5 School authorities and 15 parents. Thus four factors of family and school discourses will be compared: studying, religion, political training and discipline. Each of these four factors finds itself in possession of the students and would try to form students’ subjectivity according to their ideals. Thus, sometimes at goals level and sometimes at operations level, there is a struggle going on. These struggles cause the students identity to be called in different positions. The most important difference between school and family is in their degree of independence from government’s discourses.

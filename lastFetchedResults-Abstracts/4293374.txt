Summary from only given, as follows. Manufacturers in electrical machinery are becoming highly interested in the reduction of noise and vibrations; this is due to the increasing awareness of the problem in some industrial and military applications : one of the main causes of noise production in electrical machines is resonance between the electromagnetic force and the stator. Two fundamental steps are of importance to deal with the acoustic noise reduction problem: -study and assessment of the vibration behaviour of the stator (resonant frequencies, mode shapes....); -analysis of the electromagnetic force distribution. The objective of this paper is to report an advancement of the above works using the finite element method. The results of all previous steps are mentionned and discussed below. For this work we have used a permanent magnet synchronous machine.

In this paper three port pulse width modulation (PWM) plus phase-shift control bi-directional dc-dc converter to interface renewable energy system is proposed. When we couple multiple sources and load, the voltage and current characteristics of sources and battery are different from load. So in order to interface source storage and load, power electronic converters have to be incorporated. Multiport converters make the system simpler and compact because it uses a single stage power conversion technique. Current stress and the losses while conduction have been reduced by the PWM control plus phase shift control. This multiport converter not only interface all sources and loads but also modifies electrical energy and manage power flow from source to load side. In addition to phase shift modulation technique, duty cycle control is also used. The operation principle and steady state analysis of the bidirectional converter are discussed. The simulation is carried out using MATLAB and results are presented.

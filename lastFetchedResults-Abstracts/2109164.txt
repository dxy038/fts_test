Background: The age-dependent worsening of lipid profiles increased the risk of cardiovascular disease in males. Eating fruits and vegetables is known to be beneficial on lipid profile.
Objectives: The objective of this research was to delineate whether drinking daily squeezed apple juice (AJ) modulates lipid profile and antioxidant enzymes in the animal model that gonadectomized.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 28 male rats were equally divided among the following 4 groups: group I (control), orchidectomized (ORX), ORX +AJ 10%, and ORX+ AJ 25%. After 60 days of drinking AJ, superoxide dismutase (SOD), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides in serum were evaluated. Data analyzed by SPSS-16 and computed using one way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparison test. P  <  0.05 was statistically significant.
Results: In the ORX group compared with the sham group serum SOD and ALP activities decreased (P  <  0.05), while serum cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL increased but HDL decreased in ORX groups (P  <  0.05). In contrast to the ORX group, drinking AJ decreased (P  <  0.05) concentration of LDL, TG and cholesterol in the serum. AJ also increased (P  <  0.05) serum HDL, SOD and ALP activities compared with the ORX group.
Conclusions: Drinking AJ prevented oxidative stress by elevating serum antioxidant enzymes.

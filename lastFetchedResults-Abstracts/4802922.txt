A major objective in power system control design is to prevent loss of synchronism when a sudden fault occurs. In this paper, the backstepping method is applied in order to design a nonlinear controller with the goal of improving both transient stability and voltage regulation of power system under a symmetrical three-phase short circuit fault. A comparison based on simulations is then performed between the here-proposed control scheme and both the classical control scheme AVR+PSS and the DFL controller based on state feedback linearization. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the practical robustness of this backstepping approach

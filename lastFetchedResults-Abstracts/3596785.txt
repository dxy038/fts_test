Describes and analyzes the Hybrid Array Ring Processor (HARP) architecture. The HARP is an application specific architecture built around a host processor, shared memory, and a set of memory mapped processing cells that are connected both into an open backplane and a bidirectional systolic ring. The architecture is analyzed through detailed simulation of a system implementation based on the Texas Instruments TMS34082 floating point RISC. A bus controller is designed that provides a tightly coupled DMA function that accelerates systolic communication and supports new interleaved transparent communications and reduced overhead message passing. The architecture is benchmarked with the matrix multiplication, FFT, QRD, and SVD algorithms

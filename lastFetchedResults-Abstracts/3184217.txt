Villamayor and connell have obtained the necessary and sufficient condition for group algebra to be regular while the regularity of semi group algebra has been discussed by Weiss glass. The main objective of this paper is to find the condition for semi group algebra to be periodic. This will be proved here each periodic inverse semi group is completely semi simple.

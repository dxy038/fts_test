This paper is concerned with L<sub>2</sub>-L&#8734; filtering for a class of neutral systems with interval time-varying delays. The objective is to design a full order filter such that the resulting filtering error system is asymptotically stable with a prescribed L<sub>2</sub>-L&#8734; performance satisfied. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, a delay-dependent and rate-dependent sufficient condition for the existence of filter is obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The corresponding filter design method is also proposed, while the explicit expression for the desired filter is given. A numerical example is finally included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

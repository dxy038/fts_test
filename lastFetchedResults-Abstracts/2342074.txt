The objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of improved drawability of AZ31 magnesium alloy sheet produced by equal channel angular rolling process at room temperature. Although with similar optical microstructure, the limiting drawing ratio of AZ31 magnesium alloy sheet is improved from 1.2 to 1.6 for the specimens before and after equal channel angular rolling, which is due to the changing crystal orientation that induces shear deformation through this process. The enhanced drawability in AZ31 magnesium alloy sheet provides the possibility for drawing at ambient temperature by controlling the crystal orientation in AZ31 magnesium alloy sheet.

Among all the existing objective measures, few are able to give a clearly specific indication on speech distortion or noise reduction although speech distortion and noise reduction are two key metrics to evaluate the enhanced speech quality. In this paper, two objective measurement tools are proposed to separately evaluate the capability of a speech enhancement filter in terms of recovering the clean speech and reducing the noise. Several common speech enhancement algorithms are evaluated by these objective measures as well as subjective listening test. Correlations between the results of objective measure and subjective measure clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed objective measures in evaluating the quality of enhanced speech signals.

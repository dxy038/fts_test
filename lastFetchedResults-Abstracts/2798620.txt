Lack of information or information missing is one of the main features when dealing with unconventional emergencies. In the decisions of unconventional emergencies, due to the impact of the decision-maker of the catastrophe, the destruction of the environment and infrastructure, the lack of critical information and decision-making related issues particularly significant. Study on information missing issues under unconventional emergencies background plays an important role in the research of unconventional emergency decision-making. By constructing an information flow model in the unconventional emergency decision process, this paper formalized the information in the decision process and then discussed its formation mechanism. At the same time, the paper analyzed the types of information deficiency from two perspectives of decision space and information space, and discussed the reasons and influences of information deficiency from the subjective and objective aspects.

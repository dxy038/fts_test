Low moisture mozzarella or pizza cheese is a prominent member of the pasta filata, or stretched curd cheese that originated in Italy. This cheese is produced by tow method, starter culture-enzyme and acid-enzyme method in world now. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of four types of organic acid (Lactic, Citric, Acetic and Phosphoric Acids) at three pH levels (5.3,5.6,5.8) on physico-chemical and organoleptic properties of mozzarella cheese and pizza. This method have a lower cost and time from current method (starter culture-enzyme method). Moisture content, hardness, meltability and organoleptic properties (taste and flavour of cheese and texture of pizza) were examined. The results indicated that the type of acid used for initial pH adjustment had a significant effect on moisture content, hardness, meltability and organoleptic properties of the cheese. The interaction effect between type of acid and pH only had a significant effect on taste and flavour of cheese but had no effect on texture of pizza.

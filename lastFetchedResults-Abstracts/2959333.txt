The objective of this study is the development of auto-navigation system which supports activities of the visually impaired without help of others. This system navigates the subject by using information about two sensors (gyroscope and acceleration sensor), DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System), maps and a traffic data base. In this paper, we assess the developed method which estimates the position and movement of the subject. From the experiments, the following characteristics become clear. (1) Using DGPS technique, positioning error was about 2 m. (2) Our estimation method by using a gyroscope and an acceleration sensor worked very well. Therefore, weÂ´ve concluded that our new method will be useful for the navigation system

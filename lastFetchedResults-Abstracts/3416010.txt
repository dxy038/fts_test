The increasing use of compression standards in broadcasting digital TV has raised the need for established criteria to measure perceived quality. Novel methods must take into account the specific artifacts introduced by digital compression techniques. This paper presents a methodology using circular backpropagation (CBP) neural networks for the objective quality assessment of motion picture expert group (MPEG) video streams. Objective features are continuously extracted from compressed video streams on a frame-by-frame basis; they feed the CBP network estimating the corresponding perceived quality. The resulting adaptive modeling of subjective perception supports a real-time system for monitoring displayed video quality. The overall system mimics perception but does not require an analytical model of the underlying physical phenomenon. The ability to process compressed video streams represents a crucial advantage over existing approaches, as avoiding the decoding process greatly enhances the systemÂ´s real-time performance. Experimental evidence confirmed the approach validity. The system was tested on real test videos; they included different contents ranging from fiction to sport. The neural model provided a satisfactory, continuous-time approximation for actual scoring curves, which was validated statistically in terms of confidence analysis. As expected, videos with slow-varying contents such as fiction featured the best performances.

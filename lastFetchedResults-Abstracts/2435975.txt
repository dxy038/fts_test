This paper investigates the effects of preventive-maintenance cost functions on the optimal preventive-maintenance policy for a leased product with Weibull life-time distribution. During the lease period, any product failures are rectified by minimal repairs and may incur a penalty to the lessor, if the time duration for performing a minimal repair exceeds a pre-specified time limit. To reduce repair costs and possible penalty, preventive-maintenance actions are scheduled in the lease contract. The objective of this paper is to derive the optimal preventive-maintenance schedule and maintenance degrees such that the expected total cost is minimized. Some structural properties of the optimal policy are obtained and an efficient algorithm is provided to search for the optimal policy. For the cases where the preventive maintenance cost is a constant or a linearly increasing function, the effects of the preventive-maintenance cost function on the optimal policy are investigated in detail both theoretically and numerically.

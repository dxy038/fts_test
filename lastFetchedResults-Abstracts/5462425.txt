This paper deals with the problem of H<sub>&#8734;</sub> guaranteed cost control for uncertain discrete-time switched systems with multiple time-varying delays. The objective is to design a stable H<sub>&#8734;</sub> guaranteed cost controller, which guarantees that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable with H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance and the cost function value is not more than a specified upper bound for all admissible uncertainties. By resorting to switched Lyapunov function, some delay-dependent sufficient conditions are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

A new flow shop scheduling problem (FSP) is studied, which is abstracted from the auto assemble workshop. The problem is characterized by multi-workstation operation and stopping line operation, and fluctuant processing time. So the problem is very complicated. Firstly, the math model of this scheduling problem is constructed, and then the Petri net model is constructed based on the math model. The scheduling results are obtained based on hybrid algorithm of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm (GASA) with minimizing the completion time as function objective. Lastly, testing and analyzing the performance of scheduling results through 2D animation simulation. The effectiveness of this method is tested on the real data from the assemble workshop in an auto factory in Beijing.

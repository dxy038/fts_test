In this study, we proposed a concept of virtual and real-field construction management systems (VR-Coms), which is integrated with virtual construction simulation, planning, scheduling, and performance management systems to evaluate productivity and safety in virtual simulated and real-field constructions. And, we built up a computational environment to develop the VR-Coms. The VR-Coms offer supporting modules for learning and discovering solutions with objective to manage construction at right speed with improved humanware and constructability. The configuration of VR-Coms is described. This paper also shows an application of agent theory to construction management.

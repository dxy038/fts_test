The paper presents a novel stabilization controller scheme system for a Wave Energy Converter (WEC). The proposed controller of WEC-Battery renewable energy system is based on Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization MOPSO technique. The optimization algorithm is implemented to control a novel low cost dynamic AC side filter/capacitor compensation scheme. The novel Dynamic Modulated Filter Capacitor Compensation scheme (MPFC) serves as an AC side voltage stabilization regulator and wave energy utilization enhancement. The objective is to extract available power from the wave energy system (WES) and transfer this power efficiency to the local isolated DC side electric load. The performance and dynamic characteristics of the controllers to any load nonlinear J, B parameters and load torque excursions is examined for PMDC Motor Drives. A tri-loop error driven dynamic controller is used to adjust the PWM switching of the two Dynamic filter compensator schemes. Multi Objective Optimization MOPSO technique is used to find the dynamic optimal control settings of the control signal to the PWM activation/ triggering block that dynamically minimizes the global dynamic error for all components, three SPWM, switched filters and motor.

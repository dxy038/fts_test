The approach currently being taken by ETSI (BSM) to standardisation for multicast PIM-SM protocols is described. This paper describes methods, architectures and adaptations to support IP-multicast services efficiently across IP-based broadband multimedia satellite systems. The final objective is to arrive at a consensus for a standard on this subject.

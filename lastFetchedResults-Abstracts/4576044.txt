A generalized approach to the constrained cubical embedding problem is described. The generalized solver is separated from the constraints so that application-specific constraints and objective criteria can be easily incorporated. The approach has been implemented in an open system package, called CUBIC, that incorporates a highly interactive graphical interface for new problem explorations. Experiments on a large set of design examples demonstrate that the generalized approach can produce results comparable or superior to specialized methods, in similar CPU time

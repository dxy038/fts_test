The future of any country lies in its ability to use its resources to build a technological resource base. One of these critical resources are the youth still in secondary schools who need encouragement and practical examples to help them learn about and want to choose careers in engineering and technology. Hence, the objective is to introduce engineering and technology to Arkansas middle, junior high, and high school students with the assistance of school teachers. A pilot teacher training workshop will take place during July of 1995. One teacher from fifteen middle, junior high, and high schools will attend the three week workshop at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. During the workshop the teachers will learn about engineering concepts and the role of engineers in society. Teachers will also be exposed to technology used in engineering companies which they may not see otherwise. A workbook of suggested engineering discussions and activities will be provided to the teachers who will work on several of these activities during the workshop. This paper describes the organization of the workshop activities and the process of how workshop materials will be developed. Instructions to access workshop activities and lab exercises is also included

This paper arises from an observation on the norms of using &#8216;teaching and learning&#8217; terms in the practice and discussions of education. We see this not a crisis, but as an invitation to re-think of giving equal heed to thinking and learning (TL) in the discussion on education. Thus the objective of this paper is to advocate the aspects of thinking and learning in education in the stead of only teaching and learning. It then discusses four environments to groom thinking individuals in Asia, which are unbinding the binding culture; parents´ setting reading and serene environment at home; teachers and lecturers relaxing authoritative attitude; and stimuli in classrooms and lecture theatres. It next proposes a framework of how these environments will flow to produce a thinker. Following, it also proposes four aspects that should take place in a course of an individual´s education, that are teaching, learning, thinking and living. The framework of the amount of each of these aspects be exposed to a learner is proposed in relation to the hierarchy of education of the learner.

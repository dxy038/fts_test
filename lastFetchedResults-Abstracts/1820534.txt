Objective
lore the role of P2X3 receptor in pain induced by experimental tooth movement.

prague-Dawley rats weighing 200â€“300 g were used. P2X3 receptor distribution in the caudal one-third portion of the trigeminal ganglion (TG) was studied by IHC. Next, the changes of P2X3 expression were detected by Western blotting 4 h, 1 d, 2 d, 3 d, 5 d, 7 d, 14 d after tooth movement. We then developed a behaviour pain model associated with directed mouth wiping. Finally, the effect of TNP-ATP on nociceptive-like behaviour was evaluated.
s
sults showed that P2X3 receptors were expressed mainly in small- and medium-sized cells and experimental tooth movement led to an increase in staining of mandibular P2X3 receptors. In addition, following experimental tooth movement, the expression of P2X3 receptor in TG was statistically significantly up-regulated from days 1 to 5, with a peak on day 3. It was also found that the time spent on directed mouth wiping was dramatically increased by experimental tooth movement from days 1 to 7. The rhythm change of P2X3 receptor expression in TG and the mouth wiping behaviour were in concert with the initial orthodontic pain responses. The directed mouth wiping behaviour was modulated in a force-dependent manner and could be attenuated by peripheral and systemic morphine. Furthermore, peripherally administered TNP-ATP could exert an analgesic effect on this pain model.
sion
results suggest that directed mouth wiping behaviour can be a reliable measurement of pain following experimental tooth movement in rats. The P2X3 receptor is important in the development and maintenance of tooth movement pain and thus may be peripheral targets for analgesics in orthodontic pain control.

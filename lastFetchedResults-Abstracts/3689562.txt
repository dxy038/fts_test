The results of accelerated aging tests on solid electrical insulation are difficult to evaluate objectively, primarily due to the inherently large variability of the test data. This variability is often represented by the Weibull or other extreme-value probability distributions. This paper demonstrates an hypothesis test procedure which permits the objective and unambiguous evaluation of comparative dielectric tests on two different sets of data. The computation techniques are facilitated through the use of a Fortran computer program. A significant difference must be established at low probabilities of failure. Analysis of typical aging tests from the literature indicate that many experiments performed to date may not be statistically significant at utilization levels. The number of tests required to achieve unambiguous significance at low probability levels may render meaningful accelerated aging tests uneconomic.

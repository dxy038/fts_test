An experiment has been performed to study the perceptual characteristics of speech processed by ADPCM. We created 18 three-bit and four-bit coders spanning a wide range of quantizer adaptation parameters. Subjects judged the difference between each pair of coders and rated the quality of each coder individually. The difference data reveal three important perceptual dimensions (overall clarity, signal vs. background distortion, muffled vs. hoarse) which are related to various objective measures of coder performance. Overall subjective quality is well predicted by segmental SNR and even better by a linear combination of measures of granular distortion and overload distortion.

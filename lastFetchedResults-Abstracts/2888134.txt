Feature extractors play an important role in different Computer Vision application domains such as registration, recognition and visual search. Different detectors have been proposed and evaluated so far assuming images taken with classic cameras. However, many operating cameras (e.g., in surveillance and automotive) are built considering a fisheye model and a preprocessing step is performed to remove the distortion of the images before running a detector. The following question arises: are the current detectors suitable to work directly in the fisheye domain? To answer this question, in this paper a benchmark dataset and objective evaluation measures are considered to evaluate the performances of the state-of-the-art detectors in the fisheye domain. Test images are properly generated starting from benchmark rectilinear images and considering different fisheye focal lengths. The experiments evaluate the performances of the detectors against both increasing fisheye distortion and the combination of the fisheye distortion with photometric and geometric variability of the image content. The experiments demonstrate that affine covariant detectors can be employed directly in the fisheye domain. Furthermore, although the transformation between the rectilinear and the fisheye coordinates is not affine, we show that the mapping can be locally approximated by linear functions with a small error.

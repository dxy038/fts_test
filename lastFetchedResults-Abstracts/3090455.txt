In this paper an optimal design approach is proposed for the real-time production control of a general assembly line using fuzzy logic control (FLC) mechanism and genetic algorithm (GA) based on simulation. The optimal control system combines push and FLC policies together. We consider single part type production line with infinite buffers and reliable machines whose process time are determinate. The objective is to minimize the average inventory cost while satisfying uncertain demand. In order to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the design approach proposed, an illustrative example is discussed and the optimal system is compared to the original one. The results show that the optimal design methodology is completely feasible and the optimal system holds superior performance.

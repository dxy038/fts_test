Objective: Cardiovascular complications are the major cause of reduced lifetime in diabetic patients. Given that physical activity can play an effective role in reducing these complications, the current study was conducted with the aim of examining the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on some cardiovascular risk factors in women with type 2 diabetes.
Materials and Methods: Twenty women with Type 2 Diabetes were selected by convenience sampling method and were randomly divided into two experimental (n=11) and control (n=9) groups. The exercise protocol included aerobic exercise training for eight weeks and 3 sessions per week; every session lasted for 60 minutes and with intensity of 60-70 percent of maximum heart rate reserve. Blood samples were taken to measure serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), glycemia and serum lipids before and after aerobic training period.
Results: The obtained results indicated a significant decrease in the levels of hs-CRP, fasting glucose and total cholesterol, and a significant increase of HDL in the experimental group than controls (p < 0.05). Mean serum concentration of triglycerides and LDL reduced in the experimental group; however, this reduction was not statistically significant. None of the changes in the control group were significant except for increase in the plasma triglycerides levels.
Conclusion: According to the results of this study, 8 weeks of aerobic exercise can reduce inflammatory causes as well as glycemia and lipid profile in women with type 2 diabetes that these changes can have a desired effect on reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients.

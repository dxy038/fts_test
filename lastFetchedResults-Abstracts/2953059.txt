The objective of this project is to study the change in land cover of Sentosa island and to assess the condition of the vegetation existing on the island using SPOT images. Two SPOT multispectral sub-scenes of the island acquired in Feb 94 and Aug 96 were used in the study. The two images were first co-registered using common ground control points. For each image, the vegetation was characterized by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The change in the state of vegetation was assessed by the change feature image. Unsupervised classification was done on the image of 1996 and the change feature image separately. The land cover classes in 1996 and the changes between the two images were obtained from the classified images

Human operator, expertise, analogy and intuition play always a preponderant role in the piloting, the control and the decision-making in a production system characterised by an uncertain environment (technological, human and organisational). Nevertheless, in certain cases of decision making, the human decision is effected by uncertainty, hesitation and lack of experience. This represents a major problem in the area of manufacturing systems. We propose a new methodology for the modelling of the uncertainty of production resources (man, machine, information). The approach exploits the knowledge of manufacturing experts by structuring it in the form of fuzzy rules and subjective/objective data for the characterisation of production resources. A test of the model is presented with a clothing activity product

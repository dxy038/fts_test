A fix frequency (2.4GHz) beam scanning leaky-wave antenna based on composite right/left-handed (CRLH) transmission line (TL) is proposed in this paper. Two Radio Frequency Micro-electromechanical System (RF MEMS) switches have been used and the signal transmitting on the TL is reversible and bidirectional. The variation range of the beam direction can be achieved from -63&#176; to +63&#176;. The effect of series re&#769;sister of the varactors (been loaded on the TL) is studied. A sample of antenna with 38 units is made using the varactors (BB837). The simulation data is agree with the measured one.

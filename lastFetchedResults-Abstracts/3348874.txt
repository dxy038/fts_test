The striking competitiveness of modern-day companies is more than ever a direct function of their ability to implement high yielding processes and continuous optimization. Such optimization, however, is becoming increasingly harder to realize, due to the growing complexities of processes, networks, manufacturing system structures as well as business processes. The limitation of optimization tools exacerbates the difficulties in achieving competitiveness. The objective of this work is to investigate the merits and demerits of integrating systems tools for optimizing breakthroughs in manufacturing or business processes using DMAIC and DOE. The application and power of process optimization are examined using the semiconductor manufacturing industry. We seek to demonstrate that &#8220;integrated methodology&#8221; application to process optimization can enable enterprises to achieve substantial innovation and contribute to their quality standards, lower their cost and boost their competitiveness irrespective of the limitations that current tools may have.

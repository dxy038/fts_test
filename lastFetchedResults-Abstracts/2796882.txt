This paper shows the network solutions proposed and implemented in the framework of the project ARES. The strategic objective of ARES is to create an advanced CDN, accessible through a cloud interface, supporting medical and research systems making a large use of genomic data. The expected achievements consist of identifying suitable management policies of genomic contents in a cloud environment, in terms of efficiency, resiliency, scalability, and QoS in a distributed fashion using a multi-user CDN approach. The experimental architecture envisages the use of the following key elements: a wideband networking infrastructure, a resource virtualization software platform, a distributed service architecture, including suitable computing and storage infrastructure, a distributed software platform able to ingest, validate, and analyze high volumes of data, a software engine executing a sophisticated intelligence for workload distribution and CDN provisioning.

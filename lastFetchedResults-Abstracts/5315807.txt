One of the main problems in current (artificial) neural network engineering is the lack of design rules for neural networks, i.e., how many layers and how many neurons per layer to choose for a fully connected layered neural network with bidirectional weights. A theory is developed which optimizes the topology of the neural network to allow a maximum potential storage capacity with a minimum amount of neurons. The optimal topology and maximum number of connections for all the interconnection schemes are given

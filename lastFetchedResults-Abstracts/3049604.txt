Previous studies for CDMA admission control ignored traffic asymmetry analysis in both uplink and downlink. We propose an admission control-based performance management framework for uplink and downlink connection in integrated voice/data CDMA systems. Based upon reserved channels (guard channels), the prioritized admission control problem is formulated as a performance optimization model. The objective is to minimize handoff forced termination probability. For solving the optimization problem, an iteration-based Lagrangian relaxation approach is applied. The paper provides both short-term and real-time admission control for updating system parameters and resource management, respectively.

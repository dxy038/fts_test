BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Normochromic-normocytic anemia is a common problem in patients with chronic renal failure. The main cause of anemia in such patients is insufficient production of erythropoietin by kidneys. This study was aimed to compare the effect of different products of erythropoietin on hemoglobin level in hemodialysis patients. 
METHODS: In this Cohort study, 126 hemodialysis patients with hemoglobin less than 11 g/dl from Imam Reza and Imam Khomeini hospitals of Kermanshah, Iran were included. They received subcutaneous EXI poietin (65 patients) or PDpoietin (61 patients), 50-100 unit/Kg in three divided doses per week and followed up for two months and the results were compared in two groups with respect to changes in hemoglobin level and blood pressure after treatment. 
FINDINGS: The mean increase in hemoglobin levels in EXIpoietin group was 0.16±1.5 and in PDpoietin group was 0.99±1.4 g/dl (p=0.02). Despite no statistically significant difference between mean hemoglobin level before treatment in two groups, after treatment the mean changes in PDpoietin group (0.99±1.4) was rather than EXIpoietin group (0.16±1.5). However, increase in blood pressure at the end of two months, was more in EXIpoietin group (systolic=8.32±6.04, diastolic=8.45±6.89) than the PDpoietin group (systolic=4.38±7.09, diastolic=4.36±5.63) (p < 0.05). 
CONCLUSION: The result showed that increase in hemoglobin level is greater in PDpoietin. Because the PDpoietin is more available with lower cost, it is recommended to use it for treatment of anemia in patients with hemodialysis.

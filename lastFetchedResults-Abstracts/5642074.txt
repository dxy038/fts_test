An objective performance measure for image fusion considering region information is proposed. The measure not only reflects how much the pixel level information that fused image takes from the source image, but also considers the region features between source images and fused image. We conducted several simulations which show that our measure accords with subjective evaluations. Considering the robustness of image fusion, we test some exciting fusion method by appending any levels noise as disturbance. By the experiments, we find that robustness is an ignored performance should be given more attention to.

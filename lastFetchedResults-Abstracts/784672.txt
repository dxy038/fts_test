Background: The relationship between cardiovascular factors and death can vary with age, very few
studies have examined metabolic syndrome in the elderly. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the
prevalence of the MS in a sample of elderly institutionalized patients (>65 years) using ATPIII and IDF
definitions. Design: This was a cross-sectional survey covering a sample of representative of the institutionalized
Spanish population aged above 65 years. The final sample study consisted of 862 patients, 556 females and 306
males. ATPIII and IDF definitions were used to classify the patients. Results: Prevalence of MS was different
according to the two definitions used. When the IDF definition was applied, total prevalence was 48.91%
(CI95%:43.47-50.25), while prevalence according to ATPIII criteria was 46.80% (CI= 43.47-50.25). a higher
prevalence of MS was found in females as compared to males. Using IDF criteria, odds ratio was 1.9
(CI95%:1.4-2.6) and 1.7 (CI95%:1.2-2.2) according to ATPIII criteria. a steady decrease is seen in MS
prevalence as the age of patients increases (the last two groups (85-94 ys and >95ys), both for the ATP III and the
IDF definitions. Conclusion: A higher prevalence of MS in this elderly population as compared to general
population was observed. A decrease of this prevalence above 95 years was detected.

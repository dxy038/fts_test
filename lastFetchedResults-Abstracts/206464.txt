Background: With respect to the high prevalence of tuberculosis in Iran, its delayed diagnosis and prior reports of elevated adenosine deaminase activity in the affected patients, this study was carried out in individuals referring to Imam Khomeini hospital in 1999.
Materials and methods: During this historical study, we have assessed the ADA activity in CSF of 3 groups: control-I (10 non-tuberculous patients whose CSf was extracted during spinal anesthesia), control-II (6 viral or non-tuberculous meningitis) and case (6 tuberculous meningitis). Meanwhile, ADA activity was evaluated in ascites fluid of 10 non-tuberculous patients and 5 tuberculous patients.
Results: The activity of ADA in CSF of the aforementioned groups was 0.64±0.12, 2.08±0.8, and 13.1±5.3 U/L, respectively (p<0.0001). The activity of ADA in ascites fluid of non-tuberculous and tuberculous patients was 13.9±5.7 and 66±12.9 U/L, respectively (p<0.0001).
Conclusion: Evaluating the ADA activity in CSF and ascites fluid could be helpful in the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

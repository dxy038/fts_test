The effectiveness of Car2X communication strongly relies on trust in received data. Securing in-vehicle communication is an essential yet so far overlooked step to achieve this objective. We present an approach based on the use of symmetric key material protected with inexpensive hardware. We modeled the involved cryptographic and network protocols, showed their applicability to automotive bus systems and conclude about their soundness with analytical and simulation methods. A prototype realization in real vehicles is envisaged as part of an ongoing project.

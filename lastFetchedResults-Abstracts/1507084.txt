Environmental concerns have stimulated interest in utilizing plant-derived materials in various industrial fields. The main objective of the present study was to synthesize a new type of high-performance lignin series dispersant of coal–water slurry (CWS) from wheat straw alkali lignin (WAL), and determine the affecting factors in the reaction and the application performance for CWS preparation. The experimental results showed that the inherent viscosity and the sulfonic group content of the modified wheat straw alkali lignin (MSL) are the key factors affecting its dispersing effect for CWS. In the reaction, the reactant mass concentration and the sulfonating agent amount were changed to obtain the MSL with different inherent viscosities and sulfonic group contents, and the MSL with intermediate inherent viscosity (6.0 ml/g) and higher sulfonic group content (1.80 mmol g− 1) was found to have excellent dispersing effect for CWS. The MSL obtained from optimized process was used as dispersant for CWS preparation, the studies of the properties of CWS showed that MSL has similar dispersing effect with naphtalenesulfonate–formaldehyde condensate, and far better dispersing effect than lignosulphonate. Recently this kind of new dispersant has been applied in several power plants in China.

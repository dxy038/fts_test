Background and objective: Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, defined as detectable HBV-DNA in serum with undetectable surface antigen (HBsAg). In patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HBV, HIV enhances HBV replication and rapid progression of liver disease to cirrhosis and liver failure. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of occult HBV infection in HIV-positive patients.

Materials and methods: 106 HIV-infected patients were enrolled in this study. HBV-DNA was detected in serum samples by Real time PCR. HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, anti-HCV, ALT levels, HIV viral load and CD4 cells count were also tested in all subjects.

Results: Of 106 patients enrolled in this study, 22 subjects (20.75%) had isolated anti-HBc. HBV-DNA was detectable in 3 out of the 22 patients (13.6%, 95% CI, 0.0%-28%) who had isolated anti-HBc.

Conclusion: Occult HBV infection was relatively common in Iranian HIV-positive patients. Therefore it seems that screening of these patients is helpful in prevention of HBV transmission.

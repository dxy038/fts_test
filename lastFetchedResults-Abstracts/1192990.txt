Aim of this paper is to search and find ways and methods of constructivism teaching and learning ideas in
teaching the architectural design studio. The objective is to extract all the positive things constructivism has to offer the architectural
design studio for efficient teaching and effective learning. Although there are similarities in the curricula of training architects all over
the world, but educators go about it in their own convenient and suitable ways and styles. And this is leading to inadequacy in the
standards of teaching the arch-design studios in the contemporary world. The topic has become very relevant and timely as
arch-educators and other stakeholders are of the opinion that something has to be done to improve the ways and methods of training
architects, especially the teaching of the arch-design studio. Through exploration of critical analytical review of literatures and interviews,
this paper finds ways and methods of constructivism in teaching the arch-design studio. These ways and methods are critically
explored through the research themes of collaboration, integration, adaptability and motivation. By teaching and learning with
constructivism ideas in the arch-design studio the students would be grounded in designing with creativity ideas and therefore we can
have professionals that design and build creatively, functionally, satisfactorily and safely. It means we can have real buildings and
places that satisfy our clients, the society and in harmony with the environment.

Since health is becoming a major priority for the European Union, the development of global national eHealth platform has been adopted as a solution in order to meet the EU recommendations in several countries. However, to reach this objective, governments have to integrate a large variety of specificities inherent to their country and to the continent. In this paper, we report about the results of a wide investigation that took place in Luxembourg in 2009. This survey aimed at learning about the situation of health professional regarding the use of Information and Communication Technology as well as their expectation with respect to health information exchange. The outcomes showed some opportunities and some existing barriers to overcome for the development of the eHealth platform in Luxembourg. This paper focuses on the barriers and illustrates them through the analysis of two case studies, based on the creation and adaptation of e-services.

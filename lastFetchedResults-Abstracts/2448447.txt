Based on the experience of the thermal convection LiPb loops, a multi-functional forced convection loop, DRAGON-IV, was constructed to confirm the different design functions of blankets in China. It can provide directly the valuable and real working condition, such as high magnetic field, flowing liquid LiPb with high temperature, tensile stress, reference TBM mockup, etc. Therefore, many out-of-pile experiments can be performed in it, such as high temperature corrosion experiment, stress corrosion, MHD effect under magnetic field for different manifolds, characteristic of flowing and heat transfer for mini-TBM, and purification technology.

tailed information of DRAGON-IV is described in the paper, its design objective, experimental parameters, main components are introduced, and the design scheme and analysis results of thermal-hydraulic for some key subsystems are presented. The results showed that they meet well the design requirement.

Subsurface drainage is an important water management practice on naturally poorly drained soils, and recommendations for appropriate drain spacings for particular soils continue to evolve. The objective of this long-term study was to measure corn (Zea mays L.) growth and yield as affected by subsurface drain spacing on a soil that was traditionally not tile drained. Three drain spacings (5, 10, and 20 m) were compared with a nondrained "control" (40 m) for plant population, grain yield, and moisture content over a 10-yr period on a low-organic-matter silt loam soil. In addition, corn populations, heights at 4 and 8 wk, yield, and moisture were measured with distance from the drain for the 5-, 10-, and 20-m spacings. Significant distance effects occurred more frequently for the 20-m spacing than for the 10- and 5-m spacings, especially for grain yield and moisture. The 10-yr average corn yields were 9.8, 9.7, 9.5, and 9.2 Mg ha^-1 for the 5-, 10-, and 20-m plots and the nondrained control plots, respectively. Grain yield was 1.3 to 1.7 Mg ha^-1 lower in the nondrained control than in the 5-m spacing in 3 of the 10 yr and was likely due to both planting date delays and wetter soil conditions after planting. The smaller-than-expected yield differences among treatments may reflect the excellent surface drainage in this field as well as optimal planting dates in 7 of the 10 years. The results demonstrate that drainage improvements are a long-term investment and may not provide yield benefit in every year.

Speech recognition has provided limited converted speech into text as query for cross language information retrieval (CLIR). Therefore, in this study, speech recognition to be integrated with cross language information retrieval system to investigate the Quran system results performance using semantic and stemmers as stemming semantic spoken query (SSSQ). The query however is based on the speech to be input and converted into text. Therefore, this study is conducted with the purposes to investigate the integration speech, semantic and stemmers approach against the queries and vice versa. Furthermore, it is also conducted to investigate the performance query based on total retrieve and relevant. The retrieval however, included the irrelevant documents because of the translation polysemy. Results from the experiments suggest that SSSQ is most important process in CLIR. It also found that semantic speech approach with stemmers contributes to better approach in using speech instead of keyboard to investigate its performance for Quran document results.

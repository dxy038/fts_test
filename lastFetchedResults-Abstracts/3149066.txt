A closed simulative circulative rig determined values of hemodynamic performance parameters. In the experiment: Bank-stored blood (400 ml) was subjected to pumping in the simulative circulative rig, with 40 ml 3.8% sodium citrate applied to the rig. Free hemoglobin (FHB) was determined. Blood samples were taken before pumping, and every hour onward until the end of the 6th hour. FHB increased linearly with the length of pumping time. The normalized index of hemolysis (NIH) was 1.3402 &#177; 0.3014 mg/100L when the pump worked at 5 L/min against 80 mmHg. The pump reached the demand of flow rate and pressure head required for people, but the NIH was still high.

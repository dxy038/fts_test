Expounding the question of divine fate and destiny, their various kinds, their being essential or active and their relationship with the issue of Bada’ always been the subject of speculation and inquiry. It’s relationship with the theological issues on the one hand, and with the anthropological issues on the other hand, have added to its complexity. Mirdamad’s philosophical system provides a relatively conclusive demonstration of fate and destiny. According to Mirdamad, there are two kinds of fate and destiny: scientific and objective. "scientific fate" is the divine knowledge of things, in the sense that it is efficient cause in a collective, Unitarian and undifferentiated way. "Objective fate" is the objective existence of beings in the universe. " scientific destiny" is the divine knowledge of things, in the sense that it is efficient cause in a differentiated, multiple and gradual way. "Objective destiny" is the external existence of incidents and the universe within the material world. Using a descriptive- analytical method, this paper seeks to expound the question of “fate and destiny” from Mirdamad's perspective and address this issue and its relationship with Bada’.

Recently multi-agent systems have been discussed to realize a large size of distributed autonomous system. This paper proposes an intelligent control of multiple partner robots as one of multi-agent systems. First of all, we discuss the current state of researches on the multi-agent systems. Next, to realize a formation behavior, we propose a multi-objective behavior coordination to realize formation behavior based on the integration of the intelligent control from the local viewpoint of individual intelligence and the spring model from the global viewpoint of collective intelligence. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed method through several computer simulation results.

Although todayÂ´s network capacity is increasing exponentially, new applications are demanding higher and higher bandwidth. The available bandwidth always seems to be less than the new applications require. This tendency results in congested networks and packet losses, and we can expect this to continue into the foreseeable future. Congestion can be caused by several factors. The most dangerous cause of congestion is the burstiness of the network traffic. Recent results make it evident that high-speed network traffic is more bursty, and its variability cannot be predicted, as was assumed previously. It has been shown that network traffic has similar statistical properties on many time scales. Traffic that is bursty on many or all time scales can be described statistically using the notion of long-range dependency. Long-range-dependent traffic has observable bursts on all time scales. Factors such as traffic burstiness make providing quality of service (QoS) in high-speed networks increasingly important. QoS implies mechanisms to avoid congestion by allocating network resources optimally, rather than continually increasing network capacities. The objective of our paper is to present an extension of a QoS mechanism called Integrated Services (IntServ) with active networking in networks with long-range-dependent traffic

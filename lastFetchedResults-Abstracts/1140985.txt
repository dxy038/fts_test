Image processing methods were developed for correcting confocal microscopy images for errors introduced during image acquisition and subsequent three-dimensional (3-D) image reconstruction. These include corrections for aberrations due to refractive index mismatch, light attenuation with sample depth, uneven intensity across image layers, and image misalignment. These procedures were validated using a simulated image with different illumination conditions. As example applications, dynamic changes in microstructure of process cheese during heating and gelation of Î²-lactoglobulin (whey protein) were studied in situ. The error-corrected image layers were used to reconstruct a 3-D composite image of fat globules in cheese. The techniques presented will allow objective evaluation of in situ changes in 3-D microstructural features in different foods.

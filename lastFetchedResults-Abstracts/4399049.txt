In recent years, because of the characteristics of environmentally friendly, mature technology and cheap operation cost, new energy power generation technology is developing fast. Based on the distribution of resources in Qinghai Province, a scheduling method of wind-Photovoltaic-hydro-gas power generation system is proposed to achieve energy conservation and emissions reduction, taking minimum hydroelectric power flow and minimum gas turbine fuel consumption as two objectives. The proposed model is solved by improved multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) based on parameter adaptive adjustment. Simulation results show that this dispatching method can effectively mobilize the power regulation capability of hydro power and gas turbines to track the random output of wind and photovoltaic output, with the minimum water flow and gas heat consumption. With this method, the association system composed by wind farms, photovoltaic plants, hydropower and gas power plants can be dispatched to the energy saving, carbon green, and high efficient operation mode.

In this paper we introduce the constellation alphabets suitable for bidirectional relaying in parametric wireless channels. Based on the analysis of hierarchical minimum distance, we present a simple design algorithm for the non-uniform 2-slot constellation alphabets. These novel constellation alphabets outperform traditional linear modulation schemes in Hierarchical-Decode-and-Forward and Denoise-and-Forward relaying strategies in fading channels without sacrificing the overall system throughput.

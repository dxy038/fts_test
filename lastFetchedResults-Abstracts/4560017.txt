The objective of this work was to produce a computerised knowledge management system (KMS) to help a multilateral training development agency train natural resource planners to be more aware of the full environmental impacts of development projects. The KMS identifies primary and higher order impacts associated with a range of projects via a rule-based causal network. In order to provide the user with further information on a range of topics related to the impacts identified by the rulebase, hypertext linkages are provided between the rulebase and a textual database. This database contains information on the underlying causal mechanisms of impacts, suggestions for potential mitigating activities, a glossary and a bibliography. The development, structure and use of the KMS in training are discussed

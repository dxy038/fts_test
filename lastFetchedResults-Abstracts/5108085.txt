A continuous and reliable electrical energy supply is the objective of any power system operation. However, faults inevitably occur in power system due to bad weather conditions, equipment damage, equipment failure, environment changes, human or animal interference and many other reasons. Since it is very important that correct information about fault location and its nature is provided as fast as possible, an automated system is proposed to track status of equipment and to calculate fault location. Calculated results are available to users through detailed graphical representation. This paper presents elements of proposed solution and describes the benefits.

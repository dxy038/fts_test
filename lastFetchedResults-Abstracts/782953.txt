Objective The aim of this study was to investigate
the occurrence of mental health problems in
adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) and the number
of adults with ID receiving care at general mental health
clinics. Method The Reiss Screen for Maladaptive Behaviour
and the Psychopathology Inventory for Mentally
Retarded Adults were used to investigate mental
health problems in samples from two Swedish counties.
Adults with ID receiving psychiatric care at general
mental health clinics were investigated via the mental
health services register in one county. Results The overall
occurrence of mental health problems in adults with
ID ranged from 34 % to 64%. The most common mental
health problems were aggressive, self-injurious behaviours,
signs of depression, anxiety or adjustment problems.
The occurrence of adults with ID among patients
receiving out- or in-patient psychiatric care was approximately
1%.Between 70 % and 90% of these persons had
a mild level of ID. Conclusion The overall occurrence of
mental health problems was similar to reported overall
figures in comparable studies conducted in the US, UK
and Denmark. The number of adults with ID registered
for out- or in-patient psychiatric care was low compared
with the occurrence of mental health problems based on
the screening results.

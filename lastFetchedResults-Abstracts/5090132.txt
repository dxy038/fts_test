We reported the carbon stocks, the distribution of carbon stocks of vegetation biomass among functionally distinct pools between 2004 and 2009, for the main forest ecosystem, Platycladus orientalis plantations in Beijing, China. We then evaluate the carbon accumulation of the forest ecosystem. Our results indicated that total carbon stocks of vegetation biomass ranged from 49.3&#8211;61.2 t C/hm<sup>2</sup>, of which 47.0&#8211;58.9 t C/hm<sup>2</sup> from trees. Total carbon stocks was highest in forest from sunny slope with thinned soil, intermediate in stand from shady slope with thick soil and lowest in forest from sunny slope with thick soil in 2005, which was inverse in forests between shady slope with thick soil and sunny slope with thinned soil in 2009. We did not find significant differences in carbon accumulation rates for forests in sunny slope of thick and thinned soil. However, an apparent increasing of total carbon accumulation rates in shady slope forest with thick soil from 2005 to 2009. Results suggested that the selection of site condition can affect carbon accumulation and forest growth, and possible is strategies for sustainable management of Platycladus orientalis plantations in Beijing when the main objective is biomass production and carbon accumulation.

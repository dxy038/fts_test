<p><strong>Objective</strong>: The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of vaginal rogesterone on prevention of recurrent preterm labor.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> Total number of 70 patients with preterm labor treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate in<strong> </strong>perinatology department of valiasr hospital entered to a randomized clinical trial. Treatment group after inhibition of preterm labor with magnesium sulfate received progesterone suppository (400 mg) daily until delivery and control group received no treatment. Latency until delivery, recurrence of preterm labor and neonatal outcomes were studied. Statistical significance was defined as p&lt; 0.05.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Mean latency until delivery (p&lt; 0.05), low birth weight (p&lt; 0.05), birth weight (p&lt; 0.01) were significantly different between the two groups. Recurrence of preterm labor was not significantly different between the groups.<br /><strong>Conclusions:</strong> The use of vaginal progesterone suppository after successful parenteral tocolysis associated with a longer latency preceding delivery but failed to reduce the incidence of recurrent preterm labor.</p>

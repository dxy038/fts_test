This paper presents a generalized periodic imperfect preventive maintenance (PM) model for a system with age-dependent failure type. The imperfect PM model proposed in this study incorporates improvement factors vis-a-vis the hazard-rate function, and effective age. As failures occur, the system experiences one of the two types of failure: type-I failure (minor), and type-II failure (catastrophic). Type-I failures are rectified with minimal repair. In a PM period, the system is preventively maintained following the occurrence of a type-II failure, or at age T, whichever takes place first. At the N th PM, the system is replaced. An approach that generalizes the existing studies on the periodic PM policy is proposed. Taking age-dependent failure type into consideration, the objective consists of determining the optimal PM &amp; replacement schedule that minimize the expected cost per unit of time, over an infinite horizon.

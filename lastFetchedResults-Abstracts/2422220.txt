In this paper, a two-stage optimal planning and design method for combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) microgrid system was presented. The optimal objective was to simultaneously minimize the total net present cost and carbon dioxide emission in life circle. On the first stage, multi-objective genetic algorithm based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was applied to solve the optimal design problem including the optimization of equipment type and capacity. On the second stage, mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm was used to solve the optimal dispatch problem. The approach was applied to a typical CCHP microgrid system in a hospital as a case study, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified.

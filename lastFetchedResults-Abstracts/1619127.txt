Freeze-drying is often used to improve storage stability of therapeutic proteins. In order to obtain a product with optimal storage stability it is important to understand the mechanisms by which solutes protect the protein against freeze-drying-induced stresses and also against damage induced during subsequent storage. The objective of the current study was to examine the importance of various mechanisms proposed to account for acute and long-term storage stability using recombinant human Factor XIII (rFXIII)4as a model protein. Initially, for acute stability during freeze-drying, it was found that solutes which formed an amorphous phase stabilized rFXIII to a greater degree than solutes which crystallized during freeze-drying. However, only amorphous solutes which were able to hydrogen bond to the protein, and thus preserve the native protein structure in the dried solid, provided optimal acute stability. Thus, in addition to forming an amorphous phase, it was also important to possess the ability to hydrogen bond to the protein. Long-term storage stability was found to be optimal in the presence of solutes which formed and maintained amorphous phases with Tgvalues above the storage temperature and which also preserved the native protein structure during freeze-drying. Solute crystallization during storage compromised storage stability.

Recently, a multigranulation rough set (MGRS) has become a new direction in rough set theory, which is based on multiple binary relations on the universe. However, it is worth noticing that the original MGRS can not be used to discover knowledge from information systems with various domains of attributes. In order to extend the theory of MGRS, the objective of this study is to develop a so-called neighborhood-based multigranulation rough set (NMGRS) in the framework of multigranulation rough sets. Furthermore, by using two different approximating strategies, i.e., seeking common reserving difference and seeking common rejecting difference, we first present optimistic and pessimistic 1-type neighborhood-based multigranulation rough sets and optimistic and pessimistic 2-type neighborhood-based multigranulation rough sets, respectively. Through analyzing several important properties of neighborhood-based multigranulation rough sets, we find that the new rough sets degenerate to the original MGRS when the size of neighborhood equals zero. To obtain covering reducts under neighborhood-based multigranulation rough sets, we then propose a new definition of covering reduct to describe the smallest attribute subset that preserves the consistency of the neighborhood decision system, which can be calculated by Chenâ€™s discernibility matrix approach. These results show that the proposed NMGRS largely extends the theory and application of classical MGRS in the context of multiple granulations.

In this paper, a neurodynamic optimization approach is proposed for robust eigenstructure assignment problem of second-order descriptor systems via state feedback control. With a novel robustness measure serving as the objective function, the robust eigenstructure assignment problem is formulated as a pseudoconvex optimization problem. Two coupled recurrent neural networks are applied for solving the optimization problem with guaranteed optimality and exact pole assignment. Simulation results are included to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

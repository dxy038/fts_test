The tensor product (TP) model transformation is a recently proposed technique for transforming given linear parameter varying (LPV) models into affine model form, namely, to parameter varying convex combination of linear time invariant (LTI) models. The main advantage of the TP model transformation is that the linear matrix inequality (LMI) based control design frameworks can immediately be applied to the resulting affine models to yield controllers with tractable and guaranteed performance. The main objective of this paper is to study how the TP model transformation performs in a real world, experimental environment. The study is conducted trough the example of a translational electromechanical system, the single pendulum gantry (SPG)

Composite stems obtained by injection moulding of polyetheretherketone reinforced with carbon fibres (CF/PEEK) can concurrence metallic ones in total hip replacement. By the combination of process simulations and structural analysis, different compositions of CF/PEEK and injection conditions are explored. The resulting implants are compared to the bone alone and the bone-implant system based on conventional metallic materials, under walking load. Comparisons are done through four objective criteria: stress shielding, stress deficiency, debonding and global deformation. CF/PEEK injected implant presents very good results.

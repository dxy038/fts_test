The objective of this research is to study a model-based scheme for Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) in mechatronic systems. Mechatronic systems are a class of interdisciplinary engineering systems which entails greater reliability. A model-based feature estimation FDI approach is developed. A proprietary electric motor based valve actuator, used in pressure regulation applications was integrated and the developed FDI algorithm was tested. In order to develop FDI algorithms, appropriate methodology and supporting tools such as ANN, Fuzzy Logic, MATLAB, embedded technology (DSP boards), PC platforms, and programming tools are used.

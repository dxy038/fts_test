The evaluation of equipment maintenance training effectiveness is complicated, variable and uncertain. There is no effective way to evaluate the quality of the effectiveness of equipment maintenance training at the present time. In this paper, the evaluation method of equipment maintenance training effectiveness based on cloud models is provided. This method is based on Cloud Model theory, with uncertainty as the starting point, blends together the subjective and objective information. At the same time, the method integrates the fuzzy and random completely, achieves the mutual conversion of qualitative and quantitative evaluation, and deals with the uncertainty of the system evaluation indexes effectively. On the other hand, the final results of the evaluation can provide explicit improvement suggestions to ensure the continuous improvement of the training. Combined with an example, the method is validated finally.

In this paper, a buck resonant voltage divider (RVD) (BRVD) with bidirectional operation considered is presented, which can be used as the first stage of the bus converter. The proposed BRVD under open-loop control can obtain about half of the output voltage created from the existing RVD. Above all, the used switches have zero-current switching at turn off or zero-voltage switching at turn-on. Moreover, the bidirectional operation of the proposed topology is also taken into consideration. The detailed illustration of the proposed topology is provided along with some experimental results to verify their effectiveness.

This paper presents a project space exploration on the baseline JPEG compressor proposed and implemented in previous works. This exploration took as basis the substitution of the operators used in the 2-D DCT calculation architecture of the compressor and the consequent evaluation of impact in terms of performance and resources utilization. This substitution was made with main focus in the carry lookahead, hierarchical carry lookahead and carry select architectures, with the objective to increase the JPEG compressor performance. As the compressor architecture was designed in an hierarchical mode the operators substitution was an activity quite simple, because it has not involved the other hierarchy levels. The operators were described in VHDL, synthesized and validated. They were inserted in the 2-D DCT architecture for synthesis in the whole module. The 2-D DCT was synthesized for an altera FPGA. With this project space exploration, the highest performance obtained for the 2-D DCT was 23% higher than the original, using 11% more logic cells.

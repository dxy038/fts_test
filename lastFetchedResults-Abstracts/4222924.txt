The first preliminary results of attempt at objective physical detection (measuring) the geopathogenic zones are given. The geopathogenic zones are the influencing zones of the underground flowing waters and geological clefts, which have negative effects on living organisms. Because the nature of geopathogenic influences is unknown so far, there are hitherto no instruments for its detection and measurement. Here the first preliminary results of objective detection of the geopathogenic zones influence on the brain wave frequency are given. This is the first physical detection of the geopathogenic zones so far

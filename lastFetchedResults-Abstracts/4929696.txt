Under unconsolidated resources, cloud computing providers have to allocate some resources to fullfil client request based on the on-demand mode. Using the applications profile, Infrastructure-as-a-Service model can be developed. Basically, Infrastructure-as-a-Service model provides resources in the form of computation power (CPU-hours unit), storage (gigabytes unit), network bandwidth (Internet data transfer, GB per day unit), and electrical power (kWh). From service availability point of view, reference model is previously developed as a backup framework. In this research, the development of cloud computing reference model for on-demand services is based on both application characteristics and resources availability. The objective of development model in this research is to decrease idle resources.

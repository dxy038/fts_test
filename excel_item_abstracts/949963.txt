The AFM topography of GaAs vicinal surfaces shows that the step-step interaction is dominated by an important dipolar term which compensates the low kink energy to give straight ledges at 600Â°C. The Ga/Al ordering in GaAs/AlAs lateral superlattices is shown to be limited by the step array disorder as well as by the vertical exchange treated in a mean field approximation.

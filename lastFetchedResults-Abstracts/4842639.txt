An important objective of positioning systems is to follow a desired path precisely under the presence of disturbance and plant uncertainty. To achieve this objective, we examine a dual-actuator configuration. An H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller is designed to guarantee closed-loop robustness. Furthermore, we adopt a two degree of freedom control scheme to obtain a good transient response. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the design method

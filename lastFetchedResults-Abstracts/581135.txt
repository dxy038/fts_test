Background and Objective: High levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and oxidative stress play a key role in development of complications in type 2 diabetes (T2D). It has been reported that glycemic optimizing affects vitamin D in patients with T2D. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of daily consumption of vitamin D and vitamin D-calcium-fortified yogurt drink on serum levels of AGEs and ox-LDL in T2D patients.
Materials and Methods: Sixty diabetic subjects aged 30-60 years were assigned randomly to one of the three groups: 1- plain yogurt drink; 2-yogurt drink fortified with 500IU cholecalciferol per 250 mL bottle; and 3- yogurt drink fortified with 500IU cholecalciferol and 250 mg calcium per 250 mL bottle. Participants were instructed to consume 2 bottles of the yogurt drink daily for 12 weeks. The anthropometric, dietary and laboratory assessments were done at baseline and at the end of intervention.
Results: Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased significantly from 40.6±30.1 to 76.8±32.6 nmol/L (p < 0.001) in group 2 and from 45.1±38.7 to 72.7±35.3nmol/L in group 3. Fasting glucose (p   =0.016 and p=0.040, respectively), insulin (p < 0.001 and p=0.009, respectively), HbA1c (p=0.001 and p=0.003, respectively), HOMA-IR (p < 0.001 and p=0.002, respectively) and serum level of AGEs (p=0.029 and p=0.001, respectively) decreased significantly. There was no significant within and between group changes in ox-LDL serum levels. 
Conclusion: Our results showed that daily intake of 1000 IU vitamin D with or without calcium significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH) D, improved glycemic control and decreased serum levels of AGEs but had no effect on ox-LDL levels in diabetic patients.

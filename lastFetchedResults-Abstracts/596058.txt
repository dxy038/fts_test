Rheumatoid arthritis is a multi systematic progressive illness of connective tissue, mostly with joint changes, but also with non-joint changes. The objective of the paper is to compare laboratory and clinical parameters between two groups of examinees, who live in different material, hygienic conditions and different level of health protection. One hundred and forty five patients (core group) were examined and 50 patients (control group). Laboratory and clinical monitoring shows differences in the core group and control group. It is primarily reflected in the status of cell immunity, clinical forms of rheumatoid arthritis, but also other parameters. Cell immunodeficiency is dominating in the core group, heavy clinical forms of rheumatoid arthritis but also visceropathy. The reasons for higher potential of evolution of rheumatoid arthritis in the core group should be sought in the bad material, hygienic living conditions, as well as the level of health protection in the core group compared to the control group.

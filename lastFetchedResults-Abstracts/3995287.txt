This paper describes a novel driver-support system that helps to maintain the correct speed and headway (distance) with respect to lane curvature and other vehicles ahead. The system has been developed as part of the Integrating Project PReVENT under the European Framework Programme 6, which is named SAfe SPEed and safe distaNCE (SASPENCE). The application uses a detailed description of the situation ahead of the vehicle. Many sensors [radar, video camera, Global Positioning System (GPS) and accelerometers, digital maps, and vehicle-to-vehicle wireless local area network (WLAN) connections] are used, and state-of-the-art data fusion provides a model of the environment. The system then computes a feasible maneuver and compares it with the driverÂ´s behavior to detect possible mistakes. The warning strategies are based on this comparison. The system &#8220;talks&#8221; to the driver mainly via a haptic pedal or seat belt and &#8220;listens&#8221; to the driver mainly via the vehicle acceleration. This kind of operation, i.e., the comparison between what the system thinks is possible and what the driver appears to be doing, and the consequent dialog can be regarded as simple implementations of the rider-horse metaphor (H-metaphor). The system has been tested in several situations (driving simulator, hardware in the loop, and real road tests). Objective and subjective data have been collected, revealing good acceptance and effectiveness, particularly in awakening distracted drivers. The system intervenes only when a problem is actually detected in the headway and/or speed (approaching curves or objects) and has been shown to cause prompt reactions and significant speed correction before getting into really dangerous situations.

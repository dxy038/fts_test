Summary form only given. In this work, we have optimized the design and fabrication of 1.55 &#956;m InP-based ridge and BR lasers with compressively strained and strain compensated MQW separate confinement heterostructures. Our objective was to determine the performance characteristics of optimally designed lasers under low photon density conditions

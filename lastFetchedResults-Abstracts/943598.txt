Background and Objective: Internal root resorption (IRR) in early stages, may have no radiographic facing. For evaluating of these lesions, intraoral periapical radiography is ususally used. One of the most limitations for this method is its low diagnostic detective information power. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) with periapical radiograghy in early internal root resorption.
Subjects and Methods: Sixty single root premolar teeth were cut mesiodistal and devided randomly into two groups (30 teeth in each).  The test group was subjects to artificial IRR in coronal and apical region by round bur.  The control group was left untreated. The samples were manted on self cure acrylic resin. CBCT and periapical radiography captured from all teeth. Two blinded radiologists assessed the presence or absence of IRR in each tooth.
Result: Complete agreement in diagnois and prescence of IPR was made by CBCT. However, with periapical radiography only 1/3 of apical lesions were diagnosed.
Conclusion: The finidengs of this study demosmntrated that CBCT has a higher accurcy in detecting internal root resorption lesions particularly in apical sites than periapical  radiography.

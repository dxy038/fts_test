This paper firstly presents an image quality objective assessment method on the base of color moments. Then by analyzing the statistical characteristics of the subjective assessment results, this paper proposes a non-linear calibration algorithm using the worst image quality video sequence as the reference to separate the score interval of objective assessment. Combined with the similarity metric algorithm based on the color moment, an improved objective assessment algorithm of the image quality is established. The results show that the subjective evaluation results and objective evaluation values gained by this algorithm are with high consistency.

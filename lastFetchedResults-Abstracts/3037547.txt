In this paper we propose a new approach for multi-objective control using a cascade of filters that progressively removes candidate commands which do not satisfy task constraints. The approach is motivated by other control methods that prevent destructive control interactions through space projections. We apply this approach to a practical leader/follower task in which a mobile robot must address the conflicting objectives of moving to a goal position while avoiding obstacles and keeping a region of the workspace within the field of view of a fixed camera mounted on the platform. We experimentally verify our approach using the Segway Robotic Mobility Platform (RMP), a dynamically stable, differential drive mobile robot.

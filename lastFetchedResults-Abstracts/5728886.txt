The objective of Mobile video monitoring system is to provide high performance low latency video streaming to the client side. This work presents an effective system design and implementation for mobile video monitoring. We focus on the whole system design and some key issues on video encoding and decoding. We compare our design to existing solutions and experiment results demonstrate the efficiencies of our method.

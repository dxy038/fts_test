This paper presents the design technique of a bidirectional power flow DC-DC converter for two power sources. The power sources are composed of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) and the Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. A single DC-DC Converter is designed for both of motoring and generating modes of the DC motor load condition. Charging and discharging operating modes of NI-MH are focused. The PSpice simulated result confirms a good achievement of the energy management.

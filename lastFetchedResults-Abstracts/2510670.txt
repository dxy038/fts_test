The main objective of this research work is to investigate the subsurface
structures in Sabalan geothermal field using two-dimensional (2-D) nonlinear
conjugate gradient and smoothness-constrained least square inversion methods
of magnetotelluric (MT) data. To achieve the goal, 8 MT sites in the Sabalan
area have been selected along one profile. Dimensionality analysis using the
WALDIM code and impedance polar diagrams indicated that the subsurface
structures of the selected sites are One-dimensional (1-D) or 2-D at shallow
depths, whereas they are mainly three-dimensional (3-D) at middle and lower depths. Tipper and induction arrows have
been used to determine the geoelectrical strike. As a result, NE-SW direction has been identified as the major strike
direction of subsurface structures in the area. Spatial averaging method has also been used to remove the galvanic
distortions. After setting up the modeling parameters and appropriate mesh design, 2-D inversion of the MT data has
been performed using nonlinear conjugate gradient and smoothness-constrained least square methods. The obtained 2-D
models have illustrated very well the geothermal structures including cap rock, reservoir and the heat source. Moreover,
there is a close correspondence between these models and past investigations in the area.

Background and Objective: Hyperlipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In recent years some evidence have been presented on the association of periodontal and cardiovascular disease. Acute systemic or local chronic infections seem to induce changes in the plasmatic concentration of cytokines and hormones, which determine changes in the lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was the evaluation of association between chronic periodontitis and plasma lipid level.

Subjects and Methods: The plasma lipids levels of were measured in 90 subjects. The patients were divided into two age- and sex- matched groups: a test group, composed of 45 individuals with chronic periodontal diseases ranging from moderate to severe, with at least two periodontal pocket> 5mm; and a control group, composed of 45 periodontally healthy individuals or with gingivitis. Individuals with diabetes, hypertension, with history of myocardial infarction or cancer, or those who used diuretics, corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, and those who had received periodontal treatment in the last six months and/or took cholesterol reduction medicine in the last two months before the beginning of this study were not included in the study. Variables related to high cholesterol levels, including age, sex and, body mass index, were evaluated.

Results: Total cholesterol (CHOL) and triglycerides (TG) were significantly higher in case group compared with control group (P<0.001). HDL and LDL cholesterols were higher in cases but didn't have any significant differences with controls. The frequency of persons with pathologic value of TG and CHOL were significantly higher in cases compared with control group.

Conclusion: This study showed that hyperlipidemia may be associated with periodontitis in medically healthy people but we can not conclude that whether periodontitis causes an increase in levels of serum lipids or whether hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for periodontitis

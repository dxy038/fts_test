This work proposes a system to allocate surveillance resources in areas of high piracy risk when the satellite AIS coverage is low, resulting in an improved maritime traffic situational awareness. The system is based on multiobjective optimization algorithms providing solutions that are on the so-called Pareto optimal front. The solutions are a trade-off among different objectives, including surveillance risk, area coverage, and mission costs. In general, the inclusion of an objective in the multiobjective vector function is application dependent.

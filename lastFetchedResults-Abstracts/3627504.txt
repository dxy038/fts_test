This note is concerned with model predictive control for linear singular systems with time-varying uncertainties. A piecewise constant control sequence is calculated by minimizing the worst-case linear quadratic objective function. At each sample time, the sufficient conditions on the existence of the model predictive control are derived and expressed as linear matrix inequalities. The robust stability of the closed-loop systems is guaranteed by the proposed design method.

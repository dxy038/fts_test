To describe complex fenestration systems such as novel solar blinds, new glazing or coating materials, daylight and
sunlight-redirecting devices, a detailed description of their optical properties is needed, given by their Bidirectional
Transmission (or Reflection) Distribution Functions (commonly named BTDFs and BRDFs). These functions are
angle-dependent at both the incidence and the emission levels, and are defined as the ratio of the luminance of a surface
element in a given direction (after diffuse transmission or reflection) to the illuminance on the sample. However, these
functions are capable of describing the specular as well as the diffuse components of emerging light, and their mutual
knowledge is necessary to properly assess a glazing or shading system s daylighting performances and benefit from their
potential as energy-efficient and users  comfort strategies. Although the analytical expression of a BT(R)DF differs
whether it is related to specular or diffuse light, a simultaneous assessment of the two components can be achieved
under certain conditions. These conditions are analyzed for the particular data acquisition procedure developed for
a novel type of bidirectional goniophotometer, based on digital imaging.

The author presents a general-purpose reconfigurable switch which allows for all possible combinations of two line interconnections of any of its bidirectional lines. This switch can be used to implement a global interconnection network for systolic arrays, wavefront arrays, or any topology with similar regular structures such as programmable logic devices. The reconfigurable switch has the desirable properties that it is both scalable and C-testable. Furthermore, the switch is shown to be C-configurable; that is, the number of configurations required to test a network of switches is independent of the size of the network

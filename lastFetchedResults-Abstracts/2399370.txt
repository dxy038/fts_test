Objective
pare microtensile bond strengths (MTBS) subsequent to load cycling of resin bonded acid-etched or EDTA-treated dentin using a modified ethanol wet-bonding technique.
s
entin surfaces were obtained from extracted human molars and conditioned using 37% H3PO4 (PA) (15 s) or 0.1 M EDTA (60 s). Five experimental adhesives and one commercial bonding agent were applied to the dentin and light-cured. Solvated experimental resins (50% ethanol/50% comonomers) were used as primers and their respective neat resins were used as the adhesives. The resin-bonded teeth were stored in distilled water (24 h) or submitted to 5000 loading cycles of 90 N. The bonded teeth were then sectioned in beams for MTBS. Modes of failure were examined by scanning electron microscopy.
s
st hydrophobic resin 1 gave the lowest bond strength values to both acid and EDTA-treated dentin. The hydrophobic resin 2 applied to EDTA-treated dentin showed lower bond strengths after cycling load but this did not occur when it was bonded to PA-etched dentin. Resins 3 and 4, which contained hydrophilic monomers, gave higher bond strengths to both EDTA-treated or acid-etched dentin and showed no significant difference after load cycling. The most hydrophilic resin 5 showed no significant difference in bond strengths after cycling loading when bonded to EDTA or phosphoric acid treated dentin but exhibited low bond strengths.
icance
esence of different functional monomers influences the MTBS of the adhesive systems when submitted to cyclic loads. Adhesives containing hydrophilic comonomers are not affected by cycling load challenge especially when applied on EDTA-treated dentin followed by ethanol wet bonding.

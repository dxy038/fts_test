Objective
This study was undertaken to compare patient satisfaction with subjective and objective measures of success.
Study design
Satisfaction at 1-year was measured by using a self-administered written questionnaire. Success was assessed both subjectively and objectively by using the short form Urogenital Distress Inventory, stress testing, and multichannel urodynamics. Outcomes were compared to determine the relationship between satisfaction and success. Satisfied and dissatisfied patients were compared with respect to pre-, intra-, peri-, and postoperative characteristics. Student t and Ï‡2 tests were used for continuous and ordinal data, respectively.
Results
Of 66 (80%) patients, 53 were satisfied. These patients were more likely to achieve subjective cure (91% vs 62%, P = .009) but not statistically more likely to be objectively cured (92% vs 75%, P = .08). Dissatisfied patients tended to have overactive bladder symptoms, voiding difficulty, and required sling release. Other patient characteristics did not influence satisfaction rates.
Conclusion
Satisfaction after tension-free vaginal tape procedure is highly dependent on normal bladder function. Dissatisfied patients deserve comprehensive evaluation, although objective measures may not reflect patient satisfaction.

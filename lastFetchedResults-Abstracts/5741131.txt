The main objective of the present work is to develop a smart wireless sensor network (WSN) for an agricultural environment. Monitoring of environmental factors have increased in importance over the last decade. In particular monitoring agricultural environments for various factors such as temperature and humidity along with other factors can be of significance. A traditional approach to measuring these factors in an agricultural environment meant individuals manually taking measurements and checking them at various times. The ability to document and detail changes in parameters of interest have become increasingly valuable, to such an extent that unattended monitoring systems have been investigated for this function. This study investigates a remote monitoring system using WiFi, where the wireless sensor nodes are based on WSN802G modules. These nodes send data wirelessly to a central server, which collects the data, stores it and will allow it to be analyzed then displayed as needed.

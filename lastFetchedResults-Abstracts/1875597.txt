Objective
cribe the frequency, manifestations, and correlates of impaired healing of saphenous vein (SV) harvest incisions in hospitalized patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

ctive, descriptive, correlational.
g
oast university-affiliated medical center.
ts
-two English-speaking adults who had undergone CABG.
e Measures
ed wound healing of SV-harvest incisions.
s
erall indidence of impaired healing was 43.8%. The most frequent manifestations of impaired wound healing at discharge were prolonged erythema (8/32), prolonged drainage (8/32), and both prolonged erythema and drainage (2/32). Correlates of impaired healing of SV-harvest incisions were body mass index (product-moment correlation=0.39, p=0.026) and preoperative use of diuretics (point biserial correlation=0.42, p=0.016).
sions
ed healing of SV-harvest incisions in this sample occurred more frequently than previously indicated in the literature. Although severe wound infections were infrequent, a high degree of impaired healing occurred (43.8% of patients who had undergone CABG). Future studies need to explore the long-term effects of impaired healing and test interventions to mitigate impaired healing in this population.

We hypothesized that computerized analysis of gastrointestinal acoustic phenomena (GAP) may provide an accurate, rapid, safe, and inexpensive method of diagnosing a wide range of gastrointestinal conditions. Adaptive filters (AFs) and other conventional signal-processing techniques were employed for heart-sound (HS) cancellation. The objective was to remove HSs with minimum GAP distortion. After an overview of AF applications in biomedicine, we review our methods for HS removal in the laboratory and we discuss the results of the study.

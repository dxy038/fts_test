Objective
We assessed the effects of an intervention aimed at increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables on plasma folate and homocysteine concentrations.
Methods

Seventy-one healthy non-smoking women (mean ± SD 41 ± 4 y of age) were randomized to an intervention or a control group. Participants in the intervention group (n = 36) received weekly packets containing fruits and vegetables free of charge and were asked to consume a daily amount of ≥200 g of vegetables and two pieces of fruit (the Dutch recommended intake level) over a period of 1 mo. Control subjects did not receive any intervention.
Results

Compared with the control group, reported fruit and vegetable intakes in the intervention group increased by 133 g/d (95% confidence interval [CI] 87–179, P < 0.001) for fruits and juice and 64 g/d (95% CI 37–91, P < 0.001) for vegetables and estimated folate intake from fruits and vegetables increased by 40 μg/d (95% CI 22–58, P < 0.001). However, no effect was observed on plasma folate concentrations (intervention effect 0.3 nmol/L, 95% CI −1.8 to 2.8, P = 0.77) or homocysteine concentrations (intervention effect 0.26 μmol/L, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.87, P = 0.39).
Conclusion

The results suggest that 4 wk of increased fruit and vegetable consumption to the recommended amounts may be insufficient to change plasma folate and homocysteine concentrations.

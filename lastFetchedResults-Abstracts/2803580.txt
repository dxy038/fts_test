The objective of this paper is the derivation in a closed form of the channel estimation mean square error (MSE) expression in the time-frequency domain for OFDM systems, providing a general tool that can be applied to all linear channel estimation algorithms. The proposed method can be used to identify the best channel estimation algorithms, and to compare the different pilot symbol positioning strategies within an OFDM frame. Thanks to these features the proposed method can be used as a support to the system design.

Artificial bee colony algorithm (ABCA) as one of swarm intelligence methods and finite element analysis are first adopted for structural topology optimization. The objective of the paper is to examine the effectiveness and applicability of the suggested ABCA in structural topology optimization. This paper describes considerable modifications made to the ABCA in order to solve discrete topology optimization problems. The desirable conclusions are obtained through the results of the examples based on the suggested ABCA.

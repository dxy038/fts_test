Objective
The objective of this study was to determine whether central fat distribution varies between children who were growth retarded as young children and normal-height children from the same impoverished communities of São Paulo, Brazil.
Methods

A prospective study of 50 stunted and normal-height children in São Paulo, Brazil was conducted in which children were measured for changes in fat mass (FM) and fat distribution (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and anthropometry) and Tanner stage over a 4-y period. Statistical analyses included multiple linear regression to control for confounding factors and Student’s t test was used to estimate group differences.
Results

At follow-up, stunted children were shorter, weighed less, and had less total FM compared with control children. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to percent FM or percent truncal FM (%TrFM). Linear regression analyses were used to determine that stunted children had 1) increased TrFM (independent of FM); 2) increased %TrFM (independent of FM, gender, and Tanner stage), and 3) a borderline significantly greater change in TrFM (independent of FM, gender, and Tanner stage).
Conclusion

Stunted children are more likely to deposit fat centrally when entering puberty, a significant risk factor for chronic diseases. Our results may explain part of the association between early growth retardation and later risk for metabolic diseases.

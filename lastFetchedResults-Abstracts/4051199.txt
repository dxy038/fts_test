The authors describe a differential method for estimating mean concentrations of atmospheric molecular components along a quasivertical rectilinear Earth-air path utilizing a transmitter-receiver pair operating at infrared. The choice of a differential method is due to the need to limit calibration problems without utilizing more complex and costly systems such as DIAL, whose capabilities are definitely oversized for this kind of measurement. For this objective, a preliminary selection of the optimal wavenumbers for each molecular species of interest is needed. This is the main issue discussed in this paper, after which the analysis focuses on the effects of the uncertainties on atmospheric parameters that need to be estimated to provide the final mean-concentration estimates. The feasibility study is carried out on carbon monoxide, considered as test species of interest in the reported simulations of atmospheric propagation, based on standard atmospheric models. Technological requirements are finally discussed

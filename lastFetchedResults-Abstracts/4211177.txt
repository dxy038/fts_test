The objective of this paper is to show performances of the deadbeat controller applied to a VSC-HVDC transmission link. The system studied is based on 3-level neutral point clamped (NPC) converters. The dynamic response of the VSC-HVDC is of primary importance under various operating conditions. It is also important that the converter valve currents be limited during AC disturbances in order to avoid the blocking of the converter. A deadbeat control system is designed using the average value model of the converter and then the obtained controller is used with a detailed model and the system performances are shown during change of active power and a three phase short-circuit. Simulation results for a 200 MW, 50 Hz, 230 kV, VSC-HVDC system show that the deadbeat controller has an excellent transient response.

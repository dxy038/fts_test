Wall shear stress (WSS) has been proved to play a critical role in formation and development of atherosclerotic plaques. Our objective was to quantify local WSS in vivo in normal subjects, and to analyze spatial distribution patterns and determine the temporal gradient of WSS. Seventy-eight CCAs of 42 healthy volunteers at common carotid arteries (CCAs) were studied. Cine phase-contrast MR sequence was used to acquire the flow velocity information. Three-dimensional paraboloid modeling was applied to fit the velocity profiles and WSS values were calculated. Mean WSS value for CCAs was 0.783±0.209, with the range of WSS value from −0.541 to 3.464 N/m2. The 95% confidence interval for mean WSS value in CCA was (0.736–0.830) N/m2. Different WSS spatial distribution patterns were classified into three types according to the location of low WSS values during a cardiac cycle. Mean value of maximum temporal gradient of WSS was 14.12±5.46, with the range from 5.87 to 33.23 N/m2 s−1. Skewed velocity profiles were displayed in most CCAs, indicating the flow patterns in CCA were more complicated than commonly assumed. Obvious inter-subject variation were found in magnitude, spatial distribution and the temporal gradient of WSS in CCAs, and the blood flow patterns as well.

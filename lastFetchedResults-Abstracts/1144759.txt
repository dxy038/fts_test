Environmental noise can produce negative effects on people’s health since it interferes with basic activities such as sleeping, resting, studying and communicating. These effects depend not only on the physical characteristics of the noise itself, but also on parameters associated to each person and each environment. It is thus important to study noise pollution from a quantitative point of view as well as a from the point of view of the annoyance that it produces in the population.

We have conducted a social survey aiming to identify the main sound sources, evaluate the annoyance and analyse the main effects of noise on people. The survey was distributed to a sample of people living approximately in the corners of an imaginary 250 m grid placed over the map of the city of Valladolid (Spain). The same corners were used to perform in situ measurements for a noise city map.

There are two main purposes for this research work: (1) we want to compare the objective noise measurements to the annoyance reported by the people in order to find some kind of dose–effect relationship, and (2) we want to analyse how the population of Valladolid evaluates noise reduction from an economical and social point of view.

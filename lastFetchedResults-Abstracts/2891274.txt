As increasing the access of spectrum in current wireless environment needs the proper utilization of spectrum. Cognitive Radio is the one of the most technology for Spectrum utilization in wireless media. Sensing of the channel is prime objective in Cognitive Radio. Some most common spectrum sensing techniques like Energy based Detection, Matched Filter based Detection, and Cyclostationary Feature Detection. In this paper Energy Detection is used as spectrum sensing. Using Cooperative analysis of multi CR (Cognitive Radio) during channel sensing is studied. Also evaluate performance of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with increasing no of CRs. At the last in this paper a comparison between a selected relay based on maximum value SNR and SNR of others relays in multi-channel is done. And evaluate the performance of all relays and selected relay based on SNR. For performance analysis using MATLAB software.

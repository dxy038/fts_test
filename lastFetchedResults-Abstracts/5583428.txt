The objective of this paper is to evaluate land suitability for sorghum using geographic information system (GIS). Terrain attributes (slope and aspect) and soil physical and chemical properties (effective soil depth, organic matter, texture, available phosphorus, available potassium, and drainage capacity) were selected using Delphi technique. The weight of each index was determined by AHP approach. The results showed that about 94% of the study area was classified as suitable and highly suitable land for planting sorghum. The highly suitable land is mainly located in the north-western Jiangyang.

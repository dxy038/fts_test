A mixed integer nonlinear model for continuous steel casting production is proposed. For each casting line a set of allowed products is fixed; each product is characterized by a nominal length with a corresponding tolerance range. The model is used to formulate a constrained optimization problem whose objective consists of finding casting lines speeds and cutting plan that minimize scrap material and production time. A corresponding algorithm is implemented in a tool which has been experimentally tested in a steel production plant located in Italy.

The electronic devices used in automobiles have seen a sharp increase in demand every year, but we face an essential problem in order to keep abreast of the growing market demand: to improve the reliability of the electronic parts used in these devices. To attain this objective, it is necessary to establish a system of close cooperation between the automobile industry and the electronics industry, and to produce and select parts of high reliability for use in automotive electronic devices. In order to produce "100% reliable" products, moreover, it is imperative to upgrade the screening technology and to perform sufficient reliability tests, as well as to improve electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) technology for digital electronic products.

This paper proposed a new idea that applying Identity-based cryptography mechanism to the wireless mesh network for itÂ´s security features and defects, IBS-EAP access authentication protocol and IBS-RP roaming authentication protocol are designed with objective of rapid access and avoiding multiple certification. The security and efficiency of the new protocols is analysed. With the ID-based signature technology adopted, the public key can be calculated directly from node identity and the IBS system public parameters without using complex technology to maintain public key certificates and certificate revocation lists.

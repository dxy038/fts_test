The Advanced Television Test Center (ATTC) is a private sector, nonprofit organization created to undertake full, fair, and impartial testing of the various advanced television (ATV) systems that have been proposed as the United States terrestrial broadcast standard. Cable Television Laboratories (CableLabs) organized by the cable television industry operates, in cooperation with ATTC, a state-of-the-art laboratory testing facility capable of thoroughly evaluating the proposed ATV systems when transmitted by cable TV, including both coaxial cable and fiber-optic transmission. Presently there are six systems scheduled for test by the ATTC and CableLabs. The systems and their scheduled test dates are shown. One of the systems is an enhanced NTSC compatible system and the other five are high-definition television (HDTV) simulcast systems. Four of the simulcast systems are digital. Both objective and subjective tests of all six systems are discussed

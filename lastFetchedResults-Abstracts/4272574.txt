Hub networks are used to connect supply and demand nodes without establishing direct connections between any origin-destination nodes. The issue is to find optimum hub locations and allocate non-hub nods to them at minimum cost and/or travel time. Multiple allocation hub location problems deal with network in which non-hub nodes can be allocated to more than one hub. In this paper we use a multiple objective approach for hub location to minimize total cost of the networks regarding minimizing maximum travel time between nodes. There are capacity restrictions on hub facilities and arcs connecting the nodes. Finally the comparison between the proposed model and existing ones has been illustrated.

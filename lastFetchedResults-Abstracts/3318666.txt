The aim of this paper is to present an application of polynomial factorization as an alternative to FIR approximation in the design of a &#8467;<sub>1</sub> controller. The polynomial matrix fractions have been calculated for the H, U and/or V matrix transfer functions coming from the Youla parametrization of the plant to be controlled. Different approaches are possible depending on which one of the H, U and/or V matrix transfer functions are factorized. The objective of these approaches is to reduce the number of constraints, variables and/or non-zero coefficients in the Linear Programming problem to be solved for the &#8467;<sub>1</sub> control design, and if possible, to accelerate the convergence of the upper and lower bounds of the &#8467;<sub>1</sub> norm.

This paper presents the development, analysis, and simulated experimentation with a discrete control algorithm for optimal control of a solar energy system for heating buildings. The contents include the mathematical formulation of the system and objective function, the solution technique, the microprocessor control system and its components, and the results of tests conducted using a control-driven dynamic simulation computer model to perform comparisons with conventional controls.

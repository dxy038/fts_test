The objective of the paper is to propose a predictable context sensitive trust model for a business system. A business system can be imagined with four basic entities between which there is a mutual trust of different nature exists. A formal model, which encompasses the trust between the stack-holders is proposed where the context sensitive features of the multi variate trust issues are addressed. The impact of both the legal environment and the interoperability factors on various entities involved in the trust issues are focused in the work. The key dimensions of the trust i.e. integrity and loyalty are determined through acceptable uncertainties of various components in the proposed model the proposed context sensitive trust model for business systems. The model which represents the various trusts in a context sensitive business system is verified using a numerical simulation tool and the inferences are drawn with a scenario.

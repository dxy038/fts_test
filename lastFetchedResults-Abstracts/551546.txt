Background and Objective: Osteoporosis is a major health problem for postmenopausal women and use of dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is standard diagnostic method. But due to the cost, it is not economical to use for screening of all postmenopausal women, thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate performance of Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI) as a tool for screening of osteoporosis among Iranian postmenopausal women. Subjects and Methods: In this study data was collected from a bone densitometry centre. The osteoporosis risk was evaluated for 341 postmenopausal women (age > 45 years) without consider secondary cause of osteoporosis. The results were compared with their bone mineral density.
Results: From 341 postmenopausal women, 20.8% were showed osteoporotic and 39.6% had low bone mineral density in one or both studied area by DXA. To assess osteoporosis of low bone mass, ORAI was shown a sensitivity of 70.9% and specificity of 66.9% respectively. Conclusion: The ORAI was adequate sensitivity to evaluate Iranian postmenopausal women. This test could be used as screen test to determinate low bone mineral density to referral of women.

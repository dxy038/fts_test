The objective of this preliminary study was to determine the optimum concentration of antioxidants in the soluble fractions of Maillard Reaction Products (MRPs similar) (formed by sarcoplasmic proteins of beef and malondialdehyde) and to evaluate the influence of different meat components (individual and combined sarcoplasmic proteins, glucose and Fe2+) on the antioxidant effect of this fraction in a model system. The results showed that the optimum concentration of MRPs similar that should be used to achieve an acceptable antioxidant activity in this model system is 3% (w/v). When the interactions of all the components of meat with MRPs similar were evaluated, the largest concentration of protein and glucose exerted an increase in the antioxidant effect of MRP for the concentrations of iron assayed.

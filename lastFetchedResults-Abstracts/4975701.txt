This paper describes a dependability benchmark intended to evaluate partitioning operating systems. The benchmark includes both hardware and software faultloads and measures the spatial as well as the temporal isolation among tasks, provided by a given real-time operating system. To validate the benchmark, a prototype implementation is carried out and three targets are benchmarked according to the specified process. The results substantiate that the proposed benchmark is able to compare and rank the targets in an objective way, and that it provides the ability to identify aspects of the target systems that need improvement.

Leak-before-break (LBB) assessment of
primary heat transport piping of nuclear reactors involves
detailed fracture assessment of pipes and elbows
with postulated throughwall cracks. Fracture assessment
requires the calculation of elastic-plastic
J -integral and crack opening displacement (COD)1 for
these piping components. Analytical estimation
schemes to evaluate elastic-plastic J -integral andCOD
simplify the calculations. These types of estimation
schemes are available for pipes with various crack configurations
subjected to different types of loading.However,
such schemes for elbow (or pipe bend), which is
one of the important components for LBB analyses,
is very meager. Recently, elastic-plastic J and COD
estimation scheme has been developed for throughwall
circumferentially cracked elbow subjected to closing
bending moment. However, it is well known that the
elbow deformation characteristics are distinctly different
for closing and opening bending modes because the
ovalisation patterns of elbow cross section are differentunder these two modes. Development of elastic-plastic
J and COD estimation scheme for an elbow with
throughwall circumferential crack at intrados subjected
to opening bending moment forms the objective of the
present paper. Experimental validation of proposed J -
estimation scheme has been provided by comparing
the crack initiation, unstable ductile tearing loads and
crack extension at instability with the test data. The
COD estimation scheme has been validated by comparing
the COD of test data with the predictions of the
proposed scheme.

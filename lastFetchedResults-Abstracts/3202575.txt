This paper presents a study about photometric performance of LEDs (light-emitting diodes) using an optimized methodology for LED lighting systems. The objective is to evaluate and quantify the flicker produced in LEDs supplied with current ripples commonly found in LED drivers. An optimal point of operation is approached taking into account thermal, electric and optical LED system characteristics. The results are compared with levels of perception and acceptability previously presented in the literature.

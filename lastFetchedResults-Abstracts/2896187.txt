We have devised a method to optimize Golomb-Rice coding of frequency spectra, aiming at its use in frequency domain audio coder, using spectral envelopes extracted by linear predictive coding (LPC) from amplitude spectra instead of conventional power spectra according to theoretical investigations. This optimization improves the efficiency of the Golomb-Rice coding by allocating Rice parameter at each frequency bin based on the value of the envelopes, resulting in the enhancement of the objective and subjective quality of the state-of-the-art wideband coder at 16 kbit/s. Therefore, the method introduced here is expected to be useful for coding audio signals at low-bit-rate and low-delay conditions, required in mobile communications.

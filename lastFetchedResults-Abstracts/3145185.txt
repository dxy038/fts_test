Multi-objective particle swarm optimization is the research hot spot of the intelligent computing field at present, which has a more efficient information sharing mechanism than the genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial immune algorithm (AIA). In allusion to a certain kind of new freight car, the multi-objective optimization design of the transmission is carried out by using multi-objective particle swarm optimization. The multi-objective optimization model of the transmission is established. Seeking for the optimal structure design of transmission under the target of the minimum volume and the minimum centre distance with Matlab platform, the optimal solutions for Pareto theory are obtained. The optimization method is of certain reference significance to design the other complex systems.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS) is a new clinical test for measuring muscle spasticity, which is increasingly used in the clinic and research. Only one study has been performed on the validity of the MMAS. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the MMAS and electromyographic (EMG) parameters in assessing wrist flexor muscle spasticity.
METHODS: In this concurrent criterion-related validity study, eleven women with first ever stroke resulted in hemiplegia with a mean age 51.82 years (range: 32-69) and mean time since stroke 17.82 months (range: 1-48) participated. Spasticity of wrist flexors using MMAS simultaneously with EMG recordings was assessed. Spearman's rho test was used to calculate the correlations between the MMAS grades and EMG parameters. 
FINDINGS: There were significant correlations between the MMAS and all EMG parameters including mean amplitude (r=0.64, p=0.02), peak amplitude (r=0.53, p=0.05), duration of activity (r=0.72, p=0.01), latency (r=-0.69, 
p=0.01), and rise time (r=0.56, p=0.04).
CONCLUSION: The significant correlations between the MMAS and the EMG parameters indicate that the MMAS is a valid measure for assessing muscle spasticity.

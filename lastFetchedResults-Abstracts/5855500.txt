Summary form only given. Three methods for storing temporal associative patterns, which are ordered vectors, are presented. The first is to use a single bidirectional associative memory, the second is to use a cascade bidirectional associative memory, and the third is to use a ring unidirectional associative memory. Their performances are compared by simulations which use words of four letters as the temporal associative data. These words can be recalled after one letter is input. Finally, the application of the ring memory to store autoassociative data is also discussed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

A number of circuit configurations for protection of CMOS circuits against erroneous connections to the surrounding world (e.g. reversal of the supply voltage) are suggested and analyzed. It is found that protection against any permutation of input connections, output connections, and supply voltage connections can be obtained. The design objective is to prevent permanent damage to the chip regardless of how it is connected. It has been found both analytically and experimentally that this design goal can be achieved

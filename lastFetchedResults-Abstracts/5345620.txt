The WHO Report 2002 describes in detail how a few major risk factors account for a significant proportion of all deaths and diseases in most countries. Those risk factors are directly related with lifestyle and unhealthy habits. Thus, population based approaches addressing lifestyle factors have huge potential for the prevention of severe morbidity and mortality. The best therapeutic choice is guided by correct risk stratification for the individual, taking into account all the risk factors, not only the physio-pathological ones, but also the genetic, environmental, socio-cultural, behavioural and personal factors, in order to personalize health-hygiene measures on the basis of the risk profile. Health risk management programs address the identified risk levels of each individual and the action strategy proposed to elaborate a complete comprehensive program of life which should lead him from the current status towards the optimal one. Therefore, the objective of our proposed model has been to develop an intelligent system for the planning of personalized health risk management processes considering both the health strategies and the personal preferences: The life assistance protocols (LAPs).

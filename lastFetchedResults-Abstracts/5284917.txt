This paper presents a new effective algorithm depending on mathematical programming, to achieve the optimal scheduling of multiple nonconventional energy sources during a period of time. The model is constructed to realize multi objective function with set of equality and inequality constraints. This system is studied under two different considerations depending on the type of systemÂ´s variables (deterministic model and stochastic one). For simplicity, a modified technique combined with the chance-constrained technique is applied to study the stochastic system. Comparison with classical approach is conducted and shows the superiority of the proposed analysis. The algorithm is simple to implement and it is tested on a sample system. The results proved that the method is efficient and a considerable reduction in the overall time may be obtained if a good starting point is suggested

Objective
We investigated the effects of probiotics on nutritional status and gut mucosal atrophy after fasting.
Methods

Twelve rats were fasted for 3 d and then fed with rat chow (control group, n = 6) or an isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diet containing probiotics (probiotics group, n = 6; 106 colony-forming units/g of Bifidobacterium lactis BL and Streptococcus thermophilus) for 3 d. Twelve other rats were starved for 3 d (starved group) or normally fed with rat chow (sham group). At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected for total protein and albumin analyses, and the colonic mucosa was weighed (in grams) and assayed for DNA content (milligrams per gram of tissue).
Results

Feeding efficiency was greater in the probiotic group than in the control and sham groups (P < 0.01). Animals in the probiotic group presented higher albumin than did those in the control group (P = 0.04). Colonic mucosa of the sham group (1.32 [range, 1.28–1.44]) was heavier than that of all other groups (probiotic, 1.20 [0.95–1.49], P = 0.03; control, 1.09 [0.96–1.21], P < 0.01; and starved, 1.03 [0.99–1.07], P < 0.01) and heavier in the probiotic than in the starved group (P = 0.03). The DNA content in probiotic rats (49.1 ± 9.7) was similar to that in sham rats (53.9 ± 5.9; P = 0.79) and higher than that in control (30.3 ± 12.9; P = 0.01) and starved (34.4 ± 6.5; P = 0.05) rats.
Conclusions

Probiotics enhance the recovery of nutritional status and lessen gut mucosal atrophy after fasting.

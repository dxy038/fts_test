This paper presents results and analysis of experiments carried out on a vehicle platoon control system developed in the PATH program. The objective of this project is to assess the feasibility of applying currently available technology to the concept of vehicle platoon control. It is estimated that the vehicle platoon system could increase highway traffic capacity by a factor of two or three. The Integrated Platoon Control System (IPCS) includes a control system, communication system, data acquisition system, and various sensors including a radar system. The initial experiments using two Ford cars showed successful results. In the field tests, the automated following vehicle successfully followed the manually driven lead vehicle through several different kinds of maneuvers. This project is a joint effort by U.C.Berkeley, Caltrans and VORAD, with vehicles provided by Ford.

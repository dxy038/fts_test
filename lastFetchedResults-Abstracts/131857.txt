Although the advantage of JIT system have motivated many companies to implement this system, but uncontrollable varying environment parameters and the impacts of these parameters in reducing the efficiency of the system is the major problem in J1T implementation. Based on our literature review, determination of the number of Kanbans and investigating of JIT performance in different conditions is one of the most interesting research subjects. In this paper we first dev elop an integer linear programming (ILP) model to determine a fix number of Kanbans in each working station. Then based on this model we introduce another 1LP model to control varying production parameters. The second model determines variable number of Ka nbans for each station. Our objective function consists of inventory holding costs, shortage costs and costs of having variable number of Kanbans. We also compare the efficiency of both models regarding to variation in demand, processing times, capacity of stations, etc., by solving some test problems. We found that the second model dominates the first one in all cases.

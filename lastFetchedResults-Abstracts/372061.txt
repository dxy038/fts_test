In this work, we studied the shell structure of the Nautilus pompilius Linnaeus by using analytical techniques of scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction. The main objective of this study is the structural characterization of Nautilus shell at different length levels, from micron to nano-scale. The results were also used to try to determine the shell structure mechanism of formation. The information obtained in this work will place our particular knowledge a closer step to understand how self-assembly works in nature, and will increase the opportunities of using this information in the future synthesis of new advanced materials.

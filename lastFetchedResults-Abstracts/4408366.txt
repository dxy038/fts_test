Controlling electroporation and determination of its design parameters govern the performance in many electroporation applications in the fields of medicine, biology, and food industry. This work provides an enhanced high throughput signal processing method to enable non-expert, objective, automatic and fast analysis of large datasets of microscopic images of high throughput electroporation experiments. This can enable optimal design of vital electroporation parameters including the optimal thresholds for the electric field strength, and the optimal number of pulses. In this work the non-expert visualization platform and the methods are described, and implemented on normal dermal human fibroblasts cell culture.

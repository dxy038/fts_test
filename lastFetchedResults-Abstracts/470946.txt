Objective
The purpose of this study was to describe quantitatively the associations between total vaginal length and demographic, historic, and physical characteristics.
Study design
At 2 clinical sites, patients completed a standardized questionnaire and physical examination. Bivariate correlations explored relationships between total vaginal length and demographic, historic, and examination variables. Significant variables were evaluated with a multivariate linear regression model.
Results
The study included 3247 women. Hysterectomy and pelvic reconstructive surgery contribute 0.63 cm and 0.22 cm, respectively, to total vaginal length shortening; 10 years of age decreases total vaginal length by 0.08 cm. One meter of height and 10 kg of weight increases total vaginal length by 0.09 cm and 0.02 cm, respectively. Menopause is associated with a shortening of total vaginal length by 0.17 cm.
Conclusion
Although there appears to be statistically significant associations between total vaginal length and the aforementioned factors, the impact is unlikely to be clinically significant.

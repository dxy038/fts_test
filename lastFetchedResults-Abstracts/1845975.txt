The objective of this study was to observe the changing appearance of human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) grafts in their tibial bone tunnels by MRI using oblique axial images. One-hundred and eight knees in 75 patients were studied by MRI at 1â€“33 months after arthroscopic ACL reconstructions using double-looped, autogenous semitendinosus and/or gracilis tendons. Knees with poor stability were excluded from this study. The examinations were performed at 0.2T with spin echo proton density and T2-weighted oblique axial images. Appearances of grafts were mainly described on spin echo proton density images based upon time after surgery. The grafts appeared as homogeneous, low signal intensity areas in the bone tunnels at 1 month after the surgery. Ring-shaped low signal intensity areas were observed along the wall of the bone tunnels in the 2- to 3-month group. In many grafts from this group, each tendinous bundle appeared as a low signal area separated by a high signal intensity area. In all cases in the 4- to 6-month group, the thickness of the ring-shaped low signal intensity area had increased, whereas the thickness of the high signal intensity area had decreased. In almost all of the cases, the interior of the bone tunnel gradually became a homologous low signal intensity region by 7 to 12 months after the surgery. According to these results, it is suggested that the maturation of the tendon-bone interface was completed from 6 to 12 months after the ACL reconstruction.

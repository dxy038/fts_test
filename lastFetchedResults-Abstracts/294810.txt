Comparatively little attention has been given to the impact of smaller burns (less than 20% body surface area) on patients' health status after their return to normal life. The objective of this study was to investigate patients' own assessment of their physical and psychological health 3–4 months after discharge from in-patient treatment. A postal survey was employed which utilised: (a) personal and employment status questions; (b) a short health status questionnaire which was developed for use with this group of patients; (c) the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HAD); (d) the impact of event scale (IES). The response rate to the survey was 71%. Physical and social function were reported to be affected at the follow-up point in a minority of patients. The greatest impact of the injury was on levels of anxiety and response to trauma-related stress, as measured by the HAD and IES instruments — almost one third of the responders (15 patients) had clinically significant scores on either or both dimensions of the IES. Factors which may be associated with the response to trauma-related stress are discussed.

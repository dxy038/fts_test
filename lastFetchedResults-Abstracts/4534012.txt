Plug-and-Play is the dream of the process tool installation in the wafer fab. One day hookup is the first step or objective towards this dream. The ProMOS project proved that this objective could be achieved through the well-organized and good coordinated efforts, as well as strong support of the contractors. The successful pre-hookup made the dreams come true. Three methods were used for different kind of tools to do the correct pre-hookup. Models or templates made of steel bars were used to determine the utility connections three dimensionally for CVD and RIE equipment. Real size layout drawings were put on the raised floor for chemical stations. For furnaces, the header with take-offs for each group of furnaces was made based on the detailed hookup micro layout and process equipment layout. All the works were followed by the daily meeting of facility engineers, process equipment engineers and contractors, which made the hookup interface clear, the schedule on time and the cost under budget. The good management has minimized the hookup time of the utilities. The best results we achieved were 0.9 day for furnaces and CVD equipment, 1.2 days for wet stations and 1.9 days for sputters after tool assembly (10 working hours per day)

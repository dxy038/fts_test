Step-index single-mode optical fibers were tapered and then cleaved by ion beam milling to allow direct examination of the mode evolution in the taper with a microscope objective and CCD camera. Observation of HE<sub>1m</sub> modes is reported in tapered fibers cleaved at diameters ranging from 8 to 35 &#956;m. Theoretical scalar mode fields are fit to the experimental data and the mode transitions are explained by considering coupled mode theory

Depth image based rending is an important technology in 3DTV for synthesis virtual view. The most commom method consist of preprocessing depth image, 3D warping, image merging and holes filling. In this paper, we use a processing method only smooth the edges of objects, while omitting the pixel at high discontinuities. We also proposed a hole filling method based on depth information, Experimental results show that holes can be completely eliminated in our method, compared to previous method, the proposed method is effective and reliable in both of subjective and objective evaluations.

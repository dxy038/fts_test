Forest background, consisting of understory, moss, litter, and soil, contributes significantly to optical remote sensing signals from forests in the boreal region. In this paper, we present results of background reflectance retrieval from multiangle high-resolution Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager sensor data over a boreal forest area near Sudbury, ON, Canada. Modifications of the background by white and black plastic sheets at two sites provide two extreme limits for the development and testing of an algorithm for retrieving the background information from multiangle data. Measured background reflectances in red and near-infrared bands at six sites in the vicinity of these modified sites are used to validate the algorithm. We also explore the effect of uncertainties in the input forest structural parameters on this retrieval. The results document: 1) capability of the algorithm to retrieve meaningful background reflectance values for various forest stand conditions, particularly in the low to intermediate canopy density range; 2) the effect of background bidirectional reflectance distribution function on retrieved values; 3) performance of the algorithm using data with different cross angle values; and 4) verification of the internal consistency of the geometric-optical 4-Scale model used. The results provide an important platform for the operational estimation of the vegetation background reflectance from the bidirectional reflections observed by the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer instrument.

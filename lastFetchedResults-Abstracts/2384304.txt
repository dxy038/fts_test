Recent research has focussed primarily on lipid emulsions for drug delivery and fluorocarbon emulsions for both oxygen delivery (blood substitutes) and drug delivery. Decisive progress has been made where our comprehension of emulsion stability and handle on stabilization against both molecular diffusion and droplet coalescence are concerned. The in vivo fate of the particles and mechanism of the side effects which can follow the intravascular administration of emulsions are better understood; the latter were minimized. In terms of applications, one key objective was to prolong intravascular persistence of lipid emulsions intended for drug delivery. A strategy has been outlined for optimal utilization of injectable oxygen-carrying fluorocarbon emulsions with the objective of alleviating the need for blood transfusion.

Objective: Setting research priorities in the research management cycle is a key. It is important to set the research
priorities to make optimal use of scarce resources. The aim of this research was to determine the research needs of
Health Insurance Organization based on its health care centers research needs.
Methods: This is a qualitative, descriptive and cross-sectional study that was conducted in 2011. A purposeful
sample of 60 participants from 14 hospitals, seven dispensaries, five dental clinics, two rehabilitation centers, four
radiology centers, six medical diagnostic laboratories, 12 pharmacies, and 20 medical offices that were contracted
with the Health Insurance Organization in Iran was interviewed. The framework analysis method (a qualitative
research method) was used for analysis of interviews. Atlas-Ti software was used to analyze quantitative data,
respectively. The topics were prioritized using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method through Expert
Choice software.
Results: Based on the problems extracted in our qualitative study, 12 research topics were proposed by the experts.
Among these “Design of standard treatment protocols,” “Designing model of ranking the health care centers under
contract,” and “Pathology of payment system” took the priority ranks of 1 to 3, earning the scores of 0.44, 0.42, and
0.37, respectively.
Conclusion: Considering limited resources and unlimited needs and to prevent research resource wasting,
conducting research related to health care providers in the Health Insurance Organization can help it achieve its
goals.

A water quality comprehensive evaluation was taken for the water in water supply network. It was on the basis of water supply network microcosmic model. The water quality indicators, by which the state of water quality was expressed, were chosen as the input vector for the comprehensive evaluation model. The self-organizing feature map and k-means arithmetic were taken in the model. As a result, a comprehensive water quality evaluation method was proposed for the defects of single indicator grade evaluation. And the objective water quality evaluation model of water supply water network was taken. Compared with the single-evaluation indicators, SOM can take into account the single water quality monitoring data and the overall data, and reflect the water quality distributing in the water supply network objectively.

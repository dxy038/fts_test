Multiport converters, a promising concept for hybrid power sources, have attracted increasing research interest recently. The use of a single power processing stage to interface multiple power inputs integrates power conversion for a hybrid power source. This structure removes redundant power stages that would exist in the conventional approach that uses multiple converters. The multiport structure is promising from the viewpoints of centralized control and compact packaging. The proposed basic bidirectional switching cells show several possibilities to construct a multiport converter. Several three-port topologies are discussed. Furthermore, based on the interleaving technology, topologies for higher power applications are also provided.

Objective: 
Microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin peripheral blood smear (PBS) remains as the standard
laboratory method for the diagnosis of symptomatic malaria. This study was done to compare PBS with polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) method for detecting asymptomatic malaria parasitemia.
Patients and Method: 
Blood samples were collected from 900 asymptomatic school children between 7-11 years old
in one of the provinces in the South of Iran.
Results:
 All 900 students were negative for plasmodium vivax and plasmodium falciparum by PBS. PCR method
detected DNA of P. vivax in 10 blood samples (1.1%). Specificity and negative predictive value of PCR method was
respectively 98.89% (95%CI: 98.0-99.5%), 100% (95%CI: 99.6-100%) compared to PBS as the gold standard
method. As there was no positive case by PBS method, calculation of sensitivity, positive predictive value and
likelihood ratios of the PCR method was not possible.
Conclusion: 
In comparison to PBS, expensive and prolongation PCR method is not suitable and cost effective for
identification of malaria infection in asymptomatic

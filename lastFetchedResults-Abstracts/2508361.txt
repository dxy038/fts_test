The pathobiology course was taught with attention to community oriented medical education in group A. The teacher focused on more prominent and prevalent infectious diseases in Khorasan Razavi province, but regular subjects were taught in group B. Student grades or data was then compared and analyzed by SPSS 16, mean, standard deviation, and a t-test with P&lt;0.05 for comparison, and significant levels were determined. The total grade of pathobiology in group A (with community oriented medical education) was 17.58 ± 1.28. In group B (regular education), the total grade was 17.02 ± 1.75 with t = 1.292 and P = 0.202. There were no significant differences. The specific lessons, such as infection of mycobacterium tuberculosis and gastro intestinal infections, were promoted.

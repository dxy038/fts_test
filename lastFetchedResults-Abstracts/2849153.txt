In this paper, use of Viterbi-based algorithm and spectral transition measure (STM)-based algorithm for the task of speech data labeling is being attempted. In the STM framework, we propose use of several spectral features such as recently proposed cochlear filter cepstral coefficients (CFCC), perceptual linear prediction cepstral coefficients (PLPCC) and RelAtive SpecTrAl (RASTA)-based PLPCC in addition to Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) for phonetic segmentation task. To evaluate effectiveness of these segmentation algorithms, we require manual accurate phoneme-level labeled data which is not available for low resourced languages such as Gujarati (one of the official languages of India). In order to measure effectiveness of various segmentation algorithms, HMM-based speech synthesis system (HTS) for Gujarati has been built. From the subjective and objective evaluations, it is observed that Viterbi-based and STM with PLPCC-based segmentation algorithms work better than other algorithms.

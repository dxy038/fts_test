Today, more than ever, we need engineering graduates equipped with effective design skills and a high degree of ideation competence. This paper presents results of our pilot study on improving the ideation performance of undergraduate engineers through training in TRIZ and emphasis on sketching. This is the first study of its type to rigorously test the value of TRIZ on ideation performance. Positive study findings would provide guidance to introductory and capstone design course instructors, as well industry practitioners who intend to enhance their ideation toolkits. Our objective is to test our hypotheses that TRIZ, or sketching emphasis improves design ideation alone or in combination. A series of classroom studies using investigator-developed interventions (modules) that train students in TRIZ and Sketching Importance is run. Class participants perform ideation exercises. The results of the ideation exercises are assessed and scored for Novelty, Variety and Quantity. In the paper, we document the results of the pilot experimentation. Overall, pilot studies will help fine tune the experimental approach.

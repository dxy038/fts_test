This paper is concerned with the incorporation of displacement discontinuities into a continuum theory
of elastoplasticity for the modelling of localization processes such as cracking in brittle materials.
Based on the strong discontinuity approach (SDA) (Computational Mechanics 1993; 12:277â€“296)
mesh objective 2D and 3D  nite element formulations are developed using linear and quadratic 2D
elements as well as 8-noded 3D elements. In the formulation of the  nite-element model proposed in
the paper, the analogy with standard formulations is emphasized. The parameter de ning the amplitude
of the displacement jump within the  nite element is condensed out at the material level without
employing the standard static condensation technique. This approach results in linearized constitutive
equations formally identical to continuum models. Therefore, the standard return mapping algorithm
is used to solve the non-linear equations. In analogy to concepts used in continuum smeared crack
models, a rotating formulation of the SDA is proposed in addition to the standard concept of  xed
discontinuities. It is shown, that the rotating localization approach reduces locking e ects observed in
analyses based on  xed localization directions. The applicability of the proposed SDA  nite-element
model as well as its numerical performance is investigated by means of a three-dimensional ultimate
load analysis of a steel anchor embedded in a concrete block subjected to a shear force

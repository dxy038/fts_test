A novel winding-coupled bidirectional dc/dc converter with zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) performance is proposed in this paper. In the low-voltage side, the parallel configuration is employed to share the large current and reduce the current ripple. In the high-voltage side, the series structure is adopted to sustain the high bus voltage and achieve large voltage ratio conversion. There are only two coupled inductors in the proposed interleaved bidirectional converter and their secondary windings are in series to serve as winding-coupled inductors. Furthermore, the two winding-coupled inductors can be integrated into a magnetic core to reduce the passive component numbers and improve the power density. Moreover, ZVS soft-switching operation is implemented for all the power switches to minimize the switching losses by introducing the active clamp scheme. In addition, the pulsewidth modulation plus phase-shift control strategy is employed to reduce the power MOSFET peak current and diminish the circulating losses. The duty cycle is applied to balance the voltages of both sides. The phase-shift angle is introduced to realize the power flow regulation. This decoupling control strategy is advantageous for bidirectional dc/dc conversion to realize high efficiency. Finally, a 1-kW prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed circuit.

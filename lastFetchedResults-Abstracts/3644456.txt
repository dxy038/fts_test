A novel computer-aided optimizing procedure has been developed to obtain the geometry of the magnetic electron lens that give the minimum spherical aberration coefficient <e1>Cs</e1>. The minimization of <e1>Cs </e1> is done by a simplex method in which Cs is regarded as a function of up to 11 parameters characterizing the lens geometry. In this process, <e1>Cs</e1> and other optical properties of lenses are evaluated using a high-speed FEM (finite-element method) with automatic mesh generation. The optimization procedure was applied to the design of an objective lens for a 400 kV transmission electron microscope

Since different applications have different requests, an already generated DEM does not always suit all the demands of an application. The objective of DEM generalization is the generation of a smooth surface with a lower resolution than the original data, which should preserve topographic features and be appropriate for a smaller scale relief presentation. In this paper, we take a new algorithm-3 dimensional Douglas-Peucker algorithm in DEM generalization, which is effective in data compression as in 2 dimensional form. Our test is based on a new DEM model, which is aimed to generate DEMs with high qualities. A case study is put forward to give the detail explanation. Meantime, its feasibility is described from elevation range and contours derived from generalized DEMs.

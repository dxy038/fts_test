Objective: To study the impact of ultraweb nano-fibrillar substrates on in vitro differentiation of mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells. Materials and Methods: For a duration of up to 36 days, mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cultured on an artificial basement membrane containing ultraweb nanofiber (nano+) and plates (nano ) coated with Matrigel and used growth and differentiating factors for hepatogenic differentiation. Then, to study the impact of nanofib-ers on hepatocyte differentiation, mRNA expressions for liver-specific genes (CK7, AFP, FOXa2, ALB, CYP1a1, HNF4a) were analyzed using real-time PCR , and ultrastructures of differentiated cells were evaluated using scanning and transmission electron microscope.

Results: Both experimental groups expressed mRNA of liver-specific genes in a time dependent manner. However, mRNA expression trends of liver-specific genes, especially those of FOXa2 and HNF4a, were better in the nano+ culture as compared to the nano-culture (p<0.05). Furthermore, the ultrastructures of differentiated cells in the 36 day-old nano+ culture were more mature as compared to those of the nano- group. Conclusion: The results suggest that topographical properties of the extracellular matrices produced by ultraweb nanofibers are effective for the in vitro reproduction of more differentiated MSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells.

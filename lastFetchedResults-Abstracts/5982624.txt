Computer aided group support, formally known as group support system (GSS), has been studied extensively over the last few years. This paper presents a class of GSS known as decision conferencing (DC).

DC is a two to three day process and the main purpose is to create shared understanding and commitment to action. Traditionally, DC uses simple multiattribute type modelling tool for analysis. This paper proposes a DC process, called multi-objective decision conferencing (MODC), which uses the sophisticated multi-objective type modelling tools. As an illustrative application the paper deals with a project portfolio planning problem and highlights the benefits of MODC

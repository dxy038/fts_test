Currently available electroweak data is carefully examined for internal consistency within the Standard Model (SM) framework. Scenarios of excluding/including inconsistent data are explored. An objective and plausible approach including all data is proposed in which the SM fit yields MHiggs = 185−134+251 GeV, and the 1σ contour in the Mtop vs MHiggs plane yields an upper limit of 650 GeV for the Higgs mass at 68% confidence level.

This paper deals with the implementation of a RF Doherty Power Amplifier (DPA) with the objective of improving the average efficiency. This technique is an interesting way to provide efficient PA for high PAPR signal of more recent standards of communications. The Doherty principle is applied to a 2.5GHz fully integrated PA on a CMOS 65nm technology. The DPA exhibits 23.4dBm output power, 15dB of power gain and 24.7% of PAE on a 7 dB power range. The die size is 2.89mm2. To fulfill high data rates, wide-band behavior is a big challenge. Hence the wideband behavior of integrated DPA is also investigated.

Objective: To show the frequency of tumours and tumour-like lesions in various age groups, male to female ratio and the bones commonly involved.Material and Methods: Microscopic slides, tissue paraffin blocks, clinical record and available x-rays of 271 patients whose specimens were reported between 1992 to 2001 were retrieved from the record of Pathology Department, Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) Peshawar. Of the total, 21 cases had inadequate material. The slides were reviewed by two histopathologists.Results: Results showed osteosarcoma (OSA) and Ewing's sarcoma to be the commonest malignant tumours in childhood and adolescence with the mean age of 15.3 years. Lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and giant cell tumour were the commonest malignancies in middle adulthood with the mean age of 32.2 years. In the late adulthood and old age (mean age of 51.2 years), metastatic tumours, plasma cell myeloma and chondrosarcoma were the commonest malignant bone tumours. Osteosarcoma was the commonest malignant and osteochondroma was the commonest benign bone tumour. The bones most commonly involved were femur, tibia and humerus. In male to female ratio, male preponderance was noted in most of the malignant tumours except giant cell tumour and Ewing's sarcoma.Conclusion: The study consisted of a small number of cases and was biopsy based, therefore need careful interpretation.

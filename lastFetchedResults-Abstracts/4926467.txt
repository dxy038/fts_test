The main objective of this paper is to provide an efficient tool for delineating brain tumors in three-dimensional magnetic resonance images. To achieve this goal, we use basically a region-based level-set approach and some conventional methods. Our proposed approach produces good results and decreases processing time. We present here the main stages of our system, and preliminary results which are very encouraging for clinical practice.

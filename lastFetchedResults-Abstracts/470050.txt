Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess the association between previous maternal Toxoplasma gondii (T gondii) infection and risk of fetal death.
Study design
This was a population-based prospective cohort of 29,912 pregnant women without acute T gondii infection in Norway.
Results
In the study population, 2937 (9.8%) women had evidence of previous maternal T gondii infection, and 299 (1.0%) had fetal deaths. We found no association between previous T gondii infection and risk of fetal death at ≥20 weeks of gestation. We did find a trend for an increased risk of fetal death at ≥16 and <20 weeks of gestation. However, we noted no association between previous T gondii infection and risk of fetal death at all birth weight categories (≥1000, ≥500 and <1000, and <500 g).
Conclusion
These data do not indicate an increased risk of fetal death at ≥20 weeks of gestation in women with previous maternal T gondii infection.

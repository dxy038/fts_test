This paper presents a new robot for interventions using needles. The main objective of the robot is to be able to do multi-channel biopsy, automatically conduct repeated task, and adjust the angle between the robot base and the end of macro-motion robot. In order to implement the desired functions, three modules are designed: a needle cartridge, needle positioning mechanism, and needle driving unit. The detachable needle cartridge contains six needles for five sampling, rotates itself for sampling slot change, and rotates needles for needle-tip angle change. The needle positioning mechanism is devised as a two degree of freedom spherical mechanism but not a typical hemisphere type. The needle driving unit controls two hooks which hold or release needles. The concept design for three components was created and then the prototype was made. It was confirmed that desired functions can be achieved.

Background and Objective: Paying attention to quality of life in patients with coronary heart disease due to the extent of damage and mortality is of importance. The present study investigated the role of defense styles and alexithymia on predicting quality of life in patients with coronary heart disease.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 300 patients with coronary heart disease who attended Heart Center of Shahid Ayatollah Madani Hospital in Lorestan, Iran, were selected by convenience sampling method from May to October, 2013. Data was collected using Demographic Questionnaire, Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and The MacNew Heart Disease Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) instruments. A stepwise multiple regression procedure was used for data analysis withSPSS version 19.
Results: There was no significant correlation between mature defense styles and quality of life (P=0.198).In addition, a significant (negative) correlation was found between neurotic and immature defense styles and quality of life (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, a significant (negative) correlation was found between alexithymia components and quality of life (p < 0.05). The results of multiple regression analysis showed that immature defense styles and difficulty in identifying feelings are able to predict a  reduction in quality of life in patients with coronary heart disease (p < 0.0005). 
Conclusion: Immature defense styles and difficulty in identifying feelings play an important role in predicting quality of life in patients with coronary heart disease. Therefore, in order to improve the quality of life in these patients, attention to the aforementioned variables during clinical trials with the goal of appropriate intervention will be beneficial.

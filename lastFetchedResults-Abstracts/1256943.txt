The objective of the present article is to show the influence of Khosravani Wisdom and Iranshahri’s thoughts on Arabic Literature. The subject does not seem new. What is new is our approach to it. The article claims that in addition to bold traces of Persian wisdoms in Arabic Literature, most part of more than a thousand proverbs available in Arabic literature are of Persian origin. We have first introduced historical background facilitating the way to transfer of the proverbs into Arabic literature, and then we have traced back lots of Arabic proverbs to their roots to make sure of their origins. In addition, we have also referred to Dehkhoda’s Amthal-o-Hekam for common contents of Persian and Arabic proverbs. In some cases we have carried out critical study and analysis of some Persian literary texts, resulting to the fact that the influence of Persian wisdoms and thoughts on Arabic literature goes beyond the imaginations of not only the contemporary Arab scholars but also the Persian scholars.

An optimization system based on the multi-objective evolutionary technique NSGA-II is presented to automatically size unity-gain cells, namely: voltage and current followers, and voltage and current mirrors. These unity-gain cells are optimized in three performance objectives: gain, bandwidth and offset. The proposed optimization system uses HSPICE as circuit evaluator by including input and output resistances as constraints, besides by guaranteeing that all transistors are in saturation operation.

Effective Web site design is critical to the success of e-commerce. Therefore, the evaluation and enhancement of a Web site design is of great importance. In this vein, accessibility is important and has been examined by a lot of researchers from different points of views. By and large, Web site accessibility is a structural problem and may be analytically investigated using mathematical approach. We propose a framework for representing real-world design problems as generic Web site designs, which then can be mapped into accessibility models analyzable or solvable using established analytical techniques. The framework consists of generic design and graph models, with the necessary mapping. We describe a generic Web site design using its objective and constraints, which correspond to important design requirements. By representing design problems using well-defined structures and rigorous analysis methods, this framework measures Web site accessibility using systematic and quantifiable approaches rather than qualitative ad-hoc practice. Hence, the framework facilitates the overall Web site design process, enhances design quality, and increases ease of analysis, implementation and continuous improvement.

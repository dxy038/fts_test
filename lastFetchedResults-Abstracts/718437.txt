During the course of our investigations in the field of azole antimicrobial agents, we have identified BM212 a pyrrole derivative with goodin vitro activity againstmycobacteria andcandidae. These findings prompted us to prepare new pyrrole derivatives 2â€“6 in the hope of increasing the activity. The microbiological data showed interstingin vitro activity againstMycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria.

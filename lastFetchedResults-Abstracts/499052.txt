In previous article of Disaster Assessment 1, all definitions, frameworks, principles, and types of assessment were surveyed based on the time of implementation and were described their related areas. Also it mentioned that assessment is divided into two parts such as:

• Initial Rapid Assessment

• Detailed Assessment

Initial Rapid Assessment is essential in disasters because it provides the most important data and needed information. This information is important because some reasons: first it is so valid and can be useful for managers; then it helps managers to make best decisions especially when they are suffering from the lack of needed information in the time of emergency.

Thus, it's necessary to discuss one of the most important types of assessment in an objective form.

Although, pleural (PT) and disseminated tuberculosis (DT) have been considered as extreme endpoints of the Th1â€“Th2 immunological spectrum of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, these conditions can occur together. The presence of PT and DT could be explained by (1) PT as primary condition, with progression of HIV infection possibly leading to dissemination of bacilli located in the pleura; (2) preexisting PT, with reinfection at lower LTCD4+ count explaining the DT form; (3) simultaneous acute PT and DT, considering immune compartmentalization phenomena in pleura. There are several important aspects of the immune response and its compartmentalization in co-infected patients with tuberculosis and HIV. PT and DT should not be always considered as extremes of the immunological response against M. tuberculosis, both diseases together may be explained after the understanding of compartmentalization of immune response. Associations between these entities are not so rare, while they remain incompletely explained. This brief review discusses several points of this contradictory association.

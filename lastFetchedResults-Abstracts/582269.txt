Objective: Crime is an undesirable social phenomenon. Crime commitment
and its growth threaten economic and social security. Crime leads to security
enhancement and disciplinary costs, and social and private costs, as well, and
as a result it leads to reduction in social welfare. The present article aims at
reviewing and analyzing the impact of economic motivation on committing
crime.

collecting the required information of the research. N=340 including all the
criminals of "Semnan Central Prison" who arrested by police because of committing
various crimes. The sample includes 125 prisoners calculated and
achieved through using Cockran formula. SPSS is used for statistical analysis
of the research findings.
Findings: Findings of the study indicated that the impact of achieving a better
social situation, poverty, income limitations, and crime commitment record
in the past cannot be ignored (95% assurance). The issue is confirmed
in terms of economy and based on the research history and from statistics
point of view. The descriptive statistics of sample data indicated that 60% of
the criminals do not hold high school diploma, and 66% of them are between15 
and 35. The information indicates that low education level and being young

enhances the probability of individuals' contribution in criminal activities.

and confirmation of the direct and significant relationship between economic
factors such as crime and low income with crime commitment rate, and offering

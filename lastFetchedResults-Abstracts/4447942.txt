Two types of DC-DC converters are compared. These converters are constructed on the basis of a single-phase bridge and a single-phase half-bridge of cells´ circuits in the multichannel system. Each channel contains a single-phase VSI, a high-frequency transformer, an active single-phase rectifier on the basis of a turned VSI. At the input the channels are connected consistently, and at the output - in parallel or independently. The channels also contain a three-phase VSI the output of which is connected to the induction machine. The variant of bidirectional transformer less step-down DC-DC ladder converter is also considered. The comparison is based on the results of converters´ simulation in the program PSIM.

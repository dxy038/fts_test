Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the cause of 43% of the peripheral lymphadenopathy cases in developing
countries. However, psoas abscesses are usually secondary to the extension of infection from an adjacent site. In the
present study, we describe a case of abdominal and cervical lymphadenopathy and multiple abscesses due to
mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Patient: A 55 years old man with ahdominal and cervical lymphadenopathy, psoas muscle sheath abscess and a large
abscess of abdominal wall was admitted. Vertebral column was intact and the patient didn't have imrnunodeficiencv or
history of illicit drug use. Analysis of aspirated pus with PCR for mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive, however,
Ziehl-Neelsen and gram staining was negative. Culture of pus was positive for mycobacterium. Treatment vas
commenced with 4 drug antituberculosis regimen. During the treatment period, paradoxical reaction occurred and
prednisolone was administered. Following 9 months of treatment, the abscesses resolved and the patient recovered
completely.
Conclusion: our patient presented with a group of uncommon extrapulmonary presentations including Gl involvement,
paraaortic lymphadenopathy and abscess formation secondary to tuberculosis that was aroused without any
immunodeficiency context with hematogenous origin. He respondedwell to our therapeutic protocol.

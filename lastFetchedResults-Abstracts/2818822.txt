The objective of this paper is to increase the lifetime of the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) through balancing the energy of the sensors and reducing the number of transmissions. Sensor nodes are limited in power. It is difficult to recharge the battery of sensor. Utilization of energy efficiently is the main issue of WSN. Clustering and Aggregation are the energy efficient methods of WSN. Hence we propose an Efficient Cluster Head Selection and Aggregation (ECSHA) algorithm to minimize energy consumption. Cluster head selection is based on the number of neighbors, residual energy and distance of a node from the centre of the cluster. And also we propose a filter based approach for reducing the number of transmissions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher energy efficiency and increases network lifetime.

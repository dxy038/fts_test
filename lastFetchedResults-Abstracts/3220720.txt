This work studies the problem of CMOS operational amplifiers (op-amps) optimization. A front Pareto based-MOGA (Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm) methodology is proposed to optimize the operational amplifier. The proposed approach is used to find the optimal dimensional transistor parameters in order to obtain operational amplifier performances for analog and mixed CMOS-based circuit applications. To evaluate the proposed approach, an example in both time and frequency domains for a two-stage CMOS Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) is presented in 0.18&#181;m process. The simulation results confirm the efficiency of MOGA in determining the device sizes in an analog circuit.

Background
Information regarding compliance with infection control precautions in the dental settings in the Middle East is scant.
Objective

To examine the knowledge and practices in infection control among dental staff and dental nurses at a university teaching dental center.
Methods

A self-administered, confidential questionnaire concerning various aspects of infection control knowledge and practices was distributed to 48 dental staff and 28 dental nurses working at the Jordan University of Science and Technology Dental Teaching Center.
Results

Responses came from 37 (77%) dental teaching staff members and 23 (82%) dental nurses. Of the dental staff participants, 95% received hepatitis B immunization in comparison with 87% of the dental nurses. Dental nurses were more prone to percutaneous dental injuries (P < .05). In both groups, 100% reported routine wearing of gloves. Although the dental staff reported a statistically higher frequency of washing hands before gloving (46%), dental nurses reported a higher frequency of washing hands after removing the gloves (100%). Dental staff reported statistically higher frequency of routine mask use (43%) than dental nurses (30%).
Conclusion

Compliance with recommended guidelines for control of cross infection varied among the 2 tested groups. A need exists for proper practice of infection control by both dental staff and dental nurses.

MATLAB is an important tool incorporated in numerous engineering curricula, particularly in signal processing and control system related courses. However, it could be a challenge to have unlimited access to it on a limited budget. The objective of this presentation is to suggest possible free alternatives to MATALB for electronics engineering undergraduate curricula. The alternatives are not limited to what may be called clones of MATLAB, but they include applets available for free on the Internet

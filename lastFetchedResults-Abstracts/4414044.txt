This Paper describes a method of generating two phase supply for two phase inductor motor. The novelty of scheme is a simple algorithm and the scheme can be fabricated as integrator chip iS2MC. Matrix converter (MC) technology is already used in industrial applications, but is limited to three-phase induction motor with three-phase power line. It has no limit on output frequency due to the fact that it uses semiconductor switches with controlled turn-off capability. The circuit which consists of 8 bidirectional switches, enables a two-phase induction motor to be driven by single-phase power line without smoothing capacitors The MC generates independent two-phase voltages controlled by a simple switching algorithm, Two-phase motor driven by MC eliminates start-run capacitors and generates more torque than the three-phase motor. The performance of the system with symmetrical two-phase induction motor was confirmed by simulation.

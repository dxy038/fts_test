Nanofluid is a heat transfer fluid that can improve the performance of heat exchanger systems. Different parameters such as particle size, shape, and volume concentration affect the performance of these systems. The objective of this paper is to study the effect of different nanoparticle shapes (such as cylindrical, bricks, blades, platelets, and spherical) on the performance of a shell and tube heat exchanger operating with nanofluid analytically. Boehmite alumina (Î³-AlOOH) nanoparticles of different shapes were dispersed in a mixture of water/ethylene glycol as the nanofluid. The thermodynamic performance of the shell and tube heat exchanger that is used in a waste heat recovery system was analysed in terms of heat transfer rate and entropy generation. Established correlations were used to measure the thermal conductivity, heat transfer coefficient and rate and entropy generation of nanofluid. The results show an increase in both the heat transfer and thermodynamic performance of the system. However, among the five nanoparticle shapes, cylindrical shape exhibited better heat transfer characteristics and heat transfer rate. On the other hand, entropy generation for nanofluids containing cylindrical shaped nanoparticles was higher in comparison with the other nanoparticle shapes. However, the increased percentage of entropy was below 1%. Therefore, this greater entropy generation could be deemed negligible and cylindrical shaped nanoparticles are recommended to be utilized in heat exchanger systems working with nanofluids.

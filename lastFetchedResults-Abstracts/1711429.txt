Nowadays most of the organizations are faced with a challenge resulting from knowledge and skills loss of human resources. Usually this knowledge is undocumented and the skills require years of training and experience to acquire. This loss may be caused by a variety of factors including retirement, internal transfers or resignation of employees. The main objective of this research is to develop a model based on knowledge management and risk management approaches. In this model the aim is to identify any kind of knowledge that faces with loss, based on risk assessment approach. Afterwards, it will be managed by developing some plans and therefore the knowledge loss risk will be reduced.
The suggested model has been implemented in an industrial plant. The results showed that after a year of implementing it, the job positions that faced with losing, are reduced by 88 percent. The research methodology can be applied in a variety of organizations by some modification.

The possible effects of radiofrequency (RF) exposure on the genetic material of cells are very important to determine since DNA damage of somatic cells may be linked to cancer development. The first objective of our studies was to study the complete R-banded karyotype of cultured human amniotic cells exposed to RF similar to those emitted by mobile phones of second generation (GSM). Our second objective was to investigate whether the GSM-exposure may induce aneuploidy by FISH (Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization) using the same probes as those used by Mashevich et al. (2003) and Mazor et al. (2008).

The authors consider the control of a bidirectional C&#711;uk converter. They analyze the generation of sinusoidal power waveforms in the converter output using time varying sliding surfaces and considering the reference signal as locally constant. The investigation shows that sliding mode controlled bidirectional converters can be used as the basis for new power amplifiers or sinusoidal inverters in the range of 0-1 kHz of bandwidth

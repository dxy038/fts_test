This research aims to investigate working women's attitude toward participation in decision making process at Karaj education organization. The core objective of the research lies in knowledge, information access, power and reward factors to promote and persuade women toward participation activities in a seven-stage decision making process. Among 137 women who are working in various staff departments of the organization, 80 of them were selected randomly.

The results of the research demonstrate that the rate of organizational readiness in light of women's knowledge for participating in decision making process is available, but in view of power and reward, the readiness of this sample society is low. In addition, women with higher knowledge could be effectively participated in implementing decisions, through gaining access to further information in selecting an optimal solution, with further power in evaluating alternatives, as well as by receiving a further rate of reward that could be effective and useful in persuading participation at the stage of diagnosis of problems. It is suggested that further participation should be offered to women with higher knowledge in decision making process. Particularly, at the stage of decision implementation in an educational system and to provide necessary facilities for their acquiring further knowledge. Through delegation of authority, power sharing, note to materialistic and abstractive rewards as well as dissemination of information in all organizational levels could be provided further possibility of participation for women in decision making process. This point has also been mentioned in the fourth economic plan act. Thus in-depth assessment of these policies aiming at formulating women's participation policy is recommended in the fifth economic, social and cultural development act.

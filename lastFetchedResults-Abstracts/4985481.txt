WiMAX presents a very challenging multiuser communication problem: Different users in same geographic area requiring high on-demand data rates in a finite bandwidth with low latency. To make resource allocation more practical, in mobile WiMAX instead of individual subcarriers a group of them is allocated to different users in both frequency and time. There are several ways to allocate subchannels in mobile WiMAX, three for downlink: FUSC (Fully Utilised Subchannelisation), PUSC (Partially Utilised Subchannelisation) and AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding). This paper aims to study the performance of low complexity adaptive resource allocation in downlink of OFDMA for WiMAX systems with variable rate requirements. Objective of the proposed algorithm is to maximize total throughput while maintaining rate proportionality among the users. The proposed algorithm prioritizes the user with the high sensitivity to the subcarrier allocation. Simulation results shows that proposed method performs better than previous method in terms of significantly decreasing the computational complexity and achieve higher capacities, while being applicable to a more general class of systems.

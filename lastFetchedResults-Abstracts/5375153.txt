With the booming of multimedia services, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the evolved Multimedia Multicast/Broadcast Service (e-MBMS) feature for LTE systems. The main objective of MBMS is to introduce real broadcast distribution capabilities into cellular systems. This purposed 3GPP to introduce the MBMS over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) operation. In this work we investigate the provision of MBMS service over a combination of MBSFN and PTM transmission schemes. We focus on the file repair procedure, because the distribution of binary data via MBMS must result in 100% error-free downloaded files. In order to achieve this goal, MBMS offers a Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanism. Our simulation results show that there are some file repair schemes that achieve better performance as far as different network configurations are concerned. Furthermore, we compare all the file recovery methods and evaluate them against various network parameters in a realistic simulation environment.

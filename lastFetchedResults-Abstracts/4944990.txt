In this paper, the primary objective is to discuss the details of scalable methods for distributing certificate revocation lists and other large files using vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications while taking advantage of the multi-channel operations in IEEE 1609.4. We also discuss the results from a simulation study using the ns-3 network simulator to closely replicate the WAVE environment discussed in the IEEE 802.11p and 1609 draft standards. Realistic vehicle traces were used in the simulation study. The results show that the methods developed in this research scale very well for increasing vehicle densities.

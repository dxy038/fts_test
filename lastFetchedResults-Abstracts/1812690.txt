Suramin is a polysulfonated compound currently under investigation for the treatment of various types of cancer. Pharmacokinetic studies from clinical trials in humans have shown that most of the circulating drug is associated with serum albumin. The objective of the present study was to investigate the intracellular localization of suramin and serum albumin in human colon cancer cells (HT-29-D4) upon suramin treatment. For this purpose, combined gold labeling and autoradiographic methods were performed on HT-29-D4 cells grown in serum free medium containing both [3H]suramin and colloidal goldalbumin. These morphological experiments demonstrated for the first time that suramin and serum albumin were co-localized in the same cellular compartment (i.e. the lysosomal system) of the suramin-treated HT-29-D4 cells. The albumin-directed targeting of suramin in lysosomes may allow the drug to inhibit the activity of several lysosomal hydrolases. resulting in a lysosomal storage disorder.

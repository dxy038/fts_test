An enhanced version of hardware accelerated QoT estimation tool in impairment-aware optical network to support Cloud Computing is designed and evaluated against the different number of lightpaths and wavelengths per link. It outperforms the software version by 28 times in the order of millisecond for a single computation, and up to 3 times more for multiple computations. It sharply decreases the lightpath assessment time and accelerates lightpath provisioning with the objective of making it suitable for incorporation in a dynamic and realtime environment. It enables Cloud Computing based timing critical applications which need fast response and low delay.

The objective of this paper is to compare two competitive methods of glottal closure instants (GCIs) detection from the speech signal. The two methods are the Multiscale Product (MPM) and Dynamic Programming Phase Slope Algorithm (DYPSA). MPM is based on peaks detection in the product of wavelet transform at three adjacent scales, DYPSA is based on dynamic programming applied on the group delay function. Performance comparison of MPM and DYPSA method is made on Keele University database. We show that GCI estimation by MPM is more precise than DYPSA.

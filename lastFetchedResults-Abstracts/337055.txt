Recent results strengthen evidence that CD1-restricted T cells play important roles in host defense against microbial infections. Human subjects recently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis  showed elevated responses to CD1c-mediated presentation of a microbial lipid antigen, compared with control donors. Activation of CD1d-restricted NKT cells with a synthetic glycolipid antigen results in improved immune responses to several infectious pathogens.

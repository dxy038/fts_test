A new algorithm is proposed to render the earth with atmospheric effects, in which the light intensity is analyzed and divided into three parts that can be calculated individually. Satellite remote sensing data is used to be inverted to ground bidirectional reflectance model. Texture of surface reflectance, optical depth, emissivity and temperature is generated in the phase of data processing, which is applied to GPU-based real-time rendering system. Thus light interacting effect between ground and atmosphere is realized. The method is proved to render the scene more realistic and immersive, and shows high efficiency and flexibility for complex application.

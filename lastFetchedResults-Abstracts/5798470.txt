Image enhancement is basically improving the interpretability or perception of information in images for human viewers and providing `betterÂ´ input for other automated image processing techniques. The principal objective of image enhancement is to modify attributes of an image to make it more suitable for a given task and a specific observer. This work addresses the implementation of image enhancement algorithms like brightness control, contrast adjustment and histogram equalization on FPGA that have become a competitive alternative for high-performance digital signal processing applications. With the advent of mobile embedded multimedia devices that are required to perform a range of multimedia tasks, especially image processing tasks, the need to design efficient and high performance image processing systems in a short time-to-market schedule needs to be addressed. Hence, the Image enhancement algorithms implemented in hardware have emerged as the most viable solution for improving the performance of image processing systems. The proposed work gives the implementation of efficient image enhancement algorithms on Field programmable gate array (FPGA) using Matlab Simulink.

Metal carbonyl thionitrosyls are potentially accessible by reactions of metal carbonyl anions and related nucleophiles with N3S3Cl3 as illustrated by the reported synthesis of (η5-C5H5)Cr(NS)(CO)2 from N3S3Cl3 and NaCr(CO)3(η5-C5H5). Related manganese carbonyl thionitrosyls provide the opportunity to examine the behavior of the NS ligand in both mononuclear and binuclear systems that have a reasonable chance of experimental realization by related synthetic methods. In this connection the two low energy structures for Mn2(NS)2(CO)7 are a doubly NS-bridged structure and an unbridged (OC)5Mn–Mn(NS)2(CO)2 structure. A triply bridged Mn2(NS)2(CO)7 structure analogous to the experimental triply bridged Fe2(CO)9 structure is not found at competitive energies. The lowest energy structures for the unsaturated Mn2(NS)2(CO)n (n = 6, 5) all have a five-electron donor bridging η2-NS group, showing the propensity of a bridging NS group to bond to metals through both the nitrogen and sulfur atoms. The lowest energy Mn2(NS)2(CO)6 structure of this type is a particularly attractive synthetic objective since it lies at least 15 kcal/mol below any other Mn2(NS)2(CO)6 structures.

An objective of the present paper is to perform a comparative analysis of the operation of large-scale ion optics in sources based on glow and arc discharges. It is known that the generation of uniform plasma is quite possible and easier to achieve in sources based on hollow cathode glow discharges, this promoting the attainment of broad ion beams. However, results of performed analysis show, that, when the screen electrode of the ion optics is a part of the glow-discharge cathode, the presence of the cathode sheath with a potential drop of about several hundreds of volts, which is characteristic of glow discharges, causes a decrease in maximum current through the beam formation system having some preset parameters. Nevertheless, the attainment of a certain preset current density is quite possible with the application of higher total accelerating voltage. Another possible way of increasing the current density is the reduction of the potential drop between the screen electrode and the discharge plasma

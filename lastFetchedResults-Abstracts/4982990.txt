The use of wireless sensor network in the smart traffic control systems is very beneficial and starting to be very promising in the design and implementation for such systems. It will help in saving people time and adapt the intersections traffic lights to the traffic loads from each direction. In this paper we present an intelligent traffic signals control system based on a wireless sensor network (WSN). It uses the vehicle queue length during red cycle to perform better control in the next green cycle. The main objective is to minimize the average waiting time that will reduce the queues length and do better traffic management based on the arrivals in each direction. The system also includes an approach to alert the people about the red light crossing to minimize the possibility of accidents due to red light crossing violations. The system was simulated and results are shown in the end of this paper.

In a direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) based cellular network, meeting the diverse quality of service (QoS) needs of mobile hosts (MHs) is a challenge because of the fluctuations in the quality of the wireless channel. The QoS needs of the MHs application are modelled using a service curve. Furthermore, a notion of deviation is introduced as a measure of meeting the service curve. The paper describes a forward link scheme whose primary objective is to minimize system deviation from the service curve and the secondary objective is to maximize the system throughput. The solution includes constraints on the transmit power of the base station (BS), number of spreading codes and target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the MHs.

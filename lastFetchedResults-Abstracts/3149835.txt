Knowledge is the unique matter for human, and the evolution of human knowledge is the actual reflection of objective world. The knowledge evolution theory studied by the scientific philosopher has made a macroscopic description for knowledge evolution, which enjoys the identical part of the theory of evolution from Darwinian, and also has the difference. Based on the thoughts of knowledge evolution, the paper establishes the model for knowledge evolution system, and illustrates the process and evaluation function of evolution algorithm. It mainly divides the operators of knowledge evolution into inheritance operator, innovation operator and inspection operator. Finally, it sets some examples to demonstrate that the knowledge evolution algorithm is a new type differing from the theory of evolution used for knowledge discovering and perfection.

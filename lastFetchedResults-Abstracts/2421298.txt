Background and objective: Laboratory wastes are produced in small, but varied quantities. These wastes need to be managed correctly. Consequently, this research has undertaken a quantitative and qualitative assessment and management of the laboratory wastes of Zakaria Razi Laboratory Complex in Tehran Science Research Branch Islamic Azad University.
Methods: This study, primarily with the help of interviews, determined the most productive laboratories of the Complex, which then led to the selection of two educational laboratories and two research laboratories for qualitative and quantitative sampling. After sampling which the samples were catalogued according to the four categories of corrosive, toxic, flammable and reactive. 
Results: The findings of this research show that 54% of the hazardous waste of the research laboratories is flammable and in the educational laboratories 56% of the waste produced is corrosive.
Conclusion: In most of the laboratories in this complex (88%), a list of the hazardous waste produced is not compiled and stored, and in all but 16% of the laboratories where hazardous waste is disposed after being secured in appropriate containers, this waste is poured into the drain without any proper management. A list of produced wastes in each laboratory is required to be prepared, using the laboratory operator's assistance.

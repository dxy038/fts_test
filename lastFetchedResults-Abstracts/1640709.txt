The objective of this research was to optimise the rheological parameters, hardened properties, and setting times of cement grouts containing metakaolin (MTK), viscosity-modifying agent (VMA) and superplasticiser (SP). All mixes were made with water-to-binder ratio (W/B) of 0.40. The replacement of cement by MTK was varied from 6% to 20% (by mass), and dosages of SP and VMA were varied from 0.3% to 1.4%, and 0.01% and 0.06% (by mass of binder), respectively. Increased SP led to an increase in fluidity, reduction in flow time, plate cohesion, rheological parameters, and an increase in the setting times. Increased VMA demonstrated a reduction in fluidity, an increase in Marsh cone time, plate cohesion, yield stress, and plastic viscosity. Results indicate that the use of MTK increased yield stress, plastic viscosity, cohesion plate, and flow time due to the higher surface area associated with an increase in the water demand. MTK reduced mini-slump and setting times, and improved compressive strength.

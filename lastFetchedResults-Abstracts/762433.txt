Background & Objective: Behavior management of preschool children and disabled children is a challenge for dental students and dentists in dental clinics. This challenge affects the quality and quantity of the treatment options and in some cases the parents are not satisfied with the treatments. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dental treatment under sedation and general anesthesia, as a novel method, in improvement of quality and quantity of education of dental students. This was achieved by the evaluation of acceptance and satisfaction of the parents of pediatric patients.
Methods: In this descriptive and cross-sectional study in Kerman School of Dentistry, Iran, 30 children and adolescents, 4.5 to 16 years of age, who had not been admitted to the dental clinics, received dental treatments under general anesthesia and by use of nitrous oxide at the department of pediatric dentistry. Then, the acceptance and satisfaction of their parents were evaluated by a questionnaire. The data were analyzed by SPSS 16 software and descriptive statistic methods.
Results: The data showed more than 80% of the parents were satisfied and believed that their children did not have anxiety in comparison to previous visits (96% of them gave 8-10 scores). Most treatments were tooth restoration and tooth extraction.
Conclusion: This procedure, as a novel educational method, is comfortable for pediatric patients and satisfies their parents, so it is recommendable for educational dental clinics.

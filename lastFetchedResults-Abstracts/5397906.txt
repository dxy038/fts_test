The grid has appeared recently as a new computing paradigm. However, to make the use of the grid available to the scientific community, frameworks that enable to easily write applications and to run them efficiently in the grid should be provided. GRID superscalar has been specially designed to satisfy the two requirements mentioned above. This paper presents an implementation of a biological application, fastDNAml, using GRID superscalar. The objective is not only to demonstrate the performance that can be achieved, but the programmability of the framework. The description contains details of the fastDNAml implementation, new features of GRID superscalar and summary of results obtained.

This work describes and evaluates an integrated system of computing information technologies to support the data mining and knowledge discovery of qualitative data collected from groups with diverse objectives and multiple, possibly conflicting criteria. The system provides a method and supporting infrastructure to produce a shared view and common objective based on the data collected, hence managing effectively a conflict situation. This multidisciplinary research combines social scientific fields of conflict resolution, group dynamics, social psychology, and sociology with current knowledge in computer technology, decision sciences, database development, data mining and data fusion. The goal is to build human and information systems that maintain the human-in-the-loop, but provide for more efficacious decision support and collaborative resolution and planning. By combining an action evaluation (AE) Web based elicitation process with database management system and searching schemes, an integrated platform is developed to collaboratively reach consensus and resolve conflicts. The system was implemented and validated with actual projects. Qualitative assessment of its effectiveness and use was also carried out. Conclusions derived from this experience are made in order to improve the systemÂ´s design and future development.

This study examines the factors of human activities causing environmental stresses on the subsurface environments in the urban settings of Jakarta. A major objective of this study is to identify the basin geometry and estimate how critical is the degradation of the subsurface environment within the basin, and it covered micro-palaeontology and chemical analyses, the decrease of water level, and GPS data. New data on shallow groundwater quality is provided and the results indicate strong evidence for human activities have influenced the degradation of the Jakarta subsurface environment.

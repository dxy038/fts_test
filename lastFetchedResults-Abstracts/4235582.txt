Along with the development of bandwidth consuming services, fiber optic is being widely used, especially in the metro core networks. Many solutions have been proposed for designing optical network topology. However these solutions neither focus on all-optical network nor fault tolerance issue. This paper proposes a solution for designing physical topology of optical metro core networks with the objective of (i) ensuring traffic requirements between the network nodes, (ii) minimizing fiber cost, and (iii) assuring the network survivability. The numerical results show that the proposed solution satisfies those objectives and save more fiber than existing solutions.

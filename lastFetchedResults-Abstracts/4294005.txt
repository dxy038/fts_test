The optimization model of container shipping of sea-carriage based on fuzzy linear programming is established to maximize the profit of a shipping company. The objective function is to maximize the shipping profit. The variables include the number of heavy and empty containers shipped by lines, the shortage number of heavy containers and the renting number of empty containers from requiring ports. The constraints include meeting the need of heavy and empty containers required, weight and volume limit to lines and supplying ability for empty containers The number of empty containers supplied and storaged is fuzzy. The fuzzy programming is translated to an integer programming and Lingo 9.0 is used to solve the model. Simulation is done under varied parameters to show the effectiveness of the model to optimize the shipping plan. The model can be used to optimize container shipping plan of sea-carriage to a shipping company and raise its profit.

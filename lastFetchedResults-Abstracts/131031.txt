Objective: Past studies reported that dermatophytosis due to geophylic dermatophytes was limited to tinea capitis. However, recent research shows that this fungi may cause a broad range of different clinical manifestations such as tinea capitis, tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea unguium and systemic form. From an epidemiological point of view, it is more important to recognize the keratinophilic fungi and geophilic dermatophytes as well as the frequency of them in soil. Based on this, the present research has been conducted on soil of the 16 regions including cities and villages of Isfahan.
Material and Methods: 800 soil samples have been collected during 1997 and 1998. In order to isolate geophyilic dermatophtes and keratinophilic fungi, the keratin baiting technique was applied.
Results: 588(73.5%) samples had dermatophytes and keratinophilic fungi. The present study recognized 727 species including 12 species of 11 genus as follows: chrysosporium (80.6%), M.gypseum (12.4%), sepedonium (3.3%0), Malbranchia (1%), T.terrestre (0.8%), T.ajelloii and paecliomyces (0.4%), E. album and Acremonium (0.3%), Curvularia, Fusarium and Ulocladium (0.1%). The species most found was in khonsar city, while the species least was for Ardestan. Most microsporum gypseum species were detected from region with seminomadic and temperate climate (47.6%). We also found 45.7% keratinophilic fungi from the soil samples with pH: 7.01-8. This study, isolated engyodontiurn album opportunistic fungus for the first time in this country (IRAN). Engyodontium album is recognized in causing keratitis, cerebral abscess, endocarditis and vesicular eczema.
Conclusion: Finally, the study revealed that the soil of Isfahan province is rich in geophilic dermatophytes and keratinophilic fungi.

Space programs, in general, present a long development schedule, in which diverse phases must be sequentially fulfilled. One of them is Assembly, Integration and Tests (AIT). The satellite AIT activities are a logical and interrelated sequence of events mechanical, electrical and environmental tasks. The main objective in this phase of development of space program is to achieve a high degree of confidence that the satellite complies with his operational objectives, survival to the launch environment, and correct operation during the designed satellite lifetime can be achieved. In order to reach this goal it is necessary to set forth an AIT Quality Program which applies and coordinates at least the following main points control of status of test facilities and means of support, strict control to the test execution, formal test analysis and review of test results, ensuring that the Satellite will be free of latent defects. This paper presents a Brazilian experience on AIT quality assurance, at system level, gets through satellite AIT activities executed at Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) Integration and Testing Laboratory (LIT) the largest satellite testing lab in the South Hemisphere. The paper contains the LIT AIT QA organization; logbooks and records used, system AIT QA main tasks, launch Base and GSE related issues, resuming the lessons learned with system AIT QA activities executed with success at LIT with Brazilian and international satellite programs.

After a period of architectural modernism and discussions about the design of homogeneous architecture around the world, many critics of this style were introduced. Many architects and designers like Le Corbusier believed that modern architecture can be replicated all over the world in bulk and just principles of modernism and its functions are important. On the other hand, critics raised the issue of national identity and architectural identity as opposed to the theory of homogeneous architecture. In this regard, some of these architects see sign of identity in specific objective imitation of a work of architecture; others use symbols of architectural history of a land and some just seek a sense of a historical space in order to bring back the architectural identity. But how the architect defines this matter depends on his own identity roots and as a consequence of globalization, Architects like most people in the world now develop a bicultural characteristic, in which part of their identity is rooted in their local culture while another part stems from an awareness of their relation to the global culture. So what is national identity and in which human characteristics is it rooted? How can we create a unique architectural identity and what could be the role of the architect’s thoughts in this process? In this paper we will discuss the reason of introduction of concepts like identity in art and architecture by studying some of the characteristics of human behavior then we will prove the importance of the architect’s thoughts as the main and free factor that chooses the path to the formation of an architectural identity.

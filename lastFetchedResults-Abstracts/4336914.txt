Recent advancements in the design, fabrication and packaging of micro electro-mechanical (MEM) sensors with embedded computing and wireless communication capabilities have made positive impacts on persistent surveillance of large areas in hostile conditions. We outline a set of core capabilities required of smart sensors to establish their precise-location and perform collaborative sensing to gain and maintain maximum situation awareness. Such features include: CORDIC structured computations, direction selective transmission and reception through RF-MEMS, chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC), infra structure assisted sensing, among others. Then we outline several system-level considerations such as: command, control, collaborative &amp; cognitive computation and communication, and offer an end-user perspective of intelligent sensors in mission oriented sensor networks. The objective is to provide insights into the critical challenges for increasing the effectiveness of future sensor networks. We use a hypothetical counter-sniper system as an example to concretely emphasize the value of such features.

This paper presents the use of analogical learning, in particular case-based reasoning, for the automatic generation of prosody from text, which is automatically tagged with prosodic features. This is a corpus-based method for quantitative modelling of prosody to be used in a Spanish text to speech system. The main objective is the development of a method for predicting the three main prosodic parameters: the fundamental frequency (F0) contour, the segmental duration and energy. Both objective and subjective experiments have been conducted in order to evaluate the accuracy of our proposal.

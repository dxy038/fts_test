The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive analysis of the resolving capability of diffraction tomography using finite-size receiving apertures based on the span of spatial spectral coverage. The analysis is performed on both the transmission and reflection modes, and can be generalized into various data acquisition configurations. In addition, the analysis provides an important link to other tomographic systems such as the classical X-ray tomography and synthetic aperture radar systems

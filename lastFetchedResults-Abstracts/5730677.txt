Human negligence and human error have become the primary cause for train accidents in India. The objective of the paper is to eliminate train accidents by exploiting surveillance. Each locomotive is equipped with an automated surveillance system. The train tracks in railway network are segmented and given with distinct track numbers which are read by surveillance system inside the locomotive. This track number will be shared with neighbour trains using Radio Frequency Communication by the surveillance system. The system then compares its track number with neighbour train track numbers. On locating same track numbers, steps are taken by the surveillance system to caution the concerned motorman in order to stop the train and avoid mishaps. The paper proposes specific way of numbering the train tracks in segments. Also a communication protocol is proposed to ensure data transfer among Radio Frequency transceivers of the systems under half duplex mode.

In this paper, the geometrical theory of diffraction is used to establish mathematical model for calculating the isolation of parabolic reflector antenna, and set up the objective function of the layout optimization. The method of genetic algorithm combining with high-frequency electromagnetic simulation to realize the optimization of antenna layout is described in detail. The results of satellite antenna layout optimization show that this method is effective in the optimal design of satellite antenna layout for the purpose of electromagnetic compatibility.

The authors describe a SONET (synchronous optical network) architecture called NICENET (NEC´s Intelligent Communication Enhanced Network). The objective is the realization of intelligent networks characterized by flexibility, survivability, and manageability. The intelligent NE´s (network elements) and their network management system allow the creation of flexible networks. In order to realize the survivability, self-healing networks are intensively exploited. Integrated network management over SONET NE´s provides a high degree of manageability, where unified user interfaces, database and management interfaces are to be realized. In the design of the network management system, an object-oriented approach is taken so that a high software productivity and customer definability can be achieved

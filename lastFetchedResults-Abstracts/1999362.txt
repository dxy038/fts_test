Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the canonical correlation of the relationship between the social support and absence of motivation of 2nd and 3rd grade high school students in physical education activities.
Methodology: The method of study was descriptive–correlation, and field survey. 381 students among 2nd and 3rd high school students of Bookan city were chosen through multi-level cluster random sampling. They filled in interpersonal behavior scale of Pelletier et.al (2008) with the reliability (?=.81), and questionnaire of absence of motivation in physical education of Shen et.al (2010) with reliability (?=.78). Data was analyzed with Canonical Correlation method.
Results: The results showed that there was a negative significant relationship between autonomy support with insufficient values of activities (r=-0.130, p?0.05), and unappealing activities (r=-0.166, p?0.05). Competence support had a negative significant relationship with deficient ability (r=-0.135, p?0.05), deficient effort (r=-0.133, p?0.05), insufficient values of activities (r=-0.197, p?0.01), and unappealing activities (r=-0.202, p?0.01). Relatedness support had a negative significant relationship with deficient ability (r=-0.110, p?0.05), deficient effort (r=-0.108, p?0.05), insufficient values of activities (r=-0.157, p?0.01), and unappealing activities (r=-0.178, p?0.01). Also, canonical correlation showed a significant set between social support and students’ lack of motivation, that is, set of social support predicted set of students’ lack of motivation (0.19).
Conclusion: Physical education teachers, who provide supportive environment for students, can influence students’ motivation, and increase their participation at physical education activities.

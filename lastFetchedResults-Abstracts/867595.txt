This paper addresses the problems of selection and scheduling related to a virtual organisation in which a
central service broker communicates with groups of service providers offering services of different types.
Our objective is to show that these problems can be formulated in a precise manner and that well-established
algorithms can be developed for solving them. Especially, Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing
with Variable Neighbourhood search are proposed as options for finding near-optimal solutions to the
selection and scheduling problems. In our computational experiments, the algorithms were first validated
with the help of benchmark job-shop problems and then applied to a specific cutting stock problem
with randomly generated instances.

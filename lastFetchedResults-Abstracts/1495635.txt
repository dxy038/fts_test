The yield of rainfed crops is commonly limited by the availability of soil water during the summer growing season. Channels produced by cover crop roots in fall/winter when soils are relatively moist may facilitate the penetration of compacted soils by subsequent crop roots in summer when soils are relatively dry and hard. Our objective was to determine the effects of fall cover crops on maize (Zea mays) growth and soil water status under three levels (high, medium, and no) of imposed traffic compaction. The study was conducted on coastal plain soils (fine-loamy Typic/Aquic hapludults and siliceous, Psammentic hapludults) in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States from 2006 to 2008. Cover crop treatments were FR (forage radish: Raphanus sativus var. longipinnatus, cv. ‘Daikon’), rapeseed (Brassica napus, cv. ‘Essex’), rye (cereal rye: Secale cereale L., cv. ‘Wheeler’) and NCC (no cover crop). Maize under high compaction achieved more deep-roots following FR and rapeseed than following rye or NCC. However, maize had greater yield following all cover crops than NCC control regardless of compaction levels and soil texture. Compaction reduced maize yield only under the high compaction in the lightly textured soils. During 24 June–24 July 2008, soils at 15 and 50 cm depths were drier under no compaction than high compaction and drier following FR than other cover crop treatments. Our results suggest that FR benefited maize root penetration in compacted soils while rye provided the best availability of surface soil water; rapeseed tended to provide both benefits. However, as rapeseed is relatively difficult to kill in spring, a mixture of FR and rye cover crops might be most practical and beneficial for rainfed summer crops under no-till systems in regions with cool to temperate, humid climates.

Background: Uncertainty exists regarding the surgical approach to the contralateral side in children who have unilateral inguinal hernia.
Objective: To evaluate the necessity of bilateral inguinal exploration in unilateral inguinal hernia among preschool age group.
Methods: In present study 84 children (78 boys & 6 girls) were investigated during 6 months in 2005. Routinely, all preschool age children were subjected to contralateral exploration when a unilateral hernia was present. All operations were carried out by a qualified pediatric surgeon. Preoperative and postoperative diagnoses, along with descriptive surgical findings were tabulated and analyzed using X2 test.
Finding: Thirty eight children (42.5%) had bilateral inguinal hernia. It was noted that children with left inguinal hernia were more likely to have a positive result (63.3% vs. 35.2%). Conclusion: Based on data found in our study, a bilateral exploration is necessary when a unilateral inguinal hernia is present.

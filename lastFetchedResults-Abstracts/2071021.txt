Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is increasingly used in food supplements due to its dietary and medicinal compounds with a beneficial role in human diet and health. As many other medicinal plants, sea buckthorn can be contaminated with microorganisms which exerts an important impact on the overall quality of the products. Irradiation is an effective method for food preservation because it is able to destroy pathogenic microorganisms keeping the organoleptic and nutritional characteristics of the foods. The objective of the present study was to investigate the application of electron beam irradiation in order to improve the microbiological safety of sea buckthorn. The experimental results indicated that the electron beam treatment might be a good method to remove undesirable microorganisms from sea buckthorn without significant changes in its active principles.

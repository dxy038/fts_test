The objective was to develop fiber-optic subarray technology to enhance the system performance of phased-array antennas. The near-term plan was to demonstrate the wideband characteristics of a beam-forming network implemented with switchable fiber-optic delay lines. In the breadboard system each line source was divided into four channels, each controlled by one delay line and powered by one high-power amplifier. For the X-band (10 GHz), the line source consisted of 32 dipole elements grouped into four subarrays. The L-band (1.9 GHz) line source had the same length as the X-band array and was formed by eight vertical monopole elements lined up in a parallel-plate structure. The dual-band transmit system was built and tested in the laboratory. The antenna was operating properly as designed. The measured array patterns for the X and L-bands are shown. The observed beam characteristics agreed very well with the theoretical predictions. Preliminarly scan performance was verified by using different sets of precision-cut, unequal line length coaxial cables.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

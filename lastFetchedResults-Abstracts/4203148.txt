Constraint-Based Testing (CBT) is the process of generating test cases against a testing objective by using constraint solving techniques. When programs contain dynamic memory allocation and loops, constraint reasoning becomes challenging as new variables and new constraints are created during the test data generation process. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a new constraint model of C programs based on operators that model dynamic memory management. These operators apply deduction rules on abstract states of the memory allowing so to enhance the constraint reasoning process that permits to generate test data for these programs. We illustrate our approach on structural testing of a complex program that contains dynamic memory allocation/deallocation, structures and loops. An implementation is in progress and first experimental results obtained on this program show the highly deductive potential of the approach.

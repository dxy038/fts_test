This paper presents a novel object-based method for the generation of a stereoscopic image sequence from a monoscopic video, using bidirectional two-dimensional motion estimation for the recovery of rigid motion and structure and a Bayesian framework to handle occlusions. The latter is based on extended Kalman filters and an efficient method for reliably tracking object masks. Experimental results show that the layered object scene representation, combined with the proposed algorithm for reliably tracking object masks throughout the sequence, yields very accurate results.

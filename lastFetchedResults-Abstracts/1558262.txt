This paper presents a variant of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP) in which the traveling time between each pair of cities is represented by an interval of values (wherein the actual travel time is expected to lie) instead of a fixed (deterministic) value as in the classical ATSP. Here the ATSP (with interval objective) is formulated using the usual interval arithmetic. To solve the interval ATSP (I-ATSP), a genetic algorithm with interval valued fitness function is proposed. For this purpose, the existing revised definition of order relations between interval numbers for the case of pessimistic decision making is used. The proposed algorithm is based on a previously published work and includes some new features of the basic genetic operators. To analyze the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and different genetic operators, computational studies of the proposed algorithm on some randomly generated test problems are reported.

This paper presents a multi-objective algorithm to solve stochastic distribution feeder reconfiguration (SDFR) problem for systems with distributed wind power generation (WPG) and fuel cells (FC). The four objective functions investigated are 1) the total electrical energy losses, 2) the cost of electrical energy generated, 3) the total emissions produced, and 4) the bus voltage deviation. A probabilistic power flow based on the point estimate method (PEM) is employed to include uncertainty in the WPG output and load demand, concurrently. Different wind penetration strategies are examined to capture all economical, operational and environmental aspects of the problem. An interactive fuzzy satisfying optimization algorithm based on adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) is employed to determine the optimal plan under different conditions. The proposed method is applied to Taiwan Power system and the results are validated in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

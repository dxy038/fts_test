Bodily sensations are relevant to problems such as hypochondriasis, but the issue of whether people are accurate in their perception remains unclear. The accuracy of perception of bodily sensations was analysed in 20 male and 20 female volunteers using two methods: a heart beat tracking procedure and the within-S  correlational approach described by Steptoe and Vögele (1992, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 30, 597–607). The correlational approach involved monitoring of heart rate, skin conductance level and total respiratory resistance during relaxation and task periods, and computing correlations between appropriate physiological parameters and ratings of heart rate, sweaty hands and difficulty with breathing. In general, subjective ratings of bodily sensations were tied more closely with feelings of distress than with objective physiological state. Error scores on the heart beat tracking procedure showed no association with hypochondriacal concerns or with vigilant and avoidant coping styles measured with the Mainz Coping Inventory. Individuals varied considerably in accuracy as assessed with the correlational approach. However, there was a significant negative association between hypochondriacal concerns and accuracy of perception of sweat gland activity. The results are discussed in relation to measures of somatic perception and the experience of bodily sensations.

In this document is proposed a novel integration of two fuzzy controls of different systems involved in one, with the objective of control the nominal speed of a three phase induction motor and a soft switching control of a dc link to support a VSC converter which are running simultaneously. The fuzzy control methodologies of each one are presented. Some tests are made to confirm the control actions over the whole system. Finally the results are verified in a prototype hardware designed.

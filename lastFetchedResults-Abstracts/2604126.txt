One of the considered issues in CR is theallocation of frequency channels between its users. In this paper, at first, spectrum allocation model is presented, then a new spectrum allocation method based on DifferentialEvolution (DE) algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm in order to decrease the search space we propose a mappingprocess between the channel assignment matrix and the position of candidate solutions of DE based on the characteristics of thechannel availability matrix and the interference constraints. Then DE Results show efficiency of our proposed method. Corresponding results show that our proposed method fastconverge in maximizing three objective functions which are: Max-Sum-Reward (MSR), Max-Min-Reward (MMR), and Max-Proportional-Fair (MPF); this feature makes our proposed methods useful for practical applications.

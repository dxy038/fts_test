The objective of this project is to develop a telemedicine information monitoring system, the composition of which primarily includes wireless vital sign monitoring devices, a healthcare gateway and a health services information platform. Of these three pillars, the healthcare gateway plays the intermediary role. The system also adopts the open services gateway initiative (OSGi) platform, which can offer dynamically adjusted healthcare service programs for individual patients. In addition, ZigBee-built in wireless modules are used in the transmission of information between vital sign monitoring devices and the healthcare gateway. Vital sign data parameters, including ECG, SPO2, blood pressure, glucose and body temperature, can be transmitted to the healthcare gateway via ZigBee and then are relayed through the Internet to the health services information platform. This integrated healthcare system is based on the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) concept, providing a system that enables the healthcare management for individuals. As a result, round-the-clock telemedicine services can be provided for persons with chronic illnesses as well as the elderly.

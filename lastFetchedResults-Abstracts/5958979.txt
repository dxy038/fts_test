This balance is often expressed in terms of COD/N ratio of the influent. The objective of the work reported here was to determine the optimal COD and COD/N ratio for high efficient production of PHB. Compared influent initial COD concentrations from 200 to 1000 mg/L, results indicated that the COD 600 were more propitious to PHB accumulation. Simultaneity, compared the influent initial COD/N ratios of 100, 200, 300, and 400 respectively, results showed COD/N ratio of 200 was more favorable acetate fully converted into PHB in aerobic open mixed cultures.

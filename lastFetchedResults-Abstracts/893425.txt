Background and Objective: One of the most common complications of IUD users is dysmenorrhea, which is not the same  in different IUDs. The aim of this study was  to compare the  dysmenorrhea in IUD multi-load 375 and IUD copper T 380 A.
Material and Methods:   A randomized double- blinded controlled clinical trial was conducted on  48 women referring to a health-center  in Tabriz, from 2011jan-2012 oct.The participants  were randomly allocated to  two groups of   multi-load 375 IUD and the copper T 380A IUD ( located in a four-member and six-member block) . We measured the amount of dysmenorrhea with Visual Analog Scale , before the IUD insertion and four mouths later. The data was  analyzed by SPSS-13, using  Mann-Whitney,  Regression, Fridmans test.
Results: The results showed that the severity and duration of dysmenorrhea in two groups of IUD were  significantly different, considering   the factors such as  the baseline dismenorrhea ,  the utilized  drug and the  interval between the last labor and IUD insertion.The  dysmenorrhea in multi-load group was decreased and in copper T increased significantly. 
Conclusion: Based on the results , multi-load  IUD results  in considerable reduction in the  severity and duration of dysmenorrhea. Therefore,  it is reccomended counseling about both multi-load  IUD and Copper T in the family planning service centers.

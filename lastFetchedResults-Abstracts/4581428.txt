A new heuristic is presented for the general cell placement problem where the objective is to minimize total bounding box netlength. The heuristic is based on the Guided Local Search (GLS) metaheuristic. GLS modifies the objective function in a constructive way to escape local minima. Previous attempts to use local search on final (or detailed) placement problems have often failed as the neighborhood quickly becomes too excessive for large circuits. Nevertheless, by combining GLS with Fast Local Search it is possible to focus the search on appropriate sub-neighborhoods, thus reducing the time complexity considerably. Comprehensive computational experiments with the developed algorithm are reported on small, medium and large industrial circuits, and for standard cell and general cell variants of the problem. The experiments demonstrate that the developed algorithm is able to improve the estimated routing length of large-sized general cell layouts with as much as 20 percent. The general nature of the proposed method makes it easy to incorporate other goals, such as routability and timing constraints, into the objective function. Current layout algorithms use a feedback approach in which a placement is evaluated by performing (partial) routing and timing analysis; the output of this analysis is then used to construct an improved placement. This iterative nature of the design process calls for placement algorithms that take an existing placement and construct an improved placement that resembles the original one, but in which the information from the routing/timing analysis is taken into account.

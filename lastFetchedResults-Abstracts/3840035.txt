Objective validation and ranking of measurements and simulations may be done by methods such as feature selective validation (FSV). FSV is used to compare two EMC-measurement results. Owing to the noisy nature of these type of data, the FSV results are corrupted. The reasons are discussed and solutions are proposed to make FSV feasible in a broader area of applications. The final solution is a combination of denoising the data and changing the weight of the data to be in accordance with our visual interpretation.

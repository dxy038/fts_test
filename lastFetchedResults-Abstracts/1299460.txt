The objective of this paper is to examine the performance of solar systems in buildings. this subject were chosen, because there are not sustainable buildings in Iran. In this paper, the main question is that buildings are designed, how it is responsive to thermal requirement. if these buildings can be designed only by relying on regional climatic conditions compared with the solar system, how much impact on reducing energy consumption. For responding to this subject, design were accomplished in two stage. 
At first, thermal load have been calculated for this design without solar systems Then, the solar system was added to the project and its impact in improving the thermal conditions were calculated. The results show, using a solar system can reduce the amount of heating required about 65%.

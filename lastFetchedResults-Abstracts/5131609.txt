As one of important components in traditional Chinese medicines, Musca domestica larvae has been used to cure ecthyma, osteomyelitis, C, malnutritional stagnation and lip boil since the Ming/Qing Danysty. The objective of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of the Musca domestica pupae lectin (MPL) on the activity of macrophages and splenocyte. The fraction of buffer insect solution (BIS) lectin was purified by affinity chromatography on galactose-Sepharose-4B and ultrafiltration. This lectin agglutinatin rabbit blood cells (RBC) at 10 mug/ml. The immunomodulatory of the MPL was studied by the production of nitric oxide (NO), IL-6 and IL-12 in a dose-dependent manner. The production of IL-6 was induced by MPL at 5 mug/ml; IL-12 was significantly induced at 15 mug/ml. Lymphocyte transformation test in vitro shown MPL potential as immunomodulator, splenoctye proliferation index was significant increased at 10 mug/ml comparing with the control . Our results suggested a portion of the beneficial therapeutic properties of lectin from Musca domestica, our results also supported the concept of using MPL as an immunostimulation adjuvant.

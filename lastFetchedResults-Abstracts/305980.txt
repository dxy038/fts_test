Objective

This study was performed to identify  possible relationship between genotype and phenotype in the congenital familial long QT syndrome (cLQTS).

Background

The cLQTS, which occurs as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait, is characterized by QT-interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram and torsade de pointes arrhythmias, which may give rise to recurrent syncope or sudden cardiac death. Precipitators for cardiac events are exercise or emotion and occasionally acoustic stimuli.

Methods

The trigger for cardiac events (syncope, documented cardiac arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death) was analyzed in 11 families with  familial LQTS and  determined genotype.

Results

The families were subdivided in KVLQT1-related families (LQTS1, n = 5) and HERG (human ether-a-gogo-related gene)-related families (LQTS2, n = 6) based on single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing. Whereas exercise-related cardiac events dominate the clinical picture of LQTS1 patients, auditory stimuli as  trigger for arrhythmic events were only seen in LQTS2 patients.

Conclusions

Arrhythmic events triggered by auditory stimuli may differentiate LQTS2 from LQTS1 patients.

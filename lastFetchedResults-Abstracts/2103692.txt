The objective of this research was to demonstrate the ability of canola to take up structural potassium from muscovite and biotite. The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design with factorial combinations and three replicates. Culture medium was a mixture of sandy quartz and K-bearing minerals including muscovite or biotite with two sizes:  < 4 ?m and 4-60?m (as silt) and the plants fed during a period of three-months by two different nutrient solutions (K+ and K–). At the end of the experiment, shoots were separated and their K content was determined with flame photometer. In- K treatment, total K uptake of plant was significantly influenced by the type of culture medium. The maximum K absorption was related to plants grown in culture medium containing biotite. However, the minimum value was observed in the muscovite and quartz bearing medium with K-free nutrient solution. Mineralogical results after treatment showed clay size biotite which was fed with K-free nutrient solution weathered more than silt sized biotite and partially transformed to vermiculite because in smaller size, the confinement layers of potassium are more weathered and will release their K more quickly and release it to the plant. On the contrary, there was no significant difference in the degree of muscovite weathering when fed with K+ and K– free nutrient solutions in both media. Muscovite was resistant in this situation.

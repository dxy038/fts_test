Analogs of the psychotropic phenothiazines were synthesized and examined as antitubercular agents against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. The compounds were subsequently counter-screened for binding to the dopaminergic-receptor subtypes D1, D2, D3 and the serotonergic-receptor subtypes 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C. The most active compounds showed MICs from 2 to 4 Î¼g/mL and had overall reduced binding to the dopamine and serotonin receptors compared to chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine.

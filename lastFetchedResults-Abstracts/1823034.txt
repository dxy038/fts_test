Objective
oryl oligosaccharides of calcium (POs-Ca) are highly soluble calcium source made from potato starch. The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal concentrations of POs-Ca for the remineralization of subsurface enamel lesions in vitro.

ralized bovine enamel slabs (n = 5) were remineralized in vitro for 24 h at 37 °C with artificial saliva (AS) containing 0–0.74% POs-Ca to adjust the Ca/P ratio to 0.4–3.0, then sectioned and analysed by transversal microradiography (TMR). The data were analysed by Scheffe's post hoc test. The Ca/P ratio with most remineralization was used to investigate the effect of calcium on enamel remineralization (n = 11). The demineralized slabs were treated with AS with calcium-chloride- (CaCl2-) or POs-Ca with an identical calcium content, and sectioned for TMR and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) analyses to evaluate the local changes in hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystal content. The data were analysed using the Mann–Whitney U-test.
s
ghest mineral recovery rate resulted from addition of POs-Ca to adjust the Ca/P to 1.67. At this ratio, the mineral recovery rate for AS containing POs-Ca (24.2 ± 7.4%) was significantly higher than that for AS containing CaCl2 (12.5 ± 11.3%) (mean ± SD, p &lt; 0.05). The recovery rate of HAp crystallites for AS containing POs-Ca (35.7 ± 10.9%) was also significantly higher than that for AS containing CaCl2 (23.1 ± 13.5%) (p &lt; 0.05). The restored crystallites were oriented in the same directions as in sound enamel.

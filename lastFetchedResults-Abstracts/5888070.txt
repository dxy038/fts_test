We consider a novel detection algorithm based on particle filtering algorithm for Bell Laboratory layered space time (BLAST) systems. Applying QR-decomposition of the channel matrix, a tree search method based on deterministic sampling can achieve the performance near optimal decoding when the number of searching paths is very large, which is computationally complex. In this paper, we provide a bidirectional adaptive algorithm (BIDAA), which can quickly approach the best path at low cost. Simulation results show that the new algorithm can greatly outperform MMSE-SIC detection

This paper presents a current-based optimal power flow (OPF) with predictor-corrector interior point algorithm (PCIPA). The distinctive features of this OPF formulation are: i) the elements of Hessian matrix are all real, ii) the objective function and constraints are quadratic functions and such quadratic properties are explored in the development of a robust nonlinear OPF solution procedure. This paper also presents the proposed method can further decomposes into two optimal sub-problems (active and reactive). The computational results on power systems of IEEE 9 to 118 buses have shown that the proposed algorithms are very effective.

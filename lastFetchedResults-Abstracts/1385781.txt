This work considers the addition of damping to a beam system in order to limit the response due to random-in-time forcing functions. Here the optimization process for such dissipative attachments will use as an objective function the spatial average of the mean square response over the extent of the beam. It is shown here that optimal dampers and damped vibration absorbers can be found which minimize this objective function.

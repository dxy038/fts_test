Objective:  The objective of this study was to characterize the in vitro corrosion behavior of five high-palladium dental alloys in two media using a potentiodynamic polarization technique.

Methods: Potentiodynamic cyclic polarization between −1000 and +1000 mV (SCE), 12 h open-circuit potential measurement, and linear polarization were performed on cast specimens of three Pd–Cu–Ga alloys and two Pd–Ga alloys in deaerated 0.09% NaCl solution and Fusayama artificial saliva at 37°C. Zero-current potential, corrosion current density, open-circuit potential, and polarization resistance were determined. The Kruskal–Wallis test and the Mann–Whitney U-test were used to analyze the numeric findings.

Results: The Pd–Cu–Ga and Pd–Ga alloys in both the as-cast and heat-treated conditions showed spontaneous passive behavior under electrochemical conditions similar to those in the oral environment. The Pd–Cu–Ga alloys Liberty and Spartan Plus exhibited increased activity in the Fusayama artificial saliva after the porcelain-firing heat treatment, which may have arisen from internal oxidation of casting defects. Heat-treated Freedom Plus had an unstable oxide film to form on the surface during anodic polarization and may have a limited tendency for pitting corrosion in the Fusayama artificial saliva. The two heat-treated Pd–Ga alloys remained passive in the test media. As a group, the high-palladium alloys exhibited satisfactory corrosion resistance.

Significance: Corrosion of high-palladium alloys in the oral environment involves a release of ions that is related to their biocompatibility. Knowledge of the in vitro corrosion behavior of these alloys may lead to better understanding of any biologically adverse effects in vivo.

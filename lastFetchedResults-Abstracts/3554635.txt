The main objective of this study was to develop a 3D X-ray reconstruction system of the spine and rib cage for an accurate 3D clinical assessment of spinal deformities. The system currently used at Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal is based on an implicit calibration technique based on a direct linear transform (DLT), using a sufficiently large rigid object incorporated in the positioning apparatus to locate any anatomical structure to be reconstructed within its bounds. During the time lapse between the two successive X-ray acquisitions required for the 3D reconstruction, involuntary patient motion introduce errors due to the incorrect epipolar geometry inferred from the stationary object. An approach using a new calibration jacket and explicit calibration algorithm is proposed in this paper. This approach yields accurate results and compensates for involuntary motion occurring between X-ray exposures.

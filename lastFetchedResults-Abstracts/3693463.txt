This paper proposes a design method for optimizing the rotor winding shape of HTS motor. The design objective is to maximize the flux-linkage of stator winding with a given amount of superconductor volume. The increase of flux-linkage results in output-power increase, compact size and quench-reliable characteristic. The optimization algorithm is a design sensitivity analysis where the HTS critical current condition is taken into account. First, the shape of rotor winding is optimized to give a boundary shape of smooth curves. Second, with the shape the rectangular sizes of windings are approximately obtained for easy manufacture. Finally, the rectangular sizes are also optimized for fine-size tuning. The proposed design method is applied to the 100-hp HTS motor.

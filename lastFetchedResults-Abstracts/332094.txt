Objective: A comparative investigation of acrylic denture base surface microhardness, induced through glazing with different photo-activated liquids.

Materials and methods: Thermopolymerized acrylic resin Paladon 65 (Kulzer) was used for this study. The samples were mechanically thinned by silicon carbide grinding papers and finally, mechanically polished by alumina pastes. The samples were then glazed with Palaseal, Plaquit and Lightplast-Lack photo-activated liquids. Microhardness tests were carried out via a Zeiss optical microscope equipped with an Anton Paar microhardness tester fitted with a Knoop indenter.

Results: Microhardness testing performed on surfaces glazed by Plaquit, Lightplast-Lack, and Palaseal photo-activated liquids showed enhanced microhardness values compared to the mechanically polished acrylic resin denture base material.

Conclusions: Comparative microhardness tests performed on acrylic base resin treated with photo-activated acrylic glazes showed that all increases the surface microhardness. The enhancement of surface microhardness of acrylic denture bases suggests that they are likely to resist wear during service.

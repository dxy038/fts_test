Objective
The goal of this study was to examine whether sociodemographic, clinical, and other service-related factors, as well as preventability issues affect a woman's progression along the continuum of morbidity and mortality.
Study design
This was a case-control study of pregnancy-related deaths, women with near-miss morbidity, and those with other severe, but not life threatening, morbidity. Factors associated with maternal outcome were examined.
Results
Provider factors (related to preventability) and clinical diagnosis were significantly associated with progression along the continuum after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics (P< .01 for both associations).
Conclusion
In order to improve mortality rates, we must understand maternal morbidity and how it may lead to death. This study shows that important initiatives include addressing preventability, in particular, provider factors, which may play a role in moving women along the continuum of morbidity and mortality.

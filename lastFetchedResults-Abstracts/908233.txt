The objective of this study was to evaluate parents’ versus children’s level of decision making in regards to healthy eating and physical activity practices and how it relates to weight status. Cross-sectional parent responses to a series of visual analog items assessed the level of both parent and child involvement in decisions related to nutrition and physical activity. Participants included parent–kindergarten student cohorts in West Virginia from 2007 to 2009 (n = 634). Mean nutrition and physical activity decision making scores were compared across four groups of parent and child weight status combinations. The results indicated that parents described equal involvement of the parent and child in nutrition and activity decisions within the home. Within families where the parent and/or the child were obese, parents reported more involvement of the child in nutritional decisions. Families with an obese parent and an obese child reported the highest level of child involvement in these types of decisions. In summary, this study found that families share involvement in decisions but greater child involvement may be associated with adult and/or child obesity. At least for younger children, decisions may prove healthier if parents have an equal or greater amount of input in the decisions related to healthy lifestyle choices.

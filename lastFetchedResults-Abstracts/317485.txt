During a prospective study after separation of the nasopalatine nerve at the foramen incisivum during exposure or removal of impacted and palatal displaced maxillary canines, 59 patients were examined neurologically for 4 weeks postoperatively over an investigation period of 18 months. During the first week after the operation, subjective as well as objective sensory disorders were found in all of the patients, but after 4 weeks at the most no neurological deficit could be detected in any patient.

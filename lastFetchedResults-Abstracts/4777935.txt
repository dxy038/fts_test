In this paper, we present signal construction for the future IEEE 40GBASE-T standard. The LDPC assisted coded modulation and demodulation is presented. A code achieving 6 dB gain, which is literally high enough to satisfy reliability constraints for data transmission at a rate of 40 Gbps over 50 m Cat-7A (class FA) copper cable, is designed and the simulation results are presented. The main objective of the presented work is to extensively reduce the power and implementation complexities of a 40GBASE-T system.

Objective To investigate the association between weekly
lottery sales and number of suicide deaths in Taiwan.
Methods All suicides aged 15? years during 2004â€“2006
in Taiwan were included. Poisson autoregression time
series models investigated associations of weekly numbers
with contemporaneous and recent sales from two national
lotteries in operation. Adjustments were made for seasonal
fluctuation, temperature, monthly unemployment and
autocorrelation.
Results In fully adjusted models, suicide deaths were
negatively correlated with sales of tickets for a low-prize,
low-cost lottery system. However, they were correlated
positively with recent sales for a higher-cost, larger-prize
system. Both correlations were stronger for male than
female suicide numbers but differed in terms of age groups
most strongly implicated.
Conclusions Associations between lottery sales and suicide
numbers differed according to the nature of the lottery.
A low-prize, low-publicity system appeared to be more
benign than a high-prize, high-publicity one.

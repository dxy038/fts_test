The main objective of this article has been to demonstrate the utility of stratal slice images for exploring the sequence stratigraphy and sedimentology of complex depositional systems. The seismic-geomorphology study and sedimentary interpretation were performed to map sediment-dispersal characteristics from late Paleogene to Neogene in Qinan Sag, located in Huanghua Depression of China. The Qinan Sag is underlain by a non-marine Mesozoic and Cenozoic-age stratigraphic section. Main data types in this study area are lithology, wire-line logs and 3D seismic. The main study strata, Member one of Shahejie Formation to Minghuazhen Formation, divided into two second-order sequences and four third-order sequences. The older of the two second-order sequences, SE, corresponds to the formations from Kongdian to Dongying. The younger of the two second-order sequences, SN, correspond to Guantao and Minghuazhen formations. Guided by third-order sequence-stratigraphic correlations from seismic and wireline-log data, we prepared stratal slices from a three-dimensional seismic volume to reveal high-resolution (10-m) sediment dispersal characteristics in a relative geologic-time domain. Using techniques of 3-D seismic geomorphology, we defined four types of depositional systems: braided deltas, deltas, braided rivers and meandering rivers. Stratal slices indicated that the depositional evolution of these interest sequences was from braided-delta front to delta front, braided river and finally meandering river system. Many factors related to the structural evolution history controlled the sediment-dispersal characteristics, such as the basin type, dynamic mechanism, faulting activity, subsidence rate and paleo-high.

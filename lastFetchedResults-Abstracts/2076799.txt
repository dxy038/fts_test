Mathematical models have become indispensable tools in contemporary ecology and environmental science. To facilitate an efficient (re-)usage of these models, the documentation and information system ECOBAS was designed. The objective of the project is to enable complete and consistent documentation of models as well as to make them accessible and comparable. The information requirements are outlined and the components of ECOBAS are explained.

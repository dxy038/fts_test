The antenna placement problem, or cell planning problem, involves locating and configuring infrastructure for cellular wireless networks. Many authors have looked at computationally efficient methods to create feasible or optimised cell plans. However in most approaches the tension between conflicting objectives is generally addressed implicitly rather than explicitly. In this paper, we present a model for resolving the most fundamental tension, between service coverage and cost of base stations. The model is general in its approach, and its abstract representation means that state-of-the-art multiple objective optimisation techniques can readily be applied. We use a synthesised test problem to obtain typical results which demonstrate the tension between objectives and the diminishing return (in terms of service coverage) for additional investment.

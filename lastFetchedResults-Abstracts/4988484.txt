The objective of this paper is to automatically generate a MCUM (Markov chain usage model) starting from an OMG UML-SD (sequence diagram) in order to derive TTCN-3 (testing and test control notation version 3) compatible test case definitions. Our approach is a combination of statistical usage testing and specification-based testing. Within this paper, special attention is given to international standardized FDT notations, specifically UML-SD and MSC. We have also defined an XML-based representation format called MCML (Markov chain markup language) to build a common interface between various parts of the MaTeLo tool set. In the case of UML-SD, we use XMI descriptions in order to generate the desired MCML format.

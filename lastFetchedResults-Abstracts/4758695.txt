To choose the proper number of generic elements in the universe of discourse in the design of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is always arbitrary and obscure. The authors examine the effects of the table dimensions when a domain expert does not exist. They test the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) FLC with a three-dimensional fuzzy associated memory (FAM) rule table whose entries are obtained from fuzzy addition on a dynamic second-order tracking problem. The objective is to examine and compare the effect of the types of tables through the transient response of a second-order system. Simulation results show that a fuzzy system which uses an even type of FAM rule table is more suitable for controlling a second-order plant which demands slightly underdamped response

Most common approaches for object detection collect thousands of training examples and train a detector in an offline setting, using supervised learning methods, with the objective of obtaining a generalized detector that would give good performance on various test datasets. However, when an offline trained detector is applied on challenging test datasets, it may fail in some cases by not being able to detect some objects or by producing false alarms. We propose an unsupervised multiple instance learning (MIL) based incremental solution to deal with this issue. We introduce an MIL loss function for Real Adaboost and present a tracking based effective unsupervised online sample collection mechanism to collect the online samples for incremental learning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by improving the performance of a state of the art offline trained detector on the challenging datasets for pedestrian category.

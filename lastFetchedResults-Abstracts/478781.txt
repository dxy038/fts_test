Background and Objective: Nowadays, various biomaterials have been presented for regeneration of osseous defects and Bio-oss is one of them. The objective of this study was evaluation of Bio-oss function in intramedullary space of rabbit`s tibia near titanium implant.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 12 white New Zealand rabbits were selected and randomly divided into control and experimental groups. These groups based on defined periods were subdivided into 2 triple groups. A defect was made by drilling proximal tibia of each rabbit. The size of defect was equal to implant diameter. In experimental group, at first, defects were filled with Bio-oss and then titanium implants were placed. In control group, only implants were inserted. After 8 and 16 weeks, bone tissue specimens were prepared through undecalcified resin section method and evaluated histologically, histomorphometrically and statistically.

Results: After 8 weeks, mean of bone to implant contact (BIC) and the ratio of immature bone surface area to total new bone surface area reached to 5.3% and 94.3% in control group and to 21.4% and 84.7% in experimental group respectively. After 16 weeks, above-mentioned variables reached to 9.6% and 73.6% in control group and to 49.4% and 51.7% in experimental group respectively (p<0.05).

Conclusion: Bio-oss could have the bone-healing capacity in medullary space of tibia and could increase the stabilization of titanium implant.

Solid oxide fuel cell is one of most promising types of fuel cells with advantages of high efficiencies, flexibility of usable fuel types. The performance of SOFC is strongly affected by cell overall parameters, e.g., temperature, pressure, reaction rates, etc. In this work, a 3D CFD model is developed to simulate the working processes in SOFCÂ´s anode. The objective of this work is to study the effects of the parameters such as inlet temperature, permeability and pores radius on the working processes, by coupling the chemical reactions of gas- and surface-phase species based on catalyst surface coverage with the transport processes such as mass, momentum and thermal energy.

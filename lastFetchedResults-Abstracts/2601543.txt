Research Method: This paper can be categorized to descriptive (based on the nature), library study (based on the data gathering method), fundamental theoretical research (based on
objective). This paper uses a quantitative research method by utilizing Kalman Filter as a data
mining (prediction) tool.
Findings: The results obtained from current trend analysis has showed that there is a strong
relations between e-governance and good governance proportionally. Scenario-based analysis
also figured out that the change in good governance level on the e-governance has more impact than the change in e-governance level on the good governance.

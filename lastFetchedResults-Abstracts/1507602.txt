The gas concentration and temperature information from the combustion of biomass offer significant advantages to enhance the understanding of an industrial-scale biomass heating plant. The main objective of this study was to investigate the gas composition and temperature in a 4 MW reciprocating grate boiler. An extensive series of measurements was carried out, and the samples, which were drawn through different ports by means of a water-cooled stainless steel suction pyrometer, were analyzed for temperature and for O2, CO, and NO concentrations. The results showed that the averaged NO, CO, and O2 concentrations in the gas phase during fuel combustion in the primary chamber were 40 ppm, 3.5 and 6.5 vol.%, respectively, while the values were 80 ppm, 1.1 and 6 vol.% in the secondary chamber. Detailed gas species and temperature distributions are discussed, which provide good possibilities for the control of emissions.

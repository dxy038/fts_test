The calibration of constitutive models is based on the solution of an optimization problem, whereby the
sought parameter values minimize an objective function that measures the discrepancy between experimental
observations and the corresponding simulated response. By the introduction of an appropriate
adjoint problem, the resulting formulation becomes well suited for a gradient-based optimization scheme.
A class of viscoelastic models is studied, where a discontinuous Galerkin method is used to integrate the
governing evolution equation in time. A practical solution algorithm, which utilizes the time-flow structure
of the underlying evolution equation, is presented. Based on the proposed formulation it is convenient to
estimate the sensitivity of the calibrated parameters with respect to measurement noise. The sensitivity
is computed using a dual method, which compares favourably with the conventional primal method. The
strategy is applied to a viscoelasticity model using experimental data from a uniaxial compression test.

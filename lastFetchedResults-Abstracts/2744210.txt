This paper describes the design, construction, and testing of a 750-V 100-kW 20-kHz bidirectional isolated dual-active-bridge dc-dc converter using four 1.2-kV 400-A SiC-MOSFET/SBD dual modules. The maximum conversion efficiency from the dc-input to the dc-output terminals is accurately measured to be as high as 98.7% at 42-kW operation. The overall power loss at the rated-power (100 kW) operation, excluding the gate-drive and control circuit losses, is divided into the conduction and switching losses produced by the SiC modules, the iron and copper losses due to magnetic devices, and the other unknown loss. The power-loss breakdown concludes that the sum of the conduction and switching losses is about 60% of the overall power loss and that the conduction loss is nearly equal to the switching loss at the 100-kW and 20-kHz operation.

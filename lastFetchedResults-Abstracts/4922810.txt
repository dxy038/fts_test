Collaborative activities of neurons in the network will be a typical working example in the biological system. Neurons look like to do respective different activities in the network. But, neurons communicate each other for performing an objective work. To control and process the all respective neurons efficiently in the neural network, the collaborative activities will give some clues for the principle and design of artificial collaborative systems. In the network, the correlations of collaborative activities of neurons are important communication means to perform effective works. This paper makes clear the correlation computations to be important in the network for the collaborative behavior of neurons in the layered network.

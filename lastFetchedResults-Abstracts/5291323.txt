The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method studied in this paper is assigned as an intelligent control of photovoltaic (PV) system. The objective of this control is to make the load operate at the maximum electrical power generated by the PV module. In this aim, the ANN consists to track the optimal duty cycle of the electronic converter, in order to lead to the Maximum Power Point (MPP) of the PV system. Moreover, the two classical methods: Perturb and Observe (P&amp;O) and Incremental Conductance (IncCon) are studied in the sake of comparison with the ANN method, by taking into consideration the efficiency, the speed and the robustness performance when the meteorological conditions change.

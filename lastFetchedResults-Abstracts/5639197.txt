The objective of this research was to establish an analytical methodology using TD-GC-MS to identify major volatile organic compounds present in coffee beans aroma. The goal was to make comparative study to check chemical changes that take place when coffee beans stored under room and refrigerator temperature. Twenty three major components in coffee beans aroma were detected by TD-GC-MS system. Results showed that most of the chemical components detected shown increased under room temperature. However Decane, Dodecane, Toluene shown opposite trend. For analyses of the VOCÂ´s detected by the GC-MS, principle component analysis (PCA) was applied and the groups were discriminated and shown using PCA score plot. The results of this study show that a TD-GC-MS system has the ability to identify different geographic origin coffee beans stored under different storage temperature and provides separation among different geographic origin of coffee beans.

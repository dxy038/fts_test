This paper presents a high-frequency rectifier stage using four quadrant switches as synchronous rectifiers for an electrical discharge machining (EDM) power supply. The EDM impulse generator is a series-parallel resonant inverter operating in current-mode. The device specifications and drive requirements of the converter are studied with the objective of generating unipolar and bipolar current waveforms suitable for different types of EDM operations.

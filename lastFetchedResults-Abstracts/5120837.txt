How to provide quality of service (QoS), has been a major issue for the Internet for the past decade. But, recent monitoring projects showed that Internet traffic exhibited large variations, and non-stationary traffic, making difficult to guarantee a stable and robust QoS. The objective of this paper is then to guaranty a robust QoS which means providing the requested QoS under all circumstances, including the most difficult ones. Among the most difficult circumstances are enforcing QoS even in the presence of denial of service (DoS) attacks. This paper then proposes to use a measurement based architecture (MBA) suited for coping with actual non-stationary traffic, as well as traffic disruptions or anomalies. The idea of our measurement based networking (MBN) approach relies on a real time analysis of traffic characteristics and QoS evolution, and on the design of mechanisms able to adapt their reactions accordingly. In particular, we designed a new congestion control mechanism, called MBCC (measurement based congestion control), able to cope with the large variability in traffic throughput. MBCC proved to optimize the use of resources and to improve QoS. In this paper, we show that using MBCC instead of TCP makes the Internet more robust to DoS attacks, i.e. the QoS provided by the attacked network using MBCC, is better than using TCP. These preliminary results are shown on different NS-2 simulations

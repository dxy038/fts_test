Safflower seed (SS), Carthamus tinctorius L., has the highest concentration of linoleic acid among 80 oilseeds. It was hypothesized that an Iranian variety of SS can be effectively fed with cottonseeds (CS) to maintain feed intake, energy metabolism and productivity of early lactation cows under negative energy balance. Our objective was to determine effects of feeding diets containing 100 g whole CS with (1) no SS (SS0), (2) 75 g CS + 25 g SS (SS25), or (3) 50 g CS + 50 g SS (SS50), per kg of dietary DM, on feed intake, rumen fermentation, blood metabolites and milk production of early lactation cows fed diets based on a uniform mixtures of alfalfa hay and corn silage. Nine multiparous early lactation Holstein cows (46 ± 7 d in milk) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design study with three 21-d periods. Each period had 14 d of adaptation and 7 d of data collection. Dietary inclusion of SS did not affect (P&gt;0.10) DM intake, rumen pH and concentrations of ammonia and VFA, blood concentrations of insulin, non-esterified fatty acids, urea and triglycerides, and milk production. Adding SS linearly reduced blood glucose (P=0.05) and beta-hydroxybutyric acid (P&lt;0.05), and increased blood total cholesterol (P&lt;0.01) and low-density lipoproteins (P&lt;0.05) concentrations. Results demonstrated that SS as an economical and rich source of essential fatty acids can be included up to 50 g/kg of dietary DM alongside CS for early lactation cows without affecting feed intake while maintaining rumen fermentation, peripheral energy supply and milk production.

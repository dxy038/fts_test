Since supply chain management involves the leveraging of channel wide integration to better serve customer needs, improvements in productivity and quality will depend heavily on the implementation and coordination of quality management activities upstream. We introduce the philosophy of total quality management and just in time (JIT) manufacturing in order to achieve the best results of production management. This paper focuses on supply chain planning with quality control in an OKP environment with multiple manufacturing centres and multiple customers. A model and its solving algorithm are discussed respectively, and the objective is to identify suitable supply chain partners and achieve optimal production planning in order to minimize the total cost of earliness/tardiness penalty, manufacturing and transportation in meeting customerÂ´s requirement under the constraints of limited manufacturing capacity. The computational results demonstrate that satisfactory solutions can be obtained for supply chain planning with quality control.

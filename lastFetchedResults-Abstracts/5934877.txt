The use of technology for automation of surgical tasks has great potential in the field of robotic surgery. Automation of surgical robots essentially involves designing a control scheme for precise and automatic positioning of robotic manipulators. This objective can be achieved by the use of Visual servoing. We have developed a visual-servoing-based robotic laparoscopic surgery system. The visual servoing system enables autonomous control of a robot arm in a surgical set-up. In this paper, we propose algorithms for the automatic positioning of the laparoscope and the surgical instruments under small incisions of skin. We have verified the performance of the system theoretically and experimentally.

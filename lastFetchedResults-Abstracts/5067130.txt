The emerging technologies have brought a revolution in wireless communication. After three successful generations of wireless standards, now fourth generation is under consideration. Along with progress toward new technologies, interoperability of different technologies is also getting attention. User session handover is main concern to provide connectivity between different networks. This paper has mentioned some handover solutions based on prior networks. The main objective is to present the idea about session handover of user between GSM and WiMAX. GSM is circuit switched based network where as WiMAX is packet switched network. Both technologies use different infrastructure but both support Mobile IP. So in this paper the issue of interoperability between heterogeneous networks has been dealt with using Mobile IP.

Cosine-modulated filter banks are introduced into fractal image coding to remove the block effects which exist in conventional block-based fractal image compression both in spatial and frequency domains. The proposed method offers not only an efficient solution to such block effects but also better objective performance. Compared with the fractal image compression methods based on discrete cosine transform, about 1 dB SNR gain can be achieved

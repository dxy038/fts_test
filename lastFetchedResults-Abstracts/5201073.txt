The Personal Mobile Television (PMT) is a commercial reality in many countries, and is becoming a reality in other places. The Quality of Experience (QoE) actually delivered to end users will be one of the key criteria for the adoption of this new service. In order to evaluate it, objective quality assessment tools may not correlate well with the human perceived video quality and, at the same time, subjective quality assessment methods are costly and time consuming. In this paper, we design an automatic QoE monitoring module for H.264 video over DVB-H networks. The module is based on both network and video parameters. We describe some strategies for extracting and measuring these parameters in DVB-H networks without any access to the original signal. The results show that our QoE estimation module captures the nonlinear relationship between these parameters and QoE. Moreover, our consideration of additional parameters leads to significant improvement in QoE estimation accuracy when compared to recent ITU QoE models for video streams.

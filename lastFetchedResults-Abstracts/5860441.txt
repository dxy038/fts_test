The paper presents a temporal error concealment technique for compressed videostreams over wireless channels. The proposed technique is two stages temporal error concealment which are: (1) reconstruction of corrupted macroblocks (MBs) using the available motion vectors (MVs) of the corresponded MBs and (2) recalculation of the previously estimated MVs in the first stage using texture information of the surrounding MBs. The experimental results show that the proposed technique produces better visual quality in subjective measurement and higher PSNR in objective measurement when compared with other conventional techniques.

It is the objective of this work to verify the validity of different approximations in the analysis of geometrically non-linear vibrations of open, cylindrical, laminated, fully clamped shells. Namely, it is intended to verify if membrane inertia and transverse shear deformation can be neglected and when. p-version finite elements with hierarchic basis functions are employed to define the models. A simple comparison of the different stiffness and mass terms is carried out first, to assess the relative importance of membrane inertia and shear deformation. Then a few numerical tests are carried out in non-linear vibrations by solving the ordinary differential equations of motion by Newmarkâ€™s method. It is found that what are usually considered to be thin panels actually require the consideration of shear deformation.

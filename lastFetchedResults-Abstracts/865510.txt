Some environmental pollutants have the ability to alter the endocrine function in fish through interaction with the estrogen receptor (ER). Many of these chemicals are also able to interfere with the endocrine system through other mechanisms of action, however. The plasma sex steroid-binding protein (SBP), which is involved in regulating circulating levels of endogenous sex steroids, has recently been proposed to contribute to pollutant induced disruption of endocrine homeostasis. The objective of the present work was to determine whether industrial effluents contain chemicals that are able to modulate the endocrine system through interference with the function of the ER and SBP using in vitro biological assays (bioassays) from rainbow trout. The results show that solid phase extracts of process water (produced water) from an oil production facility in the North Sea and a land-based oil refinery contain chemicals that are able to induce estrogenic effects as well as displace natural sex steroid 17β-estradiol from the SBP. The bioactive chemicals were found to be partly resistant to biological degradation, but the identity of the chemicals was not determined. The alkylphenol 4-tert-butylphenol, which is known to occur in effluents from various oil production facilities, was found to be estrogenic and displace 17β-estradiol from the SBP and may thus contribute to the observed endocrine disrupting activity.

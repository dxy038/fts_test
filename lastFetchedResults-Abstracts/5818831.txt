Objective: To observe the effect of creatine phosphate sodium (Italian Alfa Wassermann product) and enalapril towards the reversal of early renal injure. Methods: 66 cases of early renal injury patients were randomly divided into a treatment group (n = 45) and a control group (n = 21). Both were given enalapril 10mg orally twice a day on the basis of treating the primary diseases. The treatment group was also given creatine phosphate sodium 2.0g IV daily. Urine microalbumin (MAU) and N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) of the morning urine of both groups were checked before and after two weeks treatment regime. The results: After the treatment, MAU and NAG in both groups reduced, but the change is more evident and statistically significant in treatment group. Conclusion: Creatine phosphate sodium exhibits a significant protective effect on renal injury. With the combination of enalapril in treatment, creatine phosphate sodium is superior to enalapril alone.

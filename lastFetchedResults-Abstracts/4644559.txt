Traditional preventive control strategies do not take into account the likelihood of each potential contingency, thus the dispatch results may often be conservative or radical. Aiming to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between economy and security, this paper develops a risk-oriented preventive control (ROPC) strategy. A three-state weather model is introduced to reflect the impact of weather conditions on the failure rate of transmission lines. Using the multi-objective optimization (MO) method, system security level associated with overload risk can be controlled in advance. A distance based multi-objective particle optimization (DSMOPSO) algorithm is adopted to solve the MO problem. Simulation results obtained on a six-bus system are analyzed in comparison with OPF and PSCOPF to show that the proposed ROPC could provide a useful decision-making tool to keep an optimal balance between system operational cost and overload risk in different weather conditions.

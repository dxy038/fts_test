The objective of the present work is the global stabilization of a cart-pendulum system. First, an energy shaping algorithm is developed to bring up the pendulum to the close vicinity of its upright equilibrium point. The energy control technique employed here also takes care of the practical constraint of limited cart track length. Next, a sliding mode controller (SMC) does the task of keeping the pendulum at its upright position. The real-time implementation of the control scheme is carried out for the cart-inverted pendulum system. The robustness under uncertainty caused by dry friction, plant parameter variations; disturbance rejection and noise attenuation of the SMC have been investigated thoroughly in real-time.

With increasing development of Internet, grid as a new structure of distributed network will be discussed more and more, while its security is facing the heavy challenge and restricts application of grid. The international research shows that grid security is on the way to trustworthy grid. Apart from current trust model, the future trust model in grid should add users´ behaviors reflecting users´ the subjective and objective characteristics those is asymmetric. Trust based on user behavior not only can reduce or avoid the contact with the malicious user, but also can reduce additional costs from monitoring and prevention for mutual trust between different users. Traditional trust model could not solve the problem, that user has different trust evaluation result because of different transaction and behaviors. Thus, considering different behaviors of user in transaction, a recommender trust model based behavior is proposed.

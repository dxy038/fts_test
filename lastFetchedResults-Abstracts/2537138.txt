Many energy-harvesting devices use the piezoelectric elements in order to convert mechanical vibrations into usable electrical energy. The input excitation is usually assumed to be a deterministic harmonic wave, while, in practical situations, the mechanical excitation of the media is a random signal. The objective of this work is to study energy harvesting in the piezoelectric devices using the random vibration theory. In the first step, a lumped parameter physical model of the device is presented. A mathematical model is then developed by acquiring the normalized differential equations governing the voltage induced in the energy-harvesting circuit as well as the length of the piezoelectric materials. The random vibration theory is then utilized to derive the analytical expressions for the statistical properties voltage, power, and length of the piezoelectric materials in terms of the statistical properties of the excitation, which is assumed to be a band limited white noise. It is shown that with a proper selection of the system parameters, the expected value for the harvested power can be effectively maximized. The qualitative and quantitative knowledge resulting from this effort is expected to enable the analysis, optimization, and synthesis of the energy-harvesting piezoelectric devices.

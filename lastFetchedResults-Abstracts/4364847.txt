An example of an application of multi-objective control based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is presented. H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimization is used to synthesize a dynamic output feedback controller for a microsatellite subject to disturbances, important sensor time delay, actuator saturation and flexible modes. The reduced controller is compared with a classical phase lead controller and finally validated with the complete nonlinear satellite model

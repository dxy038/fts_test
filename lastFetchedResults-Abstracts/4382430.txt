An active handover control scheme for multicamera tracking in surveillance systems is proposed to achieve the objective of real-time seamless monitoring on a specific subject. These cooperative cameras can track a moving target quickly and keep the target within their viewing scope at all times by using an embedded system, which controls image processing, calculates the cameraÂ´s angle of rotation, and handover protocol for the peer system. The control station controls cooperation among multiple cameras, including coordination based on spatial relationships. This paper also proposes effective deployment methods for cameras in a variety of layouts. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and performance of real-time tracking on a moving target.

In the transportation planning for some industrial wastes, in addition to hauling cost, environmental impact must frequently be considered. A notable example is transporting waste soil generated by major construction projects. Adequate transportation planning is particularly important for construction in a metropolitan area. In this study, we present a novel two-phase approach to address the multiple-criteria decision problem. The first phase applies the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to obtain a "composite impedance" for each road sector where transportation costs, environmental impact, and traffic congestion are considered in the evaluation. The second phase employs fuzzy mathematical programming to find the optimal transportation network based on the fuzzy impedance. An illustrative example is provided for the transportation planning for waste soil of the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system construction project. The optimal solutions using the proposed approach are compared with the solutions using the conventional shortest-path approach where minimizing the transportation cost is the only objective.

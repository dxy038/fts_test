In this paper we present a novel access strategy for bidirectional CATV network which uses the existing and widespread coax distribution infrastructure to provide high speed and cost-effective multi-service access. This system adopts IEEE802 3ah as Media Access Control (MAC) protocol, just as the same as that of EPON over the P2MP coaxial networks, so that it is with the feature of seamless connection with EPON, passing the Ethernet date to subscribers over coaxial networks. Besides PHY of the system is separated with MAC layer, therefore different PHY layer can be applied to build up the EOC system for various customer groups. And experimental results are presented at the end of the paper to demonstrate the favourable performance of the proposed system

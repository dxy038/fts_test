This paper reports an improved method for neglecting the distance effect in extracellular neuron recording and objective comparison of biological and electro-chemical properties between gold (Au) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) based microelectrode arrays (MEA). The response amplitude of action potential using MWCNTs that marked by a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as high as 50.06&#177; 1.47 dB. Whether the MEA located in different positions, the average SNR is more than 1.5-fold for the MWCNTs compared to the Au electrode.

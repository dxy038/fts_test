The objective of the Seasat-A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system was to detect ocean waves from orbital altitudes. An SAR system operating at 1275 MHz (23-cm wavelength) was designed and built to meet this objective. The choice of wavelength was the result of imagery obtained by aircraft during 1972 to 1974 and ease of implementation. The Seasat. A SAR system was turned on in orbit on July 4, 1978, and gathered imagery until the spacecraft bus failed in orbit in October 1978.

The objective of this paper was to study MEC performance at steady-state conditions in continuous mode and to analyse MEC performance in terms of chemical efficiency. At steady-state operation, a current density of 10.2 A m−2 (applied voltage 1.0 V) for a set-up with an AEM was produced, compared to 7.2 A m−2 for a set-up with a CEM. For all applied voltages, total internal resistance for the AEM configuration was lower than or the CEM configuration. Therefore, energy input for the AEM configuration is lower than for the CEM configuration. In case a CEM is used, the conductivity in the cathode reaches high values: &gt;130 mS cm−1. This conductivity is mainly caused by the presence of Na+ (7.8 g L−1), K+ (12.2 g L−1) and OH− (8.3 g L−1). Furthermore, MECs perform better at high buffer and electrolyte concentrations. However, as current density does not increase proportionally with increase in chemicals, the effectiveness of chemical addition decreases when more chemicals are added. Therefore, addition of chemicals and buffer does not necessarily enhance performance but increases operational costs.

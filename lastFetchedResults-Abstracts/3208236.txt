Several applications in recent years require high speed motors to drive the systems. Among these applications, switched reluctance motors (SRM) have been widely considered due to its several advantages. The objective of this paper is to develop a low cost drive for the high speed SRM based on simple logic gates for supercharger application. The proposed drive can operate in three different modes: normal angle, advanced angle, overlapped angle, resulting in different performances in terms of accelerations and maximum achievable speed. The advantages of the proposed system includes simplicity, low cost and ease of installation.

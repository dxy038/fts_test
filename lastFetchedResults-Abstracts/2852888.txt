&#9608; For current aircraft a manual optimal design of DIMA architectures is almost impossible &#9608; Support thru model and algorithms: Avionics Architect + Toolbox &#9608; Network topology optimization calculates switches, links, and signal routings &#9608; Stripping down an overdimensioned topology with combinatorial optimization &#9608; Multi-objective optimization using Pareto-Front-Sampling &#9608; A320-like use case demonstrated full scope &#9608; A380-like use case shows large-scale feasibility &#9608; In every case improved architectures were found and insights gained &#9657; Model and optimization are a valuable assistants to learn, improve and justify architectures

We are investigating the millimeter-wave sintering of polycrystalline ceramic laser materials. The objective is to produce materials with optical quality comparable to that of single crystals. Advantages of polycrystalline laser materials are expected to include high thermal conductivity, flexible dopant concentration, reasonable cost, and shorter processing times. Results for neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) and yttrium oxide are presented. Studies have been done at 83 GHz, with a Gycom, Ltd. gyrotron.

In a previous work, we published multidisciplinary experiences on teaching the design of electronics 2.0 systems for social change. In this paper we present the lasts changes done in our framework. The most important change currently is the inclusion of a new course from the business creation and development academic program. Previous experiences have been considered only computer-related engineering and industrial design students. This new step presents improvements in our previous process. Since the new included academic program has the objective to graduate students with an enterprise, the integration of our previous experience and this new academic program is a win-win junction to achieve that goal. The main objective is to create a new generation of electronics products that adds social capital to the society through its use. This approach to promote the entrepreneurship spirit in our undergraduate students can be considered as pragmatic since students from electronic engineering and industrial design are not following a formal entrepreneur education. We will present the results of surveys that take into account several institutional criteria.

Conventional shunt hybrid active power filter must endure fundamental voltage of power system. To overcome the disadvantage, a new kind shunt hybrid active power filter is researched which is suitable to high power system by installing the active power filter in parallel of fundamental series resonance branch. Based on the summing-up of its electric model, issues in their realization such as sharp rise on dc-link voltage, resonance between filter and grid are analyzed in detail. Multi-objective genetic algorithm is put forward to optimize the parameters of the injection branch in hybrid active power filter. The above parameter design method restrains the resonance and rise on dc-link voltage effectively, and ensure the injection ability of harmonic currents. Simulation and industrial application results have testified that the shunt hybrid active power filter using the parameter designed by the proposed method can achieve high performance in reactive power compensation and harmonic suppression.

This paper presents the ITCÂ´02 SOC test benchmarks. The purpose of this new benchmark set is to stimulate research into new methods and tools for modular testing of SOCs and to enable the objective comparison of such methods and tools with respect to effectiveness and efficiency. The paper defines the benchmark format and naming scheme, and presents the benchmark SOCs. In addition, it provides an overview of the research problems that can be addressed and evaluated by means of this benchmark set. These research problems include the design of optimized test access infrastructures and test schedules.

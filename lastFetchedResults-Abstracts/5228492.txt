This paper presents the stochastic management methodology to determine the decision points in an e- commerce setting, specially online shopping. The system deals with the multi-server system with regard to the "shopping time" (or human factor) that is spent by the customer who wants to buy something online. This theoretical approach is more practical and realistic than the single-server system. Explicit formulas obtained demonstrate an easy usage of the main stochastic characteristics and the stochastic optimization of these objective function.

The optimal design of the quenching quality using technical parameters is a problem with high dimensional multi-objective and with complicated calculations &amp; constraints. A novel general method for high dimensional multi-objective optimal design is presented based on degree of grey incidence with hybrid discrete variables. Making response surface mathematical model, multi-objective optimization of the quenching quality using technical parameters is fulfilled by the proposed method. The results show that the quenching quality using technological parameters after optimization is much better than the quenching quality using technical parameters before optimization. All the items of evaluation objectives are improved after optimization.

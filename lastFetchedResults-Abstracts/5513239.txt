Airport gate assignment is to appoint a gate for the arrival or leave flight to ensure that the flight is on schedule. Assigning the airport gate with high efficiency and reason is a key task among the airport ground busy works. A model of airport gate assignment based on the embedded analysis of the actual airport gate assignment for a busy domestic civil airport is proposed. The objective of the problem is to maximize the sum of the all products of the flight eigenvalue and the gate eigenvalue which the flight assigned. The flight type and the flight downtime and the number of airline passengers are considered in the flight eigenvalue and the ease of the gate is considered in the gate eigenvalue. The solution space of the problem based on the dynamic scheduling parallel machines and a directed graph model are given. The solving method based on the branch and bound algorithm is designed. Simulation result shows the validity of this model and algorithm.

In this paper, a novel bidirectional UPS is proposed. The proposed UPS includes three main parts: (1) a pre-regulator; (2) a voltage regulation inductor; and (3) a bidirectional power converter. The pre-regulator is used for reducing the variation of the mains voltage within &#177;5%. The regulation inductor and the bidirectional converter are used for the fine voltage regulation. Because the value of regulation inductor is very important, it may affect the performance of the proposed UPS. In this paper, a steady-state model for parameter design is proposed. By using this model, the value of regulation inductor can be determined

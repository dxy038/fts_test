This paper presents a team player based modeling approach to communication structures in microgrids. The modeling follows a game theoretic framework by forming teams inside the Small Scale Power Systems (SSPS). The team players are able to minimize the common objective when there is communication, and shift to the individual objectives when communication fails. The paper also presents analysis to determine the minimal performance standards for the given level of communicated information. The last part of the paper shows how the Stackelberg concept can be integrated to the micro-grid for a leader-follower modeling approach. Example systems are simulated to explain each case.

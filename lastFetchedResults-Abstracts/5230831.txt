An improved non-negative matrix factorization with sparseness constraints (INMFSC) is proposed by imposing an additional constraint on the objective function of NMFSC, which can control the sparseness of both the basis vectors and the coefficient matrix simultaneously. The update rules to solve the objective function with constraints are presented. Research of ear recognition and its application is a new subject in the field of biometrics authentication. In practical application, ear is maybe partially occluded by hair etc. So the proposed INMFSC is applied on ear recognition with normal images and partially occluded images. Experiment results show that, compared with the traditional NMFSC, the proposed method not only obtains higher recognition rate, but also improves the sparseness and the orthogonality of coefficient matrix

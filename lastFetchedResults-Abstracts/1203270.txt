The present study aims to investigate the effect of human capital on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition at knowledge based firms in Yazd’s science and technology park of Eghbal. Research methodology of this paper is the applied research in terms of the objective of the study, descriptive-correlated in terms of the data gathering method, and quantitative in terms of the type of data. Our statistical population includes 75 managers of knowledge based firms in Yazd’s science and technology park of Eghbal. Due to the limited numbers of managers, we decided to apply the census method for sampling. We used structural equation modeling with smart PLS 2 software for analyzing data in two sections of measurement model and structural model. In measurement model section, technical features of the questionnaire in terms of reliability, convergent validity, and discriminate validity were investigated. Moreover, in structural model section, path coefficients were used for testing hypotheses. The results indicate the positive and significant effect of human capital on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition at knowledge based firms in our sample. Thus, in order to get a better recognition of entrepreneurial opportunities through an organization, we should enhance the conditions of human capital.

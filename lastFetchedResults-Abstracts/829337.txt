The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between some physical and mechanical properties and calculate a regression equation with respect to three irrigation treatments for the IL111 varieties of safflower seeds, typically cultivated in Iran. Physical and mechanical properties of safflower seeds were determined at 7% (w.b.) moisture content. Effect of mass, geometric mean diameter, sphericity and surface area were considered on rupture force, deformation at rupture point, rupture energy and hardness. Result showed a significant effect on some mechanical properties at P?0.05. Moreover, it was observed that there exist good relationships between seed mass and geometric mean diameter, sphericity and surface area with mechanical properties for specific treatments. There was not a strong relationship for safflower seed deformation as a function of mass, sphericity and geometric mean diameter.

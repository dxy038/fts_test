In this paper, we deal with a traffic demand clustering problem for designing SONET-WDM rings. The
objective is to minimize the total cost of optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs) and inter-ring hub
equipments, while satisfying intra-ring and inter-ring capacities. Also, the minimum number of nodes,
for example three, for each ring should be satisfied. We develop an integer programming (IP) formulation
for the problem and develop some valid inequalities that provide a tight lower bound for the problem.
Dealing with the inherent computational complexity of the problem, we also devise an effective tabu
search procedure for finding a feasible solution of good quality within reasonable computing time. Computational
results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the lower and upper bound procedures for
solving the problem.

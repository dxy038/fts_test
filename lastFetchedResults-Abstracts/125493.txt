Objective(s): To determine the effect of pre-operation training on pre-and post operation anxiety in patients undergoing open-heart surgery.
Methods: This was quasi-experimental study. In this study, the patients were randomly divided into cases and controls so that the effect of training on anxiety in the units can be assessed (50 patients in each group). Data were collected using a three- part questionnaire: (1) Demographic variables, (2) Objective anxiety symptoms (blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate), and (3) The Spiel Berger questionnaire.
The research was carried out in three stages. During the first stage a questionnaire was given to both groups on the day of admission for the evaluating level of anxiety. Then only the under-training group was educated with regard to various kinds of nursing cares and post-operation cooperation. During the second stage (one day before the operation) the same questionnaire was given to both groups and again the level of anxiety was measured. Then during the third stage, which followed the operation (3-5 hours after tracheal extubation) the questionnaire was again given to both groups.
Results: After statistical analysis and comparison of all three stages, the results indicated that during the first stage both groups had a similar level of anxiety while after training at the second and third stages the level of anxiety in the control group was still high, but decreased in the cases (P<0.0001). Conclusion: Providing pre-operation and post-operation training is effective for reduction in anxiety and boosts patient cooperation for more rapid improvement and the earlier discharge.

The ultimate objective of the problem solving system is to provide an interrelated framework for prospective users to facilitate their work, such as biological and biomedical knowledge retrieval, discovery, capture. In addition to this objective, there is demand for secure and practical computing algorithms which address the challenge to safely outsource data processing onto remote computing resources. This allows users to confidently outsource computation over sensitive information from the security level of the remote delegate. In this paper, we present the computing algorithms which preserve privacy of users and confidentiality of service providers in the cloud environment.

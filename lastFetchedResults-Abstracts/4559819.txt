A critical problem in wireless sensor networks is to maximize their lifetimes. Data aggregation is an effective method to reduce redundant data and minimize the overall energy consumption. This method requires data to be delayed and processed in their paths to the sink node, so it causes extra time delay to the networks. This paper studies the aggregation node selection problem in sensor networks with time delay constraint, and the objective is to minimize the overall energy consumption of networks. A dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. This algorithm can turn out the optimal solution in polynomial time. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm; the results show the efficiency of the algorithm in energy consumption reduction.

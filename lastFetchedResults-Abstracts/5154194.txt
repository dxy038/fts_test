This paper presents a method of reducing the response time to system operators of static contingency screening. To achieve this objective, the reactive loss compensation index is selected as the critical system factor and an approximate power flow model is employed to solve line flow non-iteratively. The index determines the severity of transmission line contingencies. The compensation index in line outage situation is obtained, first, by evaluating the amount of reactive losses on the lines connected to the system load buses, and second, by determining the appropriate reactive compensation required to maintain their pre-contingency voltage magnitude. The compensation is simulated by applying artificial Var compensators placed at the load buses. The effectiveness of the new method in screening performance and computation time reduction is tested on the standard IEEE 30-bus system.

Objective: To quantitatively evaluate the healing and bone changes in the mandible of adult female rats following unilateral extraction of the mandibular molars and the incisor. Methods: Six-month old female rats had their mandibular molars and the incisor on one side of the mandible extracted. Nine rats were sacrificed at 0, 14, 28, 56 and 112 days post-extraction. Bone mineral density (BMD) as observed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and histomorphometric measurements of total bone volume (TBV/TV%) as well as changes in size; height and width on backscattered electron microscopy images of cross-sections of the mandible were evaluated. Results: There was a total increase of 28% in BMD of the body of the mandible and 35.1% increase in TBV/TV% at 112 days post-extraction. A maximal increase of 25% in BMD was observed at 14 days post-extraction. TBV/TV% increased by 9.5% at 14 days post-extraction and further increased by 15.9% (P&lt;0.001) from 14 to 28 days and by 9.2% (P&lt;0.001) from 28 to 56 days. A further slight but non-significant increase of 6% (P=0.108) occurred from 56 to 112 days post-extraction. Regression equations demonstrated that the maximal increase in TBV/TV% and BMD occurred between 0 and 28 days, which subsequently slowed down between 28 and 56 days and further declined between 56 and 112 days post-extraction. Healing was associated with a reduction in cross-sectional area (32.89%), height (21%) and width of the mandible (12.84%). Conclusions: BMD of the edentulous mandible following extraction of manibular molars and the incisor on one side of the mandible increases up to 56 days, but that total bone volume increases up to 112 days post-extraction. This indicates that bone volume measurement is more sensitive than BMD measurements in detecting small increase in bone formation at later stages of healing, possibly because of changes in geometry of the edentulous mandible following teeth extraction. The edentulous mandible undergoes a significant reduction in size as a result of reduction in both height and width up to 112 days post-extraction.

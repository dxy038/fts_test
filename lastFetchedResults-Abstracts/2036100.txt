This paper presents an evolutionary programming based genetic algorithm approach for the solution of multi-constrained complex unit commitment and economic dispatch problem in electrical power system. A unit commitment in power system is used for deciding and planning for optimium generation of power from generating unit according to load demand at particular hour. Genetic algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm which works on the principle of natural selection like "survival of fittest". In the case study, 5 power generating units system for 12 hour period of cycle is considered. The objective is to minimize the total operating cost subjected to system constraints, and generate a solutions for economically use of power generating unit.

The cooperative work process and the automation work flow of the no man keeping watch library which takes the robot as its center and uses the internet of things technology are firstly introduced in this paper. A new data format of the RFID electronic label for books is designed, and the robustness of positioning of the manipulator is improved by the information fusion of the RFID label source and the CCD sensor source installed on the manipulator. A position method named THREE STEPS by the combination of fuzzy position, area position and accurate position is advanced, and the complex books positioning and grasping question is transformed into the world coordinate solving question of some point on the objective book. The fuzzy CMAC (cerebella model articulation controller) neuron network is adapted to realize the non-line relationship of fusion feature and manipulator position. And direct vision servo control architecture is used when designing the manipulator position system. The experiment result has proved this method can help the manipulator realize the accurate position and rapid catching.

Using the method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to evaluate objects to be selected, defects will be brought by using subjective weight method or objective method individually to determine index weights. In this paper, a method is proposed based on IOWA operator. A variety of subjective and objective weights are integrated into a new reasonable comprehensive index weight. The quality of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is improved by using this method. Verified by an example that a 500kV substation site to be selected is evaluated, evaluation results obtained by using this method are consistent with the actual project selection.

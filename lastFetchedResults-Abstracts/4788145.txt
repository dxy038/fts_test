This contribution is concerned with a nonlinear control design for diesel engines equipped with a variable geometry turbocharger and an exhaust gas recirculation valve. The control objective is to supply an amount of fresh air and to achieve a desired pressure in the intake manifold for the actual operating point of the engine. The well known differential equations describing such a system are split into parts with a slow, and a fast transient response and transformed into the standard form for singular perturbed systems. For the proposed controller, the slow part is extended with two integrating states and asymptotic stability of the closed loop system in the sense of Lyapunov is guaranteed using singular perturbation methods. Finally, the performance of the controller is demonstrated by simulation results.

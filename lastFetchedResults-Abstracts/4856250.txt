The purpose of the paper is to introduce a frame-based approach to scientific computing on distributed computing platforms. The objective of the effort is to introduce well-defined mappings between the representations of physical phenomena as mathematical structures and the computational algorithms for modeling that phenomena on high-performance parallel computing platforms. Using this approach, we identify representations that solve classes of scientific problems based on the computational structure required for solution on parallel processors. Thus, once the representation is defined for a particular problem, the mapping onto a parallel computing environment can be managed automatically in software. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach by application to a combustion modeling problem

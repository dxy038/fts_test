By trying to increase the luminosity or the life expectancy of an incandescent lamp, an idea consists of a series of successive
rolling up of the tungsten filament. This gives geometrical configurations of filaments named simple, twin, or triple
helical spring, etc. . . In this paper, we will limit only to the cases of the simple and twin helical spring filaments. Under the
combined effects of the high temperature and the stresses induced by its own weight, the filament creeps by becoming plastically
deformed in a permanent and a continuously manner, until the rupture. The theoretical study of the behaviour of
these filaments needs the knowledge of internal efforts distribution, deformations modes, and their evolutions. The present
work consists on an elastic structural analysis which must be the first step. Since the objective is also to study the influence
of the filament self-weight solicitation, the orientation (or position) with respect to gravitational direction should be taken
into account. Numerical results are obtained by finite element method. They showed a negligible influence of the solicitations
due to the variation of the temperature with respect to those of the self-weight, and a relative sensitivity to the position
changes for the twin helical spring filament. For this later, we have developed an analytical method which is only valid
in the case of a vertical position. Because of some difficulties, the comparison between the numerical and analytical results
could not be carried out directly. However, the analytical approach proved to be qualitatively useful for the analysis of
numerical results.

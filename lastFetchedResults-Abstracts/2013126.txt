Enhancing the properties of dental resin composites is of interest to researchers. The
objective of the present investigation was to improve the strength and fracture toughness of dental
composites via addition of silicon carbide whiskers and substitution of commonly used filler
materials with stabilized zirconia ceramic powder. It was also intended to study the effect of
powder- to- whisker ratio on mechanical properties of the resultant composites. The flextural
strength and fracture toughness of composite samples with different whiskers loadings were
measured. It was found that addition of whiskers to the composites enhances the mechanical
properties of the composites. The strength and fracture toughness increased by increasing the
amount of whiskers. The flextural strength of a composite having 60wt% whisker and 10wt%
zirconia powder was about 210 MPa while that of the composite having only 60wt% ceramic
powder was about 110 MPa. The microstructural examinations revealed that reinforcing
mechanism was whiskers pull-out as well as crack deflection

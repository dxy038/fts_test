Modern remote education engineering experimental teaching is an important way to cultivate talents with applied competence. The implementation of the experimental teaching should be constructed as a complete system, and the thinking principle of the resource design as well the basic framework of this construction should be more systemic and pertinence. In this paper, the model is constructed based on the relationships of all the factors influencing the experimental learning system. The optimization analysis of the model objective is made according to the influence of each factor on the model objective. Combined with the results of the optimization analysis, a better engineering experimental teaching system for remote education which is more suitable for the learning of the continuing education students can be constructed.

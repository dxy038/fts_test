A three-dimensional numerical model is presented for three-phase ßow (moisture, air, and heat) in a deformable
partly saturated soil with deformation calculated via a non-linear elastic theory. The present work is an
extension of a two-dimensional analysis presented by Thomas and He.1 The objective of this work is the
solution of problems of greater geometric complexity. The mathematical formulation of this coupled
problem consists of four governing equations, developed from the principles of mass and energy conservations
as well as the stress equilibrium equation. DarcyÕs ßow law is used to describe the motion of liquid and
air in the porous medium, and a Philip and de Vries type vapour ßow approach is employed in the
formulation. A Galerkin Þnite element method coupled with a Þnite di¤erence recurrence relationship is
used to obtain simultaneous solutions to the governing equations where pore liquid, pore air pressures,
temperature and displacements are the primary variables. The method allows the non-linear nature of the
soil parameters to be modelled. Three-dimensional 20-noded isoparametric elements are used to simulate
di¤erent types of cases for the veriÞcation of the work. Results are presented of the application of the new
model to four problems, two of which are isothermal and two heating simulations. The three-dimensional
nature of the results achieved is highlighted. Copyright

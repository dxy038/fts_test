The clustering problem is cast in the framework of possibility theory. The approach differs from the existing clustering methods in that the resulting partition of the data can be interpreted as a possibilistic partition, and the membership values can be interpreted as degrees of possibility of the points belonging to the classes, i.e., the compatibilities of the points with the class prototypes. An appropriate objective function whose minimum will characterize a good possibilistic partition of the data is constructed, and the membership and prototype update equations are derived from necessary conditions for minimization of the criterion function. The advantages of the resulting family of possibilistic algorithms are illustrated by several examples

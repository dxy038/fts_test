Simulated annealing is a provably convergent optimizer for single-objective problems. Previously proposed multiobjective extensions have mostly taken the form of a single-objective simulated annealer optimizing a composite function of the objectives. We propose a multiobjective simulated annealer utilizing the relative dominance of a solution as the system energy for optimization, eliminating problems associated with composite objective functions. We also propose a method for choosing perturbation scalings promoting search both towards and across the Pareto front. We illustrate the simulated annealer´s performance on a suite of standard test problems and provide comparisons with another multiobjective simulated annealer and the NSGA-II genetic algorithm. The new simulated annealer is shown to promote rapid convergence to the true Pareto front with a good coverage of solutions across it comparing favorably with the other algorithms. An application of the simulated annealer to an industrial problem, the optimization of a code-division-multiple access (CDMA) mobile telecommunications network´s air interface, is presented and the simulated annealer is shown to generate nondominated solutions with an even and dense coverage that outperforms single objective genetic algorithm optimizers.

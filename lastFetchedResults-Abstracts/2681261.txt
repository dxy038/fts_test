The concept of sustainability in supply chain management refers to a
logical balance between economic development, environmental considerations, and social
responsibilities. In this paper, a sustainable model has been proposed to design a supply
chain network in textile industries considering the key environmental and social factors.
Regarding the type of industry and characteristics of the area under study (Zanjan,
northwest Iran), minimizing the negative eects of wasteful extraction of ground waters and
the environmental pollution resulting from industrial wastewaters and maximizing justicebased
employment were considered. The supply chain consists of the following elements:
suppliers, plants, distribution centers, water renery centers, and customer zones. One of
the important features of the proposed model is that it considers the lost opportunity cost
of facilities and focuses on wastewater recycling in water reneries. To solve the model, the
Multi-Objective Vibration Damping Optimization (MOVDO) algorithm has been used. In
addition, to evaluate the proposed model, as a case study, the supply chain network design
problem was solved in textile industry. In addition, to evaluate the solution performance of
the used algorithm in comparison with that of the NSGA-II algorithm, ten random problems
with dierent sizes were solved, and the results were analyzed using dierent indexes. All
in all, the results show that the proposed method has the necessary performance.

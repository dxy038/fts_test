Objective: This study aimed to assess deficits of cognitive and emotional aspects of theory of&nbsp;mind in patients with bipolar disorder type 1 within a remission period.
Methods: In this case- control study, 30 bipolar patients and 30 normal individuals were&nbsp;selected through Purposive sampling method for the purpose of the study. Then, they were&nbsp;matched based on their educational background and age. Finally, all participants were asked&nbsp;to complete the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), eyes test, Theory of Mind Picture
Stories Tasks. Data were analyzed using the independent t-test.
Results: Results show that there is a significant difference between two groups regarding their&nbsp;scores of cognitive theory of mind (t=4.85, P<0.01). and emotional theory of mind(t=4.54,&nbsp;P<0.01). and their reaction time for cognitive test(t=10.34, P<0.01) and emotional test(t=4.61,&nbsp;P<0.01).
Conclusion: The results show that bipolar patients type I with remission period have deficit&nbsp;regarding cognitive and emotional theory of mind. And because of this, they are weak in&nbsp;understanding others &rsquo;cognitive mind states like opinions and ambitions, and others&rsquo; emotional&nbsp;mind states like feelings and emotions. In fact, it can be concluded that the deficit in Theory of&nbsp;cognitive and emotional mind in bipolar patients with remission period can be the result of the&nbsp;malfunction of brain regions and cognitive infrastructures like executive performances.

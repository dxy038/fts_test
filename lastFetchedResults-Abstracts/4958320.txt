The paper presents the concept of an adaptive neighbor list management mechanism that has as objective to control the quality of radio links over a wide range of offered traffic in wireless communication systems. An algorithm to adapt the size of the neighbor lists , and therefore their composition to fluctuations in traffic conditions is presented. The concepts of this algorithm are supported by a comprehensive system level simulation study. The wireless technology used as a case study is the UMTS TD-CDMA, however the observations are generally valid, irrespective of the technology. It is shown that a reduced neighbor list can enhance the radio link quality at heavy traffic loading while the system can continue to operate at acceptable call blocking rates. The outcome of the adaptive algorithm may result in pushing the system to operate at heavier loads while still offering acceptable individual radio link quality.

In this paper we investigate two different multi-island structures (namely mesh-structure and clique-structure) based on Single-Electron Tunneling (SET) technology, and study the experimental behaviors in terms of their tolerance to random background charges (RBCs) which are a big concern with SET logic. As an alternative redundancy scheme, both structures are applied to an SET-based NAND logic gate for detailed discussions. Our main objective is to show that the proposed multi-island structures are more tolerant to RBCs over the islands when compared with single-island SET logic. Further comparison between the two structures is also shown through the experiments.

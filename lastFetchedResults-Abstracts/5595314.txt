The objective of this paper is to evaluate a single-phase claw pole machine where the magnetic core is made of a soft magnetic mouldable composite material (SM<sup>2</sup>C). SM<sup>2</sup>C has low permeability but also very low remagnetization losses, which makes this kind of material very suitable for high frequency applications. Therefore, the high speed characteristics of the single-phase claw-pole machine are in focus on theoretical analysis and practical evaluations.

In this paper, an approach to solve a flow assignment problem is proposed assuming known the whole trip planning of the fleets. The objective is to minimize both the risk of the network associated to the DG transport flow and the variance of the assigned delivery planning in respect to the expected one. Different simulation tests have been performed to evaluate the goodness of the proposed model, planning one or two deliveries from different OD pairs, varying risk values on the links of the network during the time horizon. The results demonstrates that model application guarantees a decrease of risk costs splitting flows on multiple paths avoiding to transit on links characterized by an high risk at a certain time, as well as the respect of expecting flow over each link.

The objective of this panel is to reflect on the advances that volume rendering has brought to the medical community and, even more important, to discuss its current short-comings and future needs. This direct feedback from the medical community will hopefully inspire the IEEE Visualization audience and help to focus on new research areas that will further advance the state of the art in medical visualization. The panel assembles end-users from well-known medical facilities and research institutions who have a background in visualization but primarily are experts using this technology for practical diagnostic applications.

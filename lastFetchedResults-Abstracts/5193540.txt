Presents a zero-one programming of transforming an ordinary Petri net into a colored Petri net. The transformation is based on the similarity measures embedded in the initial Petri net. The objective function is to maximize the compactness of the colored Petri net subject to the constraints which are defined on places and transitions of the initial Petri net. The application of the model is illustrated using an example

A linear network of communicating processors is examined. The objective is to solve a computational problem in a minimal amount of time. The processors in the networks may be equipped either with or without front-end processors for communication off-loading. The cases of equal division of processing load and optimal division of processing load are discussed for both the network with front-end processors and the network without front end processors. An example of the inclusion of solution time, the time taken for processors to report the solution back to the problem originator, is also presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

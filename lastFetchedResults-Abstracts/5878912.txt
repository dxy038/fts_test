In this paper the operation of 50 kW PEM fuel cell system as distributed generation is studied. The objective of this work is to develop the modeling and control framework for such distributed generation to enable their operation in a distribution system. A new control strategy for the operation of the fuel cell system in both grid connected and islanded modes is proposed to enable better management of energy sources within the system. The operation of the new controller is demonstrated using simulation results of SimPowerSystem Toolbox in Matlab/Simulink software.

This paper proposes a bidirectional interleaved current-fed voltage doubler for high power applications with natural voltage clamping. Owing to zero current switching of current-fed devices, it is a snubberless topology. Zero voltage switching of secondary devices is achieved. Interleaving reduces the conduction losses in semiconductor devices. Therefore, overall high efficiency is obtained. Soft-switching and voltage-clamping is inherent and load independent. Steady state analysis, design, and simulation results are presented. Experimental results on 500 W prototype have been demonstrated to show performance of the proposed converter and modulation. Output capacitor voltages are balanced.

The objective of this study is to develop a micromechanical approach for determining the fracture toughness. A phase-field model for grain growth is employed to generate microstructures with varying attributes and the cohesive finite element method is employed to quantify the interaction between a propagating crack and microstructures of an AZ31 Mg alloy. Simulations show that fracture toughness increases as the average grain size decreases and that the local crack tip environment significantly affects the fracture behavior. Dramatically different dependences of fracture toughness on overall strain rate are seen when two different types of cohesive laws are employed.

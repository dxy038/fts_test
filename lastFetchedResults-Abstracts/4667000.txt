The objective of the P.0. Pistilli Scholarship program is to increase the pool of professionals in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science from under represented groups (women, African American, Hispanic, Native American, and physically challenged). In 1989, ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (SIGDA) began providing the program. Beginning in 1993, the Design Automation Conference provided the funds for the scholarship, and SIGDA continues to administer the program for DAC. DAC normally funds two or more $4000 scholarships, renewable up to 5 years, to graduatiiig high school seniors. The 2005 winners are: Elizabeth Hong-An Boi Ha - attending Georgia Institute of Technology and Hans Edgar Anderson - attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

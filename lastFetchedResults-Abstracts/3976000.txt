This paper deals with the McDonnell Aircraft (MCAIR) approach to achieving the objectives of R&amp;M 2000. The ``Direction and Goals´´, Objective 1, and ``Industry Commitment´´, Objective 6, are primarily addressed as they have the most impact on industry. Independent Research and Development (IRAD) efforts for R&amp;M Design Approaches and Supportability show how an aircraft support system can be operated to increase availability at reduced cost and manpower requirements. R&amp;M 2000 establishes the foundation of supportability by applying R&amp;M principles in balance with performance, cost, and schedule in the design process. Proper consideration of the integrated logistics support elements throughout this application has resulted in the highest levels of supportability possible. High supportability is essential to achieving the customer goal of increased warfighting capability at an affordable cost.

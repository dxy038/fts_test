An analytical solution for 1-D stationary problem of heat and IRradiation transfer in a plane layer under conductive, convective and radiation energy exchange with the environment has been obtained within the P1-approximation. Problems for heat and IR-radiation transfer in physical objects under their conductive, convective and radiative heat exchange with environment arise, in particular, when methods for non-contact thermometry for metal melts are developed. The paper objective is to study the correlation between the melt temperature and IRradiation emitting by it.

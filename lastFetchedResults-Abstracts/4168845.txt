The Clean Air Act charges the EPA with establishing and enforcing emission standards for automobiles to control emissions that cause or contribute to air pollution, which endangers the public welfare, as well as the public health. However, public welfare (or protection against economic losses caused by air pollution) is necessarily a secondary goal. The United States is so far from achieving the levels of clean air needed to protect health that it will not be meaningful to talk about emission control to protect welfare for some years to come.

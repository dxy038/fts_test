A study was initiated with the objective of evaluating the effects of sonication treatment on important quality parameters of extract of Bursa of Fabricius. Sonication of extract was done (frequency 20 kHz and various amplitude levels) at 0 Â°C for 10 min, 30 min, 50 min, respectively. As results, the yield of bursa peptides significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). Then we found sonicated bursa extract promoted the content of bursin and the CFU pre-B formation, exerted immunomodulatory function on antigen-specific immune responses in C57/BL6 mice immunized with inactivated Japanese encephalitis b virus (JEV) vaccine, including enhancing JEV-specific antibody and cytokine production, T-cell immunophenotyping and lymphocyte proliferation. Findings of the present study suggested the sonication treatment of Bursa of Fabricius could improve the yield as well as the quality of bursa peptides, indicating that sonication is effective in processing of bursa extract and could be a potential process for future immuno-pharmacological use.

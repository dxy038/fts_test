This publication describes a laboratory test program conducted with the objective to develop a test that would replace the existing DC withstand test. The article describes the methodology used to establish the voltage duration and magnitude of VLF (0.1 Hz) high voltage field tests suitable for crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) insulated power cable. The results show that the voltage breakdown of laboratory aged XLPE cable at 0.1 Hz is approximately equal to that at 60 Hz, that proof tests at 0.1 Hz cause very little damage to the cable, and that 0.1 Hz testing appears to be a satisfactory alternate to DC testing. Preliminary values are suggested for voltage magnitude and time duration of cable acceptance, maintenance and proof tests at 0.1 Hz for XLPE cable rated up to 35 kV. A program is underway to similarly evaluate samples of service-aged XLPE cable; as well as to demonstrate the use of the preliminary test values at typical utility installations

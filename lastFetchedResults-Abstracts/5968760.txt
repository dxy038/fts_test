Methods: Human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells cultured in vitro were treated with different concentrations of alteronol, Inhibition rate was detected by SRB assay. Cellular morphological changes were observed by AO/EB (acridine orange/ethidium bromide dye) staining. The apoptosis rate was determined by annexin V-FITC/propdium iodide assay. Cell cycle distribution was determined using a Flow Cytometry. Results: The proliferation of HL-60 cells treated with alteronol was inhibited in a dose dependent manner. Based on cell viability assay, observation on cell morphology and apoptosis rate, we confirmed that alteronol played an obvious role in proliferation inhibition in HL-60 cells, but it did not induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells in different concentrations groups. Conclusion: Alteronol could effectively inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells by leading to cell cycle arrest in Gl phase.

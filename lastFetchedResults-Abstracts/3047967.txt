In view of the need for effective usage of the battery energy of the electric motorcycle, we propose an integrated management system, which not only accomplishes the objective of robust velocity tracking but also efficiently utilizes the stored energy of the battery. This integrated management system is divided into three major subsystems, including the power-saving controller, energy supervisor and protection subsystem. The concept of intelligent decision is applied such that the redundant energy loss can be avoided. At the end, simulation and experimental results is given to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed integrated management system.

Linear programming optimizations on the intersection of <e1>k</e1> polyhedra in R<sup>3</sup>, represented by their outer recursive decompositions, are performed in expected time <e1>O</e1>(<e1>k</e1> log <e1>k</e1> log <e1>n</e1>+&#8730;<e1>k</e1> log <e1>k</e1> log<sup>3 </sup> <e1>n</e1>). This result is used to derive efficient algorithms for dynamic linear programming problems ill which constraints are inserted and deleted, and queries must optimize specified objective functions. As an application, an improved solution to the planar 2-center problem, is described

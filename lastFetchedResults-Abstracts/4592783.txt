Noninvasive imaging of inflammations of human joints using a new remote scanning technique is described; it uses the mm wave radiation emitted by the human body. This method overcomes the depth limitations of conventional infrared thermographs and can measure to subcutaneous depths of several mm with a temperature resolution of 0.25&#194;&#176;C. Measurements on rheumatoid arthritic knee joints are presented which show little correlation with simultaneously measured skin temperatures. Significant long term thermographic changes induced by steroid injection indicate a potential for objective patient monitoring and development of new treatment methods.

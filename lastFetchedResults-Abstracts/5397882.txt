This paper presents the integration of neural-stimulation capability into a miniature, wireless, and battery-operated neural-recording system based on the TelosB embedded sensor platform. The highly flexible wireless stimulator can be configured to generate constant-current, constant-voltage, monophasic, and biphasic stimulation pulses. Users have 8-bit control over stimulation amplitudes (up to 5V for constant-voltage stimulation, and up to 1mA for constant-current stimulation) and pulse durations (mus, ms, sec). A browser-based client has been developed to provide users an intuitive method to remotely activate stimulation. This work leverages the bidirectional communications capability of the TinyOS-based embedded sensors to remotely activate a single channel of user-configurable stimulation pulses.

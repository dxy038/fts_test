The objective of present study was to prepare thiolated pectin nanoparticles and to evaluate them for ocular delivery. Thiolated pectin nanoparticles were prepared by ionotropic-gelation technique using magnesium chloride as the ionic cross-linker and timolol maleate as the model drug. The results revealed that increasing the concentration of magnesium chloride results in significant increase in particle size, while % entrapment is decreased significantly by increase in the concentration of thiolated pectin. The optimal formulation having particle size of 237 nm and % entrapment of 94.6% was obtained at concentrations of thiolated pectin – 0.01% (w/v) and magnesium chloride – 0.01% (w/v). On comparative evaluation, thiolated pectin nanoparticulate formulation provided significantly higher ex vivo corneal permeation of timolol maleate across the excised goat cornea than the conventional aqueous solution.

This paper proposes a new bidirectional intelligent semiconductor transformer (BIST) for the smart distribution system and smart grid. The proposed BIST consists of high-voltage high-frequency ac/dc converter, bidirectional low-voltage dc/dc converter, and hybrid-switching dc/ac inverter. It features 1) input-to-output isolation with a high-frequency transformer; 2) bidirectional power flow; 3) small size and light weight; 4) capability of compensating voltage sag and/or swell; and 5) realization of three-phase structure based on single-phase module. The operational feasibility of proposed transformer was verified not only by computer simulation with PSCAD/EMTDC software but also by a hardware prototype with rating of 1.9 kV/127 V, 2 kVA, allowing a three-phase transformer of 3.3 kV/220 V, 6 kVA with three-phase construction.

Geometric programming is a methodology for solving algebraic nonlinear optimization problems. It provides a powerful tool for solving nonlinear problems where nonlinear relations can be well presented by an exponential or power function. Many applications of geometric programming are engineering design problems in which some of the parameters are approximately known. The goal of this paper is to state the problem of a two-bar truss which some parameters are estimates of actual values and suggest a solution to derive the fuzzy objective value of the fuzzy polynomial geometric programming problem.

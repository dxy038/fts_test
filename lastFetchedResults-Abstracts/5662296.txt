Macrophages are an essential part of our immune system and one of the well-known cells in biology. However, despite its importance its usual behaviour and moving rules are mostly unknown due to the lack of observatory data for the macrophages. An experiment was conducted in an attempt to obtain new data by observing the macrophages in a living rat and produced a couple of movies. Our objective is to exploit these results to develop a simulator that is able to reproduce the moves of a macrophage population. After the movie analysis, we identified a few characteristics to implement into a first simple simulator. Although its performance is very limited, it represents a first step for further research of understanding macrophages.

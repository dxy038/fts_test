Interpolation is required in interferometric SAR processing for co-registration of complex signals. Straightforward system theoretical considerations provide objective figures of merit, like interferometric decorrelation and phase noise, for interpolators. Theoretical and simulation results are given for nearest neighbor, piecewise linear, 4-point and 6-point cubic convolution kernels

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Threatened abortion is defined as any bloody vaginal discharge or bleeding during the first half of pregnancy. It occurs in 30-40% of pregnant women and approximately 50% of them will abort. The aim of this study was to survey the therapeutic effects of progesterone in patients with threatened abortion.
METHODS: This double blind clinical trial study was performed on 300 patients with threatened abortion who hospitalized in Ghods and Ali Ebne Abitaleb hospitals of Zahedan in 2004-2006. The patients divided into two groups randomly, we prescribed usual treatment (bed rest, hydration and analgesic drugs) in control group (150 patients) and our collaborators, gynecologists that were blind to this study, prescribed usual treatment plus progesterone (50mg/12h/im/4-6dose) in case group (150 patients) empirically.
FINDINGS: In case group we have 3 cases of abortion (2%), while in control group there were 18 cases of abortion (12%) (p=0.001), while, average duration of hospitalization in case group was 1.89 days and in control group was 2.64 days and (p=0.0001). Average duration of uterine bleeding in case group was 1.78 days and in control group was 3.13 days (p=0.0001). So that the differences of two groups from these points were significant.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that progesterone has significant results in reducing of abortion and time of hospitalization and bleeding in threatened abortion.

The objective of the present work is to investigate indentation in polymers and hyperelastic materials. Both experiments and numerical analysis have been carried out. Two different sports floorings were selected to test, monolayer rubber and two layer polyurethane (PU)/polyvinylchloride (PVC). To determine the value of hardness and indentation depth of indenter in the materials, experimental study was carried out according to quality standard test for sports flooring. The numerical analysis was also conducted by Abaqus software using simulation of experimental testing conditions, selection of the best hyperelastic model and comparison of the results to experimental test in order to ascertain the efficiency and accuracy of each simulation step. The accuracy of the results has been shown by comparision of experiments with numerical results. For the first sample, indentation depth was 0.575 mm (based on experimental result) and Yeohâ€™s model was employed to simulate with the error of 4.3%. The indentation depth and error (by selection of reduced polynomial form of order two models) were 0.425 mm and 0.94% for the second sample (PU/PVC), respectively. In addition, hardness was decreased from 78.1 to 75.3 when the thickness of rubber sports flooring was increased from 2.5 to 5 mm. In general, it can be concluded that the hardness values of polymers depend on their thickness, and on the other hand the indenter shape has an influence on indentation depth and force-displacement curves as well.

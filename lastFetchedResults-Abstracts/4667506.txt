The paper presents a simulation study and an experimental implementation of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for a Cu&#710;k converter in a stand alone photovoltaic (PV) energy scheme. DC-DC power converters are used to convert the unregulated DC input into a regulated DC output at a desired voltage level. An FLC algorithm is selected and used to control the nonlinear PV power system. The control objective for the Cu&#710;k converter is to move the operating point of the PV system to its peak power point. A system that consists of PV generator, converter, AC PWM inverter and load models is simulated, analyzed and experimentally implemented. The simulated system with FLC is investigated at different solar insolation levels. The fixed structure FLC shows a robust performance when applied on a wide operating range of the proposed converter, and AC PWM inverter

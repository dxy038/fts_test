This paper gives a introduction about several theoretical models of information behavior and information seeking behavior. These representative models in Western countries include Dervin´s theory and model of sense-making which is accepted in information studies as the metatheory to investigate information behavior, Ellis´ model of information seeking behavior, Kuhlthau´s model of information seeking process and Wilson´s model of information seeking behavior. Detailed comparative analysis and objective evaluation on these four models. Their differences and shared features are summarized.

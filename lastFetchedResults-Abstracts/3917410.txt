Electrical power systems in future hybrid and fuel cell vehicles may consist of three voltage nets: 14 V, 42 V, and high voltage (&gt;200 V) buses. A soft-switched, bidirectional dc-dc converter that uses only four switches was proposed for interconnecting the three nets. This paper presents a reduced-part dc-dc converter, which decreases the converter cost while retaining all the favorable features of the original topology. Experimental data are included to verify a simple power flow control scheme.

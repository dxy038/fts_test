In view of electro-mobility, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles needs to be deployed optimally to keep them powered up. This paper aims at developing a framework with novel aspects for deployment of charging infrastructure for EVs. This paper discusses the pros and cons of various proposed techniques for EVs charging infrastructure and also compares different available technologies in the current scenario. Moreover, various charging characteristics of battery electric vehicles and different charging methodologies and standards are investigated for practical realization of the facility infrastructure framework. Then, this paper presents a novel smart bidirectional interface equipped with multilevel cascaded power converter with embedded strategies of reverse energy flow management supporting enhanced expansion of renewable energy integration in order to keep stress on the power grid to a minimum. Moreover this paper proposes appropriate wireless communication technologies for deploying effective communication bridge among all nodes of the network in order to make the infrastructure smart. MatLab simulations are performed for provision of quality of service vs. operating cost of the charging facility. The simulation results show that the proposed technique prevails over the other available technologies in terms of cost and QoS. Future research work is also mentioned in this paper for the complete development of the proposed framework of smart charging station.

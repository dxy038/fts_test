Multi-satellite task merging can reduce the imaging number, which is significant to improve the imaging efficiency and save the energy. In this paper, to solve the task merging problem of multiple imaging satellites, considering point targets and area targets synthetically, the task merging relationships and constraints are analyzed. Introducing the concept of consistent relationship, multi-satellite task merging model with the objective of minimum energy consumption is constructed. A task merging algorithm of multiple imaging satellite based on consistent relationship is suggested. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm are validated with some examples.

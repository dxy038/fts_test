Retrieving most suitable web services from large collection of instances is very crucial for decision makers, In this context QoS properties may play a central role in selecting web service compositions that serve complex requests. A number of approaches have been proposed to resolve Web service selection problem, we distinguish several classes such as the mono objective selection, the multi-objective selection and the hybrid selection. In this paper, we propose a mono objective approach based on harmony search algorithm, this later is able to get a near optimal composition, by leveraging various movements such as local search, memory based movements, random walk etc. Experimental results are very encouraging, and show that the proposed algorithm is more effective than the genetic and bees algorithms.

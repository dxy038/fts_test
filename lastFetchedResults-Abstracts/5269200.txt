In the early floor plan, power noise DC analysis by linear programming method has been proposed [1]. In order to accelerate the analysis speed, we propose new objective functions and also new constraints for linear programming. Using our new ideas can accelerate analysis speed by about 10<sup>5</sup> times, comparing with conventional method in the case of 20 horizontal x 20 vertical power nets noise analysis for 19 application program execution cycles.

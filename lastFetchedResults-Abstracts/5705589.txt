In this paper a new intelligent technique named multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm used to solve profit based unit commitment (PBUCP). The Profit Based Unit Commitment problem is a nonlinear multi-objective optimization problem which involves the simultaneous optimization to maximize the generation companies (GENCOs) profit. The first function is the revenue while the second is the total cost. This optimization involves many constraints such as system power and reserve, unit generation limit, unit minimum ON OFF duration and ramping constraints. The used technique has been tested on IEEE-39 bus system with ten generating units over 24-h time horizon. The simulation results obtained are compared without another technique. The algorithm and simulation are realized with MATLAB 7.4 software.

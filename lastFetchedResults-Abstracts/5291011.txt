This paper presents a new model for capacitated facility location problem, where serve radius and economic benefit are considered. In the new model, the objective is to maximize the total return investment. However, the objective for multiple knapsack problem is to maximize the total profit. So the capacitated facility location problem can be translated into multiple knapsack problem. Because this problem is difficult to solve, we propose a hybrid harmony search algorithm, which incorporates harmony search algorithm with greedy algorithm. Numerical results from computational experiments are presented and analyzed.

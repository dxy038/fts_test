Based on the finite element computation of the electric field, a formula of sensitivity evaluation of the voltage ratio to the axial position of a movable electrode is derived. The sensitivity of the voltage ratio to the axial position of the movable electrode in an optical instrument voltage transformer is analyzed only by means of finite element mesh generation and one time solution. This formula is also extended into computation of derivative of the objective function that is for the automatic design of the voltage ratio and the voltage ratio can be designed through an optimization process based on the sensitivity analysis. Numerical results are found to be satisfactory

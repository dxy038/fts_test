The objective of this work is to demonstrate the use of discrete event simulation to be employed as a didactic resource in automatic control systems classes. The application was made with the free and open-source software Ururau integrated to programmable logic controllers of manufacturing didactic stations. The result produced an environment for learning (simulation model and controllers). In this environment, the student can experience different practical situations with the simulation model and have direct contact with the real equipment.

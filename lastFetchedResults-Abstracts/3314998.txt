Fuzzy mathematical model can be used to ensure the objectivity and the accuracy of summarization of measurement questions in the questionnaire survey and minimize the subjective factors. By steps of establishing fuzzy matrix, setting fuzzy weight set, calculating the comprehensive evaluation matrix, and establishing evaluation vector table and evaluation the results, summarization of measurement questions in a questionnaire survey can be fully and objectively conducted. Therefore, fuzzy mathematical model is a comprehensive and objective evaluation method which could be of broad adaptability.

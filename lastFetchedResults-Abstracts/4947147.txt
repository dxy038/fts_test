This paper focuses the performance of network-coded bidirectional relaying in OFDM networks. The fading channels between the base station-relay and relay-mobile station follow Rician and Nakagami-m distributions respectively. The outage probability expression is deduced for the non-identical-independent Rice-Nakagami-m fading channels. Neuro-Fuzzy based relay selection algorithm is used to select the best relay for the source and destination pair. The performance of the proposed network is compared with the traditional dual-hop network. Simulation results show that the network coded dual-hop system improves the throughput and network life time compared to the traditional dual-hop network.

With the flourish of the Internet, online review mining has attracted a lot of attention from the research community. However, compared to various well-studied sentiment analysis and opinion summarization problems, less effort has been made to analyze the quality of online reviews. The objective of this paper is to fill in this gap by automatically evaluating the "helpfulness" of reviews and consequently developing novel models to identify the most helpful reviews for a particular product. In particular, based on a thorough analysis of various factors that may affect the review quality, we propose HelpMeter, a nonlinear regression model for helpfulness prediction. Some preliminary experiments were conducted on a movie review data set, and the performance results confirm the superiority of the proposed method.

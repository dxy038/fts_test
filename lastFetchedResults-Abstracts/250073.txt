We describe a Gaussâ€“Seidel algorithm for optimizing a three-dimensional unstructured grid so as
to conform to a given metric. The objective function for the optimization process is based on the
maximum value of an elemental residual measuring the distance of any simplex in the grid to the local
target metric. We analyse different possible choices for the objective function, and we highlight their
relative merits and deficiencies. Alternative strategies for conducting the optimization are compared
and contrasted in terms of resulting grid quality and computational costs. Numerical simulations
are used for demonstrating the features of the proposed methodology, and for studying some of its
characteristics.

In this paper, we analyze three QoE-based speech quality evaluation models: PESQ, NPESQ and POLQA models. PESQ (Perceptual evaluation of speech quality) is a well known objective speech quality assessment method for speech QoE evaluation. It is formed as the ITU-T P.862 Recommendations. NPESQ (New Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality) model is a new objective QoE model on evaluating the speech quality of multimedia communication system. It is an improved model of PESQ. POLQA (Perceptual objective listening quality assessment) is a successor of PESQ; it is approved as ITU-T P.863 Recommendations. In order to get which model is best, this paper undertakes performance comparative analysis of NPESQ, PESQ and POLQA models. Accuracy, consistency and linearity are chosen as performance metric. Through comparing the result of subjective test and three objective tests, we can conclude that, the accuracy of POLQA model is the best; and NPESQ model maintains the best consistency and linearity with subjective test.

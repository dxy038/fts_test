In order to study the relationship between the hydrophilic–lipophilic balance of surfactants and the dispersion properties of brine in residue, using droplet size and droplet distribution analytical method were determined on emulsions prepared with emulsifier blends of varying hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) values the required HLB values of emulsion. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of HLB on the dispersion properties of brine in residue. The type of emulsion was prepared using emulsifiers with various hydrophilic–lipophilic balance values. The droplet size and droplet distribution varied widely among emulsions containing emulsifiers with different HLB values. The results obtained in this study indicate that the different systems of residue/brine need different HLB values. The HLB value of the emulsion with the least dispersion ratio or the least average droplet diameter was taken as the system of residue/brine required HLB the required HLB values of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Co(NO3)2, NiSO4, Ni(NO3)2 and FeSO4. The results showed that the values of HLB were determined as different system of emulsion.

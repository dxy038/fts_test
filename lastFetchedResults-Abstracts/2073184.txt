The objective of the study was to determine basic health-related constituents, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) using the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay, total phenolic content (TPC), mineral elements and histamines present in ten categories of fruit wines and to compare them with traditional wines. Among the wines of different fruit sources, TAC ranged from 219 to 2447 mg ascorbic acid equivalents/L. TAC and TPC are the highest in red (Cabernet) wine and elderberry, blueberry and black currant wines; moderate in cherry, raspberry, cranberry and plum wines; and the lowest in apple, peach, icewine (from grapes), white (Chardonnay) and pear wines. The two measurements, TAC and TPC, had a positive and strong correlation (r2=0.97). Among the 16 elements analyzed, potassium was the most abundant element distributed throughout all categories of wines. Calcium concentration was the highest in cranberry wines. The grape wines (red and white wines and icewine) and elderberry wine contained the highest concentration of magnesium. Iron, manganese and zinc were the predominant minor elemental constituents. Red wine (Cabernet) had a significantly higher concentration (11.1 mg/L) of biogenic amine histamine than did any of the fruit wines, white wines or icewine.

Study objective
To document an unusual presentation of a pure Sertoli Cell tumor.
Design
Case report.
Results
We present a 10-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea with no symptoms of puberty. Surgical exploration revealed a metastatic pure Sertoli Cell tumor, which was treated with resection and chemotherapy.
Conclusion
Sertoli cell tumors are rare occurrences and should be considered in the differential diagnosis for a prepubescent girl with an abdominal mass.

Objective
To determine whether school teachers educated about Primary Prevention of Adult Cardiovascular Disease (PPCVD) could help their students improve their blood lipid profile.
Method

Five teachers voluntarily received training about PP-CVD. Thirteen classes of a single high school in Stradella (north Italy) were randomized to receive a 2-month course on PP-CVD (PP-classes; 150 pupils) by their teachers or to a control group (control classes; 130 pupils) during 2004. In all students body weight and fasting venous blood concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), HDL-CHOL, LDL-CHOL, and triglycerides were determined before and 6 months after the completion of the PP-CVD course.
Results

Six months after the PP-CVD course, males had significant improvements of all baseline lipid parameters whereas females had improved HDL-CHOL and TC/HDL ratio. No improvements were observed in the control class students. Body weight was unchanged in both groups of students 6 months after the PP-CVD course or the control course.
Conclusion

This investigation shows that well-trained school teachers are able to manage PP-CVD education so that students can really improve their lipid profile as a consequence of autonomous changes in dietary habits.

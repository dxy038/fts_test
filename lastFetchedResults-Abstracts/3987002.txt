This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC)-based approach for a full bridge dc-dc converter of a fuel cell power system. The objective of the proposed control algorithm is to regulate the output voltage without violating the peak current constraint. We first develop a large signal dynamic model for the full bridge dc-dc converter. The peak current protection requirement is then formulated as a mixed input and state constraint for the MPC scheme. We next introduce the integrated perturbation analysis and sequential quadratic programming (InPA-SQP) method to solve the constrained optimal control problem with sub-millisecond level sampling time. The InPA-SQP solver can meet the computational efficiency demand, thereby enabling implementation of an implicit MPC for power electronics system with fast dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm in the peak current protection and the output voltage regulation has been verified with experimental results.

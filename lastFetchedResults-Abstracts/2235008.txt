The objective of this study is to investigate ballistic impact properties of multi-layered amorphous surface alloyed materials fabricated by high-energy electron-beam irradiation. The mixture of Zr-based amorphous alloy powders and LiF+MgF2 flux powders was deposited on a Ti alloy substrate, and then electron beam was irradiated on this powder mixture to fabricate an one-layered surface alloyed material. On top of this layer, the powder mixture was deposited again and then irradiated with electron beam whose beam current was decreased to fabricate the multi-layered surface alloyed material. In the mixed multi-layered surface alloyed materials fabricated with LM1 alloy powders and LM2 or LM10 alloy powders, the surface region consisted of amorphous phases, together with a small amount of crystalline particles, whereas the center region was complicatedly composed of amorphous phases, crystallized phases, and dendritic Î² phases. Since the surface region mostly composed of amorphous matrix was quite hard, the alloyed materials sufficiently blocked the travel of a projectile. When cracks formed at the surface region propagated into the center region, the formation of many cracks or debris was accelerated, which could beneficially work for absorbing the ballistic impact energy, thereby leading to the higher ballistic impact properties than the surface alloyed materials fabricated with LM1 or LM2 alloy powders.

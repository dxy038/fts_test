The objective of this development was to make an evolutionary improvement in the performance and cost of space qualified solar cell arrays incorporating solar concentration. High efficiency multijunction solar cells have established new solar array performance levels and have demonstrated benefits both from a systems cost and mass aspect. The G-STAR solar array design brings additional cost benefits. Because the 2.5&#215; concentration ratio reflector units are distributed (every other row of cells), the operating temperatures are lower than nondistributed systems and complexity is reduced. This paper describes the design features and provides performance characteristics, which can be used by spacecraft designers. Development models have been fabricated and tested to establish credibility and initial reliability testing is reported

This paper presents an achievable rate region for a 2-user Gaussian Z-interference channel with a noiseless and bidirectional digital communication link between the receivers. The region is achieved by utilizing the rate-splitting encoding technique, and the decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward strategies. In the very strong interference regime, the capacity region is achieved. In the weak interference regime, the asymptotic sum rate is characterized and shown to be possibly unbounded, which is in contrast to a recent result by Yu and Zhou for a similar scenario, however, with a unidirectional communication link between the receivers.

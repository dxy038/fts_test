Summary form only given. Feedback has been shown to be a useful tool improving decision making and might also be a useful tool in improving the accuracy of recurrent judgmental forecasts. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of feedback on accuracy when forecasting time series with structural instabilities. The underlying model and definitions were derived from (Balzer et al., 1992); the experimental design was similar to that used by (Remus et al., 1995)

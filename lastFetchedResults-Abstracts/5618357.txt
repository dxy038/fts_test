The objective of simulation modeling is to gain insight into the dynamics of complex systems. Simulation models of complex systems consist of numerous input variable, linked together by logical relationships. The process of determining the set of input variable values that produce the optima output has often posed the greatest challenge during simulation studies. In recent years, the ability to integrate optimization technology into simulation models has significantly improved this process. To effectively utilize optimization technology, however, modelers must define optimization variables. In this paper, an approach is developed that provides information concerning the interrelationship between input variables used in a simulation model. This information can then be used as the basis for selecting optimization variables.

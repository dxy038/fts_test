An approach to controller design of static var compensator (SVC) device, and its parameter optimization by GA and SA algorithms is proposed In this paper as a power system stability point of view. The implementation of the algorithm for optimizing the controllers&#194;&#191; parameters is described in detail. In the analysis, the generic dynamic model of SVC and its associated controllers is presented with other dynamic elements of proposed test power system, and the small signal stability model is derived; based on this, an eigenvaluebased objective function is utilized to optimize the controllers&#194;&#191; parameters. With the optimized controller parameters, the system stability is improved under disturbances applied. Simulations are performed to illustrate the control performance.

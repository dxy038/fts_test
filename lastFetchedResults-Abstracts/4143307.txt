We consider two queues in tandem, each of which has its own input of arriving customers, which, in turn, may either be accepted or rejected. Suppose that the system receives a fixed reward for each accepted customer and pays a holding cost per customer per unit time in the system. The objective is to dynamically determine the optimal admission policies based on the state of the system so as to maximize the average profit (reward minus cost) over an infinite horizon. This model finds applications in flow control in communication systems, industrial job shops, and traffic-flow systems. In this paper, a novel approach is presented using fuzzy control. This approach explicitly finds the optimal policy, which up until now has defied analytical solutions

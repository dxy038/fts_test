The objective of this paper is to propose a new approach for designing a passive LC filter of the full-bridge rectifier by using genetic algorithms (GAs). The performance of the cost-effective passive LC filter for a constant load depends on the appropriate inductor and capacitor selection. Several design methods are reviewed and a novel design methodology using GAs is proposed in this paper. By using the proposed GA program, designer can quickly find appropriate parameter values to meet the desired circuit performance. Experimental results show that an appropriate combination of the inductor and capacitor selected by the proposed GA program can meet the desired power quality requirement. Different cases of design examples are shown in this paper to verify the performance of the proposed design methodology.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the prevalence of infections by human papillomavirus, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus among women with severe vulvar vestibulitis. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-six women referred for dyspareunia and diagnosed as having severe vestibulitis underwent perineoplasty, including surgical removal of the sensitive vestibule. Controls included 25 age-matched patients without dyspareunia undergoing vaginal operations for various benign causes or undergoing repair of an episiotomy. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was carried out to determine the presence of viral genes. RESULTS: The prevalence of herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus among the subjects tested was nil, whereas human papillomavirus was detected in 46 cases (54%). The human papillomavirus present was not of types 6, 11, 16, 18, or 33. Only one woman of the 25 asymptomatic controls (4%) had human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the vestibule (p< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data provide support for the idea that vulvar vestibulitis is associated with human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in more than half of cases.

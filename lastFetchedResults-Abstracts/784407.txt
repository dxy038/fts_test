Objective: To determine the association between anthropometric indicators of adiposity with type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension (HTN) in older adults. Design: Cross-sectional study of participants
of the Mexican Health Survey 2000 (MHS). Setting: Mexico, subjects recruited from the general community.
Participants: The analytic sample included 7,322 adults who were â‰¥60 years of age at the time of the survey.
T2DM data were available on 6,994 individuals, who represent 95.5% of the original sample; data on HTN was
available on 6,268 subjects, which accounted for 86.5% of the original sample. Measurements: Type 2 diabetes
mellitus and hypertension, as well as anthropometric indicators including body mass index (BMI), waist
circumference (WC), and conicity index (CI). Results: The prevalence of T2DM and HTN in this age group was
34.3% and 73.9%, respectively. After adjusting for other variables, the association between high WC and T2DM
(OR=1.59 95%CI=1.26-2.01, P <0.001) was stronger than the association with overweight (OR=1.26, 95%CI=
1.01-1.58, P=0.04) and obesity (OR=1.38, 95%CI= 1.08-1.79, P<0.01) using BMI, and slightly higher than tertile
2 of the CI (OR=1.49, 95%CI=1.20-1.88, P< 0.01), while tertile 3 showed a stronger association with T2DM
(OR=1.60, 95%CI=1.22-2.08, P<0.001). However, the association between obesity and HTN measured by BMI
(OR=1.98, 95%CI=1.48-2.65, P< 0.001) was stronger than what was observed with overweight (OR=1.42,
95%CI 1.13-1.77, P<0.01), with high WC (OR=1.62, 95%CI=1.25-2.10, P<0.001) and tertiles 2 and 3 of the CI
(OR=1.23, 95%CI=0.99-1.55, P= 0.09); (OR=1.53, 95%CI= 1.16-2.03, P< 0.01) respectively. Conclusions: BMI
and abdominal obesity are significantly and independently associated with an increase in the prevalence of
T2DM and HTN among older Mexican adults.

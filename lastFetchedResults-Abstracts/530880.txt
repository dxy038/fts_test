In this article free vibration of a cylindrical shell with internal pressure made of a functionally gradient material (FGM) composed of stainless steel and nickel is studied. The objective is to study the influence of internal pressure on the frequency characteristics of the FGM shell. The boundary condition of this shell is simply supported. The properties are graded in the thickness direction according to a volume fraction power-law distribution. The analysis is carried out with strain-displacement relations from Loveâ€™s shell theory and the eigenvalue governing equation is obtained using Rayleigh-Ritz method. After solving the equation, the results were verified by comparing the obtained frequencies with the frequencies of the other literatures and also with the results from ABAQUS.

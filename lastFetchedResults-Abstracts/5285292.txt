This paper presents a design of a tool for generating Unified Modeling Language (UML) analysis class diagram. The objective of the tool is to assist users in generating analysis class diagram. The tool presents a set of questions to be answered by the users. Based on the answers given from the users, the tool will then generate half-completed analysis class diagram. Step-by-step design approaches are presented to show how the candidate of classes and relationship between classes are captured. The proposed solution is presented using a case study of Food Service Management System.

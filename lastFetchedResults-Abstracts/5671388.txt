The electric power supply for the isolated systems constitutes a problem with difficult solution, because small scale systems present high costs and countless logistics difficulties regarding fuels supply for local generation. Besides, there may be severe physical isolation conditions, resulting on the impossibility of a transmission system due to very high costs. The power generation through wind power converter system (WPCS) has been substantially growing worldwide, more especially in European countries like Germany, with an already installed power capacity exceeding 2000 MW, and Denmark, with about 1000 MW. However, this exploration is still limited by operational restrictions and power quality problems that still need an effective solution. This article has as main objective to present and analyze the questions regarding impact caused by the wind power converter system (WPCS) on the electrical power system performance, mainly in relation with the problem of finding one strong connection point capable to efficiently integrate the WPCS with the existent transmission system.

This paper describes distributed and dynamic algorithms for TDMA channel scheduling in WIA-PA network with multiple channels. The main objective of the channel scheduling algorithm is to reduce the computation time while maximizing the utilization of the network resources, thereby improving the network throughput, reducing the transmission delay, and decreasing the number of retry. In this paper, we consider the channel scheduling algorithm by using the blacklist technology and under the requirements of real-time, reliability, low energy consumption and the character of time-varying channel simultaneously, and present our algorithm as a variant of the coloring algorithm. A performance study is carried out by using OPNET 10.0. The results show that our algorithm performs better than centralized algorithms and non-blacklist distributed algorithm in aspects of network throughput, end-to-end delay, and retry exhausted count.

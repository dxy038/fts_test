The objective of this paper is to develop a technique using genetic algorithms (GA) for predicting the worst response of mistuned bladed disk. A simple but representative model for the bladed disk system is presented. The response of the system under harmonic excitation was obtained. The worst response of the mistuned system was then formulated as an optimization problem. Next, mistuning in blades stiffness, blades damping and blades stiffness and damping was studied and the results were compared. The results indicate that the system mistuned with both stiffness and damping has higher response amplitude in comparison with other mistuned system.

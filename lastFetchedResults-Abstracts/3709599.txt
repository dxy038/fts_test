Provides a summary of recent developments in control of nonholonomic systems. The published literature has grown enormously during the last six years, and it is now possible to give a tutorial presentation of many of these developments. The objective of this article is to provide a unified and accessible presentation, placing the various models, problem formulations, approaches, and results into a proper context. It is hoped that this overview will provide a good introduction to the subject for nonspecialists in the field, while perhaps providing specialists with a better perspective of the field as a whole. The paper is organized as follows: introduction to nonholonomic control systems and where they arise in applications, classification of models of nonholonomic control systems, control problem formulations, motion planning results, stabilization results, and current and future research topics

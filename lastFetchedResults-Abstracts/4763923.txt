The main objective of this work is to provide the probability transformation for the parameters describing an impinging wave from the outdoor to the indoor environment. An approximated deterministic outdoor-indoor model already developed is utilised to extract the probability density function (PDF) transformation rule for the delay, azimuth and elevation spectra. Since the interface model is applicable for frequencies of 2.4 GHz, 5.2 GHz and 60 GHz, the transformation holds for these frequencies.

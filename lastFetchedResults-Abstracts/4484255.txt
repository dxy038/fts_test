This paper presents a new algorithm for designing revertible wavelet transforms by using lifting framework. The design objective is to achieve good performance of compression. We use the least MSE as optimization criterion to create adaptive biorthogonal wavelet filters which have linear phase property. The experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency of the proposed method for lossless image compression is quite competitive with other. IWT-based filters.

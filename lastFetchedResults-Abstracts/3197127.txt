The objective of this study was to evaluate surface heat fluxes based on satellite remote sensing data and field measurement data. Surface heat fluxes were estimated around the city of Cheongju, South Korea using Landsat 5 TM data and modeler of ERDAS Imagine. Landsat data was acquired on 6 August, 2006 (path 115, row 35). Field measurement was conducted in the paddy field and upland. And it was collected the same day with acquisition of Landsat imagery using net radiometer (Q-7.1, Campbell Scientific Inc.) and geothermometer (MF-180M, EKO Instruments Trading Co.). The result of this study was that net radiation at the surface was 350 ~ 670 W/m<sup>2</sup>. The percentage of surface heat fluxes were approximately 30% from sensible heat flux to the air, approximately 10% from soil heat flux, and 60% from latent heat flux. The surface heat flux in paddy field data was similar to Landsat data. The upland data was much alike, but they do have dissimilarities because the upland was too small area, considering Landsat image resolution. The results suggest that the methodology was feasible to estimate surface heat fluxes with reasonable accuracy over study areas.

Objective-The high prevalence of esophageal cancer (EC) in northern Iran, along with its unknown etiology, continues to be a major public health problem. Ecological and casecontrol studies have discussed the probable role of dietary factors in this disease. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between EC and the type and characteristics of consumed food and beverages at the time of the study as well as in the past. Methods-A total of 99 cases and 192 controls were enrolled in this study. Clinicians and pathologists referred the patients to the Babol Research Base, which is under the supervision of the Institute of Public Health Research of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. For each patient two controls were selected from their neighbors. Data were collected by means of a structured questionnaire concerning dietary habits. Results-There were no significant differences between the case and control groups in respect to the age, sex and ethnic origin. The case group showed significant differences in family history of cancer other than EC, history of gastroesophageal reflux, habit of rapid drinking of hot tea, and eating of hot foods. These factors were found to be related to the presence of EC, whereas eating cheese, vegetables, fresh fruits, black pepper and turmeric were found to be protective factors. Conclusion-This study showed some differences in the diet content and habits of patients suffering from EC in comparison to normal controls. Further elaborate studies are required to reveal the true pattern of dietary divergence in these patients. Besides, the authors are aware that recall bias might have distorted some of the results. More objective measures for assessment of diets are recommended.

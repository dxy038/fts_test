This paper has as an objective to assess the feasibility of bilateral transactions using probabilistic methods to include uncertainties associated with peak load forecasting and componentÂ´s outage. The scenarios originated from these uncertainties are generated using Monte-Carlo simulation. The bilateral transactions feasibility is assessed for each generated state using linear optimization based in primal-dual interior-point method. The sample of system states is used to obtain the probability distributions and the expected value associated with a bilateral transaction. Case studies with IEEE Reliability Test System-1996 are presented and discussed

Objective:
cribe sex differences in physical, psychologic, and social recovery patterns after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS).
:
ed measures between groups (men versus women) design. Data were collected before discharge from the hospital and at 1, 3, and 6 weeks after discharge.
g:
eaching hospitals: one urban, three suburban, and one midstate hospital that serves rural and urban clients
:
itial sample consisted of 187 men and 70 women; 132 men and 47 women completed the study.
e Measures:
al recovery was assessed by three subscales of the Sickness Impact Profile—ambulation, sleep-rest, body care and movement; a Symptom Inventory, and a Cantril Ladder Scale. Psychologic recovery was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and a Cantril Ladder Scale. Social recovery was measured by three subscales of the Sickness Impact Profile—home management, social interaction, and recreation and pastimes.
s:
asures indicated significant improvement over time with the exception of self-esteem and perception of mental health, which remained stable. There were significant differences between men and women on five recovery variables: ambulation dysfunction, physical symptoms, perceptions of physical health, symptoms of depression, and home management dysfunction.
sions:
 it is encouraging that both sex groups experienced significant improvement in recovery over time, men and women show some differences in recovery experiences that need to be considered when planning their care.

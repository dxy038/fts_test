It is an important measure to carry out energy-saving power generation scheduling in China to achieve energy saving. And how to implement policies of energy-saving emission reduction and to realize coordinated and orderly scheduling has become an important topic to the network operator. Based on the basic model of economic dispatch and energy-efficient power generation scheduling rules, the multi-objective optimization model of energy-efficient scheduling is given. And coal consumption rates and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions and operating cost functions are considered and formulated respectively as a single objective optimization problem. The model is transformed into unconstrained optimization problem by means of penalty factor and the dynamic penalty function, and then solved by PSO algorithm. Then take the IEEE-30 bus system as an example, three kinds of scheduling schemes, the typical energy-efficient scheduling, respectively economic dispatch and energy-efficient scheduling taking environmental and economic benefits into account are compared and analyzed. The results obtained demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model.

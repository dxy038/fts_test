The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI). Seventeen patients with histopathologically proven HCC were included in this study. All patients underwent MR examinations with conventional T1- and T2-weighted images, gadolinium-enhanced images, and DSC-MRI before TACE treatment. Hepatic blood volume (HBV) maps were reconstructed from the timeâ€“intensity curves. The same MRI sequences and techniques were repeated 24 h and 6 weeks after TACE. Serial changes in tumor perfusion on HBV maps were correlated with vascularity in hepatic angiography. All tumors were hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Heterogeneous enhancement was observed in all tumors before and immediately after TACE. Hyperperfusion was noted in most of the tumors on HBV map before TACE and moderate to marked hypoperfusion following TACE. The degree of tumor perfusion on HBV map correlated well with the vascularity in angiography. In conclusion, the noninvasive nature of DSC-MRI is useful to evaluate the effectiveness of TACE. Invasive procedures, such as angiography, are seldom necessary.

Screening of microscopic slides is a manual process which involves its subjectivity. A semi-automated computer based system can contribute to the detection of screening error by the way of greater reliability. The objective of segmentation in microscopic image is to extract cellular, nuclear and tissue components. This problem is challenging because accurate segmentation of each cell is a difficult task and there is large variations in feature of each component. In this paper an attempt is made to overview various segmentation methods for microscopic images. The existing methods are grouped by their application in one of the following pathologist field: Cytology and Histology. This analysis is helpful for the better use of existing method and for improving their performance as well as designing new one.

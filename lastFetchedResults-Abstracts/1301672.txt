Background: Depression is a possible side effect associated with antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of depression in patients receiving different anti-viral medications before, during and after treatment. 
Materials and methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was undertaken on 248 CHB or CHC patients referred to two clinics of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences between March 2011 and April 2012. Those who received alpha interferon, another antivirus medication or combination of them were evaluated by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and clinical psychiatric interview before initiation of the medications, 12 and 24 weeks after the initiation of the treatment and 6 weeks after termination of antiviral therapy. 
Results: The prevalence of depression in patients with either hepatitis B or C was higher than general population, but similar to each other. During the 12 and 24 week of the antiviral therapy, the prevalence of depression was increased especially in whom were receiving alpha-interferon. Six weeks after the termination of medical therapy, the prevalence of depression in whom received alpha interferon was decreased statistically. However, this event did not happen in the group that did not use interferon. 
Conclusion: It is suggested that patients receiving alpha-interferon should be psychologically assessed in the course of treatment. Displaying the symptoms of depression, doctors should apply the prophylactic and therapeutic measures as soon as possible.

The objective of this work is to study the morphological, micro-chemical and micro-mechanical characteristics of the thick zirconium oxide layer formed on a zircaloy-4 clad after a standard water corrosion test (ASTM G2-67). The oxidized samples were analyzed by Raman and Auger spectroscopy, SEM–EDS, XRD and the mechanical properties of the oxide film were evaluated using the Vickers microindentation method. The results reveal the formation of a textured oxide layer constituted of m-ZrO2 crystals oriented primarily in the direction perpendicular to the (002) crystallographic plane. In addition, a not previously reported thin zirconium carbide film on the top surface of the oxide layer was detected by SEM–EDS, XRD and Auger spectroscopy.

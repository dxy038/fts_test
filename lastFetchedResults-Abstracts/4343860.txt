The purpose of the paper is to present ideas on how to produce interoperable software for substation automation functions. The objective of the authors is to explore interoperability issues in ASME &#8212; Automation Software Modelling and development Environment. Interoperability issues arise at different levels of the design and development process involved in the implementation of automation software modules: modelling and notation; information exchange format; compliance of the specified software interfaces with the emerging standard for communication in power systems.

Background and Objective: Sexual function is an important aspect of quality of life, and reflects on the physical, psychological and mental well being of the individual. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Tibolone on sexual function, in healthy postmenopausal women.
Materials and Methods: This randomized clinical trial study was done on 96 postmenopausal women with no absolute contraindication for hormone replacement therapy. Women were divided into two groups: 52 women in Tibolone group received Tibolone 2.5mg/day + Ca-D (500 mg +200 IU) and 44 women in placebo group received only Ca-D (500 mg +200 IU) for six months. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 6 months of treatment for hormone determinations. Sexual function was assessed by female sexual function index (FSFI) in six domains. Side effect and satisfaction was assessed. Data was analyzed by Paired and independent t-test, Chi Square and Mann-Whitney tests.
Results: 41 women in Tibolone group and 40 women in placebo completed the study. Compare to baseline values and placebo, the Tibolone group significantly improved on all of six FSFI domains (P<0.05). Testosterone, FTI and FEI increased and sex hormone binding golobulin (SHBG) decreased about 57% in Tibolone group (P<0.05). Headache, weightening, vaginal spotting and bleeding, were observed in case groups.
Conclusion: Tibolone significantly improved all aspects of sexual function and increased quality of life by desirable changes in level of sex hormones and SHBG in Post menopausal women.

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective and multi-path routing mechanism called distributed multi-criteria load balancing (DMLB) algorithm. Such an algorithm can be used either to improve the network robustness in case of traffic increase or to allocate less link resources for a given quality of service. Traffic flows of an overloaded link are distributed on a set of alternative paths that is output by a load-sensitive multi-objective routing algorithm. DMLB is distributed on the network elements involved in intra-domain IP routing and works on-line at the network operation phase. Mechanisms are specified to ensure network stability and decision coherency. DMLB remains low time and space consuming. It has been tested and validated through massive and realistic network simulations. Improvements have been seen from both the network side and the end-to-end user side

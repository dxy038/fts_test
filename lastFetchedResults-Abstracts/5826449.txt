In this work, we report our results based on an innovative approach that we started three years ago for delivering an introductory computer science course. The teaching approach consisted of team teaching, hybrid delivery, recorded lecture retrieval capability, readiness assessment activities, post assessment activities, objective assessment of student progress, and cooperative learning through team work. The new aspects of this approach were team teaching, objective assessment to provide additional feedback to students, and the combination of the aforementioned tools. Details of this work, including its advantages, disadvantages, student feedback, and lessons learned, are included.

The author presents an optimisation approach to the investigation of piecewise linear convex circuits. The problem is formulated in terms of the objective function and linear equality constraints applied to the diode circuits. Two efficient techniques for solving such a problem are presented. One is based on the active constraints strategy and implemented in the form of a numerical program, and the second one is based on the neural principle and implemented in analogue circuitry, solving the problem in real time. Results of numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical considerations

Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of high TG-low HDL syndrome and high TG/HDL ratio and its associated factors in Ahvaz.
Subjects and Methods: This descriptive analytical study was performed with cluster sampling method in 6 health centres and 75 households were randomly selected. Blood pressure, weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were measured. Serum fasting level of FBS, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL and LDL were measured.
Results: Total 2505 participants [1155 male (46.15%), 1350 female (53.9%)] evaluated in this study. Prevalence of high TG-low HDL was 10.2% (6.5% in male, 13.3% in female) according to American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist (AACE). Prevalence of high TG/HDL ratio was 67.8% with significant difference in male (73.9% in male, 63.7% in female) (P=0.0001). Prevalence of high TG-low HDL and TG/HDL ratio had significant correlation with age (P=0.0001). Both disorders were more prevalent in subjects with diabetes, obesity and high waist circumference than normal weight and normal waist circumference.   
Conclusion: The results shows prevalence of high TG- low HDL and TG/HDL ratio are common disorders in Ahvaz. Educational programs are recommended to improve lifestyles and reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors.

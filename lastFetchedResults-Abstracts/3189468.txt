The objective of this study is to explore the polarimetric phenomenology of near infrared light interaction with healthy and lung cancer monolayer cells by using efficient polarimetric transmission detection techniques. Preliminary results indicate that enhanced discrimination between normal and different types of lung cancer cell stages can be achieved based on their transmitted intensities and depolarization properties of the cells. Specifically, the sizes of the nuclei of the cancer cells and the nucleus-to-cytoplasmic ratios appear to have potential impact on the detected polarimetric signatures leading to enhanced discrimination of lung cancer cells.

Optical subscriber loop transmission systems for a broadband integrated systems digital network (B-ISDN) are discussed. The realization of a communication-only system with a hybrid integrated duplexer for bidirectional transmission and the operational results using Fabry-Perot and distributed feedback lasers at 1550 nm are described. The requirements for introducing broadband communication-only systems and distribution-only systems and for the final integration of both systems to a B-ISDN by means of electrical or optical multiplexing are discussed. Aspects of systems using direct and coherent detection are considered

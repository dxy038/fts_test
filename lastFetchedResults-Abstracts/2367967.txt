Debris flows and stream floods are common natural processes in alpine regions. Though their occurrence varies significantly in space and time, a sound knowledge basis for assessing the extent and impact of such events can be gained through the use of historical sources. The GIS application described here derives from an analysis of historical accounts of landslide, flood and debris flow events which caused losses in property and lives in Piedmont (Northwestern Italy). The analysis focuses on past geo-hydrological events in small-scale Alpine catchments in such region, but the research method can be exported to any mountain basin.

lling natural hazards is a national task of paramount importance to ensure maximum safety, through sustainable strategies in the integrated risk management of natural hazard in mountainous watersheds. A specific objective of this project was to define a flood prevention methodology, to jointly with civil protection agencies in order to establish priority actions and rapid response in case of torrential rains. Working together with local civil protection units, the overall aim is to raise awareness of potential flood risks and help residents be prepared for flood events.

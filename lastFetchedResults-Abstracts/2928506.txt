Implementing Jacobi algorithms in parallel processor arrays is a non-trivial task, in particular when the algorithms are parameterized with respect to size and the architectures are parameterized with respect to space-time trade-offs. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that practical, time-adaptive singular value decomposition can be implemented on a parallel processor array using Cordic arithmetic and asynchronous communication, such that any degree of parallelism, from single-processor implementation up to full-size array implementation is supported by a `universalÂ´ processing unit. This result is the product of judicious application of transformations in the combined algorithm and architecture space

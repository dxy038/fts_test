On the research of coordinated multi-point MIMO systems, a new precoding scheme is proposed for maximizing the weighted sum rates. Construction of the objective function is based on convex optimization theory and the solution to the precoding vector is depended on iterative algorithm. Compared with existing algorithms, the application of the algorithm is not limited to the number of transmit and receive antennas, the threshold of iteration and number of cell coordinated clusters can be adjusted to achieve a reasonable tradoff between complexity and system capacity. Finally the proposed algorithm is compared with conventional algorithms and convergence of utility function is also discussed by simulation. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than those of existing schemes in system capacity.

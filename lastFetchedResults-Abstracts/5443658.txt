The objective of this work is the design of virtual instrument software system based on state machine. Through the introduction of the basic principles of it, state machine described in detail the working mechanism and its implementation in LabVIEW, combined with the a test system. With the development of practice, for the multi-state system, the nested state machine design-type thinking. Practice has proved that the use of nested state machine model of the structure of the development of complex large-scale test system can process more clearly the logic of relations have greatly enhanced software systems reliability, reusability and maintainability.

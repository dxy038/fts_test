In this paper, we compare the bit error rate (BER) performance of linear and circular arrays in a single cell radio environment. The objective is to examine the effect of angle of arrival (AOA) distributions on system performance. The results presented are compared with the results reported in [U. Spagnolini, (2004)] for CDMA systems in spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channel. The results show that for medium angle spreads a substantial spatial diversity gain can be achieved. Results also show that the central AOA can have significant impact on BER performance for linear and circular arrays. Further, it is also shown that the communication system using array with truncated Laplacian AOA, perform better even at small angle spread as compared to other energy distributions

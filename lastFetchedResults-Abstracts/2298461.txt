Mycobacterium tuberculosis is still an important cause of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and a major cause of death in the world. Extrapulmonary TB is spread almost as much as one third of pulmonary TB. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of TB and type of affected tissue in patients with extrapulmonary TB in Tuberculosis Center in Baghmalek City. This retrospective cross-sectional study was performed on the medical records of patients with TB referred to Tuberculosis Center in Baghmalek City over a five-year period. Data included information about age, sex, location, and affected tissue or organ. Among 145 patients with TB, 67 patients (12.25%) were diagnosed with extrapulmonary TB including 39 males and 28 females with the age range of 15 to 64 years. Most common organ involved in the extrapulmonary TB was the lymph nodes (29%) followed by TB meningitis (17%), urinary tract TB (17% each), bone TB (13%), and pleural TB (13% each). The findings suggest that the prevalence of extrapulmonary TB was significant. Therefore, it is necessary to perform tests for extrapulmonary TB besides tests for TB.

The paper deals with a method for optimal identification of the dispersion coefficient for streams from observed concentration profiles at downstream sections (at least two sections are required) following injection of an environmentally safe tracer at an upstream section. The method makes use of the exact solution of the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation. A reliable and accurate procedure is proposed for routing an arbitrary concentration variation further downstream using the convolution equation and pulse kernels. The new method does not require the frozen cloud approximation and avoids the error due to numerical integration of the convolution integral used for routing the concentration. It employs the objective criterion of minimum integral squared errors between observed and computed concentrations. Application of the method to field data sets shows that reliably accurate estimates of the dispersion coefficient are obtained.

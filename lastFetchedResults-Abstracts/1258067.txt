Nonlinear programming is one of the most common models in optimization which is useful for solving many of the problems in the real world. On the other hand, in formulating engineering problems we face some practical kinds of nonlinear optimization which is called geometric programming. In fact, geometric program is a method for solving nonlinear problems with nonlinear or linear constraints. Many applications of geometric programming are engineering design problems in which some of the problems parameters are estimates of actual values. Intuitively, when the parameters are imprecise values, the derived objective value is imprecise as well. The aim of this paper is to develop a solution procedure for solving geometric programming with fuzzy triangular numbers.

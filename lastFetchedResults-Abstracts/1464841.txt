Background and Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common form of sleep disorder breathing, is highly prevalent in adults with approximately 20% adults having at least mild OSA. One of the most associated consequences of OSA is cardiovascular sequel. This study aimed to assess sleep apnea in ischemic heart disease patients and whether pulse oximetry can predict apnea in this group of patients.

Materials and Methods: Sixty adult patients referred to post-CCU were selected. Patients with respiratory and CNS problems and those using sedative drugs were excluded. All participants including post-AMI, CHF and acute coronary syndrome put under the portable device and pulse oximetry. Data were analyzed and compared using SPSS version 18 software.

Results: Mean age of patients was 61Â±11 years and 61.7% of them were female. There were no relationship between ESS > 10 and ESS > 16 with AHI > 15, but there was significant correlation between ODI  > 10 with AHI more than 15 and 30.

Conclusion: Sleep apnea is very common in cardiovascular cases and its early diagnosis and management can help physicians to control sign and symptom and decrease mortality and morbidity of patients.

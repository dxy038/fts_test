Pathway analysis is a useful tool which reveals important metabolic network properties. However, the big challenge is to propose an objective function for estimating active pathways, which represent the actual state of network. In order to provide weight values for all possible pathways within the metabolic network, this study presents different approaches, considering the structural and physiological properties of the metabolic network, aiming at a unique decomposition of the flux vector into pathways. These methods were used to analyze the hepatic metabolism considering available data sets obtained from the perfused livers of fasted rats receiving burn injury. Utilizing unique decomposition techniques and different fluxes revealed that higher weights were always attributed to short pathways. Specific pathways, including pyruvate, glutamate and oxaloacetate pools, and urea production from arginine, were found to be important or essential in all methods and experimental conditions. Moreover the pathways, including serine production from glycine and conversion between acetoacetate and Bâ€”OH-butyrate, were assigned higher weights. Pathway analysis was also used to identify the main sources for the production of certain products in the hepatic metabolic network to gain a better understanding of the effects of burn injury on liver metabolism.

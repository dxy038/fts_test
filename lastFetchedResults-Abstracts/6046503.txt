This paper constructs a parameter inverse analysis model for the diffusion analysis experiments of multi-ion transport model. It transforms multi-parameter inverse analysis problem into an optimization problem for nonlinear constrained planning. The optimization principle, the sequential quadratic programming method (SQP) for optimization and its implementation method in Matlab are introduced. With Comsol Multiphysics, multi-ion transport model is analyzed positively and is edited into the objective function (File .M) that can be directly utilized by Matlab. Then the fmincon function of the nonlinear optimization of Matlab to solve and analyze the problems. The proliferation tests of NaCl salt solution in the clay are under inverse analysis to obtain macro-transport parameters. The analysis shows that this method has fast convergence and high accuracy. This method is also beneficial to the similar optimization analysis of multi-parameter inverse analysis problems and complex nonlinear multi-field coupling problems.

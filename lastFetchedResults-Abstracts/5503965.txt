This paper describes three algorithms for automatic radio station detection based on the shape of power spectrum. The objective is to find the number of active stations and for each of them to estimate the bandwidth and carrier frequency. All three algorithms are grouping spectrum components into clusters that are assumed to correspond to active radio stations. The first algorithm finds local centers of mass and puts cluster boundaries in the middle between the neighboring centers of mass. The second algorithm determines the noise level and defines a threshold based on the level. Clusters are found based on the spectrum above the threshold. The third algorithm uses adaptive multiple thresholds for separating spectrum components in height and distance. Clustering is done at different height levels. The performances of algorithms are compared it the case of two active stations whose carrier frequencies and relative powers are arbitrarily chosen.

Development, analysis and control of an axial flux permanent magnet linear oscillating motor (PMLOM) along with a suitable speed and thrust control technique is described in this paper. Also its performance parameters, such as the force, current, efficiency, power factor etc. are experimentally assessed. The objective of this paper is to determine the forces for aluminium mover embedded with the rare earth permanent magnet experimentally and analytically through FEM software and develop a low cost solution for its control.

Background and objective: Psychological or behavioral interventions that attenuate the effects of stress may be useful in promoting immunocompetence and delaying HIV disease progression. Mindfulness-Base Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a behavioral intervention that has as its foundation the practice of insight-oriented (or mindfulness) meditation. In this study, we examined the effects of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR) upon CD4 count status of HIV/AIDS infected patients registered in positive club of Imam Khomeini Hospital in 2007.

Materials and methods: Using a pilot study, we are proposing to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychological intervention (8-week) that is based on training in mindfulness in positive club of Imam Khomeini Hospital in 2007.

Eight 2-hours weekly sessions and a day-long retreat (between sessions 6 and 7) provide 10 participants with HIV. Four participants were not admitted to the program, because of methadone therapy, social problems and subjects did not believe in MBSR. We investigated the long-term effects of this new approach on CD4 count after MBSR and 3, 6, 9 and 12-month follow-up period.

Results: We studied six HIV positive patients. The mean of age was 35 ±7.7. The means of CD4 count, before and after MBSR, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month were 549± 173.6, 640.2±189.4, 655.3±183.4, 638±167.4, 619.3±163.2, and 595.2±165.6, respectively.

Conclusion: In our study, for follow-up periods, there was statistically significant difference in CD4 counts in compare to before MBSR (P<0.05). More studies with large sample size are necessary.

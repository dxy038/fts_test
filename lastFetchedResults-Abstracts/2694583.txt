This paper presents the performance analysis and comparison of two types of bidirectional dc-dc converters-cascaded buck-boost capacitor in the middle and cascaded buck-boost inductor in the middle for use in plug-in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The comparison of the two converters is based on device requirements, rating of switches and components, control strategy, and performance. Each of the converter topologies has some advantages over the other in certain aspects. Efficiency analysis has been carried out for specific scenarios in vehicle applications. The simulation and experimental results are provided for both converter types.

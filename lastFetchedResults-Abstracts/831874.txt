Design optimization of fluid-thermal systems has been an area of significant research interest for the aerospace and automotive industry. The subject studies the modification of internal and external flow passages under certain specified objective constraints while satisfying the governing flow equations. Amongst various available optimization procedures the analytical sensitivity analyses-based optimization is arguably the most efficient design tool for complex multi-dimensional practical problems. In this paper, we augmented the analysis capabilities of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code with design sensitivity analysis (DSA). The design sensitivities are computed efficiently via analytical differentiation methods. The CFD–DSA codes are then combined with numerical optimization schemes. Finally, CFD–DSA design optimization algorithm is applied to the optimization of heat exchanger fin and HVAC duct systems.

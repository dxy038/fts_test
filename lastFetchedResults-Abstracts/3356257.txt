As part of corporate Human Resource Management, the configuration of the workforce becomes more and more challenging since an increase of non-permanent, temporary, timely restricted labour can be observed, the so-called `atypical employmentÂ´. At the same time, advancements in electronic HRM are promising a better handling of operative, but also of strategic HRM tasks. It is the objective of this paper to propose a conceptual design for the formulation of a strategy integrating e-HRM and atypical employment. Which advanced objectives can be reached by such an integrated strategy? Which tasks have to be covered in regard to this intersection? And which are the requirements for strategy formulation in respect to that integrated strategy? By this paper, we would like to strengthen the theory-practice-nexus by applying IT-related progress to a real-world phenomenon being relevant for contemporary workforce management on the strategic level.

Considering CO<sub>2</sub> emission, energy consumption and economic indices as evaluation factors, this paper proposes a new multi-objective optimization model for determining urban energy systems in a specific area. The proposed model is applied to an actual city in Japan, and the tradeoff relation among three indices is analyzed. The results show the roles of the energy system alternatives from viewpoints of CO<sub>2</sub> emission and primary energy consumption, respectively.

This paper presents a device for controlling and connecting combined Renewable Energy Sources (RES)-based generators and electric storage systems to the supply utility grid. The device is a bidirectional converter that can be controlled in order to facilitate the interface between the low voltage grid and small generators combined with Li-ion batteries, contemporary addressing the requirements of the reference technical standards for users connection and providing different ancillary services. The paper describes the laboratory and field test activities carried out by the DEIM of the University of Palermo and ENEA during 2013.

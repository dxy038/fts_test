Introduction: Study of normal morphological features of the skull with precise measurement methods is named Cephalometry. The most important dimension of cephalometric is height and width of head. Occipital flattening is common among Guilanian people, so cephalometric measurements and use of cephalic index is necessary for detailed evaluation of morphological specifications of their skulls.
Objective: To evaluate the probable differences of Guilanian cephalic index with other studies.
Materials and Methods: In this prospective descriptive study 190 patients were selected among all Guilanian people with AP and lateral skull x-rays referring to inpatient or outpatient wards of Poorsina hospital in Rasht, Cephalic index was statistically evaluated after ruler measurement and calculation of percentage of maximal head width and maximal head length relation, in skull x-rays.
Results: Among 190 Guilanian people 151 persons were male and 39 persons were female. The mean age of them was 31.8 years. Mean of maximal head width and length were 15.358±1 and 17.752±l.lcm respectively. Mean cephalic index was 86.4±4.4 in the Brach cephalic range. Ninety percent of cases had Brach cephalic and 10% had mesocephalic skull, without any dolichocephalic skull.
Conclusions: In this study brachycephaly is common among Guilanian adults, like other studies. There is differences between the results of this study with other world studies (the mesocephalic skulls are the prominent type), but there is no difference with studies on other areas of Iran.

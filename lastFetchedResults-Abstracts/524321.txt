Objective-The present study aims at examining the lymphomas in Iran and the similarities and differences with those of western countries. Methods-In a descriptive observational study, the histochemical and immunohistochemical markers were used to examine the biopsied specimens of 263 patients with Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas collected from six diagnostic centers. The non-Hodgkin’s and Hodgkin’s lymphomas were classified according to the updated Kiel classification and Rye classification, respectively. Results-Out of the 225 cases that were diagnosed as lymphomas, 170 were non- Hodgkin’s and 55 were Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Sixty-nine percent of the Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas were of the B-type, 6.5 percent of the T-type and the rest were Hodgkin’s lymphomas (24.5 %). Conclusion-The comparison made between the findings of this study and those of western countries indicates that high-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas are more prevalent than low-grade lymphomas in Iran. The use of the updated Kiel classification reveals the similarities and differences between the lymphomas of our study and those of western studies. Such studies provide useful information for a more precise diagnosis and hence more success in the treatment of lymphomas. The results also call for more research into the reasons for the prevalence of high-grade lymphomas and rare occurrence of follicular lymphomas in Iran.

The objective of this research is to investigate the heat transfer and pressure loss penalty for various numbers of transverse rows in staggered finned-tube bundles with a single transverse row of the winglet pairs beside the front row of the tube bundles. Experiments were performed for two, three, four and five rows of staggered tube bundles. The pairs of winglets were placed with a heretofore-unused orientation for the purpose of augmentation of heat transfer and reduction of pressure loss penalty. This orientation is called as "common flow up" configuration. For three rows of tubes with a single transverse row of winglets beside the front row of the tubes, the heat transfer was augmented by 30–10%, and yet the pressure loss was reduced by 55–34% with the increase of the Reynolds number (based on two times channel height) from 350 to 2100. The reduction of the pressure loss penalty for three rows of tube bundles is the largest in comparison with the other numbers of rows.

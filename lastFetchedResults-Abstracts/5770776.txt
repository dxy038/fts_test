Addresses the issues involved in radiation testing of devices and subsystems to obtain the data which are required to predict the performance and survivability of satellite systems for extended missions in space. The problems associated with space environmental simulations, or the lack thereof, in experiments intended to produce information to describe the degradation and behavior of parts and systems are discussed. Several types of radiation effects in semiconductor components are presented, as for example: ionization dose effects, heavy ion and proton induced single-event-upsets (SEU), and single-event transient-upset (SETU). Examples and illustrations of data relating to these ground testing issues are provided. The primary objective of this presentation is to alert the reader to the short-comings, pitfalls, variabilities, and uncertainties in acquiring information to logically design electronic subsystems for use in satellites or space stations with long mission lifetimes, and to point out the weaknesses and deficiencies in the methods and procedures by which that information is obtained

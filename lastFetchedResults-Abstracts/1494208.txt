Topography is one of the major factors controlling the spatial pattern of
saturated areas, which in turn is a key to understand much of the variability in soils
and hydrological processes. The topographic wetness index (TWI) which combines
local upslope contributing area and slope, is commonly used to quantify
topographic control on hydrological processes. On the other hand, the interaction
of topography with the climate affects the distribution of soil organic matter (SOM)
as one of the most effective soil quality parameters that has been shown to correlate
with TWI and can be predicted by TWI. The main objective of this study was to
evaluate different flow direction algorithms of TWI and to select suitable algorithm
for the study area and to map soil organic carbon in a loess hillslope of Toshan
area, Golestan Province, Iran. TWI was calculated by single flow direction (SFD),
biflow direction (BFD) and multiple flow direction algorithms (MFD). 135
Samples were collected at random systematic method (0-20 cm depth). The results
showed D-Infinity (BFD) and MFD algorithms in the study area had stronger
correlation with SOM than SFD (D8 and RHO8) algorithms. However TWIs used
in most studies are calculated using a SFD algorithm, which assumes that all water
from a grid cell flows into only one neighboring cell. But this assumption is not
always valid, especially in areas with low relief where movement of water may be
divergent. Finally, TWI is suggested to be calculated with different algorithms so
that the best method could be selected to obtain accurate results.

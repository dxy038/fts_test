Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in head and neck lymph nodes and in differentiating malignant from benign diseases.Material and Methods: This prospective study was conducted in the ENT Department of PGMI HMC and LRH Peshawar from 1st April 2003 to 30th March 2004. A total of 42 patients were studied. After thorough history and examination, FNA biopsy was obtained with the help of experienced cytopathologist using 21G needle and the results compared with final histopathological diagnosis.Results: FNAC findings in this series were metastatic (42.85%), tuberculosis adenitis (26.19%), reactive hyperplasia (16.66%), lymphoproliferative disorder (9.52%) and lymphoma (4.76%). In terms of differentiating malignant from non-malignant lesions; diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of FNAC were 95.23%, 95.83%, 94.44%, 95.85% and 94.44%) respectively.Conclusion: FNAC has been found to be a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients presenting with neck nodes and should be considered before performing open biopsy.

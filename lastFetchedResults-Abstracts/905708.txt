Land/ocean boundaries constitute complex systems with active physical and biogeochemical processes
that affect the global carbon cycle. An example of such a system is the mesotidal lagoon named Ria de
Aveiro (Portugal, 40 380N, 08 450W), which is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a single channel, 350 m
wide. The objective of this study was to estimate the seasonal and inter-tidal variability of organic carbon
fluxes between the coastal lagoon and the Ocean, and to assess the contribution of the organic carbon
fractions (i.e. dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC)) to the export of
organic carbon to the Ria de Aveiro plume zone. The organic carbon fractions fluxes were estimated as
the product of the appropriate fractional organic carbon concentrations and the water fluxes calculated
by a two-dimensional vertically integrated hydrodynamic model (2DH). Results showed that the higher
exchanges of DOC and POC fractions at the system cross-section occurred during spring tides but only
resulted in a net export of organic carbon in winter, totalling 85 t per tidal cycle. Derived from the winter
and summer campaigns, the annual carbon mass balance estimated corresponded to a net export of
organic carbon (7957 ¼ 6585 t yr 1 POC þ 1372 t yr 1 DOC). On the basis of the spring tidal drainage
area, it corresponds to an annual flux of 79 g m 2 of POC and 17 g m 2 of DOC out of the estuary.

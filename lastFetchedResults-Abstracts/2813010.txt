The paper addresses the coupled motion of a 6 degree of freedom robot and a snake-like dexterous manipulator (SDM) designed for the treatment of bone defects behind the implant during total hip arthroplasty revision surgery. We have formulated the problem as a weighted, multi-objective constraint, linear optimization. A remote center of motion (RCM) acts as a virtual constraint for the robot. The coupled robot kinematics does not assume piecewise-constant curvature for the SDM. We have evaluated our method by simulating the coupled system inside a potential lesion area.

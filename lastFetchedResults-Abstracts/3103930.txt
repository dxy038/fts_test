In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to image completion for overlapping chromosomes. In our system, only given missing regions, the task can be performed automatically without human intervention. We address the problem of image completion for overlapping chromosomes in the context of a discrete global optimization problem. In order to reconstruct the original chromosome image as faithfully as possible, the objective cost function of this problem is defined under constraint conditions of band patterns in chromosomes image, and corresponds to the energy of a discrete Markov random fields. For efficiently optimizing this MRF, a loopy Belief Propagation algorithm is utilized to perform it. Experiment results on input overlapping chromosomes images are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

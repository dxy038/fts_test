One process diagnosis technique is proposed to solve the problems in business process. Firstly, on the base of objective view and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a process diagnosis model is founded and the limits of the causes are given by using process business objective view. Then, objective view is converted into a hierarchical structure of AHP to quantitatively calculate the effects of these causes on the problems. Finally, a software package to support the proposed technique was developed and, as a case study, applied to a process diagnosis in a manufacturing enterprise. The operations of the system in the enterprise have shown that the performance is fine and have got better economic profit and social benefit

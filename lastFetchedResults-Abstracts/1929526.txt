The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of photoperiods longer than 14 h of light:10 h of dark (14L:10D) during the rearing period on the age at first egg laying (AFE) and the subsequent reproductive performance in geese. Sixty-six White Roman geese (18 male and 48 female) were divided into three groups and subjected to different lighting schemes, i.e. natural lighting (NAT; 23°51′N, 120°33′E), 14L and 18L. Birds in 14L and 18L groups were exposed to 14L:10D or 18L:6D, respectively, beginning at 19 weeks of age and followed by a photoperiod of 10L:14D from 40 weeks of age. The natural photoperiod, including both dawn and dusk was between 11.5L:12.5D and 14.5L:9.5D. The results showed that the AFE was postponed (P&lt;0.05). Average weight of the first three eggs laid and the fertility of these eggs were improved (P&lt;0.05) for the geese in 14L and 18L groups when compared to those raised under natural lighting conditions. Meanwhile, the duration of laying were shifted from spring to autumn, with the peak laying rate in September and November instead of March. It was concluded that geese exposed to the photoperiod longer than 14L:10D for 21 weeks during the rearing period would suppress their AFE. Thereafter, the onset of laying could be induced by being transferred to the photoperiod of 10L:14D. The manipulation of photoperiodic regimes used in this study might have a potential benefit for geese farmers through improved weight and fertility of eggs.

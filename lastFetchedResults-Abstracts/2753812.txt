Objective: In microstrip transmission line (MTL) transmit/receive (transceive) arrays used for ultrahigh field MRI, the array length is often constrained by the required resonant frequency, limiting the image coverage. The purpose of this study is to increase the imaging coverage and also improve its parallel imaging capability by utilizing a double-row design. Methods: A 16-channel double-row MTL transceive array was designed, constructed, and tested for human head imaging at 7 T. Array elements between two rows were decoupled by using the induced current elimination or magnetic wall decoupling technique. In vivo human head images were acquired, and g-factor results were calculated to evaluate the performance of this double-row array. Results: Testing results showed that all coil elements were well decoupled with a better than -18 dB transmission coefficient between any two elements. The double-row array improves the imaging quality of the lower portion of the human head, and has low g-factors even at high acceleration rates. Conclusion: Compared with a regular single-row MTL array, the double-row array demonstrated a larger imaging coverage along the z-direction with improved parallel imaging capability. Significance: The proposed technique is particularly suitable for the design of large-sized transceive arrays with large channel counts, which ultimately benefits the imaging performance in human MRI.

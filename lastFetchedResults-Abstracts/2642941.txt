Abstract

Objective

Cystic craniopharyngiomas are considered the most common intracranial nonglial tumor in children with the tendency for cyst formations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intracystic phosphorus 32 (P32) therapies on controlling the growth of the cystic component of craniopharyngioma.

Materials & Methods

This clinical study was conducted on 47 patients with cystic craniopharyngioma from March 1998 to June 2012 at Shohada Tajrish Hospital, Tehran, Iran.

Patients were treated with stereotactic intracystic P32. The mean cyst volume was 23.5 ml, and the dose of radiation to the inner cyst wall was 250 Gy.

Results

The overall response rate was 78.1% and the mean survival was 113.1Â±11months.

The survival rate at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after p32 therapy was 91%, 77%, 73%, and 52%, respectively. There was no mortality related to the procedure and no visual or endocrinal deterioration. Visual improvement occurred in 88% of patients presented with recent deterioration due to the cyst enlargement.

Conclusion

Intracystic p32 therapy was an effective and almost safe procedure for the treatment of cystic component of craniopharyngioma.

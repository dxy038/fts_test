The objective of this paper is to present a method of target recognition based on the Fuzzy Logic principles applied to conventional and multifunction radars. After a presentation of the parameters which can be delivered by signal and data processing, the paper gives a description of an algorithm including both spatial and temporal merging. Computation of basic functions &#8220;Membership function&#8221; and &#8220;Density of possibility&#8221; are emphasised for typical radar applications. Finally, some simulation results are shown and discussed

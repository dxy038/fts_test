This paper presents developments of micro channel array with detecting microelectrodes (hereafter MCA) for electrophysiological biomedical sensors. Electrophysiological biomedical sensors for drug screening require higher-throughput of testing. MCA corresponding to a large number of objective cells have been developed to satisfy this demand. Based on successful results of the first design of MCA with 100 channels in F 440 &#956;m area, several improvements have been carried out to provide higher performances. The latest MCA with isolated detecting electrodes for the individual detection of cell signals will be also reported.

In this paper, we study a supply chain problem where a whole seller/producer distributes goods among different retailers. Such problems are always faces with uncertainty with input data and we have to use various techniques to handle the uncertainty. The proposed model of this paper considers different input parameters such as demand, capacity and cost in trapezoid fuzzy forms and using two ranking methods, we handle the uncertainty. The results of the proposed model of this paper have been compared with the crisp and other existing fuzzy techniques using some randomly generated data. The preliminary results indicate that the proposed models of this paper provides better values for the objective function and do not increase the complexity of the resulted problem.

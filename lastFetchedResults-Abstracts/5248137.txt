This paper presents Correlation-optimized Time Warping (CoTW) for aligning motion sequences. The proposed method maximizes an objective function based on the correlation of the two sequences. There are several parameters involved in the process, which can be computationally optimized or manually customized. Customization can take place based on the number and/or nature of actions in the sequences. CoTW shows robust performance for aligning simple gait sequences as well as sequences containing several different actions.

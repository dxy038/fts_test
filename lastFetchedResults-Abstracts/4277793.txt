We designed a scheme to introduce the LIGA process, reduce the coil line width while improving the performance, and thereby drastically cut the production costs. Consequently, we succeeded in fabricating prototype microcoils (line width: 10mum, aspect ratio; approx. 1). However, improvement in the performance of the microcoils requires an increased aspect ratio. We set an objective to fabricate microcoil lines of a high aspect ratio with the dipping method and 3D x-ray lithography in an effort to improve the performance of microcoils. And we succeeded in fabricating microcoil line with a line width of 10mum and an aspect ratio greater than 5

The objective of this work is to design an IIR filter with a transfer function as close as possible to that of the FIR sine filter but with less number of coefficients, hence saving both time and energy without degrading the device performance in terms of output signal to noise ratio. The procedure is based on utilizing the bilinear transformation to design the filter transfer function in the frequency domain and completing the design by minimizing the difference between the assumed function and the target function. The results obtained compare well with design data published in the literatures

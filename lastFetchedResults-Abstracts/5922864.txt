Abstract - This work presents a synchronizer based on pulse comparation, between variable and fixed pulses. We consider four synchronizers, divided in two variants, one variant operate at the rate and the other at half rate.Each synchronizer variant has two versions which are the manual and the automatic.The objective is to study the synchronizers and evaluate the output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus the input SNR (Signal Noise Ratio).

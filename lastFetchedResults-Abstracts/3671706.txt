The eigenimage filter generates a composite image in which a desired feature is segmented from interfering features. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the eigenimage equals its contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and is directly proportional to the dissimilarity between the desired and interfering features. Since image gray levels are analytical functions of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters, it is possible to maximize this dissimilarity by optimizing these parameters. For optimization, the authors consider four MRI pulse sequences: multiple spin-echo (MSE); spin-echo (SE); inversion recovery (IR); and gradient-echo (GE). The authors use the mathematical expressions for MRI signals along with intrinsic tissue parameters to express the objective function (normalized SNR of the eigenimage) in terms of MRI parameters. The objective function along with a set of diagnostic or instrumental constraints define a multidimensional nonlinear constrained optimization problem, which the authors solve by the fixed point approach. The optimization technique is demonstrated through its application to phantom and brain images. The authors show that the optimal pulse sequence parameters for a sequence of four MSE and one IR images almost doubles the smallest normalized SNR of the brain eigenimages, as compared to the conventional brain protocol

Saturation of existing networks and the continuous growth of load have led to increased interest in distributed generation (DG) units. Proper locations of DG units in power system are important to improve the power system operation at different conditions with respect to system power losses and relief of the heavy loaded lines. In this paper, a multi-objective formulation for siting and sizing of DG units into existing transmission networks is proposed. The methodology adopted permits the operator to compromise between the objective functions, which are reducing the power flows in the critical transmission lines and minimizing. the system power losses. The implemented technique is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) and priority goal programming method (PGP). Numerical simulations are carried out on two test systems in order to examine the validity of the proposed procedure.

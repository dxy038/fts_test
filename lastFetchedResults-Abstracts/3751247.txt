The objective of the high-altitude supersonic target (HAST) radar augmentation system is to simulate the radar cross section (RCS) of a real target. The system is, therefore, of the active transponder type with various radiating antennas simulating the dominant scattering centers on the real target. We develop a system model, which when combined with the measured RCS of the HAST vehicle, simulates the RCS of the real target. Comparisons with measurements illustrating the success of the simulation program are given.

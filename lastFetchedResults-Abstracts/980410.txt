Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)—the bacterium that causes tuberculosis—resides in phagosomes inside macrophages. This bacterium evades destruction by preventing phagosome maturation, which involves the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes. In this issue of Cell, suggest that mycobacteria co-opt the actin-binding protein coronin 1 to activate the phosphatase calcineurin, thereby preventing phagosomal maturation.

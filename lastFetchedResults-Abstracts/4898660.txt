The objective of this study was to develop a physics-based model of a SiC BJT and verify its validity through experimental testing. Two physical models were considered: a lumped charge model and the Fourier series solution used to solve the ambipolar diffusion equation (ADE). These models were realized using Matlab and Simulink. The simulation and experimental results of static and switching waveforms are given.

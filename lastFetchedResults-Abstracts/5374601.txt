The article shows two control schemes based on variable structure theory applied to DC motors to control bidirectional position. In the first scheme, the power converter (full-bridge DC-DC converter) is modeled by mean values, whereas in the second, this one is a controller part. This last way is the most appropriate to model the on-off operation of the converter. The proposed control schemes produce a fast, overdamped and good steady state response, is insensible to parameter variations, and is simple to implement with power converters. Design analysis is described, digital simulations and experimental results confirm the efficiency and robustness of the described control schemes

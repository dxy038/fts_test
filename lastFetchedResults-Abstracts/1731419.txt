Results of the camphorquinone/hindered piperidines, visible-light photoinduced polymerization of triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate are presented. The effectiveness of piperidines as a coinitiator is compared with a few aliphatic amines and aromatic amines. The main objective in this research was to study the mechanism of photoinitiation of polymerization. Reactive radicals that initiate the polymerization are formed by a mechanism of hydrogen atom abstraction by the triplet state of camphorquinone, mediated by photoinduced electron transfer. The different efficiencies of the aliphatic amines and of the aromatic amines affecting photopolymerization are explained on the basis of the different quenching reactivities of the excited states of camphorquinone.

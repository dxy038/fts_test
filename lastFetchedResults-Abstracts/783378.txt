Objective To explore whether the 4-
item subjective well-being subscale could be used to
detect a major depressive illness. Secondly, to describe
the prevalence and characteristics of depressed
health care attendees at primary healthcare
centres. Method Using a descriptive, cross-sectional
study design, we interviewed 199 consecutive patients
about their socio-demographics, subjective
well-being (SWB), major depressive illness symptoms
and depression severity. The instruments used
were translated into Luganda. Results Point prevalence
of a current Major Depressive Episode (MDE)
was 31.6%. Using a one week reference period, we
found that experiencing a lot of distress, having less
energy or poor health, having poor emotional and
psychological adjustment and not being satisfied
with life were significantly more common among
patients with a current MDE. The 4-item SWB
subscale detected depression of up to 87.1% (95%
CI: 0.818â€“0.923). In logistic regression, all four SWB
items predicted a current MDE. Conclusion Major
depressive illness is a common at primary healthcare
level in Uganda. Four simple questions
reflecting SWB items have potential to detect diagnosable
patients likely to have a current MDE,
making general screening procedures less necessary

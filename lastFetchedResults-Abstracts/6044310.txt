This paper considers the Base Station (BS) clustering in a downlink heterogeneous network with finite backhaul capacity. We consider a tree structure network where each BS has only one incoming link and several outgoing links. The objective is to maximize the minimum rate among all users while satisfying the backhaul capacity constraint and the per-BS power constraint. We propose an algorithm that combines the bisection and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The bisection search is conducted for the minimum rate. When it is given, we use ADMM to check the feasibility of the network while obeying the backhaul and power constraints. There are two steps involved in ADMM: i) a second order conic programming is used to calculate the beamformer; ii) a closed-form rule is used to determine the BS clustering. Due to the non-convexity and the non-smoothness, ADMM is not guaranteed to solve the problem. Therefore, we propose a revise step to further improve the performance. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the heuristic method and the revise step does improve the performance in all considered scenarios.

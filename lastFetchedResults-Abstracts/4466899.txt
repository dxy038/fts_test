The distributed generation (DG) interconnection into the distribution network may lead to significant changes in system. The installation of DG must be met network requirement such as: breaking capacity of switchgears, decreasing loss, increasing reliability and voltage quality. Beside, in this work, the paper also considers the objective function concerning the utility and DG private owner benefits. The resolving is based on fuzzy set and genetic algorithm (GA). These objectives are chosen more suitable for Vietnamese conditions. The DG with unavailable energy source such as solar and wind are considered. The paper also presented the general case when many types of DG can be involved.

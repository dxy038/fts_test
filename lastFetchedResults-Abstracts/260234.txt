We show that the equilibrium of a standard real business cycle model with capital adjustment costs can be supported as an equilibrium with a risk averse firm and no adjustment costs. Our result sheds light on the implications of a utility maximizing (UM) firm, which is one of the approaches proposed in the literature to get around the firm objective problem when markets are incomplete.

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate an approach to perform distribution transformer management with multi-agent technologies. With the proposed approach, the distribution transformer´s loading level is kept below a certain value by dynamically allocating the transformer´s demand limit (DL) among the homes served by the transformer during a demand response event. The DL assignment takes into account, for each home, its load profile (kW), electrical panel size (A), expected instantaneous demand (kW), and homeowner´s preferences. The proposed set of algorithms is developed in a multi-agent system (MAS). In this paper, the MAS is designed, developed and implemented in JAVA Agent Development Framework (JADE). A distribution network is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink integrated with the developed stand-alone HEM software. These platforms are linked together via MACSimJX middleware and TCPIIP communications.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that high consumption of sprouted potatoes can cause acute toxicities, coma, and death in human. These effects are attributed to glycoalkaloids such as alpha-solanine which is naturally found in potatoes and cereals. It is also frequently appeared during inappropriate transfer and storage after harvesting. The present study is designed to assess the acute and chronic toxicity effects of alpha-solanine in mice.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 90 BALB/c male mice were equally divided into acute and chronic groups (n=45). Each group then equally subdivided into control, and 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups of alpha-solanine (n=9). Animals were euthanized after 24 hours and 7 days of solanine injection (i.p) in the acute and chronic groups, respectively. Blood samples were taken for hematology and chemical tests.
FINDINGS: Alpha-solanine did not significantly effects on hematological and chemical parameters in the acute groups. Red blood cell count was significantly increased (6.1±0.3 to 8.8±0.8, p=0.02), but plasma alkaline phosphatase level was statistically reduced (764±50 to 452±33, p=0.01) in 40 mg/kg chronic groups compared to control. Significant increase was observed in blood levels of sodium (149.4±2.1 to 155.5±1.3, p=0.03), glucose (181±59 to 322±64, p=0.025) and creatinine (0.34±0.008 to 1.07±0.25, p=0.02) in 40 mg/kg chronic groups compared to control.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that long-term use of high solanine can dramatically induce hematological and chemical changes in a dose-dependent manner.

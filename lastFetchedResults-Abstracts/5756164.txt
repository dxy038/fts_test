A genetic-algorithm (GA) based optimization approach for the design of delay equalizers is presented. In the proposed approach, an objective function based on the passband filter-equalizer group delay is constructed and the equalizer coefficients are treated as the chromosomes to be optimized. The GA employs an adaptive perturbation technique for crossovers whereby the elements of a parent chromosome are perturbed by small amounts to obtain an offspring. The required equalizer is built by adding new second-order sections until the desired accuracy is achieved. Experimental results show that the GA based approach can achieve stable delay equalizers that would satisfy arbitrary prescribed specifications pertaining to the flatness of the group delay with respect to the passband

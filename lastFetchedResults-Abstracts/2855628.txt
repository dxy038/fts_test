To achieve a better riding stability and dynamic characteristic, control strategies for torque allocation are proposed, and then the discussions for the proposed control strategy has conducted. In order to solve the torque optimization question, an objective optimization is proposed. Suitable characterizations of road condition and mechanical structure are used in the strategy to dynamically distribute the torque demand among four in-wheel motors. Simulation results indicate that control strategy for torque allocation with motors in normal state and failure state can achieve the designed demands well, and the dynamic performance of the distributed driving electric vehicles has been enhanced.

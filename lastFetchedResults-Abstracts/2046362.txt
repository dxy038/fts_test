In this paper, the computational studies are
performed to compute the principle plane patterns of micro
strip patch array antenna. The objective of present work is to
design the rectangular micro strip patch antenna to achieve
good directivity. The principle plane patterns are computed
for different dielectric constants by keeping inter element
spacing constant. The best possible antenna array is chosen
by computing the Directivity for each dielectric constant.

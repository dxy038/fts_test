Practical considerations for the mapping of traffic and QoS requirements of TCP/IP applications to ATM resources on intercontinental ATM WANs were one of the objectives of the Canada-Germany research activity &#8220;Support for Multimedia Protocols on International High-Speed Connections&#8221;". The research focused on defining efficient connection admission control policies for bundling of TCP/IP connections. TCP/IP performance experiments using unidirectional and bidirectional bundles of connections with different traffic characteristics are presented. The trans-Atlantic ATM WAN scenarios are compared with corresponding ATM LAN measurements

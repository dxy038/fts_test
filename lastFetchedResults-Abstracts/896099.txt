Background and Objective: The endodontic management of immature teeth with wide open apices has always posed particular problems. A number of canal preparation and filling techniques have been described such as apexification, surgery and retrograde filling, customized-cone, and apical plug. The purpose of this study was to compare the sectional technique microleakage in open apices with lateral compaction technique.

Materials and Methods: Twenty seven open apex canals and twenty seven close apex canals were used in this study. Teeth were divided into two groups. In addition to 23 experimental teeth in each group, there were 4 positive controls and 4 negative controls. Group1 was filled with sectional warm gutta percha and group 2 was filled with lateral condensation technique. The extent of dye penetration was determined with stereomicroscope and by two independent observers. The data were obtained and then statistically analyzed with t test. 

Results: The mean microleakage )intra-canal dye penetration( in group 1 (sectional)(penetration was 0.042) was not significantly different versus group 2 (lateral) (penetration was 0.027). 

Conclusion: This study suggests that sectional technique is a suitable and non-surgical method for filling gutta-percha in open apex teeth.

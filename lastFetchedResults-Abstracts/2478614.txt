Background and Aim: Postural control is the ability of maintaining of the body posture in space. Peripheral and central factors have important role in muscle fatigue. Repetitive muscle contraction leads to muscle fatigue. If strength is educed up to 30% of maximum contraction can be disturbed stance control of subjects. The objective of the present study was to compare the effect of lumbar muscle fatigue on postural control in athlete and non-athlete subjects.   Materials and Methods: Fifteen men as athlete subjects and other fifteen matched men as non- athlete subjects participated in this study. Trunk extensor muscle fatigue was produced by dynamometer. Stance postural sways were evaluated by force platform device in bipedal stance with open eye.   Results: In pre-fatigue state there is no significant difference between two groups. Fatigue had significantly effect on postural sways in both group after Lumbar muscle fatigue specially in non-athlete group (P ≥ 0.05) .   Conclusion: The postural control of athletes after muscle fatigue was better than non athlete subjects probably due to better proprioception in athlete subjects.   Keywords: Muscle fatigue, Postural control, Force plattform.

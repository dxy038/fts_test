Background
Prevention efforts can reduce the considerable health and economic burdens imposed by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The objective of this study was to estimate the reduction in direct medical costs associated with reductions in gonorrhea and syphilis incidence in the United States from 1990 to 2003.
Methods

Using published estimates of the per-case costs of STDs, we estimated the annual costs from 1990 to 2003 of four main outcomes: primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, congenital syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV costs attributable to the facilitative effects of gonorrhea and syphilis on HIV transmission and acquisition.
Results

Reductions in syphilis and gonorrhea from 1990 to 2003 have saved an estimated $5.0 billion (in 2003 U.S. dollars): $1.1 billion in costs associated with P&S syphilis, congenital syphilis, and gonorrhea, and $3.9 billion in HIV costs attributable to syphilis and gonorrhea. In additional analyses, the estimated reductions in disease burden were substantially lower (1) when calculated incrementally (rather than cumulatively) and (2) when long-term costs of STDs were excluded.
Conclusions

These estimated reductions in the burden of gonorrhea and syphilis show the economic benefits of reducing the incidence of these STDs and preventing their resurgence.

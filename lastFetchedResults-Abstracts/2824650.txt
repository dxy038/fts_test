Multiple image thresholding is a popular method used to separate homogeneous subsets of gray level images. To find the optimum threshold in the image in the literature is still a research topic. Many image thresholding method uses the histogram of the image. In this study, the objective function of Otsu method which is a statistical process, Particle Swarm Optimization with an intuitive algorithm (PSO) by maximizing, the optimal threshold values on a medical image were studied to find. The values obtained were tested with a standard test image and brain magnetic resonance (MR) image exposed on the tumor region in segmentation, Otsu-PSO method performance was monitored.

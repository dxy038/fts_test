Objective evaluation methods of hearing aids are currently based on normal hearing case, without considering the different cases of hearing loss. In this paper, the least square method is used to design digital filters according to standard audiograms. Finally, a set of experiments to verify the attenuation effectiveness of the filters are done, and the results show that, the filters in this paper have the same attenuation effect as the standard audiograms. Thus, the filters is feasible, it can be used for measurement and evaluation system of hearing aids to improve the accuracy of the evaluation.

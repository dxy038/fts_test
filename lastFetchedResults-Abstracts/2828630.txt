Battery swapping becomes one of the most important ways to supply the energy for electric vehicles (EVs), since it takes a short time to recharge and is convenient in managing. It leads to growing popularity of the EVs to develop the battery swapping station (BSS). This paper investigates the optimization of the number of EV battery (EVB) packs and the chargers of the station. The structure of the station system and the operation strategy of &#8220;charging immediately after swapping&#8221; is first talked about. Then, the number of EVB packs in different states is analyzed based on the aforementioned strategy. We build a mathematical model which has the objective of uniform annual value of the facilitiesÂ´ cost, and restrictions of the size of the station and the demand of availability of battery swapping service per day (ABSSD). The mathematical model is solved with DE algorithm. The optimization method is configured and proved to be rational by results of a case analyzed. The research provides support for configuration plan of BSS.

Mobile Ad Hoc Networks have been deployed in a wide spectrum of domain ranging from military battlefields, natural disaster and manmade disaster management, conference, home networking, patient monitoring, remote landscape monitoring to name a few. MANET being an infrastructureless network with its inherent features like self-configuration, self-organizing and self-administration, it has been focus of research for more than a decade. Due to node mobility, topology of the network changes frequently and rapidly and hence routing is the most challenging functionality in these types of networks. Routing schemes based on various approaches like Bio inspired routing, Secured routing, trust based routing, gossip routing, anonymous routing, fuzzy based routing etc. have been proposed in the literature. Comparing all these approaches fuzzy logic is been proved as a good approach to treat random uncertainty, i.e. the impossibility of prediction of a sequence of events. The main objective of the paper is taking QoS into consideration, based on the fuzzy logic, routing will be done efficiently and effectively.

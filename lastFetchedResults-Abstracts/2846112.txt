Measurement results used for Power Quality assessment give an objective evaluation if their trust level is high. This requirement becomes feasible if a system for ensuring measurement quality is already in place and it is adapted to measurements specific domain. The system for ensuring measurement quality is absolutely necessary when measurement results are used to take correct decisions. Because all measurements are accompanied by errors and measurement uncertainty the results are expressed taking into account a certain probability. Sometimes this probability presents a risk if itÂ´s not high enough. This article presents some aspects which can contribute to diminish the risk when PQ measurements are validated.

Objective: To explore the association of lipids and lipoprotein levels with large waist circumference in obese primary school children of Dera Ismail Khan. Methodology: This study explores the frequency of adverse level of waist circumference in primary school children and associated high serum concentration of lipids and lipoproteins to identify children at risk for cardiovascular disease. Results: The study involved 86 primary school children, (Obese: 61 (70.93%), Normal weight: 25 (29.06%)). Adverse level of waist circumference (WC) was observed in 32% normal weight and 78.69% in obese children. Gender difference for higher level of WC, was observed in obese children (boys = 42%, girls = 36 .68%). Higher level of lipids (Triglyceride and Total Cholesterol) and lipoproteins (High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) was noted in children with higher WC (Normal weight 6 (24%), Obese 48 (80%)) compared with children having low level of WC (normal weight <61cms and obese <71cm). Conclusion: The adverse level of waist circumference was observed in most of the obese children and a higher level of lipids and lipoproteins was also noted in children with adverse level of waist circumference.

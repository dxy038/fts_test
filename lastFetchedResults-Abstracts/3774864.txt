Three versions of the multiple attribute (objective) decisionmaking problem with additive utilities are considered. The versions vary according to whether the preferences available for the objectives and the preferences for different attributes for each objective are cardinal or ordinal. In the versions considered, at least one of these two preferences is ordinal. The solution techniques presented either result in a single priority vector or a nondominated set of priority vectors for the alternatives.

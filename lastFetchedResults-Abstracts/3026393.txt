The purpose of this contribution is to describe personal experiences of a researcher whose work has been supported by ONR and to point out numerous similarities between emerging terrestrial power systems and power systems naval ships. Modern naval power systems are among other features, characterized by a very high concentration of power electronic loads. The use of power electronic converters could lead to bidirectional power flows in distribution systems on ships and in utilities, thus further increasing the need to understand and tightly control dynamics of power systems. Some of the recognized characteristics of naval electric power system and their implications are presented.

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the role of albumin on the corrosion behavior of titanium in a solution containing 2.0 g/l fluoride and either 0.1 or 1.0 g/l albumin. The corrosion behavior and surface characterization of passive films on titanium immersed in such a solution were examined. In addition, the change in pH and the concentration of dissolved titanium in the solution were examined. The results showed that the corrosion of titanium in a solution containing fluoride was distinct, and that adding albumin to the solution containing fluoride suppressed corrosion. Fluorine was detected on the titanium surface immersed in the solution containing fluoride, and dissolution of the titanium was confirmed. The titanium immersed in a solution containing both fluoride and albumin had an albumin film regardless of the albumin concentration. In addition, the amount of dissolved titanium from the titanium immersed in the solution was less than when the solution contained no albumin. It was suggested that the formation of adsorbed albumin films on or in the passive film acted to not only protect the titanium from attack by the fluoride but also suppressed dissolution of the titanium-fluoride compounds.

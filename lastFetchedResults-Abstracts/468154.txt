Objective: The objective of this study was to describe the use of synthetic grafts in repairing fascial dehiscence complicated by fascial necrosis and infection after obstetric and gynecologic operations. Study Design: A retrospective review of the operating room records at Hutzel Hospital (Detroit, Mich) was performed to find all cases of fascial dehiscence repaired during a 6-year period between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1996. Patients with partial or complete disruption of the fascia with evidence of fascial necrosis and infection were included in this study. Demographic information; the initial surgical procedure, including type of incision; suture material; use of synthetic graft and closure technique for repair of dehiscence; postoperative complications, microbiologic results; antibiotic therapy; subsequent operations; length of hospital stay; and late complications were recorded. Results: During the study period 52 patients underwent repair of fascial dehiscence; 36 of these had concurrent fascial necrosis and infection, including 4 women with necrotizing fasciitis. Eighteen patients were from the obstetric service and 18 were from the benign or cancer gynecology service. Ninety-one bacterial isolates were recovered from the infected wounds. Extensive fascial resection precluded closure without tension in 18 cases and necessitated synthetic graft placement to prevent evisceration. Graft materials included polypropylene (11 cases) and polyglactin (7 cases). Late complications of graft placement included extrusion of the graft in 3 patients and incisional hernia in 1. Conclusions: Extensive fascial débridement with resection prevents primary closure of wound dehiscence. Synthetic grafts permit primary closure of large fascial defects and can be used with extensive débridement in the presence of infection. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:1430-5.)

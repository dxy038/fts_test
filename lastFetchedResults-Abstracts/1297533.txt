This paper concerns the mathematical formulation and optimal solutions for the Flexible Manufacturing Systems Scheduling Problem (FMSSP) with one vehicle. This linear formulation differs from the previously published ones as it takes into account the maximum number of jobs allowed in the system, limited input/output buffer capacities, empty vehicle trips and no-move-ahead trips simultaneously. Our objective is to propose optimal solutions for small and medium-sized instances and to examine a number of commonly used assumptions and heuristics. Computational experiments are carried out on instances adapted from Bilge and Ulusoy [Bilge, Ü., Ulusoy, G., 1995. A time window approach to simultaneous scheduling of machines and material handling system in an FMS. Operations Research 43, 1058–1070] and the following heuristics are evaluated: FIFO (First In First Out) rules for input/output buffer management; and FIFO, SPT (Shortest Processing Time), STT (Shortest Travel Time) and MOQS (Maximum Outgoing Queue Size) rules concerning the vehicle. The consequences of classical assumptions are also studied: ignoring empty trips, ignoring no-move-ahead constraints, and ignoring vehicle-disjunction constraints. The numerical experiments provide a set of optimal solutions and allow to evaluate the performances of heuristic search schemes.

Control charts are the most important tools of statistical process control used to discriminate between assignable and common causes of variation and to improve the quality of a process. To design a control chart, three parameters including sample size, sampling interval, and control limits should be determined. The objectives are hourly expected cost, in-control average run length, power of the control chart, and average time to signal. Different approaches such as statistical design, economic design, and economic-statistical design of control charts have been considered by many researchers. Recently, multi-objective design of control chart has been investigated in the literature. In this paper we propose a multi-objective economic-statistical design of np control chart (np-MOESD). To solve the multi-objective model, a method is used to find the Pareto optimal solution and then a combined method based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is proposed to determine the most efficient design parameters. A numerical example of Duncan [1] illustrates the proposed approach. Sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the proposed model. In addition, the proposed model is compared with pure economic design (Duncanâ€™s model) as well as another model in the literature. Results show that the proposed np-MOESD model improves statistical properties of np control charts.

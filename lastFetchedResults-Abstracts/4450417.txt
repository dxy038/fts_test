In the steel industry the roll grinding machine has become important for maintenance. The rolls always have surface or shape errors after plastically deforming steel slabs to the steel plate. This error affects the manufacturing quality of the steel plate manufacturing process. There are many parameters for the manufacture of the roll grinding machine, such as speed of roll, speed of grinding wheel and speed of moving horizontally etc. The objective of this work is to reduce the surface error of the roll by using a helical path method. One of the important problems with the roll grinding machine is the coordinated control of the spindle axis roll speed and the z-axis speed; a lower roll speed and fast axis movement will make a roll curve error. To reduce this error a helical path was used. The helical path was used for the C-Axis (C-axis converted from the spindle axis). The results were analyzed using a mathematical model to compare the effects of the conventional method and the helical path method. It was found that the helical path method reduced the error by about 7.8%.

 One of the issues which has been presented in cognitive linguistics is the understanding of abstract and subjective domains such as time. Objective and real domains like space are understood directly. We as humans interact with such domains in our everyday life. As a result of such interactions, some image – schemas are built in our brains which are used in the understanding of more abstract domains. In order to study the relationship between the time and the space, we have studied prepositions which are one of the best examples of polysemy in Persian grammar and we have drawn a semantic network for each preposition based on Tylor and Evans’s (2003) criteria in determining the primary and distinct meaning of a preposition. Semantic networks show that temporal terms are based on spatial terms in Persian grammar.

This work presents a perceptual-based no-reference objective image sharpness/blurriness metric by integrating the concept of just noticeable blur (JNB) into a probability summation model. Unlike existing objective no-reference image sharpness/blurriness metrics, the proposed metric is able to predict the relative amount of blurriness in images with different content. Results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed perceptual-based sharpness metric. These results show that the proposed sharpness metric correlates well with the perceived sharpness.

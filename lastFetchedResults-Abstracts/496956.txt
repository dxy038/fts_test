Background: Type 1 diabetes is the most common metabolic disease worldwide. Thyroid autoimmune diseases is the most common  endocrinopathy in  diabetes type 1 .Therefore, assessment of thyroid function tests and anti thyroid antibodies in  diabetic patients (type 1) is beneficial  in early.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the anti-thyroid antibodies in diabetic children (type 1) with healthy children . 
Methods: In this descriptive-analytic study, 65 children with Type 1 diabetes and 65 healthy children who had referred to Children's Hospital in Qazvin were selected by simple sampling. Anti-TG, Anti-TPO, TSH and T4 were measured in both groups. Chi-square, t-independent and Kruskal Valis was used for statistical analysis.
Findings: The difference between sex and age in both groups (case and control) was not significant but BMI percentile was significantly different. Positive Anti-TG was 10.8% in patients and was 1.5% in controls .The difference was statistically significant (p=0.029). 16.9% of patients and 3.1% of controls  had positive Anti-TPO (p=0.024).10.8% of  patients had increased TSH and decreased T4 level (Overt Hypothyroidism) .4.6% of  controls had increased TSH and normal T4 level (Subclinical Hypothyroidism). The difference was statistically significant for T4. 
Conclusion: It seems that the prevalence of Hashimoto thyroiditis in patients with type 1 diabetes is more than healthy people.  Hence, evaluation of thyroid function tests (TFT) and antithyroid antibodies (Anti-TPO) is necessary to diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune thyroid disorders.

This paper presents an intelligent ridesharing system for taxi to share cost and journey among the passengers. The objective of the system is to provide taxi-sharing service for passengers who want to save the payment cost. It is done by recommending taxis drivers for picking up passengers at a higher revenue. The passengers are able to find taxis easily and quickly as well. By exploiting the time-dependent R-Tree, we formulate the problem of choosing the paths among the taxis in the same region by using non-cooperative game theory. The results show that our method can find taxis and passengers at an acceptable range. In addition, applying our method can reduce the payment of passengers and increase the taxi revenue by sharing.

The aim of this paper is to consider the construction site layout planning (CSLP) problem under a fuzzy random environment. With consideration of the multi-objective optimization (MOO) model is developed for fulfilling the requirement of reducing cost and improving the site security simultaneously. For solving MOO model, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is designed as a solution method. Finally, the results and comparisons analysis of a case study are presented to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the optimization method. A case study of a building project is used to validate the proposed MOO model and the results are very positive.

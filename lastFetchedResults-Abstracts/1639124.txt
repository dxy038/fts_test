Basic oxygen furnace steel slag is a kind of cementitious material with low activity and hard for grinding. The objective of this work was to validate specious grinding aids F1 made in lab which was effective for the grinding of steel slag, thus enhancing the hydration properties. By using 0.05% F1, the Blaine value of steel slag was added up to 361.3 m2/kg, the portion of size which is normally smaller than 30 Î¼m was increased and its particle size distribution turned homogeneous. The exothermic rate was increased after 8 h, and the enhancement of hydration properties was more obvious at early age. More calcium aluminum hydrate was generated at 3 days, and the pastes structure tissue became dense after 28 days.

The objective of this study was to develop a dessert that contains soy protein (SP) (1%, 2%, 3%) and guava juice (GJ) (22%, 27%, 32%) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) as the optimisation technique. Water activity, physical stability, colour, acidity, pH, iron, and carotenoid contents were analysed. Affective tests were performed to determine the degree of liking of colour, creaminess, and acceptability. The results showed that GJ increased the values of redness, hue angle, chromaticity, acidity, and carotenoid content, while SP reduced water activity. Optimisation suggested a dessert containing 32% GJ and 1.17% SP as the best proportion of these components. This sample was considered a source of fibres, ascorbic acid, copper, and iron and garnered scores above the level of ‘slightly liked’ for sensory attributes. Moreover, RSM was shown to be an adequate approach for modelling the physicochemical parameters and the degree of liking of creaminess of desserts.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different trough types on the water consumption and drinking
behaviour of pasture-based beef heifers. Two trials were implemented with 32 beef heifers to test two different types of water
troughs, namely a rectangular concrete trough (RC) and a round polyvinyl chloride water tank (PVC). In Trial 1, both troughs
were simultaneously available to groups of four animals within eight paddocks. In Trial 2, the animals were distributed in pairs
throughout 16 paddocks and, in a crossover design, were exposed to one type of trough at a time. In both trials, estimated
water intake was per four animals. Number of drinking bouts, time spent drinking and amount of water intake from the RC
and PVC trough were recorded in both trials. Data were statistically analysed by analysis of variance. In Trial 1, group and
trough effect were in the model. In Trial 2, stage, pair and trough were tested. In Trial 1, where both types of troughs were
available, animals had a higher number of drinking bouts (3.32 v. 0.5760.09; P,0.01), longer drinking periods (144.21 v.
22.8167.3 s; P,0.01) and greater intake (160.21 v. 23.76613.06 l; P,0.01) from the PVC water tank, compared to the RC
trough. In Trial 2, all groups drank more often (5.10 v. 3.2860.32; P,0.001), for longer periods (167.23 v. 115.23615.61 s;
P,0.02) and with higher intake (141.36 v. 118.4765.01 l; P,0.02) from the PVC than from the RC trough. Thus, heifers not
only prefer, but also drink more from a PVC water tank in comparison to a RC trough

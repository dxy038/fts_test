The unit commitment system (UCS), an integrated set of hardware and software components connected to Northern States Power Company´s (NSP´s) existing energy management system (EMS) via a hyperchannel network, is described. The objective of the UCS is to provide functional capabilities for the user to study and and economically schedule system resources (generation and transactions) in conjunction with the EMS system. The system design is described. It is based on the philosophy of using modularity and openness, wherever possible, giving the utility flexibility to evolve and expand the system cost-effectively as the requirements or hardware platforms change. The implemented software not only addresses NSP´s present need, but also represents a product that fits the evolving open systems environment.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

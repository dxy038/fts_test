<div><p class="Abstract"><strong>Objective:</strong> To determine marital satisfaction and its influencing factors among fertile and infertile women in Shahroud.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> In this comparative study, 1528 participants (511 infertile and1017 fertile women) were evaluated using Enrich Marital Satisfaction Scale. Data were analyzed using chi-square and t-test.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> A total of 1402 participants (78.7%) had high marital satisfaction. The results show that no significant differences exist between marital satisfaction, marital communication, conflict resolution and idealistic distortion in fertile and infertile women. However, a significant difference was observed between marital satisfaction, and job, spouseâ€™s job and income in fertile and infertile groups, but the place of residence, education, spouse's education and fertility status showed no significant difference.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Results showed that infertility does not reduce marital satisfaction. Since marital satisfaction is moderate in both groups, sex education for people bound to marry and sexual counseling for couples can lead to improved sexual satisfaction.</p></div>

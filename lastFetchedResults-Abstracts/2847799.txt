Since the traditional rapidly-exploring random tree connect (RRT-connect) algorithm cannot be applied to the problem of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning directly, a variable probability based bidirectional RRT algorithm (VPB-RRT) is proposed. The restriction of the turning angle of UAV is joined in the process of generating random points of the programming algorithm, which makes the performance of the track satisfy the conditions for flight. By using this algorithm to identify the probability though rasterizing the planning space and importing the concept of coverage rate, track has been made to satisfy the respects of online time and accuracy of UAV path planning. Compared with the A* algorithm, traditional RRT algorithm and RRT-connect algorithm, the results show that VPB-RRT fully satisfies the requirements of online UAV path planning which with shorter time and higher accuracy.

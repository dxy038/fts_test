Large-scale process control problems usually have multiple, conflicting objectives, making it difficult for control strategies based on single-objective, on-line optimization to provide the desired performance, The present work considers a goal-programming approach that treats multiple objectives explicitly. It is intended to reduce tuning complexity, yet provide flexibility in defining performance objectives. An example application to the Tennessee Eastman Challenge Process is presented

The turn of the millennium has been marked by a large-scale mobilisation of resources for immunisation programmes in developing countries. The resources have been generated by public and private sector parties collaborating in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). GAVI was formed in response to deteriorating immunisation coverage rates occurring in the late 1990s. GAVI is the latest in a line of vaccine initiatives, which have operated over the past 20 years. This article reviews the five most important global immunisation initiatives that have taken place over those past 20 years. It analyses their origins, shifts in global immunisation goals, identifies key actors, assesses the initiatives’ capacity to mobilise resources and increase immunisation coverage, and points to possible unintended effects of the initiatives.

The study argues that shifts in global immunisation goals lead to fragmentation in the implementation of vaccine programmes at the local level in developing countries. It also suggests that global actors involved in the formulation of these initiatives appear to miss opportunities to build on past experiences and fail to learn from previous mistakes. This raises questions about the initiatives’ sustainability and relevance to the overall objective of preventing vaccine-preventable deaths.

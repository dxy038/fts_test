The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of phase change material on heat transfer enhancement in a multichip module application. The parameters studied in the present study include the mass fraction of paraffin slurry, the heat flux of simulated VLSI chips and channel Reynolds numbers. The size of paraffin slurry particles was within 10–40 μm. The local heat transfer coefficients for the paraffin slurry were larger than those for water. The paraffin slurry showed an effective cooling performance at high heat fluxes. The paraffin slurry with a mass fraction of 5% showed the most efficient cooling performance when the heat transfer and the pressure drop in the test section were considered simultaneously. The present experimental data at the fourth and sixth rows gave an excellent agreement with the values predicted by the Malina and Sparrow’s correlation, and a new empirical correlation for the water and paraffin slurry with a mass fraction of 5% was proposed at the first and sixth rows for a channel Reynolds number over 3000.

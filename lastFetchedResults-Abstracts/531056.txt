Background: Cesarean section delivery can lead to much maternal morbidity. Different cytokines have been reported to be influenced by the mode of delivery. Objective: To investigate the influence of mode of delivery on maternal, placental and cord sera of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels. Methods: These three cytokines were measured using ELISA in peripheral, placental and cord sera of two groups of women (38 in each group), either delivering vaginally or by elective cesarean section. Results: Concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10 in the peripheral and placental sera were higher in vaginal delivery, while cord cytokines were not significantly different in the two groups. Cord sera contained significantly less con-centrations of these cytokines than the peripheral and placental sera. Conclusion: It ap-pears that the levels of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10 are influenced by the mode of delivery

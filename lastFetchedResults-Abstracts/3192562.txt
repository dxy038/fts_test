Bringing the concept of public satisfaction into government performance evaluation is the objective requirement of democratic politics, which involves complex psychological evaluation models and has opened a new area in China. Drawing on the classic structure of satisfaction, a theoretical model is built for the evaluation of public satisfaction of domestic local government\´s overall performance. Based on a valid data of a poll to 21,853 civilians in Guangdong Province, the results of empirically analyzing the influencing factors of public satisfaction show that: the satisfaction of "government service", "life support" and "living environment" have a significant positive impact on the overall satisfaction of the local government, especially the influencing coefficient of a&#770;government servicea&#770; satisfaction as high as 0.64, which indicates that improving the service quality is the key to lift citizens\´ satisfaction towards local governments\´ performance.

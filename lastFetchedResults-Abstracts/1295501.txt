A new BiLevel programming Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach is created to provide valuable managerial insights when assessing the performance of a system with Stackelberg-game relationships. This new approach allows us to evaluate the firm performance in decentralized decisions, which consist of the objective(s) of the leader at its first level and that is of the follower at the second level. This approach can help decentralized companies to optimize their performance using multiple inputs to produce multiples outputs in a cost-effective way, where both the system “black-box” and subsystem performance are exposed in details. We show the algorithms and solutions to our new models. We illustrate and validate the proposed new approach using two case studies: a banking chain and a manufacturing supply chain. The computation shows that subsystem being efficient at all levels results in an overall efficiency achievement in a decentralized BiLevel structure.

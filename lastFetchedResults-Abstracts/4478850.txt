Except for the output transistor, and the force transducer, the Application Special Integrated Circuit (ASIC) described herein contains all the electronic components of a system for the objective clinical evaluation of the neuromuscular blockage produced in patients, for medical purposes, by the intravenous injection of muscle relaxing drugs. The system contains three sections: an electric stimulator for motor nerves; a section that receives the signals coming from a force transducer attached to the corresponding muscle, evaluates the relative strength of the ensuing muscular contractions and stores the results in four registers, and a section that drives a liquid crystal display

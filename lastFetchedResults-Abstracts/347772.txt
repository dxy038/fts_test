Objective: To estimate the sudomotor nerve conduction velocity (CV), the central processing time (CPT) and habituation of the skin conductance response (SCR).
Methods: SCRs in response to a single deep inspiratory breath, an electrical stimulus and a sound click were obtained from the fingers and toes of 30 healthy adults. Sudomotor nerve conduction velocities were determined after measuring extremity length and latency differences. CPT was estimated by subtracting the efferent time and the known afferent times and neuroeffector times from the onset latency.
Results: The inspiratory SCR habituated slower than the auditory or electrical SCRs. CVs of the 3 modalities did not differ statistically and their mean was 1.07 m s−1 (95% CI: 1.01–1.13). The inspiratory SCR arrived at the fingers 1.26±0.09 s after the onset of chest wall movement. Electrical and auditory SCR onset latencies at the fingers were 1.60±0.03 and 1.75±0.04 s, respectively. Their CPTs were 140 and 160 ms, estimated from the electrical and auditory SCR onset latencies to the fingers. The CPT for inspiratory SCR was estimated to occur during the inspiratory CPT after the inspiratory decision and before chest movement.
Conclusions: In contrast to the SCR following an electrical or auditory stimulus, initiation of deep inspiratory SCR occurs before the inspiratory act, precluding any possible input from respiratory afferent receptors and implicating a central generator.
Significance: This study provides new insights into the origin of the SCR following inspiration.

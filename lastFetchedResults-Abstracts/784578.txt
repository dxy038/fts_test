Objective: To validate a revision of the Mini Nutritional Assessment short-form (MNA®-SF) against
the full MNA, a standard tool for nutritional evaluation. Methods: A literature search identified studies that used
the MNA for nutritional screening in geriatric patients. The contacted authors submitted original datasets that
were merged into a single database. Various combinations of the questions on the current MNA-SF were tested
using this database through combination analysis and ROC based derivation of classification thresholds. Results:
Twenty-seven datasets (n=6257 participants) were initially processed from which twelve were used in the current
analysis on a sample of 2032 study participants (mean age 82.3y) with complete information on all MNA items.
The original MNA-SF was a combination of six questions from the full MNA. A revised MNA-SF included calf
circumference (CC) substituted for BMI performed equally well. A revised three-category scoring classification
for this revised MNA-SF, using BMI and/or CC, had good sensitivity compared to the full MNA. Conclusion:
The newly revised MNA-SF is a valid nutritional screening tool applicable to geriatric health care professionals
with the option of using CC when BMI cannot be calculated. This revised MNA-SF increases the applicability of
this rapid screening tool in clinical practice through the inclusion of a “malnourished” category.

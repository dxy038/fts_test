Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) is one of the most popular tropical fruits grown in Asia. The objective of this study was to compare physico-chemical properties of native flour and starch from jackfruit seeds (A. heterophyllus) to commercially modified starches (Novation 2300 and Purity 4). The colour of jackfruit seed starch was lighter than the Novation 2300 starch but darker than the Purity 4 starch. The jackfruit seed starch had a narrower gelatinization temperature range than Purity 4 and required less gelatinization energy compared with modified starches. The peak viscosity of jackfruit seed starch was lower than commercially modified starches. Likewise, setback viscosity, swelling power and solubility of jackfruit seed starch showed similar trends. Results from this study suggest that native starch from jackfruit seed could be used as an alternative for modified starches in a system needing starch with a high thermal and/or mechanical shear stability.

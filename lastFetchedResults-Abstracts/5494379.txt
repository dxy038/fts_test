Providing quality of service (QoS) guarantees in networks gives rise to several challenging issues. One of them is how to determine a feasible path that satisfies a set of constraints while maintaining high utilization of network resources. Multi-constrained QoS routing algorithm finds a feasible route in network that satisfies multiple independent constraints. In general, multi-constrained path selection is a NP-complete problem that cannot be exactly solved in polynomial time. The NP-complete problem is converted into a multi-objective optimization problem with constraints, and optimizes multi-constraint QoS parameter respectively in this paper. A multiple constrained QoS routing algorithm is then proposed to generate a set of non-dominated optimal route based on the optimization principle of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DTRA), which can attain a satisfied multi-constraint QoS parameter nondominates set based on dominating tree. The dominating tree preserves the necessary relationships among QoS routings, and reduces the comparisons among QoS routing distinctly. So the convergence performance is quick. The theoretic analysis and experiment results show that our proposed algorithm (DTRA) is effective for multi-constrained QoS routing, and can improve the performance of networks.

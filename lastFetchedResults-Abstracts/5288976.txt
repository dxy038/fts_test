Predictive control has received much attention from both theoreticians and practitioners in diverse fields. However, a challenging problem we must face is how to auto-tune the parameters of the predictive controller. So far, only a few guidelines related to tuning of the parameters of predictive controllers have been provided by the literature. In fact, these parameters are generally determined by the designerÂ´s experience. From the process control point of view, it is difficult to find out the optimal parameters for the control system based on the single quadratic performance index. In this paper, attempts are first made to introduce an existing basic predictive control strategy in order to arrive at a best tuning procedure. Later, several multi-objective optimization techniques are explored for the possibility of auto-tuning in model-based predictive control. Finally, the paper presents a predictive controller auto-timing procedure based on the developed recursive multi-objective optimization algorithm and simulate the properties of the scheme

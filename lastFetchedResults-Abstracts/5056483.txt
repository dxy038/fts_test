This article mainly expounds on the connotation of index evaluation system of the large-scale, non-grid-connected wind power industry and its construction principles, determines the index levels of the system and the scientific significance and calculation method of each index, and conducts case analysis in accordance with the constructed index system. The index system is divided into two levels: (1) the first level includes macro index groups in four aspects, respectively reflecting the characteristics of economy, society, environment, and random fluctuation of wind power; (2) the second level reflects specific index construction of each macro index group in the first level. The weight of an index at each level in index system is eventually determined by level analysis through classifying each index, establishing a multi-level structure, building a paired comparison matrix, and through many rounds of comprehensive analysis in accordance with CR testing. The method and the process of weight determination is objective, rigorous, and scientific. A comprehensive evaluation model is built on according to the intrinsic link between indexes, and, finally, a scientific, reasonable, and improved system of comprehensive index evaluation is formed. The index system shall observe combination of the current interests with long-term interests, economic, and ecological benefits with social benefits and static analysis with dynamic analysis and take account of guidance, systematic, scientific and adaptive principles in the process of its establishment.

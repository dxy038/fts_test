A dramatic transformation in system monitoring and control is taking place in the electric utility industry. New control centers are being equipped with multiprocessor real-time computers scanning and controlling the generation and transmission system via high-speed data-acquisition subsystems and interacting with the human operator via dynamic, color, graphic displays. Within the computer as many as a hundred or more programs are available to run in a multiprogramming environment in response to changing power-system conditions and to operatorÂ´s demands. The main objective of this new development in on-line control is the enhancement of the security of the power system in order to maintain a high reliability of electric power service. The concept of security control is discussed and the noteworthy features of its present state of development in recently designed and installed control centers are described.

In recent years, the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) technique has been used in personal dosimetry, and aluminum oxide (Al2O3:C) has become a very useful material for this technique. The objective of this work was the determination of the transmission factors for beta radiation using Al2O3:C commercial dosimeters and the OSL method. The obtained results were similar to the transmission factors reported in the beta source calibration certificates.

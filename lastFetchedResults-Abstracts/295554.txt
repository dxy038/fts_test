The objective of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of bilayered cellular matrix, (OrCel™) Ortec International, Inc., New York, NY in facilitating timely wound closure of split-thickness donor sites in severely burned patients. We utilized a matched pairs design; each patient had two designated donor sites of equivalent surface area and depth. Sites were randomized to receive a single treatment of either OrCel™ or the standard dressing Biobrane-L® (Bertek Pharmaceuticals) Sugarland, TX. The results demonstrate that OrCel™ was more effective in facilitating timely wound closure of split-thickness skin donor sites than Biobrane-L®. The healing time for OrCel™ sites was significantly shorter than for sites treated with Biobrane-L®. This acceleration of wound healing was clinically important in enabling earlier recropping. OrCel™ sites also exhibited reduced scarring. Therefore, treatment of donor site wounds with OrCel™ is well tolerated, promotes more rapid healing, and results in reduced scarring when compared with conventional therapy with Biobrane-L®.

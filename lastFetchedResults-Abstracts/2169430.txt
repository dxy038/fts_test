A murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) has been developed as an alternative to guinea pig models for contact sensitization testing. Although the LLNA appears to be a little less sensitive than the most stringent of guinea pig assays, it provides a rapid, objective, quantitative and cost-effective method for screening strong contact sensitizers and has advantages with respect to animal welfare. However, a potential disadvantage is the need for the use of radioactive material. We have reported previously that an ex vivo assay based on similar principles to the original in vivo LLNA, but using a non-radioactive endopoint, was valid for the prediction of strong sensitizers. This ex vivo assay was not sensitive enough to allow prediction of moderately potent ones. In this study, we propose a new parameter, Corrected IL-2 Index (CII), for the prediction of moderate sensitizers. To obtain CII, the IL-2 release in the supernatant of the cell culture is corrected for lymph node weight ratio and ratio of CD4-positive subset. We found that CII predicted the allergenicity of moderate sensitizers, including the ones recommended by the OECD in guideline 406, such as mercaptobenzothiazole and hexyl cinnamic aldehyde. The allergenicity of metal salts, such as potassium dichromate, ammonium tetrachloroplatinate and cobalt chloride, was also predicted by the CII. We conclude that the use of CII as an index significantly increases the sensitivity of the ex vivo method so that moderate sensitizers may also be detected.

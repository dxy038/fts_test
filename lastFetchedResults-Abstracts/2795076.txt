Online auctions have becoming the most popular forms of trading on Internet. Companies have a need to provide a decision support tool that help buyer to deal with the reverse auction from suppliers. Therefore, a multi-objective decision support mechanism for reverse auction is proposed in this study. A DEA model by considering both buyers and sellersÂ´ preference that optimizes their efficiency are proposed. Each seller may revise their own bid according to suggested adjustment from our proposed decision support mechanism.

The main objective of this study was to assess
the adoption of modern aquaculture technologies by the fish
farmers’. The study was conducted in Kahaloo and Sherpur
upazilas of Bogra district. Respondent fish farmers were
selected using proportionate random sampling technique.
Quantitative data were collected using predesigned interview
schedule during August to September 2011. Focus group
discussions were conducted for obtaining qualitative
information. Adoption of “pond preparation with lime”,
“acclimatization of fish fry before stocking”, “appropriate
stocking density”, “monosex tilapia cultivation”, “use of
formulated feed”, “use of urea and TSP” and “pangus
cultivation” were found high while adoption of “poly culture
of carp”, “Thai koi and catfish cultivation” were
comparatively low. Overall mean adoption scores of 11
modern aquaculture technologies by the farmers indicate
that 58 % of the respondent fish farmers had medium
adoption of “modern aquaculture technologies” compared to
25% having high adoption and 17% low adoption. Age,
education, use of information sources, farm size, fish farming
area, annual family income, commercialization, social
participation, innovativeness and knowledge on fish culture
of the farmers had positive and significant relationship with
their overall mean adoption of modern aquaculture
technologies. “Lack of technical knowledge”, “unavailability
of credits in time”, “lack of quality fish fry” and
“unavailability of quality fish feed”, were the main
hindrances for adoption of modern aquaculture technologies
as identified by the respondents in the study area.

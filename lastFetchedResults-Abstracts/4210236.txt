Simulation and visualization have been developed for the ease of the chopping process. This project is chosen based on the analysis that had been done at the organization where the work of chopped product is done manually using human workforce. The problem that happened here is human workforce will easily get tired and bored with the repeating work. Measurement of the product is also conducted manually. Therefore, the productivity is affected due the manual measurement. The project objective is to overcome the problems by designing and simulating a Cartesian robot to perform the chopping task The result from the simulation shows that the chopping process can be perform effectively and give accurate measurement of the product. In simulating the proposed Cartesian robot, it is suitable with the chopping process. The software used in this project is Workspaces.

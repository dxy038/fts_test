The absence of well-defined tumor vasculature plays a role in the transport of effective doses of anti-cancer tumor drugs to the tumor [1]. Furthermore, the bodyÂ´s natural removal process [2] also makes complete utilization of anti-cancer drugs impossible. Thus, to quantify the effectiveness of the dosage of anti-cancer tumor drugs, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of drug transport from the tumor vasculature to the tumor is warranted. The objective of this study is to develop a general computational model that describes the mechanisms of drug transport to solid tumors using solute transport concepts. The model also accounts for drug transport through the vasculature and the interstitium that surrounds the solid tumor. Using this model, it is shown how biological parameters that define the tumor vasculature affect effective drug transport to the tumor. Knowledge of these effects is tantamount to developing more effective anti-cancer tumor drugs and protocols.

 A comparative study on image segmentation using mathematical morphology has been carried out for various combination of edge detecting spatial filters and structuring elements to accomplish morphologically smoothing the test image. It has been found out from the present study subjectively that the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter and Octagon structuring element yields the satisfactory image segmentation with respect to the image appearance. From objective point of view the aforesaid combination has been found to produce minimum entropy in the segmented image.

	At the Verge of Producing and Presenting the Razavi Atlas
Dr. Amir Salmani Rahimi
Over 120 years has passed since the publication of the first atlases such as Times Atlas and Goode’s World Atlas. These valuable collections have been mainly produced with an educational objective.
Meanwhile, such cultural atlases as Sh?‘a Atlas, the Qur’?n Atlas, Philosophy Atlas, Qibla Compass Atlas, and Prophet’s Traditions Atlas are at the focus of interest of research institutions, both in their reference to sources for book and article productions and in their information processing and its presentation. On the other hand, they have been quite welcome by the readers’ community in various areas. 
The main part of the present article deals with the road map for the research and writing of Razavi Atlas, which is undertaken for the first time by the Islamic Research Foundation as a novel example enjoying the successful experience of similar previous works.
Keywords: Imam ‘Al? b. M?s? al-Ri?? (A.S.), atlas.

The identification of both the states and the skills of drivers has been actively investigated over several decades. The identification of a driverÂ´s skills and its application to driver assistance have been proposed in recent studies. In these studies, it was assumed that different aspects of driving skill can be expressed by switching a number of simple control rules according to the situation. In this study, the driver is assigned the task of steering the vehicle toward a destination while avoiding an obstacle. The steering skill of the driver is evaluated using a previously proposed hierarchical modeling method. The objective of this study is to extract the skill of the driver in a mathematically interpretable form. A number of experiments are conducted in order to verify the validity of the proposed framework.

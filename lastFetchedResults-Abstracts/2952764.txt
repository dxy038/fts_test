Deregulation of power markets has opened up access for many small-scale independent power producers (IPPs) to an existing power system. Their common features are small-scale, distributed and independent operation. There are various other factors that can affect the economy or environmental impact of the existing power network. The objective of this research is to assess the technological impact of independent power producers introduced into an existing power system. The authors conducted the evaluation of the impact by multiple perspective. To assess the impact of IPPs, optimal power flow simulations have been repeatedly applied, changing the possible IPP locations

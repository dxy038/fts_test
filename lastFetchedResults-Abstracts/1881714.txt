Distal clavicle resection is frequently performed for persistent acromioclavicular pain. However, patient outcome after this procedure has not been well described. The results of subjective and objective retrospective analysis of 23 open distal clavicle resections in 21 patients are reported. Patients were evaluated with a questionnaire, roentgenographs, physical examination, and isokinetic muscle strength testing at an average of 30 months after surgery. Eighteen of 23 shoulders had good or excellent postoperative ratings. All patients had normal motion. No significant weakness of the operated shoulder was seen on objective muscle testing when compared with the unoperated shoulder. The average preoperative Hospital for Special Surgery score was 34, and the average postoperative score was 84. Age and hand dominance were unrelated to postoperative outcomes. Less predictable results were obtained in patients with workmen's compensation and in those patients involved in litigation. Open distal clavicle resection yields good to excellent results in properly selected patients and does not create significant subjective or objective weakness.

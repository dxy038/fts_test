Objective
ctors involved in the etiology of alexithymia are still unclear. While a few studies suggested substantial genetic influences on alexithymia, it remains to be determined if these influences are independent of genetic influences on other mental health variables correlated with alexithymia, such as depression. This study is aimed at confirming previous findings of a genetic contribution to alexithymia, examining whether there are genetic or environmental influences common to alexithymia facets, and investigating whether genetic influences on alexithymia are independent of genetic influences on depression.
s
-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and a validated measure of depression were administered to a sample of 729 twins (45% males) aged 23â€“24 years drawn from the population-based Italian Twin Register. Genetic structural equation modeling was performed with the Mx program.
s
c factors accounted for 42% of individual differences in alexithymia. Unshared environmental factors explained the remaining proportion of variance. There was a substantial (0.65) genetic correlation between alexithymia and depression. The inclusion of depression as a covariate in the genetic models reduced the heritability estimate for alexithymia to 33%.
sions
e some limitations, this study corroborates the notion that genetic factors contribute substantially to individual differences in alexithymia, with unshared environmental factors also playing an important role. Also, it suggests a genetic link between alexithymia and depression.

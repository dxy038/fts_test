Advanced composite materials offer remarkable potential in the strengthening of Civil Engineering structures. This research is targeted to provide in depth knowledge and understanding of bond characteristics of advanced and corrosion resistant material carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) that has a unique design tailor-ability and cost effective nature. The objective of this research is to investigate and compare the bonding mechanism between CFRP strengthened single and double strap steel joints. Investigations have been made in regards to failure mode, ultimate load and effective bond length for CFRP strengthened double and single strap joints. A series of tensile tests were conducted with different bond lengths for both type of joints. The bond behaviour of these specimens was further investigated by using nonlinear finite element analysis. Finally a bilinear relationship of shear stress-slip has been proposed by using the Finite element model for single and double strap joints.

We present in this paper a technique for imaging fluorescent particles based on the axial modulation of the objectiveÂ´s focal plane position. This technique provides full field optical sectioning and can be used to localize the fluorophores in three dimensions. We describe the technique and apply it to image polymer beads filled with quantum dots immobilized in a gel. We show that full field optical sectioning is obtained and that the beads are localized with a precision of 10 nm in the transverse plane and 31 nm in the axial direction

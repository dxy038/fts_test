In this paper, we are concerned with the conjugate gradient methods for solving unconstrained optimization problems. A modified conjugate gradient method is proposed in this paper for unconstrained optimization problems. The direction of the proposed method provides a descent direction for the objective function. Under mild conditions, we prove that the method with strong Wolfe line search is globally convergent.

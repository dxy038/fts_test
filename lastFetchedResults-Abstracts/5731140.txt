Federated cloud emerges recently to overcome resource limitation of IaaS providers by federating different cloud resources which belong to separate organizations. The main objective of IaaS providers is to obtain maximal profits and guarantee QoS requirements of customers at the same time. In this paper, we propose a cooperative game algorithm that helps the resource allocation decision-making process with a flexible resource amount of the total federation. This algorithm also takes the QoS constraints into account and provides two different approaches for cost-sensitive or time-sensitive customers. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves various QoS requirements and increases the satisfaction level of customerÂ´s requests.

Pico-hydro generation system is the effective way to help the remote communities by generates electricity using water as a main source. The main objective of this project is to introduce the green technology for the society in order to reduce the cost of fuel consumption. Green technology is an alternative energy whereas it is cheap, effective and reliable. It can reduce sources of fuel, capital costs and pollution. Furthermore, the idea of this project is to generate electricity by develop a prototype of pico-hydro generation system that produce low capacity to be used in rural communities. Generally, this project focused on designing and producing a pico-hydro system that can be used for small capacity equipments such as motor and bulb. Besides, this project able to analyze the output of generator based on the rotation of turbine. Water flow in the high-pressure PVC pipe has potential to drive the turbine where it is connected with a generator to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. In this project, it can be found that the pulley system can increase the efficiency of the turbine. The turbine that connected to the pulley system required lower speed compared to the turbine that connected directly to the generator.

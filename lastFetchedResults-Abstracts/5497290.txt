The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) methods applied on the oil elevation unit present as a technical-scientific demand growing area, in view of the improvements that can be carried forward to existing processes. This work has a main objective to present the development of embedded systems dedicated to a wireless sensor network based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which applies the Zigbee protocol between sensors, actuators and the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), providing low cost, low power consumption, reliability and easy installation and maintenance, solving the problems present in the deployment and maintenance of current physical communication units based on oil elevation units that uses Plunger Lift method. Embedded systems developed for that application is responsible for interpreting the information from sensors and actuators to control the standard devices as well, as using the Modbus protocol to make this network becomes transparent to the PLC, responsible for being controlling the production and delivery information to a supervisory.

The objective of this work is to obtain uniform estimates, with respect to parameters, of the attractor and of the basin of attraction of a dynamical system and to apply these results to analyze the roughness of the synchronization of two subsystems. These estimates are obtained through a uniform version of the invariance principle of La Salle which is stated and proved in this work.

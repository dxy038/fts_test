The problem of H<sub>&#8734;</sub> model reduction for linear singular systems in the continuous-time case is considered. The objective is to find a reduced-order system such that the associated error system is admissible and satisfies a prescribed H<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm bound constraint. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of this problem are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and a coupling non-convex rank constraint set. An explicit parametrisation of all reduced-order systems is presented for the case when the related LMIs are feasible. A simple LMI condition without rank constraint is derived for the zeroth-order H<sub>&#8734;</sub> approximation problem. All these results are obtained without decomposing the original system, which makes the design procedure simple and direct.

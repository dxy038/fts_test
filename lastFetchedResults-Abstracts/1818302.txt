Objective: We previously proposed the hamster cheek pouch model of oral cancer for BNCT studies. We herein present the biodistribution of a non-toxic boron compound, GB-10 (Na210B10H10), in this model to assess its potential for BNCT or BNCT enhanced Fast Neutron Therapy. Materials and methods: We evaluated the uptake and retention of GB-10 in tumour and precancerous tissue and in potentially dose-limiting, clinically relevant normal tissues. Results: Mean tumour boron concentration delivered by GB-10 (50 mg B/kg) peaked to 77.7±28.0 ppm at 20 min post-administration and remained at therapeutically useful values of 31.9±21.4 ppm at 3 h. The clearance rate for normal tissues was faster than for tumour tissue. The consistently low brain and spinal cord values would preclude normal tissue toxicity. The uptake of GB-10 by precancerous tissue may be of potential use in the treatment of field cancerized areas. GB-10 was deposited homogeneously in different tumour areas, an asset when treating heterogenous tumours. The data suggests that the joint administration of BPA and GB-10 may improve the therapeutic efficacy of BNCT. Conclusions: GB-10 is a potential boron carrier for BNCT of head and neck tumours and for BNCT-FNT.

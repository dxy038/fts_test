This paper proposes a new method for management of consumersÂ´ private information on bidirectional broadcasting services using IP networks, based on secure distributed RDB (relational database). We also propose a new protocol for browsing user information that was registered in the database from user terminals securely. We compared the processing times to browse user information between the existing usual encryption method and the proposed method. As a result, we can confirm that the latter method is as practical as the former one.

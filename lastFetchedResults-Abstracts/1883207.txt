Three theoretical expressions for the adsorption isotherms of hydrogen on LaNi4.75Fe0.25 alloy at 303 K and 313 K have been established. Our objective in this modeling is to select the adequate model that presents a high correlation with the experimental curves. The establishment of these new expressions is based on statistical physics formalism. This method has allowed the estimation of physicochemical parameters in the theoretical model. The parameters intervening in the adsorption process have been deduced directly from experimental adsorption isotherms by numerical simulation. We will mainly introduce four parameters affecting the adsorption process, namely; the density of hydrogen receptor sites NM, the number of molecules per site and the hydrogen adsorption energy. Then we apply the model to calculate thermodynamics functions which govern the adsorption mechanism such as entropy, free enthalpy and internal energy.

The joint conference of 4th Euro-Asian Pulsed Power Conference (EAPPC 2012) and 19th International Conference on High-Power Particle Beams (BEAMS 2012) will be held on Sep. 30 - Oct. 4, 2012, in Karlsruhe, Germany (http://www.eappc-beams2012.org). This conference will reflect the most recent developments on pulsed power technology and high-power particle beam physics and applications. The objective of this Special Issue is to bring the most up-to-date developments reported at EAPPC/BEAMS 2012 to the readership of IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science. Although the conference will publish its own Proceedings, this Special Issue will be dedicated to manuscripts that are substantially revised and lengthened from those of the Proceedings. These manuscripts will undergo standard peer-review process typical for all IEEE Transactions and Journals. The manuscript submission deadline is December 31, 2012. This Special Issue IS open to, but not limited to, all attendees of EAPPC/BEAMS 2012.

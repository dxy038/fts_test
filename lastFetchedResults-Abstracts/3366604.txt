Measurements of thermally stimulated currents were made on ionomer/polyethylene blends. The objective of this work was to study space charge formation in these materials. Two ionomers were compared; both ionomers contained methacrylic acid, neutralized by zinc in one and by sodium in the other. A large current peak centered near 60&#176;C was observed in all blends and associated with the motion of space charges injected into the blends during poling. All blends accumulated large negative space charge concentrations. The approach to the equilibrium space charge distribution (negative and spatially uniform in all blends) is much more rapid in the blends containing the sodium ionomer than in the blends containing the zinc ionomer

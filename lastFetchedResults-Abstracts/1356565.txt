In this paper, model predictive control (MPC) is applied to the Italian 80 MWth experimental accelerator driven system (XADS), referring to a simple, non-linear model for the dynamic simulation of the plant, which has been developed and described in a previous work [A. Cammi, L. Luzzi, A.A. Porta, M.E. Ricotti, Prog. Nucl. Energ. 48 (2006) 578], in order to describe the interactions among the different subsystems: i.e., the accelerator-core coupling, the lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) primary system, the secondary system with diathermic oil and air coolers batteries, which reject the thermal power to the environment. Hereinafter, a model predictive controller is proposed, with the objective to minimize the difference between the average temperature of the diathermic oil and its reference value, while also minimizing the variations of the control input, which is the air coolers mass flow rate. The dynamic response of the LBEâ€“XADS has been evaluated with reference to a reduction of 20% in the reactor power from nominal load conditions: this transient is very demanding for the overall plant, nevertheless the obtained results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

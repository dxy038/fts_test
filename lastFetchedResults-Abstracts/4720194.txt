This paper presents a new integrated feedforward and feedback control (IFFC) technique to achieve fast maneuvers of flexible systems. The feedforward control uses the Pareto optimal solution of a convex multi-objective optimization problem to yield a time- and energy-optimal solution. The robust <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sub>2</sub>/&#956; feedback controller is designed to account for parametric and unmodeled uncertainties due to structural flexibility. In contrast to the heuristically-combined feedforward and feedback control approaches, the IFFC approach designs these different control components in such a systematic way that it yields faster maneuvers of flexible systems with uncertainties. Included are examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new IFFC technique.

The objective of this study was to determine the suitability of the wood produced by adaptable eucalypt species for MDF production. Eucalyptus steriaticalyx fibers were produced using different levels of steaming time (5 and 10 minutes), and then medium density fiberboards were produced using these fibers and one of the two levels of press temperature (175 and 185 ?C) and one of the three levels of press time (3, 3.5 and 4 minutes). Physical and mechanical properties of the panels were measured and analyzed. The results indicated that increasing of steaming time, decreased board MOR. Also press temperature and press time had significant effect on MOR and MOE and as the press temperature and time increased, the MOR and MOE of the boards decreased. Furthermore, results indicated that by increasing steaming time, the thickness swelling of boards reduced. The press temperature had significant effect on thickness swelling of boards and increasing the press temperature reduced the thickness swelling. These results indicate that Eucalyptus steriaticalyx as a fast growing species with acceptable physical and mechanical properties is a suitable lignocellulosic raw material for the production of MDF.

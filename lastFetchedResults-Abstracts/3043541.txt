This paper describes studies of power quality done in Puerto Rico. A different studies made in the past related to power quality problems in P.R. Data, from Lord Electric is used to analyze some cases worked by this company in industrial buildings in Puerto Rico. Similarities and differences between existing problems are identified. To complete the objective, the software MATLAB was used where a program was developed to give the calculations of indices like THD, TIF, DIN, C-Message, and other indices, and also the spectrum of the signal sampling using Fourier analysis. Also, the use of digital filters is required for the elimination of noise and inter-harmonics to determine the indices and compare with the original results. The problem where was studied in case 1 was that the main breaker was tripping for unknown reasons. In case 2 data transferring communication to U.S. was lost every Sunday in Home Depot at Bayamon, P.R. For the third case, hot spots, failed torque and methods are presented in Citibank Center at Cupey, P.R. to save money. Finally, this paper has a lot importance, because the problems of power quality as technology progresses are more common in Puerto Rico and other places. This study helps to document answers about different problems of power quality in Puerto Rico and at the same time problems that could be common in other companies across the United States and the rest of the world.

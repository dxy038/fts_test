TAP1 and TAP2 genes encode heterodimeric molecule involved in endogenous antigen processing. The present study was undertaken to find out the possible association between TAP1 and TAP2 polymorphisms and risk of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in a sample of Iranian population. Polymorphisms of TAP1 (rs1057141, rs1135216) and TAP2 (rs2228396, rs241447, rs67511411, rs141555015) were determined in 173 PTB patients and 164 healthy subjects. Our findings showed that rs1135216 AG, GG and AG+GG genotypes increased the risk of PTB in comparison with AA (OR=2.36, 95%CI=1.47-3.79, p<0.001; OR=19.13, 95%CI=2.47-148.2, p<0.001 and OR=2.77, 95%CI=1.74-4.39, p<0.001, respectively). The rs1135216 G allele was associated with increased risk of PTB (OR=2.65, 95%CI=1.784-3.969, p<0.001). TAP2 rs241447 AG and AG+GG genotypes decreased the risk of PTB (OR=0.41, 95%CI=0.26-0.65, p<0.001; OR=0.54, 95%CI=0.35-0.85, respectively). No significant association was found between TAP1 (rs1057141), TAP2 (rs2228396, rs67511411, rs141555015) variants and PTB. In conclusion, our findings proposed that TAP gene polymorphisms might be associated with PTB susceptibility among patients in Zahedan, southeast Iran.

Summary form only given. High voltage ceramic resistors are used in many pulse power applications because of their ability to absorb a significant amount of power due to their low inductance. The objective of this research was to explore the behavior of these resistors towards their maximum rated power and energy. These resistors were analyzed through a numerical model prior to testing in order to predict the internal and surface temperatures. During these experiments, the resistors were used as a load for a capacitive discharge in order to test its maximum impulse limitations before any physical damage or thermal failure. A short impulse duration was used while maximizing the energy and power of the resistor. The results of these experiments are discussed in the paper.

Comparing the two improved methods, which are improved Sobel operator and improved wavelet transform using the multi-scale morphological filtering, subjective visual have achieved better results. However there are advantages and disadvantages in objective evaluations. So this paper makes the gained edges image fusion with the two improved methods using the wavelet transform fusion technology. The experimental results show that the fused image has increased significantly in information entropy and the average gradient compared to the improved Sobel operator, and it also has improved the peak signal to noise ratio and the distortion degree compared to the improved wavelet edge detection method. The fused image can concentrate the advantages of the two improved methods together and make complementary advantages. Eventually, the good de-noising effect and complete edge are achieved.

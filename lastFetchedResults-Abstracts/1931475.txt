The identification of an association between polymorphisms of the prion protein (PrP) gene and susceptibility to scrapie has enabled the development of breeding programmes to increase natural resistance to scrapie. It is, however, imperative to identify if such selection would affect important reproduction and production traits. The objective of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between polymorphisms at codons 136, 154 and 171 of the PrP gene and ovulation rate or litter size in sheep. Data were collected from a mixed-aged flock of Belclare ewes, over a 9-year period. Ovulation rate was determined annually using laparoscopy by counting the number of corpora lutea at each of two consecutive oestrous cycles, one immediately before and one after mating (2418 records from 366 ewes). Litter size was recorded at parturition (875 records from 353 ewes). The five common PrP alleles were present in the population and 14 PrP genotypes were represented among the animals studied. There was no significant overall effect of PrP genotype on ovulation rate or litter size and pairwise comparisons among genotypes did not reveal any significant differences for either trait. These data suggest that breeding programmes based on selection for specific polymorphisms of the PrP gene will not influence ovulation rate or litter size, at least in the breed studied.

Solar energy is one of the main renewable energy sources in Iran and many regions (specially central desert) have considerable potential for solar energy utilization. The objective of this paper is an economic evaluation of solar (photovoltaic) power plant utilization compared with both diesel power plant and power grid connection in the central rural regions in Iran. The electricity costs have been computed by using Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA). Results of different scenarios indicate that unit energy cost in photovoltaic system is 960 Rls/kWh which is less than unit energy cost in other electricity supply options.

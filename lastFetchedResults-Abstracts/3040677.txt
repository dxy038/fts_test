A perceptual weighting model is proposed for effective rate control so as to enhance the perceptual coding quality of videophone. We exploit two categories of factors affecting the perception of the human visual system, stimulus-driven factors and cognition-driven factors. In order to achieve a simple, but effective, perceptual weighting model, we use luminance adaptation and texture masking as the stimulus-driven factors, while skin color serves as the cognition-driven factor in the videophone application. Both objective and subjective quality evaluations of videophone-like sequences in the H.263 platform validate the effectiveness of our perceptual weighting model.

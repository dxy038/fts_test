Objective
The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), one of the most difficult epilepsy
syndromes to treat, is characterized by a triad of intractable seizures of various
types, a slow ( <  2.5-hertz) spike-wave pattern in EEG and mental retardation.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine as
add-on therapy in intractable epilepsy of children with LGS.
Materials & Methods
In a quasi- experimental study, 40 children with LGS referred to the pediatric
neurology clinic of Shaheed Sadoughi Hospital in Yazd, between August 2007
and to November 2008, were evaluated.
Results
Twenty-two boys and 18 girls with a mean age of 4.12 Â± 1.8 years were evaluated.
At the end of three months of treatment with lamotrigine, 12 % were seizure
free, 52% had >  50% reduction in seizure frequency and 12% had increase in
seizures. Means of seizure frequency/per week, before and after treatment were
70 (range 1-180) and 18.6 (range 0-60) respectively, indicating effectiveness of
the drug in seizure reduction (P value = 0.003). The drug was effective in 72 %
of mixed type seizures, 40 % of generalized tonic-clonic and 33% of drop attack
and tonic seizures. Transient side effects were seen in 12.5 % (drowsiness in 3
and ataxia in 2 children). No serious side effects were seen.
Conclusion
Lamotrigine should be considered as an add-on therapy in management of
intractable epilepsy in LGS.

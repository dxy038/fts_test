Background and Objective: Considering the environmental problems raised from current plastic packaging, edible and biodegradable films could be developed and also be effective in controlling the chemical and microbial properties of food especially if their effect be strengthened by adding natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agents like herbal essential oils. This study aimed at assessing the effect of packaging with chitosan film containing garlic essential oil on the chemical changes of chicken fillet during storage at refrigeration temperature.

Materials and Methods: Different levels of garlic essential oil (0, 0.5, 1 and 2%) were used in chitosan film preparation. Through casting method and using glycerol as plasticizer and tween 80 as emulsifier, different films were prepared after homogenization and molding. Chemical tests were conducted in days 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, and 14 on chicken fillets covered with different films and stored at 4 &deg;C. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software.

Results: Samples covered with different films showed lower values for pH, total volatile nitrogen (TVN), Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs), and peroxide index (P.V) compared with controls during the study (p &le 0.05). Generally, a dose-dependent trend was observed by essential oil addition.

Conclusion: Chicken packaging with chitosan film especially by adding various levels of garlic essential oil could had a preventive effect on major chemical spoilage factors. Considering the relatively similar preventive effect of 1 and 2 % essential oil levels and also economic aspects, optimum dose for essential oil could be 1 % in the film.

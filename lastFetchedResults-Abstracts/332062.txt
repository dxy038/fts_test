Objective: This study examined the reasons given by a selected group of dental practitioners for placement and replacement of restorations and correlated the data provided with patient factors, such as patientsâ€™ age and gender, caries risk, occlusal function and oral hygiene, with restoration longevity.

Method: A group of general dental practitioners (GDPs) were recruited to take part in the study. Each participant was asked to record the reason for placement or replacement of restorations from a list of potential reasons. The age and Class of the restoration being replaced was also recorded, as also was the material being used and the material being replaced.

Results: Details of reason for placement/replacement was received on 3196 restorations from 32 GDPs. Of the restorations placed, 54% were amalgam, 32% composite, 8% compomer and 7% glass ionomer. The reasons for placement/replacement of the restorations were principally primary caries (28%), secondary caries (29%), margin fracture (10%), tooth fracture (7%), and non-carious defects (6%). Overall, the mean age of restorations at failure was 7.1 years. Of the patients who received glass ionomer restorations, 29% were rated as having poor oral hygiene, compared with 18% of the patients who received amalgam restorations, 18% of the patients who received composite restorations and 23% of the patients who received compomer restorations. Of the patients who received glass ionomer restorations, 35% were rated as having high caries susceptibility, compared with 27% of those receiving amalgam restorations, 21% of those receiving composite restorations and 30% of those receiving compomer restorations.

Conclusion: Primary caries was the principal reason for initial restorations. Secondary caries was the most prevalent reason for replacement of restorations. The results also indicate a selective application of different materials for different patients.

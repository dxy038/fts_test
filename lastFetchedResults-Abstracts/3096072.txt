The objective of this study was to establish quantitative parameters for estimating the fetal autonomic nervous system (ANS) maturation, derived from the fetal heart rate (FHR) variability. A fetal ECG was non-invasively obtained by extraction from the maternal abdominal ECG signal, which allowed for beat-to-beat detection of the fetal heart beats. 35 healthy pregnancies were examined and divided into three groups according to gestational age. FHR variability was analyzed by a time-frequency decomposition based on a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The results imply that the fetus undergoes a neural organization during the last trimester of pregnancy and that the sympatho-vagal balance is gradually reduced with the gestational age.

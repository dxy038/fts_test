Traffic congestion is a major concern for many cities throughout the world. Developing a sophisticated traffic monitoring and control system would result in an effective solution to this problem. In a conventional traffic light controller, the traffic lights change at constant cycle time. Hence it does not provide an optimal solution. Many traffic light controllers implemented in current practice, are based on the ´time-of-the-day´ scheme, which use a limited number of predetermined traffic light patterns and implement these patterns depending upon the time of the day. These automated systems do not provide an optimal control for fluctuating traffic volumes. A traffic light controller based on fuzzy logic can be used for optimum control of fluctuating traffic volumes such as over saturated or unusual load conditions. The objective is to improve the vehicular throughput and minimize delays. The rules of fuzzy logic controller are formulated by following the same protocols that a human operator would use to control the time intervals of the traffic light. The length of the current green phase is extended or terminated depending upon the ´arrival´ i.e. the number of vehicles approaching the green phase and the ´queue´ that corresponds to the number of queuing vehicles in red phases. A prototype system for controlling traffic at an intersection is designed using VB6 and Matlab tool. The traffic intersection is simulated in VB6 and the data regarding the traffic parameters is collected in VB6 environment. The decision on the duration of the extension is taken using the Matlab tool. This decision is based on the Arrival and Queue of vehicles, which is imported in Matlab from VB6 environment. The time delay experienced by the vehicles using the fixed as well as fuzzy traffic controller is then compared to observe the effectiveness of the fuzzy traffic controller.

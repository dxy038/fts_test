Background In line with the worldwide
trend of deinstitutionalization and development of
community facilities, a rehabilitation legislation was
passed in Israel in 2000. Its aim was to establish an
infrastructure for the chronic mentally ill. The
objective of the present study was to evaluate the
impact of this legislation on the re-hospitalization of
schizophrenic patients. Method Re-hospitalization
rates within 3 years of discharge were compared for
two cohorts of first-in-life hospitalized schizophrenics,
those discharged in 1990–1991 and those discharged
in 2000–2001, after the passing of the law.
Possible confounding variables were controlled for by
logistic regression analyses. The same analysis was
done for patients with affective disorders who are not
generally beneficiaries of this legislation. Results In
2000–2001, the re-hospitalization rate was significantly
lower than in 1990–1991 for schizophrenic
patients with an in-patient stay longer than 6 months
(chronic patients) but not for short-stay schizophrenics
or for affective patients. Conclusion The
study suggests that the expanding of the rehabilitation
facilities in the community by legislation leads to
increase in the survival in the community of schizophrenic
patients.

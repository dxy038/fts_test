The plasticity-induced crack closure shielding effect for long and short through-thickness cracks is studied in a 304L steel. A main objective is to uncouple the effect of the wake length from that of the wake history. The experimental results are presented in a first part of this contribution. In the present second part, a 3D finite elements analysis (ABAQUS) for 2D cracks with a straight crack front is proposed. Globally, a remarkable consistence is obtained between simulation and experiments. The effective stress intensity factor range is confirmed as the driving force when the LEFM concepts are applicable.

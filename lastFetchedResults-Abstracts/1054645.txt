Fullerene-like WS2 (MoS2) nanoparticles (IF) have been studied in the past. It was shown that the IF nanopaticles appear to form a protective film allowing increased load capacity of the rubbed pairs under mixed lubrication. The main objective of the present work is to evaluate the behavior of the IF nanoparticles under severe contact conditionsâ€”the transition to seizure. The effect of the IF nanoparticles burnished to porous alumina matrix on friction and wear of alumina-Si3N4 pair under high contact pressure is also considered. It was shown that when the gap between the contact surfaces is smaller than the size of the IF nanoparticles, there is no effect of the nanopaprticles on the friction force. With load increasing, the IF nanoparticles penetrate into the interface, protecting the rubbed surfaces from a direct contact and thus increase the critical point of transition to seizure. Burnishing of the porous alumina surfaces by the IF solid lubricant nanoparticles provides very low friction coefficient and wear loss under high contact pressure. The IF-WS2 nanoparticles are found to be preserved in the rough summits, fill the valleys, and the pores of the sintered alumina and thus limit the straight contact between the ceramic surfaces. Although the external sheets of the outermost layers of the IF-WS2 nanoparticles were peeled-off, the pristine IF nanoparticles remain in the valleys and pores of the alumina supplying the solid lubricant sheets to the contact area during a long-term test.

This communication addresses the "Service Design, Engineering, Operations, &amp; Innovations" topic. It is oriented towards the "Security &amp; safety-related services and management" and deals more precisely with the Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) practiced in high risk industrial fields. nuclear, chemical, military, and among others, guided transport. The PHA was developed at the beginning of the sixties in the aeronautical and military fields. Almost five decades later, the practice of the PHA remains not less problematic and completely far from any harmonization optics. Moreover, the European lawful and international normative contexts remain very pragmatic in that sense. In order to meet the ceaseless needs of generic methodologies allowing to harmonize the PHA, we consider that the divergences between the various actors are rather of a semantic nature then syntactic and that it wouldn\´t be enough to write and than distribute a glossary of concepts, but to model them in a dedicated ontology. Indeed, our objective is to conceive a "systemic ontology based generic methodology" in order to exploit efficiently the exchange of PHA know-how, of course without concession on results\´ coherence and completeness.

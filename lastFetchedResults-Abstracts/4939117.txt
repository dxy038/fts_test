The objective of this paper is to present an analytical method allowing large signal stability analysis of an electric system constituted by a DC power supply and its output filter connected to a constant power load. Here, the load is realized by a voltage source inverter motor mechanical load actuator system. We suppose that proper controllers are used to drive the actuator. Then, a large signal stability analysis is given for studying the dc-link voltage behavior under large unknown disturbances. This study is based on the Takagi-Sugeno theorem which generates a Lyapunov function allowing the determination of a domain of attraction for a given operating point. This approach may be applied either to estimate robustness properties of a controlled drive system or to be used as a design tool for the dc-link capacitance value. Simulations and experimentations confirm the validity of the proposed approach.

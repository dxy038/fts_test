The two-criteria optimum design problem for thin-walled members with two axes of symmetry (of H-type) subjected to compression and bending is solved. Components of the objective function vector are the compressive force and the bending moment in the web plane. Pareto-optima and “compromise” optimal projects have been obtained and compared with standard profiles.

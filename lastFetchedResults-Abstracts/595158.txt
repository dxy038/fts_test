Objective: To evaluate optimal standard intraocular lens power (IOL) for high volume, high quality cataract patients in community eye care centres.Material and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on patients having cataract from January 2004- June 2003 at Khyber Institute of Ophthalmic Medical Sciences, Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar. Medical record was reviewed and relevant data including patient's age, sex, eye examined, preoperative and postoperative visual acuity, keratometry (K1, K2), axial length and the IOL power used was analysed by an epidemiologist by using SPSS software database.Results: Out of 500 patients with cataract 272 (54.4%) were males and 228 (45.6%)were females. The presenting pre-operative visual acuity was less than 3/60 in 77.6% patients. The post-operative visual acuity was 6/12 or better in 417 (83.4%) patients at the end of first week:. Mean axial length was 23.00 mm (SD + 1.5). For males mean axial length was 22.6824±1.0985 mm and for females it was 23.1914 ±1.6917 mm. Mean IOL power was 21.8 D (SD +2.8). Mean IOL for males was 22.1952+ 2.9170 D and for females was 21.3985 ± 2.6614 D. In 326 patients (65.2%>), IOL used was in the range of 20.5 D to 22.5 D.Conclusion: Use of an optimal standard intraocular lens power based on biometry assessment, in community eye care centres would give optimal visual results. This study demonstrates that an IOL of +20.5- 22.5 dioptre power would leave most postoperative cataract patients with better vision.

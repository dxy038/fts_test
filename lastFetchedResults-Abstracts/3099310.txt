Born from a need to reduce the cost of maintenance in the face of increasing sophistication in aircraft and aircraft systems, this paper presents methods to assess future maintenance concepts and technologies for airliners of the next generation. The objective is the validation of innovative technologies and techniques, which provide the means to make the maintenance task more efficient and effective. The selection of the most promising ones is applied already within the early stages of the innovation process, in which the main part of the arising product life cycle costs are predefined. This technology appreciation procedure supports the early pre-selection of maintenance technologies of interest and the subsequent accompanying cost benefit analysis as decisive help in the process of development to the point of the product. It aims to increase the aircraft operability by increasing the operational reliability and the availability as well as by decreasing the maintenance related costs.

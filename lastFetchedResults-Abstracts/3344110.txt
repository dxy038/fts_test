Internet evolution follows the customer needs, each algorithm, protocol, architecture, equipment, functionality succeeded when the users perceived a real benefit in using it. Taking into account the impact of customer experience when designing promising and future proof technologies is essential. In this paper we investigate how it is possible to control network resources on the base of the Quality of Experience (QoE), defined as the quality of service perceived by a user when using a specific service. QoE is a subjective measure and typically differs from objective and structured measures of quality of service that are under the service provider´s control. We consider the problem of identifying a set of QoE profiles that describes the user behavior when enjoying specific class of services, by analyzing the data related to the users´ feedback in different contextual scenarios. We formulated the mathematical model and performed a validation on the base of preliminary field trials.

98% cross-talk self-cancellation is achieved by the bidirectional power prediction (BPP) control in the proposed single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) converter. The frequency-controlled resistor based on the switched-capacitor (SC) structure determines the energy correlation scheme between dual outputs. The embedded rough and fine energy trackers in the BPP controller guarantee accurate cross-talk cancellation according to both output voltages and currents. The fabricated chip occupies 1.28 mm<sup>2</sup> in 65nm CMOS and achieves 90% peak efficiency.

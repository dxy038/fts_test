Cloud computing has been established in recent years as an important area of research. This reality has been consolidated because, currently, tasks such as obtainment, manipulation, sharing and exploitation of large amounts of data are common and require many computational resources, so cloud computing can contribute because it can provide this resources indefinitely, including processing, memory, storage and others, all them for immediate use. Cloud computing has many challenges, among them, the specification of work platforms in a cloud environment. In this context, the use of models can help insofar as they may contain several types of information that can be handled with the intention of automating the process of creation of an environment. A template can contain information about the user, hardware and software that can be used by computer systems to automatically build the necessary infrastructure for the operation of a virtual machine on a cloud computing environment. In addition, models can be easily exported to other formats used by cloud services providers. The use of concepts of Service Level Agreements - SLA to control the utilization of computational resources of a provider is common in computing environments and can be used to ensure the quality of services that being offered. The objective of this work is to combine these paradigms, cloud, models and SLA, in order to use the resources of a computational cloud to provide automatically a platform as a service - PaaS. This project will be developed in a web environment, using a model-driven approach to create the platforms and the management of resources and quality will be made by SLA.

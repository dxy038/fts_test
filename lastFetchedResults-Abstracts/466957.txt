Objective: Our purpose was to explore the influence of a range of perinatal variables on neurodevelopment at 18 months in a cohort of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) children born in the mid 1990s. Study Design: Two hundred eighty-two SGA children (birth weight <10th centile) were followed up prospectively; 220 (78%) had Bayley Scales of Infant Development II performed at 18 months' corrected age. Results: The mean (SD) gestation at delivery was 36.5 (2.7) weeks and mean birth weight was 2095 (549) g. The mean Bayley Scales of Infant Development scores were as follows: Mental Developmental Index score, 95.6 (14.5); Psychomotor Developmental Index score, 97.9 (14.8); and Behavioural Rating Scale score, 110.6 (13.5). SGA children whose mothers had pregnancy-induced hypertension were less likely to have low Mental Development Index scores than SGA children whose mothers were normotensive during pregnancy (10 [23%] vs 78 [44%]. P = .01). Low Psychomotor Development Index scores were associated with not being breast-fed at 3 months (odds ratio [OR] 3.5; 95% CI 1.2-10.1) and long neonatal nursery stay (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.02-7.05). A low Behavioral Rating Scale score was associated with a large z score for head circumference at birth (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.8) and cord arterial base deficit (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.01-1.4). Conclusion: Few of the perinatal variables previously reported are predictive of early childhood outcome in this modern cohort of SGA infants. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:1069-75.)

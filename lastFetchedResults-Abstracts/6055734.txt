Next generation wireless communication systems target to provide guaranteed quality of service (QoS) for multimedia applications. In this paper, a multiple-threshold bandwidth reservation scheme combined with a call admission control algorithm is proposed and analyzed. The objective of our work is to be able to achieve better QoS provisioning for mobile users while achieving efficient utilization of the available limited bandwidth. The proposed scheme is modelled as M/M/C/C queueing system and the performance measures, call blocking probability and call dropping probability are computed. The performance of our scheme is compared to the complete sharing (CS) policy. Simulation results show that our scheme surpasses the CS policy in terms of call blocking probability, call dropping probability and bandwidth utilization.

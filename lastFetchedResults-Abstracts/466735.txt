Objective: Our purpose was to assess the impact of the mode of delivery—vaginal delivery versus cesarean section—on the perinatal outcomes of the second-born breech twins. Study Design: This study was a retrospective analysis of second-born breech twins with a gestational age of ≥24 weeks at the onset of labor. The patients are divided into three groups: cesarean section without labor (group I), cesarean section after labor (group II), and vaginal breech delivery (group III). Results: There were 141 patients: 40 in group I, 66 in group II, and 35 in group III. There was no birth injury or neonatal death. Group II had one fetus with grade II intraventricular hemorrhage. There was no significant difference among the groups with regard to gestational age, birth weight, hyaline membrane disease, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, and cord blood gas indices, except venous pH in infants with birth weights <1500 g. Conclusions: Vaginal delivery of breech second-born twins, with gestational ages of at least 24 weeks, especially those with birth weights of ≥1500 g, appears to be a safe alternative to cesarean section.

In order to reduce the influence, brought by the integration of micro-grid, to distribution network, this paper established a multi-objective optimal operation model and determined the objective functions, which included the minimum sum of the expectation of the discarded solar and wind energy and the shaded load, as well as the minimum sum of the absolute value of the exchange power between the micro-grid and the distribution network. Thus the optimal initial state of charged of micro-grid as well as the 24 hoursÂ´ optimal exchange power could be determined. Meanwhile the simulated calculation had been done in a certain micro-grid, including wind turbine, photovoltaic cell and battery, the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed model and optimization algorithm, and providing references to the practical engineering.

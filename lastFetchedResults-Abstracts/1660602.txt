A long pathlength, three-dimensional U-type flow cell was microfabricated and evaluated for improved absorbance detection on a glass microdevice. A small diameter hole (75 μm) was laser etched in a thin glass substrate whose thickness (100 μm) defined much of the pathlength of the cell. This substrate was thermally bonded and sandwiched between two different glass substrates. The top substrate contained a typical injection cross and separation microchannel. Projecting out of the plane of the separation device was a 126 μm pathlength flow cell as defined by the laser etched hole and the attached microchannels. The flow cell was connected to a microchannel on the bottom substrate that led to a waste reservoir. The planar, flat windows on the top and bottom of this device made light introduction and collection a simple matter using a light emitting diode (LED) and microscope objective. The experimentally obtained detection limit for rhodamine B was determined to be 0.95 μM, which is nearly identical to the theoretical limit calculated by Beer's Law. A separation of three fluorescent dyes was performed, and direct comparisons were made between the transmittance changes through the narrow pathlength separation microchannel and the adjacent long pathlength, three-dimensional U-type flow cell.

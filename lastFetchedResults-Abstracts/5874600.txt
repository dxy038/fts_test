A systems integration approach to the development of digital satellite communication systems is discussed. In designing a complex communications system, there are many requirements to satisfy, some of which are conflicting. First, the general integration issues for communication systems are described. Next, the development and negotiation of specifications in multisegmented systems using link closure are presented. A discussion of the concept of a spec system to accomplish the objective of cost-effective system design is also included.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The objective of this paper is to describe application-oriented problems so that microcomputer programming courses could be made as effective as possible. These problems are seen in our daily life and thus they make the course more attractive and increase student enthusiasm, motivation, and patience with learning programming in assembly language. These problems and the corresponding laboratory assignments are given in this paper. The sequence starts with simpler problems and goes up to questions as complex as can be expected in an introductory microprocessor programming course.

In the paper of Pachkova [3] the restricted reallocation of resources, among the independent
units of a aggregated unit with the objective of optimizing the whole input consumption and
output production of that unit, have been analyzed and studied. In this paper, some reallocation
models, similar to models presented in the paper of Pachkova, are proposed. With this
difference that these models may present the projecting point of each one of the independent
units related to the aggregated unit studied in each region through preserving the stability of
efficient frontiers, and indicate the output optimized flow in the reallocation in addition to the
input optimized flow. Also, an application of the proposed models on Bank data has been
fulfilled.

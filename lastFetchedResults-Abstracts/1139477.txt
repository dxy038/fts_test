The reductions in microbial load and product yield loss are two important criteria used in establishing proper cooking schedules for shrimp. Long cooking times and high temperatures ensure better product safety at the expense of yield and sensory quality. Prediction of microbial lethality and product yield loss at given cooking temperature–time combinations would result in a balanced approach. The objective of this work was to develop “cooking charts” for large and medium tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) for any desired reduction of a target organism. A finite difference mathematical model developed for the prediction of temperature distribution in shrimp, lethality calculations and yield loss predictions at different conditions was used. The cooking time required to achieve a desired reduction in Vibrio cholera for a given cooking temperature was determined simultaneously with yield loss. Different cooking temperatures between 70 and 100 °C and desired lethalities were used. Cooking charts for large and medium size tiger shrimp were developed. These charts had temperature on the left Y-axis, cooking time on the X-axis, and yield loss on the right Y-axis with the families of curves to find cooking times for desired lethalities, and the corresponding product yield. These charts were found to be useful in the optimization of cooking by taking considering shrimp size, cooking temperature, cooking time, desired lethality, and yield loss.

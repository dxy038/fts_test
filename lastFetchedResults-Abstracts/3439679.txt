The noncoherent demodulation of multiple differentially phase-shift-keyed signals transmitted simultaneously over an asynchronous code-division multiple-access (CDMA) channel with white Gaussian background noise is considered. A class of bilinear detectors is defined with the objective of obtaining the optimal bilinear detector. The optimality criterion considered is near-far resistance that denotes worst-case asymptotic efficiency over the signal energies and phases which are unknown at the receiver. The optimal bilinear detector is therefore obtained by solving a minimax optimization problem. In the finite packet length case, this detector is shown to be a time-varying multiinput multioutput linear decorrelating filter followed by differential decision logic. In the limit as packet lengths go to infinity, the time-varying decorrelating detector is replaced by a time-invariant multiinput multioutput decorrelating filter. Several properties of the optimally near-far resistant detector are established

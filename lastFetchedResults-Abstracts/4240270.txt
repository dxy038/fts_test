In this paper a general system identification framework for structural systems is developed. With the increase in size and complexity of structural systems, a better understanding, as well as, suitable scheme(s) for monitoring and controlling the performance of systems needs to be developed. The first stage in the development of any control and/or monitoring system, is the identification and modeling of the system. Any structural system could be modeled in several forms, each reflecting some relevant set of properties, components and their interconnections. Each model is developed within the context of a specific control problem, i.e., control objectives and nature. Thus, the need for a general system identification framework is warranted. The proposed framework should be able to adapt and emphasize different properties and components of structural systems based on the control objective and the nature of the behavior of the system

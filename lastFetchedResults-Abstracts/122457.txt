Different models in the estimation of flow characteristics of the catchments and the concepts of runoff generation from rainfall, and catchment reaction to the inputs is developed in recent years. A simple model allows easier estimation of the small number of parameters, and a physically realistic model allows parameters to be identified with particular parts of the catchment and estimating its response, again making the estimation of parameters easier. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the variable source area AWBM2002 model in Iranian representative catchments. The analysis was carried out using data from selected catchments named; Kasilian, Kardeh, Amameh, Lighvan, Kan and Kameh in Iran. Parameters were estimated by optimisation using the total streamflow and on separated baseflow and surface runoff. The model performed acceptable results in all catchments. The results showed that the AWBM2002, which gives a convenient approach for estimating parameters directly from the recorded data, and which models variable source areas, can be used as a useful tool for research and design in Iranian catchments.

In distributed system there is a need for allocating processes to different sites (space sharing) followed by scheduling of the processes over time (time sharing). By carefully distributing and scheduling processes in distributed system, several performance metrics can be improved such as total execution time would be minimized, processor utilization could be maximized and balancing of load distribution would be achieved. The main objective of the proposed work is to prepare an optimal schedule which requires minimal execution time, improves the processor utilization and balances the load on different sites. The identified problem is the problem of combinatorial optimization which has been solved using genetic algorithm to produce optimal schedule.

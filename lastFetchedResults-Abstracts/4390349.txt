Coordinate transformation is an important approach for filter improvement. As nonlinear coordinate transformation cannot naturally ensure the observability of the objective system, this article studies the question of observability insurance of coordinate transformation. A theorem of the sufficient condition for coordinate transformation is proved for the cases when the parameters to be identified are nearly invariable. A case study demonstrated the correctness of the theorem.

This paper considers ordinal algorithms for parallel machine scheduling with nonsimultaneous machine available times. Two objects of minimizing the latest job completion time and minimizing the latest machine completion time are studied. For the first objective, we present the optimal algorithms for m = 2, 3, 4 machine cases. For m â‰¥ 5, we propose an algorithm with competitive ratio 2 - 1/(m - 1) while the lower bound is 5/3. For the second objective, the optimal algorithm is also given. Furthermore, for a special case, an algorithm with significantly improved competitive ratio is given.

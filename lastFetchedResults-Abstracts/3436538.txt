Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) improvements in fuel economy and emissions strongly depend on the energy management strategy. The parallel HEV control problem involves the determination of the time profiles of the power flows from the engine and the electric motor. This is also referred to as the power split between the conventional and the electric sources. The objective of HEV control is in fact to find out the sequence of optimal power splits at each instant of time that minimizes the fuel consumption over a given driving schedule. Big obstacles to the control design are the model complexity and the necessity of "a priori" knowledge of torque and velocity profiles. This paper presents three different energy management approaches for the control of a parallel hybrid electric sport-utility-vehicle that do not require a priori knowledge of the driving cycle. The considered approaches are: a rule-based control, an adaptive equivalent fuel consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS), and the H<sub>infin</sub> control. Results, compared with the optimal solution given by the dynamic programming, show that the A-ECMS strategy is the best performing strategy

Introduction & Objective: Gastric cancer is the forth common cancer and second cause of death. Surgery is the primary treatment of gastric cancer and chemotherapy and radiotherapy is used as supplementary treatments. The aim of this study is estimation of survival and affected fac-tor in the patients with gastric cancer after surgery in Hamadan province.
Materials & Methods: All patients with postoperative gastric cancer were collected in Hamadan province as a retrospective study in 2006-2012. Survival time of the  patients was  deter-mined from the time of diagnosis to death or the end of  the study. The effect of risk factors such as gender, age at diagnosis, tumor site, type of tumor and â€¦ on survival was assessed. The data was analyzed by Cox regression model and using SPSS16 statistical software.
Results: 67 patients with postoperative gastric cancer were assessed. 48 patients (71.6%) were male and 40 case died during the  study. Median survival of patients was 26 months and 1, 3 and 5 year survival rates were 67, 40 and 36 percent, respectively. The effect of gender, di-agnosis age and stage on survival was statistically significant.
Conclusion: Survival rate of postoperative gastric cancer in Hamadan is low similar to other regions in Iran. The most important cause is late referral of the patients. So, pervasive educa-tion via mass media about primary symptoms and risk factors of this malady is highly sug-gested.

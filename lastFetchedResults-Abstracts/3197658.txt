The objective of this paper is to present the contribution of a new dielectric constant characterization for the modelling of radar backscattering behavior. Our analysis is based on a large number of radar measurements acquired during different experimental campaigns (Orgeval´94, Pays de Caux´98, 99). We propose a dielectric constant model, based on the combination of contributions from both soil and air fractions. This modelling clearly reveals the joint influence of the air and soil phases, in backscattering measurements over rough surfaces with large clods. A relationship is established between the soil fraction and soil roughness, using the Integral Equation Model (IEM), fitted to real radar data. Finally, the influence of the air fraction on the linear relationship between moisture and the backscattered radar signal is discussed.

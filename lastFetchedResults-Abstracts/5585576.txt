3G cellular systems provide users with high mobility with low bandwidth. Wireless LAN is adopted as a complementaryÂ´ service to support high bandwidth in some hot spots. In this paper, we develop a network selection mechanism for the integrated 3G/wireless LAN networks. The proposed network selection combines analytic hierarchy process and Grey relational analysis. The selection procedures are presented and evaluated in four simulation cases. The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively choose the optimum network for users through balancing between objective network conditions and subjective user requirements.

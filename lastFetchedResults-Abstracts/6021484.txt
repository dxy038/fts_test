Based on the organizers\Â´ recent textbook "Solving Control Related Mathematic Problems in Matlab" by Tsinghua University Press in 2007, a half day tutorial is designed to have a quick tour of the book with illustrated examples. The emphasis is on control related topics. We choose to cover 1) "Difference equation related problems" (Chapter 6); 2) "Intelligent computation related problems" (Chapter 7); 3) "Robust control related problems" (Chapter 8); and 4) "Fractional calculus related problems" (Chapter 9). In each part, control related examples will be illustrated. The main objective of this tutorial is to show how to actually apply Matlab tools to get the control related problems solved. Hands-on experience is emphasized.

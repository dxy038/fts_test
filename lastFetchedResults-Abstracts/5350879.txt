A refined plant growth simulation approach has been proposed in this paper for distribution network reconfiguration. The proposed method combines the heuristic exchange rule used in branch exchange algorithms into the plant growth simulation algorithm for growth points search. The proposed method reduces dramatically the feasible sets of growth points in each iterative step, thus reduces the required run times of load flow, objective function evaluation and morphactin concentration calculation. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested and verified on IEEE 33 bus distribution system.

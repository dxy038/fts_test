Satisfactory solutions of interval programming and interval linear bi-level programming are defined based on a new partial order on intervals. The optimality condition for interval programming is investigated. Based on K-T optimality condition, satisfactory solution of interval linear bi-level programming is obtained from a bi-objective programming. Finally, a numerical example is presented.

A new type of four-port nonreciprocal ferrite device which has features of the isolator, circulator and power devider is described. The nonreciprocal effects are due to the physical principles of the wave propagation in a ferrite stripline immersed into the bidirectional dc. magnetic field. An approximate analysis is presented with the physical. description of the modes in the strip1ine. Finally a new type of the nonreciprocal. ferrite junction has been succesfully developed.

Object-oriented database management system technology provides a set of capabilities which are required by computer integrated software engineering systems. The authorsÂ´ objective is to take advantage of this technology and develop computer integrated software engineering systems that support complete user-defined life cycles with uniform interface and logically centralized database support. They have built tools to generate object-oriented databases that represent the syntax and some of the semantics of programs. These tools are being used to develop a software-maintenance and reverse-engineering system. The authors present an overview of their prototype system and tools.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

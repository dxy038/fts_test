In this paper, we propose a new bidirectional stacked microstrip dipole antenna with a multilayered disk array structure (MDAS) for a high gain WLAN application. In the proposed structure, two identical MDAS are attached on the both sides of a dipole exciter which is composed of two linearly polarized stacked microstrip patches placed back to back and fed with balanced input power using unbalanced-to-balanced (balun) transformer. The proposed antenna structure where MDAS has overall height of 1&#955;<sub>0</sub> was designed and fabricated to operate at 2.44GHz. The maximum gain of the antenna was found to be 10.29dBi with highly symmetric bidirectional beam pattern in both E- and H-plane.

Quality of life was assessed in 37 patients receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for intestinal failure. A questionnaire was developed specifically for this purpose and the results were compared with those obtained by subjective assessment using a simple linear scale. The majority of patients (n = 26, 70.3%) had a good objective quality of life and most (n = 16, 53.3%) of those eligible (n = 30, 81.1%) did not express an interest in intestinal transplantation.
Despite the apparent good quality of life enjoyed by patients receiving HPN, there werenumerous areas in which patients with intestinal failure felt that their quality of life left much to be desired: many patients reported significant psychological symptoms (n = 15, 40.5%) sexual (n = 10, 27.0%) and social dysfunction (n = 19, 51.3%) and most patients with intestinal failure were unable to return to work (n = 24, 88.9%). Detailed quality of life assessment reveals that there is much still to be done to ensure that provision of care for patients with intestinal failure involves not only prolongation of life but also an improvement in quality of life.

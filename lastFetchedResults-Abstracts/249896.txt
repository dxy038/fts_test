To enhance the reliability and e ciency of the multicriteria optimization procedure, a compromise
programming method using multibounds formulation (MBF) is proposed in this paper. This method
can be used either to obtain the Pareto optimum set or to  nd the ‘best’ Pareto optimum solution in
the sense of having the minimum distance to the utopia point. By introducing a set of arti cial design
variables, it is shown that a simpli ed and easy-to-use formulation can be established for practical
applications. Particularly, this formulation is well adapted to the e cient dual solution approach due
to the convexity of objective function. Theoretically, based on the Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions,
demonstrations show that the new formulation is equivalent to its original form and thus retains the
basic properties of the latter. Numerical examples will be solved to show the capacity of this method

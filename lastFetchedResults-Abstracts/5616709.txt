This article based on the relationships and characteristics of the ship routing and scheduling, depend on the thought of integrated optimization, to build an optimized model based on tramp which is a ship routing and deployment model for a bulk. The objective is to minimize the operating costs of a shipping company in a period of time, integrated navigation path selection and shipping arrangement, taking shipping capacity constraints and port draft restrictions into account, to meet diversification of customer needs. Finally, LINGO9.0 is used to solve the model which analyzed by an example.

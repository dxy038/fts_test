The requirements for quality of service (QoS) of applications in networks are becoming stricter. Toward to solve the routing problem in IP networks, MPLS architecture allows to define explicit routes in the network. This paper describes a multi-objective heuristic approach to solve the routing problem in MPLS networks. An evolutionary multi-objective algorithm is proposed based on DijkstraÂ´s shortest path algorithm exploring different metrics. The results using this hybrid approach show the quality and efficiency of the solutions and obtain good approximations to the set of optimal solutions.

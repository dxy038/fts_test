We proposed a novel cross-layer optimization approach for video streaming applications in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based networks. Parameters in media access control (MAC) layer and physical layer are optimized jointly in a cross-layer framework. The main objective is to maximize video quality by reducing the end-to-end distortion in application layer for each user. Potential games theory is adopted to solve this cross-layer problem in distributed way. Convergence of game is guaranteed by gradient projection, which reduces the time complexity of optimization considerably. Simulation results have confirmed that the gradient projection based cross-layer optimization can significantly enhance the video quality performance with low time complexity and high scalability.

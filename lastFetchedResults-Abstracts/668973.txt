Empirical research undertaken at the Budapest University of Economic Sciences and Public Administration concentrated on the organisational factors hindering energy related cleaner production measures at several major Hungarian companies. The underlying objective of the research was to analyse the barriers to preventive environmental actions which often impede the implementation of cost effective CP measures at the company level. As a result of this research, organisational barriers to effective implementation of CP measures have been identified at eight enterprises of the Hungarian industry and recommendations have been developed to overcome the barriers for the implementation of the CP options.
Although some characteristics of the sample companies are specific to a country in transition, most of the experiences gained can be utilised in more developed regions of the world as well.

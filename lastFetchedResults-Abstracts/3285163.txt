Legged robots are able to move across irregular terrains and some can be energy efficient, but are often constrained by a limited range of gaits which can limit their locomotion capabilities considerably. This paper reports a reconfigurable design approach to robotic legged locomotion that produces a wide variety of gait cycles, opening new possibilities for innovative applications. In this paper, we present a distance-based formulation and its application to solve the position analysis problem of a standard Theo Jansen mechanism. By changing the configuration of a linkage, our objective in this study is to identify novel gait patterns of interest for a walking platform. The exemplary gait variations presented in this work demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, and considerably extend the capabilities of the original design to not only produce novel cum useful gait patterns but also to realize behaviors beyond locomotion.

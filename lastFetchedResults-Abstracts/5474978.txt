A multiple-input Triple-Half-Bridge (THB) bidirectional dc-dc converter is presented when this THB converter is applied to the fuel cell electrical vehicle drive system. A dual close-loop control system is designed through bode diagram. Decoupling network is designed to obtain better control performance. Finally, the analysis and design validation are verified through the experiment.

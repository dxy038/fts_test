This work was recorded during the year
2008/2009 within thepublic farm ofagricultural machinery
training center in Siliana-Tunisia (AMTCS) that belongs to
the irrigated district of Lakhmess covering an area of 1275
ha. Cereals are the most practicedcrops representing 49% of
the total cultivated area within the irrigated district.
Themain objective of the study is to determine the water use
efficiency for different wheat cultivars and to analyze the
impacts of supplemental irrigation on cultivars yields.Five
cultivars of durum wheat (Karim, Khiar, Razeg, Nasr,
Oumrabii) andfour cultivars of soft wheat (Birsa, Vaga,
Utique, Hidra) were cultivated in the public farm and one
cultivar of durum wheat (Khiar) was cultivated within a
private farmbelonging to the same region. The area was
divided into 9 strips (100 m x 20 m). These different varieties
were conducted under rain fed and in supplemental
irrigation conditions. An amount of 100 mm of irrigation
water was provided in the plot of the AMTCS as follows: 50
mm in seedling stage (December16th, 2008), 50 mm in the
fulltillering stage (March10th, 2009). In the plot of the private
farm, 150 mm of irrigation water was distributed as
following: 50 mm in the seeding stage (10 December 2008), 50
mm in full tillering stage (10 March 2009), 50 mm in grain
filling stage (May 2nd, 2009). The sprinkler irrigation was
used with a spacing of 12m x 12 m and the plots were
irrigated by a hydrant irrigation existing in each plot.The
flowwas 5 l/s supplied from Lakhmess dam with a salinity of
0.5 g/l. The sprinkler rainfall was 8.5 mm/h with a uniformity
coefficient of 92 %.The model CropWat was used to
determine the water requirements of wheat. Grain yield was
determined by multiplying the density of cobs by the number
of grain per cobs and the Mile grains weight (g). The water
use efficiency is the ratio of the grain yields and the amount
of water consumed. Under rainfed conditions: The average of
water use efficiency was 0.38, 0.36 kg/m3respectivlyfor
durum and soft wheat. Under irrigated conditions, the best
efficiencies of durum wheat were obtained by Khiar, Razeg
and Nasrwith an average of 1 kg/m3.For soft wheat the
varieties Vaga and Utique had the best efficiencies of 1.14
Kg/m3.In the private farm, the water use efficiency of the
variety Khiar used was only 0.95 Kg/m3. The effect of
supplemental irrigation was remarkable. In fact, it improved
theyields for all varieties of durum and soft wheat
respectively by 397% and 347 %.

Objective: Diuretics, cardiac glycosides, β blockers, angiotensin E inhibitors and NSAIDs can produce anincrease in serum potassium in cardio-vascular patients. On the other hand, excessive rise of potassium concentration in extra cellular fluids (such as vitreous humor) can predispose to cardiac arrest. For this reason, the measurement of potassium concentration in the extra cellular fluids, such as vitreous humor, because it is anatomically isolated and deteriorates more slowly than other body fluids, to diagnosis metabolic disorders, electrolytes disorders, sudden death, infarction and investigation of crime in forensic medicine is necessary.
Subjects and Methods: The present investigation was performed on 88 cadavers (44 male, 44 female) brought for autopsy in forensic medicine of Khozestan. The time of death was reported by relatives or recorded responsible coroners. From each eye a-2 ml sample of vitreous humor was aspirated from the outer canthus. Samples were frozen at -20 °C until needed. The samples were liquefied at room temperature and each sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant fluid was used or determination of potassium concentration by flame photometric method and values were expressed in mEq/L.
Results: The results showed no significant differences in potassium concentration of the vitreous humor of both right and left eyes. Furthermore, no gender differences in the relation vitreous humor potassium concentrations were observed. 
Conclusion: Potassium baseline concentration of vitreous humor in right and left eyes of dead men and women in Khuzestan follows the following mathematical relationship Y=1.03x + 3.94 , r =1.

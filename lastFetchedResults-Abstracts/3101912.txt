In recent years, with the flourishing development of logistics around China, economy developed very quickly, and many logistics parks were built-up to integrate resource, and then develop modern logistics industry based on scale effect of the parks. But domestic logistics park planning is at the starting stage without a unified approach. On efficient Implementation of logistics parks functions depend on reasonable planning and working-area layout in the parks, the layout of the various functional areas is the primary problem. Using appropriate way to achieve optimal work-areas layout of the logistics parks is the basis of building the park and also the precondition for the internal layout of every work-area. SLP method used in layout of systematic workshop equipment was used in this study, influence factors are more objective and quantization, then genetic algorithm was used to from an integrated method of function partition and function area lay-out. At last, this method was used in a logistics park of Lianyungang port.

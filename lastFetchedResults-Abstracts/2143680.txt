Background and Objective: Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury repeatedly occurs in situations such as surgery, hemorrhage, burns, trauma, and infection. It has also been found that females were more resistant than males, indicating that female sex hormones have a protective function. The aim of this study was to determine the role of estrogen, progesterone, and their combination in protecting the gastric damage induced by I/R.
Materials and Methods: 40 Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: intact, ischemia - reperfusion (IR), IR + estradiol (1mg/kg), IR + progesterone (16 mg / kg) (P) and IR + combination of estradiol (1mg / kg) and progesterone (16 mg / kg). After animal anesthesia and laparotomy, celiac artery was occluded for 30 minutes and then circulation was established for 24 hours. Results expressed as mean Â± SEM and P  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: The gastric acid concentration significantly increased after induction of gastric ischemia - reperfusion (p  < 0.001). Treatment with estradiol, progesterone (p  < 0.05) and combined estradiol and progesterone (p  < 0.01) significantly reduced gastric acid levels. The histopathological evaluation of gastric tissue indicated the presence of gastric ulcer with active bleeding, erosion, submucosal edema and identified inflammation in ischemia - reperfusion group. In groups treated with estrogen and progesterone, the ulcer was not found; however, erosion, edema and inflammation of serous surfaces were observed. 
Conclusion: Regarding acid-lowering and protective effects of estrogen and progesterone upon gastric tissue following gastric ischemia-reperfusion, female sex steroids can be used to reduce gastrointestinal ischemic disorders.

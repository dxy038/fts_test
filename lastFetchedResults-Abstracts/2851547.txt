The objective of this paper is to develop an ultrasound signal processing technique suitable to measure changes in distance between two membranes that simulate the pleural membranes in a basic human thorax phantom. The proposed technique is based on the correlation and autocorrelation methods. Obtaining an accuracy of 96.83 percent compared to those measures obtained with a caliper.

Background and objective: Work settings provide a unique opportunity for
health promotion interventions. Considering the issue of obesity among employees,
this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of the intervention
based on new communication technologies and the social cognitive theory on
weight control in the governmental employees of the city of Hamadan in 2014.
Methods: This clinical trial study was conducted among “telephone-assisted
intervention”, “web-assisted intervention”, and “control” groups comprising
435 employees with excess weight or obesity. The educational intervention
was performed for 6 months under the title of “lifestyle program.” Then, the
participants were evaluated in terms of weight and changes in the constructs of
the social-cognitive theory 6 and 9 months after the intervention. A researchermade
questionnaire based on the Dishman and Dewar questionnaires was used
to evaluate the constructs of social-cognitive theory. The data were collected
and analyzed using one-way ANOVA, two-way analysis of variance, and linear
Regression test through SPSS 20.
Results: The lifestyle intervention resulted in a weight loss of 1.92 and 1.08 kg
among the telephone-assisted and web-assisted intervention groups, respectively.
The intervention in the mobile telephone-assisted group increased the
mean scores of the participants in the constructs of self-efficacy, environment,
outcome expectations, and outcome expectancies. In the web-assisted intervention
group, the mean scores of the constructs of self-efficacy and outcome
expectancies increased.
Conclusion: The results of the present study showed the effectiveness of the intervention
based on new communication technologies and the social-cognitive
theory (SCT). We recommend conducting studies to evaluate other health challenges
based on the Social-Cognitive Theory in work settings.

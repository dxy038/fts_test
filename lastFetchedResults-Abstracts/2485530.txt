Background and Objective: Several studies have found that diazepam decreases serum glucose. Meanwhile, glibenclamide is commonly used in diabetes treatment. The objective of this study was to survey the treatment impact of diazepam and glibenclamide on blood glucose and serum lipids in mice with type II diabetes.
Materials and Methods: In this study, 32 male rats were divided into four groups, i.e. diabetes, glibenclamide, diazepam and combination of glibenclamide and diazepam. Diabetes was inducted using 60 mg/kg of streptozocin injection at single dosage. Medicinal dosage was 0.285 mg/kg for glibenclamide and was 1 mg/kg for diazepam and 50 percent of above mentioned dosages for complex therapeutic dosage. Treatment was continued for 16 days after positivity of diabetes. The level of blood glucose in serum and lipid profile of the rats were surveyed at the end of the study.
Results: Therapeutic combination of diazepam and glibenclamide caused a significant reduction of serum glucose in comparison with control group at 9 and 16 days (p < 0.05). Combined treatment also caused more significant increase of serum HDL and serum HDL to LDL ratio (p < 0.05), while these changes were not observed in the groups that were treated using glibenclamide or diazepam, alone.
Conclusion: The combined treatment of glibenclamide and diazepam caused the improvement in controlling the serum glucose and can appropriately change the level of serum HDL in diabetic rats.

Building-related health complaints and symptoms represent a significant occupational health problem. Elevated concentrations of various types of indoor pollutants, frequently associated with inadequate ventilation, have been implicated as a potential cause. The objective of this research is to model and evaluate the performance of several ventilation methods in pollutant removal from indoor environments. Pollutant sources are assumed to be at the floor level, one with a constant emission rate and the other a fast decaying source (volatile organic compound emissions from a wood stain). Three ventilation methods, namely displacement ventilation and two mixing systems using a side grille and ceiling square diffuser respectively are studied. A computer model has been applied to simulate the distributions and the time history of the pollutant concentrations in a mockup office. Experimental data of velocity, temperature, and tracer gas concentration distributions in the chamber with the displacement diffuser are obtained to validate the airflow model. Simulation results show that different ventilation methods affect the pollutant distributions within the room. When the pollutant sources are distributed on the floor and not associated with a heat source or initial momentum, displacement ventilation behaves no worse than perfect mixing ventilation at the breathing zone. Conventional “mixing” diffusers, on the other hand, could perform better or worse than a perfect mixing system. The computer model could be used for selecting appropriate ventilation systems to maximize indoor air quality for occupants.

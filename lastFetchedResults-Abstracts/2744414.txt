Current rehabilitation therapies for stroke rely on physical practice (PP) by the patients. Motor imagery (MI), the imagination of movements without physical action, presents an alternate neurorehabilitation for stroke patients without relying on residue movements. However, MI is an endogenous mental process that is not physically observable. Recently, advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology have enabled the objective detection of MI that spearheaded this alternate neurorehabilitation for stroke. In this review, we present two strategies of using BCI for neurorehabilitation after stroke: detecting MI to trigger a feedback, and detecting MI with a robot to provide concomitant MI and PP. We also present three randomized control trials that employed these two strategies for upper limb rehabilitation. A total of 125 chronic stroke patients were screened over six years. The BCI screening revealed that 103 (82%) patients can use electroencephalogram-based BCI, and 75 (60%) performed well with accuracies above 70%. A total of 67 patients were recruited to complete one of the three RCTs ranging from two to six weeks of which 26 patients, who underwent BCI neurorehabilitation that employed these two strategies, had significant motor improvement of 4.5 measured by Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment of the upper extremity. Hence, the results demonstrate clinical efficacy of using BCI as an alternate neurorehabilitation for stroke.

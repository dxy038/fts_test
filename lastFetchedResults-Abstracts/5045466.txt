A phenomenological model for partial discharge that can be used for simulation studies in lumped parameter networks is proposed. The classical ´abc´ model of PD is a subset of the proposed model. It permits objective definitions of PD and breakdown. The model reference approach is used to distinguish between PD and breakdown in windings during impulse tests. In Experiments are performed to validate the results.

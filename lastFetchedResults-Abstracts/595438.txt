Objective: To find out the role of clean intermitting self dilatation (CISD) for the prevention of recurrent urethral stricture.

Results: A total of 146 male patients were included in the study. They were divided into two groups of 73 each on alternate basis. Group A was control group and group B with clean intermitting self dilatation and were followed upto 8 months. Study results showed a high rate of recurrence in control group A i.e. 42 patients (57.53%) in comparison to self dilatation group B i.e. 26 patients (35.61%). Conclusion: Clean intermitting self dilatation is an effective procedure in the prevention of recurrent urethral strictures for primary strictures and deep strictures between 0.5-1.5cm length after optical urethrotomy

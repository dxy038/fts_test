The authors consider the design of a gain scheduled control law for a nonlinear plant with the objective of regulating the output to zero in the face of a rapidly varying scheduling signal. The underlying theoretical construct is a certain manifold in the state-control space called an approximate regulation manifold. Based on maps describing this manifold and conditions related to the matching conditions of robust linear control theory, a state feedback control law that depends on the instantaneous values of the scheduling signal and its time derivative can be designed to meet the objective

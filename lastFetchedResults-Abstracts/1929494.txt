The exploitation of the domestic animals species of South American camelids is of great social importance for the native people living in the High Andes. The reproductive physiology of these species is a unique challenge in the development of advanced breeding techniques. At present, the cryopreservation of embryos has not been developed and very few investigations have been conducted. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the in vivo survival of vitrified llama embryos after transfer to recipient females. Donors females were treated with a CIDR-estradiol benzoate-eCG regimen and were mated naturally 6 days after CIDR withdrawal. One ovulatory dose (8 Î¼g) of GnRH was administered immediately after mating. A second mating was allowed 24 h later. Embryo recovery was performed nonsurgically between 8 and 8.5 days after the first mating. Twenty-two ova/embryos were recovered from 12 donor females. Hatched blastocysts were exposed to vitrification solution (20% glycerol + 20% ethylene glycol + 0.3 M sucrose + 0.375 M glucose + 3% polyethylene glycol (P/V)) in three steps, and after loading into 0.25 ml straws, were plunged into liquid nitrogen. For embryo transfer, recipients animals were ovulation-synchronized using GnRH administered at the same time as donors. A total of eight vitrified-warmed embryos and 12 fresh embryos were nonsurgically transferred to four and six recipient females, respectively (two embryo per recipient). The pregnancy rates were 50 and 33.3% for recipients that had received vitrified embryos and fresh embryos, respectively. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of this simple vitrification method for cryopreservation of llama embryos.

The plethora of networked multimedia services and ubiquitous devices has ultimately changed the objective of networking to one that strives in enabling the provision and interaction of networked services. It is therefore necessary especially in the home environment to consider the enhancement of the way services are provided to the end user. To be able to realise such a vision, a common interworking layer needs to be adopted. This allows all the devices to use the same IP addressing domain and therefore be considered as operating on one network. That would ultimately provide a common networking layer for the applications. In doing so, the authors would enable services to interact seamlessly without the needs of provision for roaming and handover functionalities. This paper presents BlueBridge, a solution that provides seamless wireless interworking in the lower layers. The detail of the design and implementation and provide results that prove the enhanced capabilities of its functionality.

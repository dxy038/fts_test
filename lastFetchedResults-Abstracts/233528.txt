The purpose of this paper was to illustrate the example of multicriteria optimization of the big blocks of flats. The method described in [Hwang and Masud (Multiple objective decision making—methods and applications—a state-of-art-survey. Lecture notes in economics and mathematical systems, Springer, Berlin, 1979)] and [Jendo and Marks (Archives of Civil Engineering 30(1) (1984))] is based on decomposition into part-problems: optimization of internal partitions of the building, the shape of building, heat sources, and finally adequate co-ordination of solutions. The above-mentioned co-ordination is obtained by an iterative method.

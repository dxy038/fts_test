The principal objective of this paper is to encounter the safety related challenges in intelligent transportation system (ITS). The detection of nearby vehicle is an important task for the radar that is used for safety application in ITS. But the received signal, contains the target information, is corrupted by clutter. This is an important issue in out door radar detection. Thus in this paper a novel method, based on STAP, has been proposed to address this issue. The mathematical modelling of non-homogeneous clutter is also presented here. The proposed methodology has been validated with help of a case study in a utopian vehicular safety scenario.

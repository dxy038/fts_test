The thin spherical dielectric lens is an ideal multiple beam communications satellite antenna operating in the millimetre wave band. Typically, tens to hundreds of simultaneous closely-spaced beams are required. The design goal is to maximise edge-of-coverage gain that is consistent with low alternate beam copolar and crosspolar interference. Each beam is generated by a cluster of feed horns with excitations formed by a low-level beamforming network. The objective here is to develop an efficient procedure for determining the optimum locations, excitations and size of the feeds. The method of focal plane beam synthesis is proposed.

This paper presents a study on bidirectional multiband-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) ultra-wideband (UWB) signal transmission through 3 different systems, i.e. cable system, multi-mode fiber and single mode fiber based radio over fiber system, and air. MB-OFDM compliant UWB signals with frequency ranging between 3.1 GHz to 4.8 GHz are generated using a WisAir-DV9110M development kit. Packet error rate (PER) and received acknowledgement measurements are performed. The results obtained show that UWB signals over fiber is a cost-efficient and promising technology that can be used to extend the distance for broadband wireless communications.

A soft switching implementation without additional device, high efficiency, simple control zero voltage switching (ZVS) bidirectional isolated DC-DC converter is presented in this paper. This is used in high power application especially for power supply in fuel cell vehicles electric vehicle driving system and power generation where a high power density is required. This technique has the advantages of low cost, light weight and high reliability power converter where the power semiconductor devices (MOSFET, IGBT, etc) and packaging of the individual units and the system integration play a major role in isolated DC-DC converter hybrid/fuel cell vehicles. The proposed converter system should be efficient to improve the range of performance of the battery operated vehicles. The simulation is performance by using MATLAB software to show its feasibility and performance.

Objective: The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism by which lactobacilli
exert their cytotoxic effects on cervical cancer cells. In addition, we aimed to evaluate
the effect of lactobacilli on the expression of human papilloma virus (HPV) oncogenes.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, using quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), we analyzed the expression of CASP3 and three autophagy
genes [ATG14, BECN1 and alpha 2 catalytic subunit of AMPK (PRKAA2)] along with
HPV18 E6 and E7 genes in HeLa cells before and after treatment with Lactobacillus
crispatus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus culture supernatants.
Results: The expression of CASP3 and autophagy genes in HeLa cells was decreased
after treatment with lactobacilli culture supernatants. However, this decrease
was not significant for PRKAA2 when compared with controls. In addition,
expression of HPV E6 was significantly decreased after treatment with lactobacilli
culture supernatants.
Conclusion: Lactobacilli culture supernatants can decrease expression of ATG14
and BECN1 as well as the HPV E6 oncogene. It has been demonstrated that the main
changes occurring during cervical carcinogenesis in cell machinery can be reversed
by suppression of HPV oncogenes. Therefore, downregulation of HPV E6 by lactobacilli
may have therapeutic potential for cervical cancer. As the role of autophagy in
cancer is complicated, further work is required to clarify the link between downregulation
of autophagy genes and antiproliferative effects exerted by lactobacilli.

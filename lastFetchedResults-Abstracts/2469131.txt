In this paper, a novel fusion algorithm based on the adaptive dual-channel unit-linking pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) for infrared and visible images fusion in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain is proposed. The flexible multi-resolution and directional expansion for images of NSCT are associated with global coupling and pulse synchronization characteristic of dual-PCNN. Compared with other dual-PCNN models, the proposed model possesses fewer parameters and is not difficult to implement adaptive, which is more suitable for image fusion. Firstly, the source images were multi-scale and multi-directional decomposed by NSCT. Then, to make dual-channel PCNN adaptive, the average gradient of each pixel was presented as the linking strength, and the time matrix was presented to determine the iteration number adaptively. In this fusion scheme, a novel sum modified-Laplacian of low-frequency subband and a modified spatial frequency of high-frequency subband were input to motivate the adaptive dual-channel unit-linking PCNN, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve image fusion performance, accomplish notable target information and high contrast, simultaneously preserve rich details information, and excel other typical current methods in both objective evaluation criteria and visual effect.

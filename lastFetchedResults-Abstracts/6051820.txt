This paper comprehensively evaluate resources competitiveness situation of five selected power plants by establishing the resources competitiveness index system of power plant. First, the uniformization and dimensionless method of selected index system is provided. Second, weight of each index is determined by the mean square method and the columns and the inverse method, objective and subjective weighting method are selected for integrated weighting to get combined weights. Third, use TOPSIS method to evaluate the weighted index system.

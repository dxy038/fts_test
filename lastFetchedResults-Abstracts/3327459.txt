Information theoretic methods of calculating the capacity of data hiding schemes allow for objective comparisons of watermarking algorithms. This paper applies these methods to the case of colour image watermarking, using a dual tree complex wavelet transform and non redundant complex wavelet transform along with a spread transform data hiding algorithm to compare levels of capacity between the two most commonly used uncorrelated colour spaces. The information theoretic model used involves the use of game theory applied to optimize the embedding and attack strategy across parallel Gaussian channels. The two most popular uncorrelated colour spaces YUV and YIQ are compared.

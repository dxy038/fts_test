In the present article, Kant's view concerning metaphysics has been studied. Having explained lexical and terminological meaning of the term "metaphysics" as understood by Aristotle, the authors have made mentions to various metaphysical systems from Plato to Descartes and his followers. Then, the meaning of the term, as understood in Kant's philosophy, has been studied; and its negative and positive aspects in his philosophy have been discussed. After that, the article comes to the conclusion that, influenced by Hume's ideas, Kant negates metaphysics in its traditional sense (i.e. theoretical and certain knowledge of God, world, and soul). But, he accepts metaphysics in the sense of theoretical support of empirical science, and considers a systematizing role for issues discussed in the traditional metaphysics as well. He leaves confession to objective existence of issues posed in the traditional metaphysics to be discussed in the field of practical reason.

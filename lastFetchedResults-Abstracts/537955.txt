 Cotton leaf curl virus (CLCuV) is one of the most destructive diseases limiting the vegetative growth and production of cotton. Development of CLCuV resistant cotton genotypes is the most effective strategy to minimize the yield losses due to this disease. But so far no cotton genotype resistant to CLCuV (Burewala strain) has been reported. We are then only left with the option to alter the management practices to minimize the yield losses. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the effects of planting time, plant spacing and genotypes on CLCuV incidence. Significant differences existed for seed cotton yield and its components and CLCuV infestation due to planting time and genotypes. Infestation due to CLCuV varied significantly among genotypes. Maximum seed cotton yield (2068kg/ha) was recorded in genotype MNH-6070 planted at 30the June with plant-to-plant spacing of 15cm. Moreover MNH-6070 proved to be better under CLCuV infestation than the rest. There was less disease incidence on 1st May planted cotton as compared to late sown cotton (15th & 30th June). Maximum CLCuV incidence was recorded within 30-45 days in late planting as compared to 105 days of early planted cotton. From the present study it is concluded that early planting with increased plant spacing and late planting with reduced plant spacing is effective in managing CLCuV to achieve optimum seed cotton yield.

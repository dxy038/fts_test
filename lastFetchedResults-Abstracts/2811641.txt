Absorption and reduced scattering coefficients (&#956;<sub>a</sub> and &#956;´<sub>s</sub>) of adult heads have been noninvasively determined by time-resolved reflectance measurements. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) analysis was used to calculate time-resolved reflectance from realistic adult head models with brain grooves containing a non-scattering layer. In vivo time-resolved reflectances of human heads were measured by a system composed of a time-correlated single photon counter and a diode laser. By minimizing the objective functions that compare theoretical and experimental time resolved reflectances, &#956;<sub>a</sub> and &#956;´<sub>s</sub> of brain were determined. It became clear that time-resolved measurements have enough sensitivity to determine both &#956;<sub>a</sub> and &#956;´<sub>s</sub> for superficial tissues, gray matter and white matter, except &#956;<sub>s</sub> for white matter.

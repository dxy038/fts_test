The Ground Test Accelerator (GTA) has the objective of verifying much of the technology required for producing high-brightness, high-current H<sup>-</sup> beams. GTA commissioning is staged to verify the beam-dynamics design of each major accelerator component as it is brought online. The major components are the 35-keV H<sup>-</sup> injector, the 2.5-MeV radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ), the intertank matching section (IMS), the 3.2 MeV first 2&#946;&#955; drift tube linac (DTL-1) module, and the 24-MeV GTA with 10 DTL modules. Results from the DTL-1 beam experiments will be presented

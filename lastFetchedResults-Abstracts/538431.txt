Background and Objective: Although mild stress could cause activity and impetus in life, but too much of it may cause physical and psychological illness. One of the most effective factors on stress is religion and religious beliefs. The aim of this research was to study the effect of Holy Quran on perceived stress in personnel of Arak University of Medical Sciences. 

Materials and Methods: In this educational trial , study sample consisted of 80 personnel of Arak University of Medical Sciences that were randomly chosen and assigned to control and experimental groups (each with 40 persons). Data collection was through a standard questionnaire including perceived stress standard (Pss-14). Before intervention, both groups filled questionnaires, then, in experimental group, the Holy Quran recitation was played for 20 minutes during two weeks. One month after intervention, both groups filled questionnaires and intervention was examined. 

Results: The results showed that the degree of stress in experimental and control groups after intervention was 29.06 ± 17.59, and 40.98 ± 15.35 respectively and there was significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion: Since Holy Quran recitation reduced degree of stress, it can be used as a non-pharmacological, safe and cheap procedure for stress reduction, so, Holy Quran recitation is suggested for personnel as a daily habit.

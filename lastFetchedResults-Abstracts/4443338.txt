This paper is devoted to the Fluorescence Diffuse Optical Tomography. This inverse problem relies on an iterative algorithm based on solutions of partial differential equations. The goal of the paper is to present a multiresolution technique applied to these equations, with the objective of computation complexity reduction. The effectiveness of the approach is then illustrated on a practical example.

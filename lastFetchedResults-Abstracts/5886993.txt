A data hiding system based in Rational Dither Modulation is proposed. This system hides information into the audio signals in Modulated Complex Lapped Transform (MCLT) domain. The system proposed is able to hide around of 43 bits per second in a CD-quality audio signal. Objective and subjective evaluations show robustness to classical attacks and transparency to Human Auditory System (HAS), respectively.

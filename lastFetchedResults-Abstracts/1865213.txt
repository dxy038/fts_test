Language textbooks are conventionally expected to develop the four language macro-skills, including listening, reading, writing and speaking in language learners. However, mastering the reading skill is of particular importance, since it enhances the comprehension of specialized texts in students. The objective of this research is to investigate the scientific aspect of Persian textbooks in teaching the reading skill. In this research at first, the significant studies and findings in the area of reading are reviewed. Afterwards, Neil Anderson's ACTIVE model, as one of the most systematic models introduced to this area, is entirely described. Following this, some selected sources of teaching Persian are analyzed based on this model. It is concluded from this analysis that these sources have hardly addressed the current findings in the area of language teaching, especially the Anderson's ACTIVE model. The cultivation of vocabulary, the principle common within all traditional methods of language instruction, is remarkably implemented throughout these books. Among other components of Anderson's ACTIVE model, the principle of verification of strategies has been considered more. The teach-for-comprehension component has been rarely applied too. Despite its tremendous significance, the activation of prior knowledge principle is disregarded in almost all books. Furthermore, the principles called increase reading rate and progress evaluation are neglected all through these sources.

As a step to achieve the objective of predicting electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise in IGBT PWM inverters, this paper proposes a new and practical EMI noise source modeling method. An equivalent Thevenin source in the frequency-domain, including the voltage source and source impedance, is employed to model the main EMI noise emission source - the IGBT switching. The modeling approach for both the differential mode (DM) and common mode (CM) noise source is studied. The methodology is verified experimentally using a simple, controlled testbed. The important issues on measurement repeatability and data processing are also investigated and discussed.

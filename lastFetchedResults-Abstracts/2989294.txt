The authors recently suggested a new approach to the design of fuzzy control rules. The method, referred to as fuzzy Lyapunov synthesis, extends classical Lyapunov synthesis to the domain of &#8220;computing with words&#8221;, and allows the systematic, instead of heuristic, design and analysis of fuzzy controllers given linguistic information about the plant. In this paper we use the fuzzy Lyapunov synthesis method to design and analyze the rule-base of a fuzzy scheduler. We show that fuzzy rules, previously suggested based on heuristics, can be derived systematically and, therefore, that the entire process can be automated. This may lead to a novel &#8220;computing with words&#8221; algorithm: the input is linguistic information concerning the &#8220;plant&#8221; and the &#8220;control&#8221; objective, and the output is a suitable fuzzy rule-base

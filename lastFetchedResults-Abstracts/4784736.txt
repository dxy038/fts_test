Considering the lack of effective evaluation on the sustainable development of inland water transport, an indicator system is designed for evaluation, illustration and checking of inland water transport sustainable development and an inland water transport decision support system for sustainable development is constructed based on data warehouse and online analytical processing (OLAP). The system structure includes 5 layers: application interface layer, auxiliary decision making function layer, warehouse management and data interface layer, information warehouse layer and data layer. The system function includes monitoring, evaluation, early warning, comprehensive analysis and search. The data warehouse is designed including determining subject, dimension design, logic model design, the choice of granularity and data partition. The subject of the data warehouse consists of the early warning indices of inland water transport sustainable development. The snow model for data warehouse consists of 4 dimensions(geological area, organization, indicator and time) and 3 granularities(annual, quarterly and monthly).The partitioning scheme for the data warehouse is to do partitioning on the geological area dimension first followed by partitioning on the organization dimension. The multidimensional decision making procedure, including slicing, dicing and rotation, is discussed. The system utilizes the data from multiple sources and provides a support for multi-objective decision making to realize the dynamic analysis, monitoring and early warning in inland water transport sustainable development.

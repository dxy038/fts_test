When investigating the pollen dynamics of agro-ecosystems and assessing the risk of pollen contamination from transgenic to non-transgenic crops, it is necessary to monitor pollen release. The objective of this study is to evaluate the possibility of using band ratio to model pollen dynamics during the maize flowering season. The temporal change of R<sub>520</sub>/R<sub>577</sub> had the best relationship with the pollen number, and the correlation coefficient was 0.80. The result is important for assessing the potential for pollen contamination.

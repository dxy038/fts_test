Good sensor deployment is vital for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To improve the initial deployment and to prolong network lifetime, one approach is to relocate sensors in different densities which vary with the distance to the sink. Since sensors located closer to the sink are involved in more data forwarding, sensors in this region should have a higher density. In this paper, we address the problem of movement-assisted sensor positioning (MSP) to increase network lifetime with the objective to achieve the theoretical sensor densities while minimizing sensor movement. We propose three solutions: an integer-programming formulation, a localized matching method, and a distributed corona-radius scanning algorithm. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the proposed solutions.

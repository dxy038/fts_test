The main objective of this study was to investigate the factorial structure of Family Emotional Involvement and Criticism Scale among Iranian students. A correlation method was employed with a sample of high school students. Participants were 204 high school students of Shiraz city, who were selected through multi-stage cluster sampling. They answered a 14-item version of the FEICS. Data was analyzed through confirmatory factor analysis and internal consistency was obtained using alpha Cronbach.  The examination of the 2 factor model by confirmatory factor analysis showed the best fit with the data, and Cronbach alpha ranged from 0.60 to 0.65 for FEICS factors which is acceptable. The Family Emotional Involvement and Criticism Scale could be used as a valid and reliable instrument in Iranian psychological & psycho-sociological research.

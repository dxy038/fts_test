Discusses the implementation of a residue arithmetic circuit using multiple-valued bidirectional current-mode MOS technology. Each residue digit is represented by new multiple-valued coding suitable for highly parallel computation. By the coding, mod m<sub>i</sub> multiplication can be simply performed by a shift operation. In mod m<sub>i</sub> addition, radix-5 signed-digit (SD) arithmetic is employed for a high degree of parallelism and multiple-operand addition, so that high-speed arithmetic operations can be achieved. Finally, the mod7 three-operand multiply adder is designed and fabricated as an integrated circuit based on 10- mu m CMOS technology.

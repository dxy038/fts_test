Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Participants were 418 first year students of Guilan University of Medical Sciences who completed Iranian versions of the TTM and exercise behavior questionnaires. Data were analyzed using bivariate correlation and path analysis.
Results: In the final model, path coefficient for the processes of change (behavioral strategy), self-efficacy in exercise and pros were 0.54, 0.20 and -0.11 respectively. The model accounted for 38% of the variance for predicting current exercise behavior.
Conclusion: The study findings support the application of TTM in exercise behavior changes among Iranian students.

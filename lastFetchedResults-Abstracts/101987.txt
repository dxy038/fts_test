The objective of this paper is to present an analysis on the scale-up procedure of two-dimensional spouted beds. The task was carried out with three different beds measuring 0.15, 0.30 and 0.80 in width. The conditions of scale-up were studied through geometrical similitude analysis. Some parameters of scale were adimensionalised, tested and validated in order to propose relationships capable of predicting values of dependent properties. Those relationships should be followed in a prototype of an equipment of industrial scale. The study permitted the development of correlations to predict values of maximum pressure drop, minimum spout velocity and maximum height of spouting.

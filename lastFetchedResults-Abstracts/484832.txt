Background and Objective: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are toxic, persistent, bio-accumulate and pose
a risk of causing adverse effects on human health and to the environment. PCB compounds exert varios
impacts on human depending upon age, route of entry, intensity and frequency of exposure. This study was
conducted to determine the effect of UV-C, hydrogen peroxide and solvent on the photo degradation of
PCBs.
Materials and Methods: The photochemical reactor was of annular geometry (500 ml volume) with a
cylindrical low-pressure mercury lamp emitting at 254 run. The power emitted by the lamp was 6 W. The
whole lamp was immersed into a reactor with temperature of 32 Â± 2 C. The PCBs were analyzed by
GC/ECD equipment.
Results: The degradation of total PCBs in terms of one, two and three lamps was 77.5%, 82.9% and 85.2%
respectively. The degradation of total PCBs in terms of not using of H20 2 and using 100/0 and 20% of H20 2
were 74.5%, 790/0 and 94.50/0 respectively.
Conclusion: The results of this experiments showed that DVC-photolysis of H20 2 leads to a degradation
efficiency of PCBs only in the presence of ethanol.

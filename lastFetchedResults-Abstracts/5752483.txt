The specific objective of this article is to describe a system using virtual reality concepts which allows the user to simulate and evaluate the performance of a control law design, including aircraft dynamics, in a visual manner. In this system, the computer controlled plane flies using the control laws under study while a virtual hand (controlled by a glove device) represents the target which the computer plane tries to fly to. In this way, the glove can be used to input evasive maneuvers while the computer controlled plane is observed to determine responsiveness and integrity. The computing platform used for this system is a 33 MHz, 80486 based personal computer. The glove input device is the Mattel PowerGlove modified for use on the computer. Stereo vision is provided by a pair of Sega shuttering lenses. The system software was developed using BorlandÂ´s Turbo C++ compiler and is written entirely in the language &#8220;C&#8221;. The graphics and interfacing software is provided by a public domain rendering library entitled &#8220;Rend386&#8221;. The specific results obtained after developing the system include: the creation of a flexible, modular system which can be expanded as the need arises, a unique interface which provides an intuitive means to evaluate complicated control systems, the entire system is simple in design and is easily implemented using &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; virtual reality components (gloves, glasses, etc.)

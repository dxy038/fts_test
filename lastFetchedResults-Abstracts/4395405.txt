To solve the subjective and one-sidedness problems in the process of coherency identification, more factors are taken to account to analyze the coherency of generators. Using the experience of analytic hierarchy process for reference, a practical AHP model is set up, which combines key factors such as swing curves, topological structures, parameters of the generators and so on, in order to change the process of coherency identification from single-decision making to multiple attribute decision making. Through the coherence of the standards system known homology matrix and its similarity comparison and analysis of the matrix calculation, various factors comprehensive analytic hierarchy judgment matrix is determined, a relatively objective factors to determine the weight. Distributed clustering method is used to calculate similarity matrix, in the end to complete motor clustering. Simulation results of IEEE118-bus and West Inner Mongolia Power Grid show that this method is accurate and practical.

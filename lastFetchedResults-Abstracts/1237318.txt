
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Spiritual intelligence as the foundation of one's beliefs has a main role in different aspects of human life particularly in provision and promotion of mental health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between spiritual intelligence and perceived stress, anxiety and depression among the Lorestan Medical Science University students.
METHODS This correlational and descriptive study was performed on 457 female and male students of Lorestan University of medical sciences who were selected by cluster-random sampling. Zung anxiety scale, Beck depression inventory, Cohen perceived stress and King spiritual intelligence questionnaires were used to evaluate and compare the variables.
FINDINGS: The results of this study indicated that there was a negative significant relationship between spiritual intelligence and perceived stress, anxiety and depression (-0.140, -0.511 and -0.908, respectively) that was significant at p < 0.01 level. On the other hand, multiple regression analysis showed that the predictor variables significantly explain the criterion variables.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicated that there was a significant negative relationship between spiritual intelligence and perceived stress, anxiety and depression. Perceived stress, anxiety and depression are reduced with increasing spiritual intelligence.

Synchronous interleaved boost converters (SIBCs) result in lower ripple currents and bidirectional power flow. The boost topology has a non-minimum phase characteristic, producing instability problems when a large bandwidth is required. Linear controllers inherently limit the boost controller bandwidth, resulting in a slow response. In this paper, state-trajectory control of the SIBC based on boundary control is proposed to provide an outstanding dynamic response during start-up and sudden load changes, close to the physical limit of the system. The proposed controller and derivation provides a rigorous framework that deals with four switching states, and three state equations, resulting in a simple control law with very fast dynamic response. The normalized trajectories for the SIBC are determined in the geometric domain along with the control law. The exact trajectories are used for fast transients, and approximate trajectories are employed for constant frequency in steady-state. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the proposed procedures.

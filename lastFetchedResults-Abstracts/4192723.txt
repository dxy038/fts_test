The model is designed for the energy conservation which is formulated as a Linear Programming (LP) problem and it can be decomposed by Lagrangian Relaxation(LR) technique. Energy savings can be achieved by the maximum utilization of energy services. Utilization of Energy services is maximized by consuming electricity and investing in conservation for planning of resources. The main objective of Demand Side Management (DSM) model is to optimize the utility of energy services. The optimum value of the proposed model is obtained by the LR technique. Based on the numerical calculations and graphical representations the maximum energy conservation is obtained by using star labeled products.

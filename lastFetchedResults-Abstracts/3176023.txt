This paper mainly introduced the basic structure and design process of hardware and software of PV power station remote monitoring system data acquisition device, collected and monitored the photovoltaic power generation system voltage,current,temperature,gave the bidirectional current sensing circuit, temperature detection circuit, serial communications interface circuit and remote communication diagram of PC and single chip microcomputer, the conditioning circuit of inverter AC voltage and current, data acquisition flow chart and so on. Aiming at the large scale parallel centralized development trend of PV power station, using group control technology, in the case of low sunshine data acquisition centralized control inverter to make inverter turns operation, greatly extend the service life of the inverter. The system could complete the data acquisition and processing of PV power station operating parameters and the instantaneous value of electrical equipment operating status, realized dynamic curves and report shows and print function of realize real-time and historical data.

The prevalence of alcohol use declines with age, but studies suggest that between 2% and 4% of the elderly population have a particulary high alcohol consumption. The objective of this study was to verify or refute this finding and identify clinical or social characteristics associated with alcohol consumption.

sured alcohol consumption by autoquestionnaire in 7575 women, aged 75 or older, recruited at five centers in France. The alcohol consumption was computed taking account of the number of beer, wine or liquor (or spirits) drinks consumed per day.

an age of the respondents was 80±6 y. Forty percent used some alcohol and 2.5% drank more than 30 grams per day. Smoking, good health status, higher socioeconomic status or single marital status were factors whose percentages increased significantly with increasing alcohol use.

e the advanced age of this population, regular alcohol intake was prevalent but not heavy and abusive consumption drinking. Drinking appears to be associated with some medical or social characteristics and possibly with better health status. Public Health (2001) 115, 186–191.

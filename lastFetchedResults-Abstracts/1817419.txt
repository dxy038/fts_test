Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of weekly paclitaxel in patients with recurrent endometrial cancer. Methods: Paclitaxel (70 mg/m2 by 1-h infusion weekly) was administered to two patients with recurrent endometrial cancer of the lung. Results: After 5 cycles, both patients with platinum-resistant disease achieved clinical partial responses confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan. The serum CA125 levels of case 1 decreased to cut-off level. The response duration of both patients was 4 months. The toxicity was acceptable and probably less pronounced than that characterize of the standard tri-weekly schedules. Conclusion: Although conclusions regarding survival are premature, weekly paclitaxel might offer better quality of life during treatment.

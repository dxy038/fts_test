The present work investigates the various reliability parameters of industrial systems in terms of membership and non-membership functions by using Î±-cut and the weakest t-norm based arithmetic operations on triangular intuitionistic fuzzy sets. As the available information about the constituent components of the system is most of the time imprecise, incomplete, vague and conflicting, the management decisions are based on experience. Thus, the objective of this paper is to quantify the uncertainties that make the decisions realistic, generic and extensible for the application domain. Sensitivity of system performance has also been analyzed for showing the effect of taking wrong combinations of reliability parameters. The obtained results computed by the proposed approach are compared with the existing methodologies. The approach has been illustrated through a case study for supremacy.

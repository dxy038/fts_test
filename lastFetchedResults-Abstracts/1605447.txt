The main objective of this paper is to investigate the stability and stabilization problem of fuzzy large-scale systems in which the system is composed of a number of Takagiâ€“Sugeno fuzzy subsystems with interconnection. Instead of fuzzy parallel distributed compensation (PDC) design, nonlinear state feedback controllers are used in stabilization of the overall large-scale system. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) conditions are derived for asymptotic and exponential stability. Two numerical examples are given to confirm the analytical results and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

The main damage from the July 9, 1997, Cariaco earthquake (Ms=6.8) was concentrated in the town of Cariaco and surrounding villages, which are located in the western part of the Cariaco sedimentary basin, close to the Gulf of Cariaco. Casanay, located at the eastern end of the sedimentary basin, suffered considerably less damage. The El Pilar fault, a right-lateral strike-slip fault that generated the earthquake, runs parallel to the southern border of the valley and crosses both towns. The determination of the velocity structure of the basin is the main objective of this study. Seismic refraction data were recorded along three lines, one of them along-strike and two perpendicular to the valley axis in the northern and southern bedrocks. Beneath Cariaco, approximately 1 km thick Quaternary sediments with seismic velocities of 1.9â€“2.1 km/s and bedrock velocities of more than 4 km/s were observed. The thickness of the Quaternary sediments varies within the basin, and Pleistocene sediments outcrop beneath Casanay. The increased thickness of the unconsolidated, water-saturated Quaternary sediments, together with the difference in the quality of buildings prior to the earthquake, probably is responsible for the damage pattern of the Cariaco earthquake.

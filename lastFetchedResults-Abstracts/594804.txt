The objective of this study was to calibrate and validate the SALTMED model using field data of three growing seasons of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.), chickpeas (Cicer arietinum) and sweet corn (Zea mays Saccharata) which were grown in the south of Morocco and subjected to six treatments of deficit irrigation with treated wastewater. The calibration focussed primarily on soil moisture related to quinoa in the field, measured yield and dry matter. The validation process of biomass production was based on use of the calibrated photosynthesis efficiency value of the control treatment. Plant parameters such as plant height and rooting depth, duration of each growth stage, sowing date, harvesting date, harvest index and leaf area index were based on field measurements and records. Crop coefficients Kc, Kcb, Fc were based on FAO56 paper. Soil parameters such as water retention curves were based on laboratory measurements. Initial soil water content and salinity were based on measurements either in the laboratory or in the field. Fine tuning of some crop and soil parameters was carried out in order to obtain a good calibration. Following successful calibration and validation, the SALTMED model proved its ability to predict soil moisture, yield and total dry matter for three growing seasons under several deficit irrigation strategies using treated wastewater. The model showed a very good agreement between the observed and simulated data, as well as being able to reveal the same difference between deficit irrigation strategies in terms of measured yield and total dry matter.

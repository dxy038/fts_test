A general optimization methodology for the optimal design of robotic manipulators is presented and
illustrated by its application to a realistic and practical three-link revolute-joint planar manipulator. The
end-e¤ector carries out a prescribed vertical motion for which, respectively, the average torque requirement
from electrical driving motors, and the electric input energy to the driving motors are minimized with respect
to positional and dimensional design variables. In addition to simple physical bounds placed on the
variables, the maximum deliverable torques of the driving motors and the allowable joint angles between
successive links represent further constraints on the system. The optimization is carried out via a penalty
function formulation of the constrained problem to which a proven robust unconstrained optimization
method is applied. The problem of singularities (also known as degeneracy or lock-up), which may occur for
certain choices of design variables, is successfully dealt with by means of a specially proposed procedure in
which a high artiÞcial objective function value is computed for such Ôlock-up trajectoriesÕ. Designs are
obtained that are feasible and practical with reductions in the objective functions in comparison to that of
arbitrarily chosen infeasible initial designs. Copyright

A linear programming problem with fuzzy relational parameters is proposed in this paper. It is an extension of the problem (solving fuzzy relation equations with a linear objective function) proposed by Fang and Li (1999). For characterizing the feasible domain of the new problem, two new concepts, f-vertex and vertex of the problem are introduced. It is proved that the minimum of the new problem must be attained at some vertex of it. Based on this conclusion, an algorithm for solving the new problem is given

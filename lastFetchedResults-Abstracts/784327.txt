Purpose Suicide is a major public health concern and a
leading cause of death in the United States. Psychopathology
is an established risk factor for non-fatal suicidal behavior;
however, it is unclear whether Premenstrual Dysphoric
Disorder (PMDD), a psychiatric disorder specific to women,
is correlated with these outcomes. The objective of this study
was to determine if PMDD status was associated with suicidal
ideation, plans, and attempts, independent of sociodemographic
factors and psychiatric comorbidity.
Methods We conducted a secondary data analysis of 3,965
American women aged 18–40 who participated in the Collaborative
Psychiatric Epidemiology Survey. Descriptive
statistics and forward stepwise logistic regression modeling
were performed using SUDAAN software.
Results The prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviors
increased in a graded fashion according to PMDD status.
Although the control for demographic characteristics and
psychiatric comorbidity greatly attenuated the unadjusted
association between PMDD and suicidal behaviors, women
with PMDD remained significantly more likely than
women with no premenstrual symptoms to report suicidal
ideation (OR 2.22; 95 % CI 1.40–3.53), plans (OR 2.27;
95 % CI 1.20–4.28), and attempts (OR 2.10; 95 % CI
1.08–4.08). Only the likelihood of suicidal ideation was
significantly elevated among women with moderate/severe
premenstrual syndrome (PMS;OR1.49; 95%CI 1.17–1.88),
compared to women with no premenstrual symptoms.
Conclusions PMDD was strongly and independently
associated with non-fatal suicidal behaviors among a
nationally representative sample. These findings suggest
that clinicians treating women with PMDD should assess
and be vigilant for signs of non-fatal suicidal behavior, and
that clinicians should evaluate and treat the premenstrual
symptoms of women who express these behaviors

The IEEE 802.11 standard has a power save management algorithm for both infrastructure and Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) mode. The standard design distributed coordination function (DCF) for channel access. The DCF is a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme with binary exponential backoff (BEB) algorithm. Several analytical models are presented for analysis of the IEEE 802.11 DCF to provide a better understanding of the research challenges. The analytical models are based on the IEEE 802.11 DCF for saturated and unsaturated traffic conditions. This paper presents detailed investigation of current analytical models of performance analysis of IEEE 802.11 DCF with Power Save Mode (PSM) and without PSM. The possible future research works in this field of research interests are also discussed, with an objective to explore new research interests in this field.

Energy availability has again become an important and polarizing issue. Different countries have made distinctive choices affecting the importance of energy as a determinant of economic growth. Analysis of these varying choices helps put the current debate over oil imports in historical context, and illuminates the relative merits of supply-side and demand-side solutions. Some nations have achieved a more effective policy synthesis than others.

The countries reviewed in this paper illustrate a variety of responses to energy vulnerability. A "best" response would be hard to define given the vastly different policy contexts. It is nonetheless clear that every country combines supply- and demand-side initiatives into an integrated portfolio that addresses price, availability, environmental impact, and other broad public values

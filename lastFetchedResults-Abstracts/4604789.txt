In this paper, a penalty-based distributed algorithm is proposed to design beamforming for multi-source multi-destination (MSMD) networks. The objective of the beamforming design is to minimize the transmission power of each source under the constraint that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements of all source-destination pairs are satisfied. The proposed beamforming design has better power-efficiency compared to the egoism, altruism, and balancing algorithms. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is also discussed and a sufficient condition is determined for the algorithm to converge to a Pareto optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has higher probability of convergence compared to the egoism, altruism, and balancing algorithms, which is close to a centralized performance benchmark.

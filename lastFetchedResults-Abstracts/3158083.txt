The optimal receiver field-of-view (FOV) of a free-space optical (FSO) link through clouds strongly depends on the multiple-scattering characteristics of the channel. Due to the complexity of the multiple-scattering model of clouds, it is a non-trivial task to obtain the optimal FOV. In this paper, the real-coded genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to determine the optimal FOV, which is defined as: with this FOV, the received optical signal reaches the highest level and the channel bandwidth is not below the specific value. The objective function for the fitness evaluation of individuals is built based on both the received-optical-energy model and the channel-bandwidth model. The penalty-function method is used to obtain an unconstrained optimization. Elitism is also employed to increase the performance of GA. Finally, the optimal FOVs are obtained by using the real-coded GA.

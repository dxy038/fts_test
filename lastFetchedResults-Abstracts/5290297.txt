Various situational management styles and their relation to accomplishing organizational objectives through teamwork are examined. The managerial grid, as proposed by Blake and Mouton, and their proposed management styles of country club management, team management, organization man management, impoverished management, and authority-obedience, are presented. The aspects of teamwork and its relation to each managerial style are examined. The overall objective is to determine if teamwork is required (and to what degree) for each managerial style. It is concluded that no one manager can have one particular style of management all the time. However, a particular style can dominate a large portion of the time, and it is this style on which that manager will ultimately fall back. No one style can be considered the correct style of management since each situation demands a set of characteristics that will often combine several management styles. Although teamwork is more often preferred, a manager cannot always be a team player

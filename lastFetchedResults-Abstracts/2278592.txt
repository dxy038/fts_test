This paper is an examination of laminar axial flow of power-law fluids in concentric annuli. The objective is to derive an accurate expression relating pressure drop to flow rate over the whole range of entry parameters: aspect ratio of inner-to-outer diameters, flow behavior index, and consistency parameter of the rheological model. Accuracy of the expression enables determination of the influence of individual parameters to the functional dependence of the explicit relation of pressure drop vs. flow rate.

The research objective of the present study is to develop and test a theoretical model that integrates the literature on antecedents of entrepreneurial creativity. The development of entrepreneurial creativity is modeled as an outcome of external factors, which is consistent with the current literature in this stream (e.g., Woodman, et al. 1993). Figure 1 depicts our proposed model.

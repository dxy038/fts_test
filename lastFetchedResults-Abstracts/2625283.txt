Improper land use management has bad impacts on available resources. To reduce the environmental
and economic effects of erosion caused by the mismanagement of the land use, there is a need on
proper plans in the watersheds. Land use optimization is of the solutions for achieving sustainable
development and reducing the resources loss. The main objective of this study, is determining the
optimal level of land use to increase the income of residents and reducing the effect of erosion in the
Sana dam watershed. To achieve the development and to apply an optimal pattern of minimizing soil
erosion and sedimentation, and minimizing land income by using Multi-objective programming
model with the objective functions and Determination optimization options. For this were used linear
programming model for the three different options for present condition, Land use of present
condition with land use management applied and land use standards condition and According to 
principles and scientific criteria. The results of this study showed that present land use level to reduce
erosion and income increase weren't suitable for area residents and must change the optimum
conditions, that in the optimum conditions for the garden land use of 108 hectares to 899/28 hectares
(832/66% increase), the rang land use level without changing, the irrigated land use level of 1232 ha
to 642/52 ha (62/45% reduce) And the dry land farming level of 107 hectares to 85/20 ha (37/20 %
reduce) changed. Also the results erosion and profits showed that in case land use optimizing in
present conditions, rates of watershed erosion and profitability, reduce 5/3% and increase 47/73%,
With land use management applied on present land use, reduce 31/7 % and increase 242/57%,
respectively, and on standard conditions, reduce 43/4% and 242/57% increased, respectively.

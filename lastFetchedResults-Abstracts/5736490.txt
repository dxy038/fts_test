Accounting for a patientÂ´s emotional state is integral in medical care. Positive emotions have a significant influence on mental and physical health. Much research has been carried out on the impact of emotion on the development and course of different illnesses. Emotion and significant contexts have an important role in helping people cope with depression, but lack of support undermines coping. In this paper, we present an emotion-focused e-health monitoring support system in assisting them to cope with their illness. In the system proposed, a user could monitor his emotional states in the absence of a doctor and regulate his emotions through the system. To provide personalized health care services to the user anywhere and anytime, the system should convert low-level multimodal context (including physiological signal, user profile and environment information) to high-level context. The objective of this research is establishing an emotion-focused e-health system for health care services.

The objective of the work related in this paper is to control a wind energy conversion system based on the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). This production unit is connected to the electrical network which is subjected to symmetrical voltage sags. In order to avoid the electrical problems during the fault, a new control strategy is proposed. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control technique during voltage sags.

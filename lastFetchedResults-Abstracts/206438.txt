The improvement of transportation systems is one of the most important issues in the economic improvement programs of a country. In this paper, a mathematical programming model is developed to measure the productivity in the transportation system of Iran. In this model, the labor and capital are considered as inputs and the maximum amount of total factor productivity of the transportation system is considered as an objective function of our model. In order to define a more accurate system, the labor input is divided into three categories: management, operational and officials. The objective function is also a weighted function of different factors consisting of total factor productivity. For determining the weight of these factors, the Aniytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used. The model is also tested on a real problem. In this case study, the optimal levels of partial productivity, total factor productivity and the optimum values of decision variables are determined by solving the model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the model under unexpected circumstances of passenger demand fluctuation is also reported.

A Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) method is proposed for audio streaming represented in the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) domain. MDCT is the dominant transform of perceptual audio coding and widely used in consumer electronics. The MDCT coefficients of a lost frame are reconstructed by our PLC method, which is based on audio sinusoidal model in MDCT domain. The sinusoid-like coefficients could be predicted by sinusoidal frequency estimation, and further optimization of computation is achieved by using sign property of sinusoids. In order to compare with other approaches, both subjective and objective evaluation tests are conducted. The experimental results show that the computational complexity and memory requirement of our approach are greatly reduced, while good quality is maintained.

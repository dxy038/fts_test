The objective of this study was to investigate the utilization of grape tree pruninig in middle layer of particleboard with poplar wood as surface layer. Experimental boards were produced using of 80, 70, 60 and 50% grape and particles in middle layer and 20, 30, 40 and 50% of poplar wood particles in surface layer, resin content (UF) at 10 and 12 percent. 24 boards were produced and physical & mechanical properties of the boards were measure and analyzed. The results indicated modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) of boards increased with increasing resin content and poplar wood particles significantly. MOR and MOE of boards produced with 12% resin content and 50% grape particle with 50% of poplar wood particles achieved DIN standard requirements. The results indicated that the internal bond (IB) of boards with increasing resin content consumption and increasing of poplar wood particles were modified and the highest of IB observed in boards produced with 12% resin content consumption and use of 50 and 60% grape wood particles. In order to the lowest of thickness swelling (T.S) of boards observed in same conditions. The results of this study showed that over than 50 percent of wood materials that utilized in particleboard production, can be obtained from grape pruning residues and with apply of their in middle layer of particleboards can be produced particleboards in standard levels

The axle base of truck, kingpins distance, bottom angle of trapezoid mechanism and length of steering arm are chosen as design variables. The off-center distances in the pin joints caused by joint clearances are regarded as noise factors. The kinematics precision at fourteen positions of steering mechanism during steering course is chosen as objective function. Considering the reliability of steering performance of truck, a math model is established to improve the robustness of the objective function. Evidence theory is used to deal with the reliability constraint of steering performance. A design example is given and the results shows that the proposed method can ensure the reliability of steering performance, also can improve the kinematics precision of steering trapezoid mechanism.

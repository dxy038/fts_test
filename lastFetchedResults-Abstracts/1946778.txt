The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in physical, chemical and biological parameters to assess the maturity and stability of composts prepared from mixture of different farm and agro-industrial wastes over a period of 150 days. All the composts appeared granular, dark grey in color without foul odor and attained an ambient temperature at 120 days of composting indicating the stable nature of composts. Correlation analysis showed that the optimal values of the selected parameters for our experimental conditions are as follows: organic matter loss &gt;42%, C:N ratio &lt;15, water soluble organic carbon (Cw):organic N (Norg) ratio &lt;0.55, humic acid (HA):fulvic acid (FA) ratio &gt;1.9, humification index (HI) &gt;30%, cation exchange capacity (CEC):total organic carbon (TOC) ratio &gt;1.7 and germination index (GI) &gt;70%. Compost enriched with sewage sludge, pressmud and poultry waste matured earlier compared to composts either enriched with distillery effluent or un-enriched.

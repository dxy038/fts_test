The objective of this study is to show the best stability of a regulation system using a nonconventional corrector like that carried out compared to system of regulation using a traditional corrector.
The input impedance of the electronic component realized has a fractional order in a frequency band called fractal area. This property suggests their use in the practical realization of analogical controllers of a non-integer nature. In this article, a fractional controller of order 1/2 is realized by using an electronic component based on the fractal structure of Hilbert. Some simulations and experiments have demonstrated that the proposed component is useful for the realization of 1/2 order fractional controller.

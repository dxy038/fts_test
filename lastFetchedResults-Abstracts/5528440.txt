This paper presents an optimal design approach for a single-sided axial flux permanent magnet(AFPM) machine. A multi-objective differential evolution based optimization algorithm is implemented, which is to maximize the output torque density (Nm/kg) and efficiency. Design constraints including geometrical and operating limits are considered. Total of seven independent variables are employed in the design. Optimization results are compared with a prototype design.

A proof-of-concept prototype walking chair for the disabled is proposed with the objective of demonstrating the feasibility of a completely new approach to mobility. Our prototype system consists of a chair equipped with wheels and legs and is capable of walking on uneven terrain and circumventing obstacles. The important design considerations, the system design and an experimental prototype of a chair, are discussed. Redundancy in actuation enables the online optimization of tractive forces which enhances the adaptability of the system

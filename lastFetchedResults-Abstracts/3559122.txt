The authors discuss the different parameters affecting the economic feasibility of power factor correction. It is shown that the specific costs of the transmission and compensation elements as well as those of the electrical energy and power losses have a decisive influence on the achievable overall economic saving. After formulating an objective function representing this overall saving, taking the load factor into account, the authors present an analytical approach to the determination of the optimal size of the compensation equipment. A generalized chart is given which enables the designer to know whether the power factor correction is feasible under any circumstances. Also, the most suitable degree of reactive power compensation can be directly found. The results obtained from a digital program are also given to indicate the sensitivity of the optimal compensation factor to changes in system parameters such as the specific energy loss cost and the annual rate of interest and depreciation

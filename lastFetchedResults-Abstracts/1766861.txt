Abstract 
Objective:The purpose of this study was finding the effect of 
8-week rehabilitation program on pain reduction and 
improving nerve conduction in patient exposed with carpal 
tunnel syndrome.
Methods:15 person of Bank workers in Ilam city were 
participated in the study. These people exposed with carpal 
tunnel syndrome (18 wrist) that divided randomly in two 
group. The tools involved personal information, Visual 
Analog Scale (VAS test), and electro diagnostic test. 
Rehabilitation protocol was informed by experimental group 
in 8 week. Experimental group performed daily and regularly 
this program in duration workhours in 6 period (each period 
last 10 minutes and in total 60 minutes). Control group didn't 
performed any program in rehabilitation stage.
Results:The result of this study indicated that in post test, 
pain rate in duration activity (p=0.001) and parastesy 
(p=0.018) in experimental group was significantly lower than 
control group. But significant difference didn't been observed 
between two groups in terms of pain rate (p > 0.05). Also about 
nerve conduction parameters, the result showed that in post 
test there was significant difference between two groups in 
terms of sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity, wave 
peak and distal latency (p < 0.05). 
Conclusion:According to the results, performing high 
program has significant effect on pain reduction, hand 
parastesy and improvementof nerve conduction.

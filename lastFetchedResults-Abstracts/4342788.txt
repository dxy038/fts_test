Making profits is the key objective for most industrial companies, but in our case, it is sacrificed to educate qualified and creative microcontroller hardware and firmware engineers. Holtek semiconductor Inc. donates its microcontroller integrated design modules and technical support to setup a laboratory in Lunghwa University for learning activities. Lunghwa University offers its resources, including teachers and facilities, to redesign course contents, hardware and software teaching materials, and propose a new program for the design of microcontroller and embedded systems. A creativity contest with high prize (<sup>S</sup>D 18000 in total) for the design of microcontroller and embedded systems using HoltekÂ´s microcontrollers is also initiated to attract more senior high school and university students to show their creativities and technical skills. The proposed program will also encourage enrolled students to win certificates provided by the Taiwan Embedded Microcontroller Development Institute, because the Institute is supported by the government and local industries

Biomedical signals are frequently complex waveforms that occur in a very noisy environment. Although the information content and the best way to present this information is under constant study in the medical and research community, advanced signal processing techniques have proven to be invaluable to the analysis of biomedical signals. With the increased capability of personal computers (PCs), the acquisition and analysis of biomedical signals is becoming practical at the individual physician level. The paper describes an inexpensive PC based system for both data acquisition and analysis. The objective is to provide advanced signal processing tools in an easy to use, inexpensive format

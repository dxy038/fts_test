A design study of a high-field superconducting dipole magnet for the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) project has been carried out in cooperation between CERN and KEK. The objective is to develop a 1-m twin-aperture dipole model magnet based on double shell coil design with a fully symmetric split collaring structure. Development of superconducting cable with high keystone angle is a key technology to realize this magnet. The progress made in the design study and the development of the 1-m dipole model magnet are described

Objective
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a common disease of the central nervous system. The
interaction between inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes typically
results in irregular neurological disturbances followed by progressive disability.
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders.
The DNA polymerase-gamma (POLG) gene, which encodes the catalytic
subunit of enzyme responsible for directing mtDNA replication, contains a poly
glutamine tract (poly-Q) in the N-terminal, encoded by a CAG sequence in exon
2.
Materials & Methods
We analyzed the POLG trinucleotide repeats in 40 Iranian patients with MS (27
females and 13 males with an age range of 18–55); and 47 healthy age, gender,
and ethnic matched controls were chosen by PCR-SSCP analysis.
Results
Our results indicated that the most common allele in patients had 10 consecutive
CAG repeats (10Q). Other alleles of 11and 12 trinucleotide repeats were detected.
We did not find any difference between the CAG repeat length distribution in
controls and MS patients.
Conclusion
No correlation was observed in the POLG gene CAG repeat with pathogenesis of
MS, but it looks that other point mutations in POLG gene may have an important
role in the disease’s pathogenesis and produced more significant results.

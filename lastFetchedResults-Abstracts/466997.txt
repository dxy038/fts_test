Objective: Our purpose was to measure the impact of a single-layer or double-layer closure on uterine rupture at subsequent delivery. Study Design: This is an observational cohort study of all women undergoing a trial of labor from 1988 to 2000 in a tertiary care center, after a single low transverse cesarean delivery. Factors most highly associated with uterine rupture were identified by using univariate regression analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for selected confounding variables. Results: Of the 2142 women who met the study criteria, 1980 (92.4%) had maternal records and original operative reports reviewed. After adjustments were made for confounding variables, the odds ratio for uterine rupture in women with a single-layer closure was 3.95 (95% CI, 1.35-11.49). Conclusion: A single-layer closure of the previous lower segment incision was the most influential factor and was associated with a 4-fold increase in the risk of uterine rupture compared with a double-layer closure.

Background: Application of natural compounds, including essential oils (EOs) and lysozyme is an effective method against growth of bacterial pathogens in foods.
Objective: Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of lysozyme and Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil on L. monocytogenes.
Methods: In this study different concentrations of lysozyme and Zataria multiflora Boiss. EOwere used alone and in combination on BHI broth to determine MIC of Zataria multiflora Boiss. EO and lysozyme with macro dilution and micro dilution methods and effect of sub inhibitory concentrations of them on bacterial growth curve of L. monocytogenes.
Results: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Z. multiflora Boiss EO was estimated ?0.04 using macro and microdilution. lysozyme at the highest concentration (1000 µg/ ml) was not effective in inhibition of bacterial growth and no MIC value obtained. Combination of EO and Lysozyme decreased the MIC value to %0.02 and 250µg/ mlfor Z. multifloraBoiss. EO and lysozyme, respectively. The results of growth curve analysis showed that combination was effective in increasing the lag phase.
Conclusion: Z. multiflora Boiss and lysozyme showed to be effective against bacterial growth and its potential application in food systems may be suggested.

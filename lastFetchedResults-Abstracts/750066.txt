Objective: To determine the patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and semantic dementia (SD).

Methods: 25 patients with mild FTD and 9 patients with mild SD as well as 15 healthy age-matched control subjects underwent 18F-FDG- positron emission tomography. Patient scans were compared with control scans using SPM-99.

Results: As compared with healthy control subjects patients with FTD showed an extensive symmetrical hypometabolism of the frontal lobes (height threshold P<0.001) which spared the motor cortex. Patients with SD showed a hypometabolism in the whole left temporal lobe and in the right temporal pole.

Conclusions: In the clinical syndromes of FTD and SD two distinct patterns of cerebral metabolism were identified. FTD was associated with frontal hypometabolism, whereas in SD cerebral glucose metabolism was exclusively reduced in the temporal lobes. Our findings are consistent with the notion that FTD and SD begin as strictly lobar neuronal degenerations and that a spread of pathological changes is not seen until more advanced stages.

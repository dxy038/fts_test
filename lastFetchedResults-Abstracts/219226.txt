Arsenic contamination in water poses a serious threat on human health. The tea fungus known as
Kombucha is a waste produced during black tea fermentation. The objective of this study was to examine
the main aspect of a possible strategy for the removal of arsenates employing tea fungal biomass. The
pretreatment of biomass with FeCl3 was found to improve the biosorption efficiency. Arsenics uptake was
found to be rapid for all concentrations and reached to 79% of equilibrium capacity of biosorption in 20
min and reached equilibrium in 90 min. The pseudo second-order and first-order models described the
biosorption kinetics of As (V) with good correlation coefficient (R2>0.93) and better than the other
equations. The data obtained from the experiment of biosorption isotherm were analyzed using the
Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The equation described the isotherm of As (V) biosorption with
relatively high correlation coefficient (R2>0.93). According to the Langmuir model, the maximum uptake
capacities (qm) of tea fungal biomass for As (V) were obtained 3.98Ã—10-3 mmol/gr. The effect of Na+, K+,
Mg+2 and Ca+2 on equilibrium capacities of As was not significant. The variation of sorption efficiency with
pH showed that optimum biosorption takes place in the pH ranges of 6 to 8. Promising results were
obtained in laboratory experiments and effective As (V) removals were observed.

The objective of this study was to assess the status of Kenya's tourist destinations and the factors that determine their choices among the residents of Nairobi. The study adopted a cross-sectional descriptive survey design that covered 118 respondents randomly selected from adult patrons at an up-market shopping mall in Nairobi. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. The Hypotheses were tested using chi-squares and Pearson Productâ€“Moment Correlation at 95% confidence level. The results indicated that tourism in Kenya is almost exclusively centred on the south coast beaches and a handful of game reserves or national parks. The Kenya's domestic tourist market considered individual trait factors as being more significant in determining the choice of a holiday destination than the environmental factors. The findings further indicated that the factors that motivated Nairobi residents in the choice of domestic tourism destination in rank order include: knowledge and adventure; economic concerns; personal safety; destination information; travel arrangement; destination features; family and friends; leisure and relaxation; religious and cultural considerations and travel bragging. Statistical tests failed to reject the hypothesis that majority of Kenya's domestic tourist attraction areas do not fall within the evoked set of the destination choice model.

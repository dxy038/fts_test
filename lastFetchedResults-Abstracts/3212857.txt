The failure of the previous regional development policies, particularly the limited spillover effects, has encouraged a more integrated approach, to suit the characteristics and the needs of the developing countries based on agriculture. In connection with this, one of the integrated approaches known as the Traditional Village Development Approach is stressed for the regional development in Malaysia. The objective of this approach is to lessen the disproportionate gap between the urban and rural areas, and at the same time upgrade the villagersÂ´ standard of living. This strategy includes agricultural improvement through ownership changes and small farm consolidation into plantations, the development of non-economic activities and the changes in settlement structure and the establishment of the growth centres. The findings of the study showed that there is still some space for action that needs to be taken by PERDA in order to develop the standard of living of the rural population, particularly in identifying the priorities for the development and the overall development strategy. The most important thing is to ensure that the returns and a more optimum benefit are given to the population through a more comprehensive and collective participation in future research to ensure focus groups are well participated.

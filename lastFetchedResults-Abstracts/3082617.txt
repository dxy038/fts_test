The dynamic structure linear predictive coder (DLPC) is proposed. The analysis filter structure is dynamic, i.e., the order number is varied according to the analyzing gain. It is adjusted so as to the achieved gain is less than the reference gain value. The main advantage is that the DLPC provides low bit-rate of transmission. Also, the subjective and objective measurements show that the DLPC yields relative quality of the synthesized speech compared to that of the conventional LPC coding

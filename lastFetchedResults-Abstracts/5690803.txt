The purpose of this work is to employ trainable neural networks to start solving the problem facing the designers and users of computer psychological tests: cultural, national and social adaptation of tests. Mathematical construction of up-to-date objective diagnostic tests is based on a comparison of the revealed condition with the norm standard. It is understandable that the norms worked out for one socio-cultural group are not necessarily the same for the other. By way of example it is possible to cite the difficulties to be reckoned with in adapting foreign techniques. Neural networks have been successfully used for classical explicit diagnoses. A typical experiment is described

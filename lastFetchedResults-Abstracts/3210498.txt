Aimed at the industrial sorting technology problems, this paper researched correlative algorithm of image processing and analysis, and completed the construction of robot vision sense. the operational process was described as follows: the camera acquired image sequences of the metal work piece in the sorting region. Image sequence was analyzed to use algorithms of image pre-processing, Hough circle detection, corner detection and contour recognition. in the mean time, this paper also explained the characteristics of three main function model (image pre-processing, corner detection and contour recognition), and proposed algorithm of multi-objective center and a corner recognition. the simulated results show that the sorting system can effectively solve the sorting problem of regular geometric work piece, and accurately calculate center and edge of geometric work piece to achieve the sorting purpose.

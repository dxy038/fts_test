Manual operation of steerable catheter is inaccurate in minimally invasive surgery and requires dexterity for efficient manipulation of the catheter meanwhile exposes surgeons to intense radiation. In this paper, our objective is to develop a remote control system that replaces the manipulation of surgeons with high accuracy and precision. The system identification for nonlinear discrete time is presented by NARX (Nonlinear ARX) method. Input force signal and output displacement signal have been measured experimentally as the reference item to identify the system dynamic equation by using Matlab toolbox. After analyzed and compared with 3 kinds of typical system mathematical model, the dynamic characteristic of system was shown that the system could be locally described in terms of a suitable NARX model and it guarantees local stability and robust.

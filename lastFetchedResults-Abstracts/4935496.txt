This study proposes a novel time frequency code (TFC) scheme for a bidirectional multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) ultra-wideband (UWB) wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) access network. The network can avoid the interference by using different TFCs under bidirectional transmission in the same wavelength. By the way, Fabry-Perot laser diodes and multi mode fibers are adopted in the access ring due to cost down and increase number of optical network units (ONUs). Moreover, we set up an experimental system to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can indeed provide many advantages of very low-cost, simple structure and reducing wavelength usage for practically bidirectional high-speed wireless MB-OFDM UWB WDM access networks.

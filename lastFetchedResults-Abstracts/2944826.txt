The problem of damping of forced oscillations is of great practical importance. Many methods have been developed for reduction of complete damping of the forced oscillations. We consider a mathematical version of this problem. The objective of the paper is to find the set of physically realisable stabilizing regulators which satisfy certain conditions, any harmonic disturbance of which is in a given form, and which do not depend on certain initial conditions and complex vector amplitudes

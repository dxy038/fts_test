Increase in the demand for ethanol has resulted in growth in the dry grind (DG) ethanol industry. In DG processing, the whole
corn kernel is fermented, resulting in two main coproducts, ethanol and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Marketing of
DDGS is critical to the economic stability of DG plants. The composition of DDGS can vary considerably; this reduces market
value. Factors that cause variation in composition need to be evaluated. The objective was to determine the relationship between
composition of corn and composition of DDGS. Samples of corn and DDGS were obtained from a DG ethanol plant and analyzed
for protein, fat, starch and other nutrients. Concentrations of protein, fiber and starch were similar to published data for corn but
were higher for DDGS. Coefficients of variation for protein fat and fiber concentrations were similar for corn and DDGS. There
were no significant correlations between concentrations of components in corn and those in DDGS. Variation in the composition of
DDGS was not related to variation in corn composition and probably was due to variation in processing streams or processing
techniques. This implies that reducing the variation in composition of DDG will require modification of processing strategies

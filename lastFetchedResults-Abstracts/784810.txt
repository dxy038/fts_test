vitamin D insufficiency is common in elderly adults, and leads to secondary
hyperparathyroidism, bone loss, muscle weakness, and osteoporotic fractures. objective: to evaluate the relation
between vitamin D nutritional status and muscle function and muscle strength in women aged over 65 years.
Methods: Fifty-four postmenopausal women from Buenos aires (latitude 34° S), average age (X±DS) 71±4, were
included in the study. Determinations of serum calcium, phosphate, 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25oHD), intact
parathormone (iPtH) and calciuria / creatininuria ratio in 24-hour urine samples were performed. Muscle
function was assessed by means of walking-speed test, standing balance, and sit-to-stand tests. lower extremity
muscle strength was determined using a manual dynamometer. Results: 25oHD levels ≥20ng/ml were found to
be associated with better lower extremity muscle function and strength. Forty- six % of participants had 25oHD
levels ≥20ng/ml. Women with 25oHD levels ≥20ng/ml scored higher on the muscle function tests (11.2±0.9
vs.10.0±2.1; p<0.003) and had stronger knee extensor (13.4±2.7 vs.11.6±2.5 Kg.; p<0.03) and hip abductor
(8.3±2.7 vs. 7.3±3.1 Kg; p<0.04) muscles; strength of their hip flexors tended to be higher but did not reach
significantly different values (17.0±3.3 vs. 15.4±2.8 Kg.; 0.1>p>0.05). Negative correlation was observed
between iPtH and muscle function (r= -0.436; p<0.02). Conclusion: 25oHD levels ≥20ng/ml are needed for a
better muscle function and strength. assessing vitamin D nutritional status in adults aged ≥ 65 years would allow
correcting hypovitaminosis D and improve muscle function and strength

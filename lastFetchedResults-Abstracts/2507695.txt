Objective: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of non-coding RNAs which play key roles in
post-transcriptional gene regulation. Previous studies indicate that miRNAs are dysregulated
in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells are two
subsets of CD4+ T-cells which have critical functions in the onset and progression of MS.
The current study seeks to distinguish fluctuations in expression of CD4+ T-cell derived
miR-223 during the relapsing-remitting (RR) phase of MS (RR-MS), as well as the expressions
of Th17 and Treg cell markers.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study used real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to evaluate CD4+ T cell derived miR-223 expression patterns
in patients that experienced either of the RR-MS phases (n=40) compared to healthy controls
(n=12), along with RNA markers for Th17 and Treg cells. We conducted flow cytometry
analyses of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and RAR-related orphan receptor ?t (ROR?t) in
CD4+ T-cells. Putative and validated targets of miR-223 were investigated in the miRWalk
and miRTarBase databases, respectively.
Results: miR-223 significantly upregulated in CD4+ T-cells during the relapsing phase of
RR-MS compared to the remitting phase (P=0.000) and healthy individuals (P=0.036).
Expression of ROR?t, a master transcription factor of Th17, upregulated in the relapsing
phase, whereas FOXP3 upregulated in the remitting phase. Additionally, potential
targets of miR-223, STAT1, FORKHEAD BOX O (FOXO1) and FOXO3 were predicted
by in silico studies.
Conclusion: miR-223 may have a potential role in MS progression. Therefore, suppression
of miR-223 can be proposed as an appropriate approach to control progression
of the relapsing phase of MS.

This work study the symbol phase synchronizer of closed loop. This synchronizer have all its components inside of the loop, for this reason is called closed loop.We will study this synchronizer considering four topologies namely the analog, the hybrid, the combinational and the sequential.The objective is to study the four synchronizers and to evaluate their output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio).

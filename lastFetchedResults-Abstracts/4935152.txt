The objective of this paper to demonstrate the validity of a new concept in dynamic stability enhancement of a synchronous generator connected to the grid via an AC transmission line, using a small power parallel DC link. Superior ability of rapid modulation of power in a DC transmission line is used to damp the oscillations in order to enhance the stability as well as to increase the power transfer capability. A Matlab-Simulink model was developed to compare the dynamic responses of the system with and without the proposed DC damping scheme. The simulations revealed that the use of a small DC link would greatly enhance the dynamic stability and power transfer capability of the AC line alone.

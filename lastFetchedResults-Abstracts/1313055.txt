Soil particle deposition and/or chemical precipitation can reduce the permeability of drain envelopes and filters. The first step in recognizing clogging phenomena is the identification of the nature of the precipitating materials. Calcium carbonate is a substance of low solubility that precipitates rapidly, forming a hard pan layer in the soil and/or clogging drain envelopes. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the precipitation risk of calcium carbonate in agricultural drain envelopes in the Khuzestan province of Iran. In this study, three indicators namely Ryznar, Langelier and Stiff-Davis indices were employed to assess the precipitation risk of calcium carbonate in agricultural drainage water. Results showed that all agricultural drainage systems in the study area give evidence of a potential risk of calcium carbonate precipitation, but the severity of the problem is different. The results also showed that the Ryznar and Stiff-Davis indices provide a better estimation of the potential precipitation risk of calcium carbonate than the Langelier index. Analyses of soil samples and drain envelopes from a drainage system, installed in the Abadan palm grove, showed that the main chemical component was calcium carbonate.

We consider the optimal mirror allocation problems for the purpose of load balance in network servers. We focus on constructing high-reliability networks, and propose the optimal mirror allocation model such that the system reliability is maximized subject to costs and delays, in view of the trading-off relationship between the reliability and cost. This optimization model is capable of dealing with various kinds of network topology. We formulate this optimization problem as a 0-1 integer programming in this model, and we can find the place where each mirror server should be and the concrete assignment of files to mirror servers. Our objective is to find the optimal mirror allocation by solving this model, and to show the general characteristics about the load balance and the improvement of the system reliability by the distributed mirror allocation, quantitatively

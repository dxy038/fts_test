This paper contains a summary of a significant amount of findings carried out collectively by a global research community specifically aimed at determining mutually beneficial and hot topics for international collaboration on the research and development of Trustworthy ICT. The paper highlights a sampling of these topics that were deemed to produce the most impact and it provides an introduction to the final recommendations of the INCO-Trust project, which was the main catalyst behind this initiative. The paper doesnÂ´t cover the extensive platforms, mechanisms, and systematic consensus building process in working groups based on workshops organised by the project to achieve its goals but instead focuses on the outcomes of the project. The key recommendations of the project will be used as a starting point for the recently start BIC project, whose objective is to include a number of new countries (Brazil, India and South Africa) into this already formed global community of ICT Trust and security researchers.

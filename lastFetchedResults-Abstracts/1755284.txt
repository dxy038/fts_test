Objective
jective of this study was to examine the predictors of fatigue 6 and 12 months after surgical treatment in women with early-stage breast cancer (BC group) and in women with benign breast problems (BBP group) in a prospective follow-up study.
s
entered the study prior to diagnosis and completed questionnaires on personality factors, psychological factors, and social support. Fatigue was assessed 6 and 12 months after diagnosis (BBP group) or surgical treatment (BC group). Clinical data were taken from medical records.
s
 BC group (n=117), fatigue at 6 months was predicted by trait anxiety (P&lt;.001) and extraversion (P&lt;.05). Trait anxiety (P&lt;.05), extraversion (P&lt;.05), and depressive symptoms (P&lt;.05) predicted fatigue at 12 months. In the BBP group (n=190), the predictors were trait anxiety (P&lt;.001) for fatigue at 6 months, and trait anxiety (P&lt;.001) and neuroticism (P&lt;.01) for fatigue at 12 months.
sion
atients who are already fatigued before diagnosis remain tired regardless of diagnosis. Trait anxiety is strongly related to fatigue in both groups.

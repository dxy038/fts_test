The present study was conducted to estimate sub-threshold stimulus intensities that can influence the body in performing an objective measurement for individual thresholds of somatosensory stimuli from outside based on brain responses. In order to investigate the relation between brain response and somatosensory stimulation, a hypothesis was set up that sub-threshold stimulus to cause significant postural balance by applying to tibialis anterior tendons would exist between thresholds of the fingers and the tibialis anterior tendons. The experiment was conducted with the somatosensory stimulus and brain wave analysis systems, five male adults were involved. The three kinds of somatosensory stimulation (200 Hz, 250 Hz and 300 Hz) were used, those stimulation was applied to the tibialis anterior tendon of the subjects, and their brain waves were measured at the same time. As a result, we can confirm that fingers were more sensitive to somatosensory stimuli than tibialis anterior tendons and the frequency of somatosensory stimuli and sensitivity to somatosensory stimuli have an inverse correlation. Also, sub-threshold stimulus may derive a significant response from the body.

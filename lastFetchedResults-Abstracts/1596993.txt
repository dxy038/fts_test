This paper presents the analysis of the optimal production control and corrective maintenance planning problem for a failure prone manufacturing system consisting of several identical machines. Machines are subject to breakdowns and repairs and can produce several parts of products. At any given time, each machine can only produce one type of product. The introduction of the corrective maintenance will increase the availability of the production system which guarantees the improvement of the system's productivity if the production planning is well done. The decision variables are the production and the machine repair rates which influence the inventory levels and the system capacity, respectively. The objective of the work is to minimize the cost of surplus and repair activities. A computational algorithm, based on numerical methods, is given for solving the optimal control problem. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach and extensions to more complex manufacturing systems are discussed.

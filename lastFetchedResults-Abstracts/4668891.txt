In this paper, we propose a new sensitivity based, statistical gate sizing method. Since circuit optimization effects the entire shape of the circuit delay distribution, it is difficult to capture the quality of a distribution with a single metric. Hence, we first introduce a new objective function that provides an effective measure for the quality of a delay distribution for both ASIC and high performance designs. We then propose an efficient and exact sensitivity based pruning algorithm based on a newly proposed theory of perturbation bounds. A heuristic approach for sensitivity computation which relies on efficient computation of statistical slack is then introduced. Finally, we show how the pruning and statistical slack based approaches can be combined to obtain nearly identical results compared with the brute-force approach but with an average run-time improvement of up to 89&#215;. We also compare the optimization results against that of a deterministic optimizer and show an improvement up to 16% in the 99-percentile circuit delay and up to 31% in the standard deviation for the same circuit area.

The objective of this research is to explore the facilitating role of organization network and ontology in identifying cross-border technology entrepreneurial opportunities to pursue innovations that achieve value creation. Based on a series of case studies of the integrated circuit (IC) design knowledge service industries, we explore the importance of entrepreneurial opportunities and organization boundary spanning in the dynamic process of international entrepreneurial (IE) activities. Previous IE studies have largely been characterized as static, cross-sectional, production sector-oriented and a lack of service sector and/or comparative research. As a result, the characteristics related to the emerging knowledge service sectors, the longitudinal aspects and cross-sector comparisons have largely been unexplored. Prior work in the IE tradition stressed mostly on the judgment-based or purposive sampling also means that the results are difficult to generalize. There is a major gap in providing rich perspective from multiple informants involved in technology entrepreneurial processes. Through the case studies of several IC design service providers, this research expects to clarify the dynamic transformation process of opportunity and value creation. Specifically, the issue of how the process is supported by the richness and the dynamically integrative effects of the various organization ontological elements is explored with a comparative study of the cross-border cases. Based on the theoretical and empirical findings, the implications will then be drawn out for strategic management of cross-border knowledge service and the associated business policy and practice

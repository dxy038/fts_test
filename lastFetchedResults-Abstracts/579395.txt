In this paper a new approach for finding optimal path planning in a plane with
stationary obstacles is discussed. At first, we consider a movable rigid object in a plane with
stationary obstacles. The goal is to find the shortest path planning which brings rigid object
from a given initial point to a given final point such that the length of path be minimized and
distance between object and obstacles be maximized. By considering the length of path and the
distance between rigid object with obstacles as objective functions, we obtain a multi-objective
problem. Because of the imprecise nature of decision maker's judgment, these multiple
objectives are viewed as fuzzy variables. Then we determine intervals for the value of objective
functions such that these intervals for the distance between rigid object and obstacles are
given by decision maker, and for the length of path is achieved by solving two optimal nonlinear

problems (ONP). Now, we define a decreasing or increasing membership function for
any objective functions on achieved intervals. Then the optimal   
policy is to find an optimal path which maximize all of membership functions, simultaneously.
After a little calculation, we obtain an ONP. By solving this ONP, a (local) Pareto optimal
solution for original goal is attained. Numerical example is also given.

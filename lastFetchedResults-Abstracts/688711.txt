Domestication of wild plants needs efforts focused particularly on the development of the theoretical basis of plant responses to environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of radiation on seedling growth and physiology of Prosopis alba, P. chilensis, P. flexuosa and P. glandulosa. Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse and randomly assigned to three light environments: full-sun, 52% sun, and 38% sun. No significant differences were found in the rate of leaf appearance and plant height 60 days after the light treatments began. Instantaneous CO2uptake was not affected by the light environment during leaf development and did not differ among species. Variations in radiation availability resulted in significant differences in biomass accumulation, shoot/root ratio, protein and total non-structural carbohydrates contents. The practice of shading seedlings reduces the chances of survival ofProsopis due to an increase of the shoot/root ratio and a reduction of total biomass, stored carbohydrates, and the C:N balance.

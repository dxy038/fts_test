Dyes belong to organic compound families with complex structure due to their toxicity, carcinogenic and lack of biodegradability properties' are considered as a serious environmental pollutant. The objective of this paper is to investigate decolorization of Reactive Blue 19 from contaminated water by potassium peroxydisulfate and solar light in the presence of solar parabolic concentrator. Solar irradiation intensity will be increased. In this case radiation after reflecting will be concentrated on the focal path of collector. The more light intensity, the more enhancement production of sulfate radical from persulfate would be. In this study evaluation of effective parameter has been investigated. Regards to the results from homogenous photo-oxidation in presence of solar concentrator has been introduced and considered as a superior option for removal of dyes from textile' industry wastewater. Using this collector dramatically increase the performance of advanced oxidation processes respects 98% of RB19 has been mineralized during 60 min in optimal condition.

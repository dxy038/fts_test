OBJECTIVE: We set out to evaluate the prognostic factors in cervical adenocarcinoma metastatic to lymph nodes. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective review of 40 patients with cervical adenocarcinoma and lymph node metastasis from 1976 to 1996. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients had adenocarcinoma, and six had adenosquamous carcinoma. Median survival was 50 months. The median survival for patients with stage I disease was 69 months. Stage at diagnosis, treatment with radical hysterectomy, and receiving adjuvant therapy were associated with prolonged survival. A trend toward improved survival was noted with the use of concurrent radiation and chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Adenocarcinoma metastatic to the lymph nodes does not have a uniformly poor prognosis, especially with early-stage disease. Improved survival was observed with the use of adjuvant therapy, specifically the use of combined chemotherapy and radiation after radical hysterectomy. The optimal therapy in this setting is yet to be determined. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:1131-7.)

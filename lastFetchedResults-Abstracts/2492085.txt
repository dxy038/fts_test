Facility layout plays a vital role in the productivity of manufacturing systems. In the
factories that have high complexly process, the flows between workstations and equipment
should be declined because it increases rudiment costs and reduces the productivity. In
this article, a model with 7processes is investigated and the facility layout for this model is
determined based on the sequences between equipment, machines and workstation. This
model is solved by relationship process method. Then, the process flow diagram is
clarified. In this model, the relationship between processes and equipment is the main
input that should be considered for facility layout. This model contains “m” parallel
machines and “n” jobs. Minimizing the work flow time is the purpose of solving this
model. Finally, the layout and jobs sequences are evaluated by objective matrix method. In
this part, their indexes are determined based on the results that are calculated.

It is shown by Park et al. (see IEEE Milcom Â´92, p.21, 1992) that the proposed routing algorithm using the minimum first-derivative length (MFDL) path exhibits the blocking probability performance of a circuit-switched tactical network. But in hybrid switching networks the proper choice of routing discipline is very much dependent on the performance objective. We investigate the interactions among four different classes of heterogeneous traffic and routing strategies to divide trunk bandwidth between circuit switching and packet switching traffic in a military tactical communication network

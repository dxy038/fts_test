A joint conference of representatives of government committees and ranking industrial standardization groups from Great Britain, Canada, and the United States are scheduled to meet within the next three months to finalize agreements on common standards for screw threads used on most types of threaded fasteners, including bolts and nuts. The attainment of such standards is important to commerce and industry. It is planned to hold this conference at the National Bureau of Standards, which has actively co-operated in the attainment of this objective over a period of many years. These agreements will not be in the form of a treaty, but will be based on separate documents, each of which is sponsored by the standardization group or groups of each of the countries concerned. These documents, setting forth the Unified Screw Thread Standard, will be in agreement on all fundamental points relating to the standard, but may differ in minor details and will differ in arrangement and general makeup. The purposes of the joint conference are to assure that there is complete agreement on all fundamentals and to celebrate the attainment of such agreement after many years of negotiations.

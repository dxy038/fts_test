Background Most needs of outpatients
with schizophrenia are met by the family. This could
cause high levels of family burden. The objective of
this study is to assess the relationship between the
patients’ needs and other clinical and disability variables
and the level of family burden. Method A total
sample of 231 randomly selected outpatients with
schizophrenia was evaluated with the Camberwell
Assessment of Needs, Positive and Negative Syndrome
Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning and Disability
Assessment Scale. A total of 147 caregivers also
answered the objective and subjective family burden
questionnaire (ECFOS-II). Correlations between total
number of needs and family burden, t tests between
presence or absence of need for each domain of family
burden and regression models between family burden
and needs, symptoms, disability and sociodemographic
variables were computed. Results The number
of patients’ needs was correlated with higher levels
of family burden in daily life activities, disrupted
behaviour and impact on caregiver’s daily routine. The
patients’ needs most associated with family burden
were daytime activities, drugs, benefits, self-care,
alcohol, psychotic symptoms, money and looking after
home. In a regression model, a higher number of
needs, higher levels of psychopathology and disability,
being male and older accounted for higher levels of
family burden. Conclusion Patients with schizophrenia
with more needs cause greater family burden but
not more subjective concerns in family members. The
presence of patients’ needs (daytime activities, alcohol
and drug), severity of psychotic symptoms and disability
are related to higher levels of family burden.

The practical teaching plays a very important role during the process of software engineering teaching. Traditionally, the practical teaching of software engineering is objective-oriented and usually involves only one single task towards the finally aim. This paper presents the task-driven method and its process framework for the practical teaching of software engineering. Students learn concepts, theorems and methods during the process of finishing multiple and related tasks and in the exploration of corresponding approaches when conducting software projects. The real case led by university teachers and engineers from Alibaba.com has shown that students are more likely to be engaged while being driven by such multiple organized tasks.

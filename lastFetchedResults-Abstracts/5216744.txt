Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) has already been the main multiple access technology for 3G long term evolution(LTE) and 4G. This paper analyzes characteristics of OFDMA multiple access technology and puts forward a new OFDMA handover algorithm (sub-carriers bidirectional arrayed handover algorithm, SBA). The simulation results show that, during handover process, SBA algorithm proposed in this paper guarantees users in OFDMA system keeping the best channel SIR and QoS. Moreover, SBA algorithm decreases the extra consumption of the handover, and improves OFDMA system performance.

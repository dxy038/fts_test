In this paper we present a mathematical modeling of Radio Resource Management (RRM) for multicast service diffusion based on Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) standard. In this model, a flexible allocation approach named F2R2M is proposed, combining three candidate transport channels with scalable video transmission technology. The allocation procedure is implemented based on simulated annealing algorithm with a two- dimensional optimization objective and lexicographic order evaluation criteria. Experiments prove that, comparing with existing channel allocation approaches, F2R2M obtains allocation solution with equal QoS and lower transmission power consumption. Moreover, it reduces the possibility of achieving saturation of power or channelization codes when simulation scenarios have more users and heavy traffic load.

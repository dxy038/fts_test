The need of fast and reliable models for CMOS gates has grown in importance not only for the simulation of digital VLSI circuits, but also for their optimization. In a library based design the optimum of speed is a basic step to achieve high performance, but also power consumption must be considered with increasing care. A simultaneous power-delay evaluation can be performed using a new model developed for sub-micron CMOS technologies, allowing better multi-objective optimization

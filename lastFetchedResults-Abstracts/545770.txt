Objective
Hemiconvulsion-Hemiplegia-Epilepsy syndrome (HHE) is an initial phase 
of unilateral or predominantly unilateral convulsive seizures usually of long 
duration, with a second phase of hemiplegia (usually permanent), immediately 
following the hemiconvulsions;and then a third stage, characterized by the 
appearance of partial epileptic seizures. The causes of the initial convulsions in 
HHE syndrome are multiple but in many patients no cause in obvious.
Neuroimaging studies demonstrate an acquired atrophy, that often is preceded 
by swelling and edema of the hemisphere. Here we report a case of 18 month- 
old boy, with an initial phase of repeated episodes of partial seizures, followed 
by hemiparesis and epileptic seizures, with one episode of generalized 
convulsive  status epilepticus . Minor head trauma was the  trigger factor  of the 
initial attack. Brain neuroimaging showed generalized atrophy , that was more 
prominent in the left hemisphere.

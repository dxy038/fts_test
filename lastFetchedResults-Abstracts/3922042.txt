In this work a dynamic control allocation approach is presented for an automotive vehicle yaw stabilization scheme. The stabilization strategy consists of a high level module that deals with the vehicle motion control objective (yaw rate reference generation and tracking), a low level module that handles the braking control for each wheel (longitudinal slip control and maximal tire-road friction parameter estimation), and an intermediate level dynamic control allocation module that generates the longitudinal slip reference for the low level brake control module and commands front wheel steering angle corrections. The control allocation design is such that the actual torque about the yaw axis tends to the desired torque calculated form the high level module, with desirable distribution of control forces satisfying actuator constraints and minimal control effort objectives. Conditions for uniform asymptotic stability are given for the case when the control allocation includes adaptation of the tire-road maximal friction coefficients, and the scheme has been implemented in a realistic non linear multi body vehicle simulation environment. The simulation cases show that the yaw control allocation strategy stabilizes the vehicle in extreme maneuvers where the non linear vehicle yaw dynamics otherwise (without active braking or active steering) becomes unstable in the sense of over- or under steering. The control allocation implementation is efficient and suitable for low cost automotive electronic control units.

This paper presents a method for determination of the optimal location and sizing of Distributed Generation (DG) in radial distribution network using Ant Colony Search (ACS). The objective is to reduce the overall line losses of the network. The method is tested using two standard test feeders. The results show that the method works effectively and can further be applied to the real system.

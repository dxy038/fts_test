This paper presents results on the modeling and control for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) kind quadrotor transporting a cable-suspended payload. The mathematical model is based on Euler-Lagrange formulation, where the integrated dynamics of the quadrotor, cable and payload are considered. An Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity - Based Control (IDA-PBC) for a quadrotor UAV transporting a cable-suspended payload is designed. The control objective is to transport the payload from point to point transfer with swing suppression along trajectory. The cable is considered rigid. Numerical simulations are carried out to validate the overall control approach.

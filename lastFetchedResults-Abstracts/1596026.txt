In this paper, a dynamic transportation model with multiple criteria and multiple constraints levels (DMC2) is formulated by using the framework of MC2 linear programming. An algorithm is developed to solve such DMC2 transportation problems. In this algorithm, dynamic programming ideology is adopted to find the optimal subpolicies and optimal policy for a given DMC2 transportation problem. Then the MC2-simplex method is applied to locate the set of all potential solutions over possible changes of the objective coefficient parameter and the supply and demand parameter for the DMC2 transportation problem. A numerical example is illustrated to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm in solving the DMC2 transportation problems.

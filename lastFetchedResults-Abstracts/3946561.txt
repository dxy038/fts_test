A new type of multi-port isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed in this study. In the proposed converter, transfer of power takes place through addition of magnetomotive forces generated by multiple windings on a common transformer core. This eliminates the need for a centralised storage capacitor to interface all the ports. Hence, the requirement of an additional power transfer stage from the centralised capacitor can also be eliminated. The converter can be used for a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) system. A pulse width modulation (PWM) strategy for controlling simultaneous power flow in the MIMO converter is also proposed. The proposed PWM scheme works in the discontinuous conduction mode. The leakage inductance can be chosen to aid power transfer. By using the proposed converter topology and PWM scheme, the need to compute power flow equations to determine the magnitude and direction of power flow between ports is alleviated. Instead, a simple controller structure based on average current control can be used to control the power flow. This study discusses the operating phases of the proposed multi-port converter along with its PWM scheme, the design process for each of the ports and finally experimental waveforms that validate the multi-port scheme.

The main objective of this research work is to propose a new method of communication adapted to sensor networks for both one-to-many and many-to-one topologies. This type of networks is characterized by its price, its size and its energy consumption. In the last few years, several recent developments concern these networks but rare of them propose a complete and functional architecture. The challenge of this work consists in proposing a new architecture for impulse communication based on the wavelet transform for both generation of pulses and detection of the information. This architecture is adapted to the low throughput short-range applications and is scalable according to the type of use but also the number of sensors.

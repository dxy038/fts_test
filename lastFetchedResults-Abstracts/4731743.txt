A decision-making problem is the process of finding the best option from all of the feasible alternatives. To some extent, the decision-makers usually are more confident making linguistic judgments than crisp value judgments. The aim of this paper is to extend the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution(TOPSIS) method to decision-making problems with the triangular fuzzy function. In this paper the triangular fuzzy function is introduced into the multi-objective decision making(MODM) problem under uncertainty and the fuzzy TOPSIS approach is proposed to solve the MODM problem with subjective linguistic variables. First the triangular fuzzy numbers are used to describe the degree of importance and the attribute value. Then it gives the general steps of solving the MODM problem through the fuzzy TOPSIS approach. Finally, a case study is used to illustrate the procedure of the proposed approach at the end of the paper. With this approach, we provide decision-makers more information to make more powerful decision.

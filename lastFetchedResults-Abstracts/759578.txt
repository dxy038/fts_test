This study was a prospective 2-year longitudinal
investigation of associations between negative maternal
parenting and disruptive child behavior across the preschool
to school transition. Our main goals were to 1) determine the
direction of association between early maternal negativity
and child disruptive behaviors across this important developmental
transition and 2) examine whether there would be
different patterns of associations for boys and girls.
Participants were 235 children (111 girls; T1; M=
37.7 months, T2; M=63.4 months) and their mothers and
teachers. Observational and multi-informant ratings of child
disruptive behavior showed differential patterns of stability
and associations with measures of parenting risk. Results
indicated bidirectional and interactive contributions of
externalizing behavior and negative parenting across time.
Results also indicated that risk mechanisms operate similarly
for both sexes. Findings support transactional models of
disruptive child behavior that highlight the joint contributions
of parents and children

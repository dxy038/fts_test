Plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are becoming more popular. The batteries of these plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles can act as storage and participate in various electricity markets. In this paper, optimal allocation of parking lots providing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) power for loss reduction is studied. The objective function containing active and reactive power indices is minimized using genetic algorithm. Power flow is done utilizing backward-forward sweep method. Finally, simulation is carried out on a 30 bus test system. Also, the effect of variation both in the number of vehicles in parking lot and the battery charge rate on the simulation results is investigated.

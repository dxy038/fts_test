The objective of this paper is to propose an intelligent information quality assurance (IQA) system using configurable event-driven process chain (C-EPC) simulation based analysis, which is capable to monitor network status, evaluate IQ, generate assuring strategies, and apply it to the network. To do this, we have employed the C-EPC formalism concept based on the advanced modeling and simulation environment for developing information security models and simulation-based evaluation of IQ as well as assuring strategy. Our approach differs from others in that a) it is able to analyze IQ on node, link, and network in quantitative manner, b) it can generate and apply assuring strategies automatically, and c) it supports a coherent design concept for intelligent IQA system. A case study performed on a test bed will illustrate our techniques and demonstrate effectiveness of propose system.

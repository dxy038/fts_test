The principle objective of this paper is to develop comprehensive models of on-site energy system components. This should facilitate reliable and optimal operation management of these systems in real-time. In practice management of these systems is mainly dependent on fixed operation planning of the integrated components. However the presence of multiple components, dynamic constraints and intermittent resources pose a dynamic and complex problem where the existing management schemes cannot lead to optimal practices at the utilisation stage. Consequently the value of a real-time management scheme that can guarantee system reliability, unit commitment, and optimal operational objectives is identified. However there is a lack of research on relevant modelling approaches of on-site energy system components to address real-time application requirements. To fulfill these gaps, we have proposed a reactive state-based modelling of potential components and associated model development methodology. This should enable models to encompass operational behavior of individual components and their aggregation as a system in a more reliable and applicable manner. Finally, reactive models of an existing manufacturing plantÂ´s energy system components are developed and validated as a case study. The results illustrate potential of proposed modelling approach in comparison with existing ones to be applied in real-time.

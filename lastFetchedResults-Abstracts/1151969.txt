This study shows the process design and forming analysis of a permalloy shielding can (PSC) that supports cross-coil movement (CCM) structurally and enables CCM gained by an electro magnetic property to indicate accurate information of a car. This study is particularly important, since the magnetic properties such as coercivity and permeability are quite sensitive to the strain and thickness of a PSC. The objective functions are strain and thickness deviation. The punch radius, die radius and blank holding force are considered as design parameters. An orthogonal array (OA) table and characteristics are applied to the neural network (NN) as training data. After training, the optimal and robust design parameters are selected. This study shows the correlation between the design methodology of NN and the statistical design of experiments (DOE) approach.

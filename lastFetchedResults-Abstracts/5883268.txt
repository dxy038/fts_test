This paper focuses on the power supply of a short primary linear drive used in automated handling applications. The vehicle is fed by a contactless energy transfer and an ultracapacitor bank, which provides the peak power during transient conditions. The ultracapacitor is used to improve the peak power and reduce the size of the contactless energy transfer. A bidirectional DC-DC converter is utilized to interfacing the ultracapacitor bank with the contactless energy transfer, making sure that the ultracapacitor bank can store the braking energy and supply the demanded peak power. The experimental results show that the systemÂ´s management is suitable for supplying the vehicle travelling on different passive track types.

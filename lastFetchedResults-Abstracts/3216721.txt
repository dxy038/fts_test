Intelligent systems deliver meaningful information of patient´s physiological data and provide essential decision support, on patient´s status, to medical professionals. This study focuses on two important areas of healthcare; real-time remote patient monitoring and decision support systems for diagnosing of Hypertension and Hypotension. The proposed real-time, wireless vital sign monitoring system with two-way audio/video conferencing enables medical professionals to provide much enhanced healthcare when compared to the traditional methods. Moreover, the development of a universal diagnostic module for early warning/alert of two physiological disorders (events) including Hypertension and Hypotension will be presented. The proposed system will be tested in real-time hospital environment while the simulation/offline result shows the system has achieved acceptable accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and predictability.

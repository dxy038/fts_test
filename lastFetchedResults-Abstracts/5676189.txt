In many cases, the values of qualitative QoS criteria are often imprecisely defined or acquired. Moreover, it is also not easy to accurately quantify the weight of each QoS criterion since human judgments including preference are often vague. In this paper, the decision making problem has been modeled as hybrid multiple criteria decision making (FMCDM). The linguistic QoS criteria is transformed to fuzzy numbers, and then we use COWA operator to turn interval numbers and fuzzy numbers into precise numbers. A optimization method with adjustability is proposed to seek subjective weight, then objective weight based on improved entropy model and subjective weight are integrated into synthetic weight linearly, the candidate services are ranking according to the membership of gray incidence degree. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the developed method.

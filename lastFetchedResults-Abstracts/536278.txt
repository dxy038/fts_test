The objective of this paper is to develop a Fuzzy Rule-Base Based Intrusion Detection System on Application Layer which works in the application layer of the network stack. It consists of semantic IDS and Fuzzy based IDS. Rule based IDS looks for the specific pattern which is defined as malicious. A non-intrusive regular pattern can be malicious if it occurs several times with a short time interval. At application layer, HTTP traffic’s header and payload are analyzed for possible intrusion. In the proposed misuse detection module, the semantic intrusion detection system works on the basis of rules that define various application layer misuses that are found in the network. An attack identified by the IDS is based on a corresponding rule in the rule-base. An event that doesn’t make a ‘hit’ on the rule-base is given to a Fuzzy Intrusion Detection System (FIDS) for further analysis. In a Rule-based intrusion detection system, an attack can either be detected if a rule is found in the rule base or goes undetected if not found. If this is combined with FIDS, the intrusions went undetected by RIDS can further be detected. These non-intrusive patterns are checked by the fuzzy IDS for a possible attack. The non-intrusive patterns are normalized and converted as linguistic variable in fuzzy sets. These values are given to Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM). If there is any suspicious event, then it generates an alarm to the client/server. Results show better performance in terms of the detection rate and the time taken to detect. The detection rate is increased with reduction in false positive rate for a specific attack.

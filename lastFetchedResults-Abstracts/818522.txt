To achieve mentioned objective, we have examined some information as performance evaluation measures including assets, debits, sales, financial leverage ratio, internal rate of returns and the errors which would occur in the prediction of absolute earnings in the increasing capital reporting from 1386 to 1388.
The correlation analysis with linear regression and test variance analysis have been used as the statistical method and the gathered data has been analyzed via the SPSS software. On top pf that, rationality of the regression equation and its coefficients were investigated respectively with F and T tests.
The results reveal a significant relation between the errors which would occur in the prediction of absolute earnings in the increasing capital reporting and financial position of the companies, internal rate of returns, the industry type, the reports type (financing for working capital or financing for development plans).

This work deals with protection of thirty bus system using Solid State Circuit Breaker. The Solid State Circuit Breakers (SSCBs) based on high power semiconductors, offer considerable advantages when compared to mechanical circuit breakers with respect to speed and life. The distortions caused by the three phase short circuit can be reduced to 100 &#956;s, in contrast to 100 ms achieved by the present technology. The Solid State Circuit Breaker uses high power anti parallel switches to carry bidirectional current. During normal operation the solid state circuit breaker is "on". During faults, the gate of the SSCB is pulse modulated to prevent the circuit current from exceeding a predetermined limit. The load voltage is sensed and it is used to turn on and turn off the SSCB. The thirty bus system with SSCB is modeled and simulated using Matlab/Simulink. The circuit model and results of simulation for thirty bus system employing SSCB are presented in this paper. Simulations demonstrate that the protection circuit provides a fast and maintenance free protection solution for multi bus system.

This paper is an empirical study that aims to characterize the similarities/differences among existing biomedical engineering curricula in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The work is based on an earlier study entitled &#8220;Project Alexander the Great&#8221; that identifies 29 institutions of higher learning within this region, offering degree programs or options in Biomedical Engineering. The objective is to evaluate the curricula of the identified institutions as to their adherence to three major curriculum philosophies: i) VaNTH-ERC (Vanderbilt-Northwestern-Texas-Harvard/MIT Engineering Research Center) Education Mission for Bioengineering and Educational Technologies, ii) Whitaker Curriculum Philosophy, and iii) Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology Curriculum Philosophy-ABET EC2000. The obtained results reveal that these programs are, to a certain degree, compliant with the requirements of the abovementioned philosophies. As such, the MENA region is witnessing a healthy academic growth and interest in the Biomedical Engineering field. The paper concludes with a referral to a different study by Abu-Faraj that provides a collection of recommendations and strategies to be implemented by entities which are planning to introduce state-of-the-art curricula in this vital field within the MENA region.

As a distributed generation system increases, a stable power supply becomes difficult. Thus control of power leveling (PL) unit is required to maintain the balance of power flow for irregular power generation. The unit is required to respond to change of voltage and bidirectional power flow. So the bidirectional buck/boost DC/DC converter is applied for the control of PL unit in this research. The PL unit with Electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) is able to absorb change of power, and it is examined whether the stable power supply is possible. The output current of PL unit is controlled so as to keep power balance and DC bus voltage. The effectiveness of the deadbeat control for power leveling unit is proved in simulation and experiment.

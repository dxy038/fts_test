Backgrounds and Objectives: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential effect of environmental exposure to toxic metal (cadmium) on pregnancy outcome and fetal growth. Materials and Methods: 330 normal pregnant women were randomly selected from vali-e-asr hospital, from July 2003 through Feb. 2005. Cadmium was measured in umbilical cord blood and mother whole blood of postpartum women without occupational exposure to metals in Tehran, Iran, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry

Result: Whole blood cadmium and cord blood cadmium ranged from 0/00 to 6/30 Mg/L ,respectivly. in the group higher level of maternal blood cadmium (> 0.40 Mg/L) 1cm decrease was seen in neonatal birth height, (p = 0.007)

There was a significant association between cadmium exposure and birth weight. Mann-whitney test showed that, maternal blood cadmium level, was significantly negatively associated with neonatal birth weight (z = -1.83, P < 0.06).

Conclusion: It was concluded that environmental exposure to cadmium significantly reduces neonatal birth height.

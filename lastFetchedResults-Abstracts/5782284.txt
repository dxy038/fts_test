This paper presents a comparative study of the performance of the bidirectional ring and the unidirectional ring multiprocessor, with emphasis on the effect of system parameters, specifically, the message length and the relative processor speed. The choice of these parameters may not be optimum due to the performance cost tradeoffs in practice. Our study shows that the use of bidirectional ring is more effective in such suboptimum system configurations and can improve the processor utilization by up to 35%

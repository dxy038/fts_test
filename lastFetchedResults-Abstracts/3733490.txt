The paper considers real time implementation of recurrent digital signal processing algorithms on an application-specific multiprocessor system. The objective is to devise a periodic, fully static task assignment for a DSP algorithm under the constraint of data sampling period by assuming interprocessor communication delay is negligible. Toward this goal, the authors propose a novel algorithm unfolding technique called the generalized perfect rate graph (GPRG). They prove that a recurrent algorithm will admit a fully static multiprocessor implementation for a given initiation interval if and only if the corresponding iterative computational dependence graph of this algorithm is a GPRG. Compared with previous results, GPRG often leads to a smaller unfolding factor &#945;<sub>GPRG</sub>

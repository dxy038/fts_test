This paper proposes a suppression of tremor effects, fluctuations caused by a userÂ´s hand, on a handheld micromanipulator by means of a robust hybrid control scheme. The proposed control scheme is a combination between an explicit model predictive control and a PID controller. The advantage of the PID controller is a robustness. It is suitable for handling the holding angle changes. The explicit model predictive control provides the excellent tracking performance. In addition, the robust hybrid control can handle tremor effects successfully. The control objective is to achieve robust tracking performance, to dampen the vibration of the mechanism and to suppress a disturbance, a tremor. The experimental results are used to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

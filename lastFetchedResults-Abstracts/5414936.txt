The modern power network is starting to face huge challenges due to the contemporary paradigms of electricity distribution such as the capability to manage energy coming from different grids as well as from Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and other Distributed Generation (DG) systems. Advanced power electronic converters can provide the means to control power flow and ensure proper and secure operation. This paper presents design and implementation of a predictive control system for a back-to-back three-phase AC-DC-AC multi-level converter employed in Universal and Flexible Power Management (UNIFLEX-PM) of electrical grids. The proposed strategy has been successfully tested for bidirectional power flow operation with different grid operating conditions such as voltage unbalance, frequency variation and harmonic distortion.

Based on model reference adaptive control theory, we design a control law for a given closed quantum system model by means of the Lyapunov stability theorem by choosing a time-varying objective function as the reference model. Meanwhile, the problems of singularities and a very large value of the control fields during the tracking are solved by using an adaptive tracking algorithm. The simulation experiments realize the tracking task from the arbitrary initial states to the time-varying objective function. Under the effect of control law, the state of control system can track from the arbitrary initial state to the state of objective system. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the control method proposed to adaptively adjust the control laws and real-time track dynamic target system.

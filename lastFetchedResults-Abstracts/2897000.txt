GenVirtual is a augmented reality musical software that allows development of activities in music therapy. This study aimed to analyze the perceptions of other health professionals about the clinical utility of GenVirtual. A secondary objective was to understand the attitudes of these professionals facing the augmented reality technology. Three focus groups composed of music therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and nurses who assist people with motor or cognitive disabilities were assigned. The quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. The outcomes showed that the view of the participants about the GenVirtual is as a tool that has great potential to be used in motor rehabilitation. The research brought new insights regarding the clinical use of GenVirtual with children, youth, adults and seniors and provided information about new features and improvements for future developments of the GenVirtual software.

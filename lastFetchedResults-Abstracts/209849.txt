Objective: It has been demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are isolated
from various tissues, have different potential in differentiation and proliferation . For
this reason it is necessary to isolate these cells from various sources in order to use them in
clinical settings. The present study has been done to investigate the possibility of isolation ,
culture and characterization of human synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
Materials and Methods: Samples (200-300 mg) were provided from synovium tissue of
patients who had knee surgery. Obtained samples were homogenized, enzymatically minced
with collagenase 0 and passed through 70 IJm nylon filters; separated cells were then cultured.
Isolated cells were identified by morphological observations , differentiation tests, flow
cytometry, immunocytochemistery studies and RT-PCR.
Results: The isolated cells in this study showed fibroblast-like morphology and have a high
proliferation capacity. In flow cytometry and immunocytochemical studies, they were positive
for CD73 and CD105 antigens. RT-PCR analysis and specific staining for differentiated cells
towards osteogenic and adipogenic lineages, showed that isolated cells were potent in differentiation
into the mentioned lineages.
Conclusion: These results suggest that synovium tissue, which is discarded in most knee
operations , can be used for cell therapy and tissue engineering protocols as an enrichment
source of potent mesenchymal stem cells.

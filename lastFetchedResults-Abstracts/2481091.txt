ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acetaminophen can induce liver damage via oxidative stress. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of fenugreek seed powder on oxidant and antioxidant factors in acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 24 male Wistar rats, weighing 250-280 g, were divided into four groups: control, normal saline+fenugreek seed powder, acetaminophen and acetaminophen+fenugreek seed powder. After 24 h of fasting, groups Normal and Normal+ Fenugreek received normal saline and groups Acetaminophen and Acetaminophen + Fenugreek received 1000 mg/kg acetaminophen by gavage. After six hours, the normal saline and acetaminophen groups received normal saline, whereas the groups receiving normal saline+fenugreek powder and acetaminophen+fenugreek powder were administered 1000 mg/kg of fenugreek seed powder via gavage. Twelve hours after the second gavage, the rats were sacrificed and liver tissues were frozen and assessed.
FINDINGS: A decline in malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide levels was observed in group acetaminophen+fenugreek, compared to the acetaminophen group (0.2608±0.03 and 1.56±0.153 vs. 6.7±0.344 and 2.38±0.104 in acetaminophen groups; p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Also, the activities of peroxidase and catalase increased in these groups, compared to the acetaminophen groups (19.07± 3.366 and 1.174±0.242 vs. 8.108 ± 2.46 and 0.614±0.089 in acetaminophen groups, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that fenugreek seeds could lead to reduced oxidative stress in acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity.

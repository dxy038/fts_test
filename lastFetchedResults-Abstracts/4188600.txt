The objective of this study is to determine whether the magnitude of a subject´s peak velocity is related to a subject´s ability to adapt to progressive lenses. Our presumption is that patients fully adapted to progressive additive lenses (PALs) are better motor learners, allowing them to modify their vergence dynamics more readily than patients who could not adapt to PALs. The experiment aims to compare the eye movement dynamic behavior from a 4deg double step stimulus which is a 4deg step followed by a subsequent 4deg step after a 200 msec delay. Eight presbyopes who wear PALs daily and seven presbyopes who could not adapt to PALs participated. The results show that presbyopes adapted to PALs have a significantly greater dynamic ratio of the first to second peak velocity from the two high velocity components stimulated from the double step. This behavior may in part be due to better motor learning abilities.

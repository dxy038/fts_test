The politically initiated energy turnaround in Germany changes the existing decision-making structures concerning the development of the power generation sector. In this context a future energy system has to fulfil the multiple criteria of the sustainability principle. In this paper we propose a multi-period, multi-objective optimization method based on a Genetic Algorithm for determining the optimal expansion planning and regionalization of power generation structures for Germany. This work considers changes in the generation side. The developed genetic operators are described in detail and novel methodical approaches are presented. Finally exemplary results are shown and evaluated.

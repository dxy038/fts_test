This paper presents a Deadbeat controller for Bidirectional High-Frequency Link (BHFL) inverter. The proposed controller consists of inner current loop, outer voltage loop and a feedforward controller. Additional disturbance decoupling networks are employed to improve the robustness of the system towards load variations. This takes into account the model discretisation effect. Therefore, accurate disturbance decoupling can be achieved. A lkVA prototype inverter is constructed and the performances of the proposed controller are experimentally verified. The results show that the proposed controller has very fast dynamic response, and good steady-state response even under highly nonlinear loads.

This paper presents software designed to deal statistically with the common lightning and switching testing results. The objective of the software &#8220;Testing Method and Statistical Analysis&#8221; is to make possible the fast analysis of the results of an impulse testing sequence, usually, considering an amount of impulses per series much larger than the common practice, that normally are used to evaluate the value of the standard deviation of the critical voltage. This software was designed to allow the automatic-generation of reports-Microsoft Word-that makes easy the analysis of the testing results. It has built in the option of printing a complete report, recording of each test sequence results, and setting up a complete historical data of the experiment with all the possible and available information, allowing the modification of any data to any moment, avoiding errors. By computing the Critical Flashover Voltage, Standard Deviation paths and also the Likelihood Surface form, some analyses regarding the test accuracy can be performed

In order to maximize the profits from oil recovery, an optimal control approach for reservoir production working systems using gradient-based method is considered in the paper. It regards reservoir as a large-scale complex dynamic system. On the basis of flow dynamics, reservoir numerical simulation and optimal control theories, the optimization mathematical model of production working system is established. The optimal objective is to maximize net present value or accumulative oil production. Using the algorithm presented to solve the optimal control problem, gradients of real-time control parameters are obtained. And then optimal control settings of each control step can be determined. Finally, a simulation example is employed to verify the validity of the proposed control algorithm.

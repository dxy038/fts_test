The objective of this paper is to present an intelligent robot photographer which can take picture using peopleÂ´s own camera. Robot Photographer has been an interesting topic on robotic research in recent years and researches had been consistently focused on the quality of frame captured. As of today, these robot photographers can only use cameras which are mounted on the robot. In this paper, we contribute a different approach for this research. Instead of taking pictures using a single camera which is mounted on the robot, but helping peoples take pictures (especially group photos) by using their own cameras. This paper makes three major contributions: optimizing task performance by integrating robot with smart device; robot manipulating the camera for the correct pose and the efficient procedures for detecting a better frame to ensure quality of group photo being taken.

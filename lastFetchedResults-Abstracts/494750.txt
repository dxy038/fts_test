BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In spite of recent developments in treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children, renal damage and scar can be associated with UTI and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The risk of renal damage is more in children with younger age, especially in children under one year. This study was done to evaluate the risk of renal scar presentation in infants with UIT and VUR.

METHODS: This study was done on 71 children less than one year old with VUR and UIT that were referred to Amirkola Children Hospital (2007-2008). VUR was diagnosed by Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) grade I-V and scar (grade MV) by DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic acid) 4-6 months later. Then the results were surveyed. FINDINGS: Among 71 children, 49 (69%) patients were female. 142 kidney units were evaluated and 114 (80.3%) units had VUR and the grades II (47.4%) was the most common grade of VUR. Among 142 renal units, 48 (38.8%) units had scar. The most common grade of scar was grade I (31 units, 64.6%). The most common grade of scar was seen in grade II of reflux (18 units, 37.5%).

CONCLUSION: According to this study, more than one-third of children less than one year old with UIT and VUR had scar. So, more attention and good follow up are needed for UTI in this age group. Also the potential of scar formation before delivery must be mentioned.

The cetyltrimethylammonium bromide turbidimetric method (CTM) has been developed to quantify the hyaluronic acid (HA) in complex media to overcome the lack of selectivity and specificity of the standard carbazole method. The objective of this work is to assess the potential application of CTM to determine HA concentration. Factors such as duration of incubation, linearity range, HA size and form (natural linear HA or cross linked HA), pH and ionic environment impact were investigated. The incubation time was set to 10 min and the calibration curve was linear up to 0.6 g Lâˆ’1. The quantitative method was relevant whatever the HA size and form, and also for a wide range of conditions. The robustness of the CTM added to its high specificity and simplicity demonstrated that the CTM is a valuable method that would be an interesting substitute to the carbazole assay for HA quantification.

The paper considers a problem of consensus-based synchronization of uncertain parameter varying multi-agent systems with Lipschitz-continuous nonlinearities. The objective is to construct simultaneously consensus and observer schedules for each agent to ensure an asymptotic synchronized behaviour of all agents. A gain-scheduling algorithm is proposed which solves this problem while maintaining a specified suboptimal H<sub>&#8734;</sub> level of relative disagreement between the agents. The algorithm uses interpolation to ensure the continuity of the interconnection and observer gains. It preserves the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> consensus properties of the interpolants.

ntroduction & Objective: A standard treatment option for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is local injection of anesthetic- corticosteroid. This clinical trial was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of daily application of the EMLA cream with that of a single injection of methyl prednisolone acetate.
Materials & Methods: This is a clinical trial which was performed in the clinics of Shiraz medical school in 1386. Sixty five participants with clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of mild to moderate CTS were randomized to receive either the EMLA cream (group 1) or one injection (40 mg) of methylprednisolone acetate at wrist (group 2). Visual analog scale was used to assess the patients' pain acuity. Collected data were statistically analyzed by SPSS software using Chi-Square test.
Results: Pain intensity before and after treatment and also 4 weeks after treatment in group A was 5.8±0.98 , 0.7±0.82 and 2.1 ± 1.2 and 5.7 ±1, 2.4±1.5 and 1.6±1.4 in group B. The differences in pain intensity in both group were significant (p<0.001).
Conclusion: EMLA cream was effective in reducing pain associated with CTS. It can be an effective, noninvasive symptomatic treatment for the patients with mild to moderate CTS.

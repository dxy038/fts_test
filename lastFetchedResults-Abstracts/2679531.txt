In this paper a two-dimensional non-oriented guillotine bin packing problem is studied when 
items have different priorities. Our objective is to maximize the total profit which is total 
revenues minus costs of used bins and wasted area. A genetic algorithm is developed to solve 
this problem where a new coding scheme is introduced. To evaluate the performance of the 
proposed GA, first an upper bound is presented. Then, a series of computational experiments 
are conducted to evaluate the quality of GA solutions comparing with upper bound values. 
From the computational analysis, it appears that the GA algorithm is able to give good 
solutions.

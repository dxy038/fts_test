Introduction: Brucellosis is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in Iran. Clinical signs are not specific and laboratory methods are necessary for definite diagnosis. Isolation of microorganism from clinical samples is the most definitive methods, but its succession depends on many factors that can not be used in all cases. Standard agglutination test (SAT) and recently Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) are the most important serological tests for diagnosis of brucellosis.
Objective: In this study we compared these two diaghostic methods in patients suspected of brucellosis in Sari in 1381.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, all patients suspected of brucellosis who referred to health centers of Sari city from 1381/2/1 to 1381/8/1 were chosen regardless of age, sex and condition. Their sera were collected and tested by SAT, 2ME (according to WHO standard methods with Pasteur institute antigen) and Elisa (113L Hamborg). 1180 titer in SAT consider as positive and 2 dilution difference between 2ME and SAT consider as positive IgM.
Results: Overall the sera of 276 patients (183 female and 93 male) were tested for IgG and 1gM antibodies against brucelia. 12 samples were positive for IgG + IgM with both SAT and Elisa methods. IgG detected in 98 samples by Elisa method while 27 samples were positive for IgG by SAT. Elisa detected IgM in 6 samples while SAT and 2ME were negative and SAT and 2ME detected IgM in 3 samples while Elisa was negative.
Conclusion: In diagnosis of acute brucellosis (IgM + IgG ) both technique were the same but in diagnosis of subacute and chronic disease ( IgG without IgM or visevera ) two methods were very different.

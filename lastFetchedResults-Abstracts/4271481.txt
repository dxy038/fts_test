This paper presents a meta-heuristic approach based on Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm for optimal placement of Distributed Generation (DG) and capacitor in an existing distribution system. The distribution system considered in the case study is a 69 bus radial distribution systems. The objective of the work is to find out the suitable size and the placement of the DG as well as the capacitor bank in the test system to minimize the total power loss while satisfying the operational constraints like voltage deviation and line flow limits of the system. In the existing 69 bus radial system, it is observed that maximum load (almost 32 %) is placed at 61 bus. The effect of the DG and capacitor placement in the proposed system is also studied by interchanging the maximum load to different bus at other laterals so as to study the effect of loading pattern.

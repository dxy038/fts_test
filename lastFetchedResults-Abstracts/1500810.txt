Performance of future ignition system for internal combustion engines should be reliable and efficient to enhance and sustain combustion stability, since ignition not only initiates combustion but also influences subsequent combustion. Lean burn systems have been regarded as an advanced combustion approach that could improve thermal efficiency while reducing exhaust gas emissions. However, current engines cannot be operated sufficiently lean due to ignition related problems such as the sluggish flame initiation and propagation along with potential misfiring. A high exhaust gas recirculation engines also has similar potential for emissions improvement, but could also experience similar ignition problems, particularly at idle operation. Similarly, ignition is an important design factor in gas turbine and rocket combustor.

ly, non-conventional ignition techniques such as laser-induced ignition methods have become an attractive field of research in order to replace the conventional spark ignition systems. The fundamentals of conventional laser-induced spark ignition have been previously reviewed. Therefore, the objective of this article is to review progress on the use of such innovative techniques of laser-induced ignition including laser-induced cavity ignition and laser-induced multi-point ignition. In addition, emphasis is given to recent work to explore the feasibility of this interesting technology for practical applications concerning internal combustion engines.

This paper describes a configurable membership protocol for distributed tasks in time-triggered systems that combine static and dynamic messages such as TTCAN or Flexray. The units of membership are processes in nodes that send messages in static communication slots. The objective is to give nodes a consistent view of the status of processes in the system. Process failures are assumed to be manifested as missing messages (fail-silent assumption). Whenever a node detects a change in the membership status of any process, it broadcasts its opinion about the membership status of all processes. This information is broadcast only by nodes that detect a change of local membership status. The protocol is implemented in a distributed embedded system with TTCAN-communication. The response-time of the protocol has been evaluated experimentally by means of fault injection

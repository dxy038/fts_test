A graph representation of the design effort called a TAO-graph is introduced, and a design environment (FORS) that uses it as the main representation model is described. Each design graph consists of design tools, which are programs distributed over the whole network, and design aspects, which are the models to which the tools are applied. The systemÂ´s communication and exchange of data is based on distributed problem-solving techniques. The main objective is to develop mechanisms for collaboration between the different tools. In addition, the system provides an icon-based interface that is self-explanatory, allows for the dynamic reconfiguration of the design graph, and maintains libraries of records, tools, and aspects. The addition and the deletion of tools is easy since the user has the ability to access information and data from old design efforts. FORS has been used in the mechanical design of a car-window regulator, and implementation in the area of power systems is in progress

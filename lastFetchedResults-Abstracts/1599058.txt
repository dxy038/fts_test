Background: The objective of the present study was to estimate the contribution of environmental pollutants to hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) on subjects living in Kermanshah. 
Materials and Methods: This study is an ecological analysis. Data of CVD was collected from the largest CVD hospital of Kermanshah during 1 March 2010 until 30 February 2011. The air pollution data were obtained from environmental center. Magnitude of association was estimated by Poisson regression model. 
Results: Among air pollutants PM10 and CO was significantly associated with hospital admission for CVD. 
Conclusion: This study suggests that short-term exposure of people with some air pollutants such as PM10 and CO could increase CVD hospital admission.

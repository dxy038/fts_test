A STATCOM multi-objective, adaptive control simulation model is established based on MATLAB dynamic simulation tool SIMULINK. Set a machine infinite-bus system with the STATCOM as an example, combine of fuzzy control theory, with S-Function simulate and analysis the STATCOM transient fault in the system in the process of adjustment. The simulation results proves the correctness of the fuzzy controller designed in this paper and the effectiveness of the device simulation model of reactive power Static Synchronous Compensator.

We investigate the proportional fair scheduling (PFS) algorithm, with the objective of obtaining an analytic expression for it. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the throughput of PFS in wireless networks. The theoretical results from analysis are compared with those from simulations. The analytic model is shown to provide a high accuracy in evaluating the throughput of the PFS algorithm in Rayleigh fading environment.

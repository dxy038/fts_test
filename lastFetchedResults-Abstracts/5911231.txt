This paper investigates the absolute stability problem for Lur´e singularly perturbed systems with multiple nonlinearities. The objective is to determine if the system is absolutely stable for any &#949; &#8712; (0, &#949;<sub>0</sub>], where &#949; denotes the perturbation parameter and &#949;<sub>0</sub> is a pre-defined positive scalar. Firstly, an &#949;-dependent Lyapunov function of Lur´e-postnikov form is constructed. Then, a stability criterion expressed in terms of &#949;-independent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is derived. Finally, an example is given to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the obtained method.

The determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites in human urine is the method of choice for assessing exposure to carcinogenic compounds. The objective of this study was the development of a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) method using a flame ionisation detector (FID) to simultaneously determine 10 hydroxylated PAH. The method was based on enzymatic deconjugation, liquid–liquid extraction, and trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatization of the analytes by microwave heating. Satisfactory separation was achieved. The coefficient of variance was 3.8–12.8%. LOD was 0.03–0.18 μg/L, and LOQ was 0.1–0.5 μg/L. The mean recovery was 76%. The method was applied to the analysis of urine from smokers and non-smokers.

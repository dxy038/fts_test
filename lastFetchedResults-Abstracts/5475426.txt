The Satellite Assembly, Integration and Testing (AIT) activities are a logical and interrelated sequence of events. The main objective in this phase of a space program development is to achieve a high degree of confidence that the satellite complies with its specified performance parameters. Traditional simultaneous engineering space systems (e.g. satellite) development can have a better approach for taking into consideration AIT requirements during the initial phases of satellite conception and project detailing. By combining model driven system design approach with simultaneous engineering concepts for process modeling, AIT requirements at system level can be dealt with during satellite conceptual and detailed design. AIT requirements comprise electrical, mechanical and environmental requirements. This paper aims to present a new process for the development of satellites, that includes - electrical, mechanical and environmental requirements of assembly, integration and testing (AIT) of satellites, at the system level, already at the design stage of the satellite project.

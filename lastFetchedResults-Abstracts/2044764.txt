Objective(s):The neuroprotective effect offruit aqueous extract of Ziziphus jujuba Lam on glucose-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells as an appropriate in vitro model of diabetic neuropathy was investigated. Materials and Methods: Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured by DCFH-DA analysis. Cleaved caspase-3, a biochemical parameter of cellular apoptosis, was measured by western blot analysis. Results: Our data showed that a 4-fold elevation in glucose levels within the medium significantly reduced cell viability, increased intracellular ROS and caspase-3 activation in PC12 cells after 24 hr. Incubation of the high glucose medium cells with 300-Î¼g/ml Z. jujuba fruit (ZJF) extract decreased the high glucose-induced cell toxicity and prevented caspase-3 activation and excited ROS generation. Conclusion: Thus, we concluded that the aqueous extract of Z. jujuba protects against hyperglycaemia-induced cellular toxicity. This could be associated with the prevention of ROS generation and neural apoptosis. Moreover, the results suggest that the ZJF has a therapeutic potential to attenuate diabetes complications such as neuropathy.

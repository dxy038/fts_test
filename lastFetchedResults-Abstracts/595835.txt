Tuberculous meningitis is an infection of the the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges). Tuberculous meningitis is a major global health problem and is the most severe form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, with high rate mortality. Last years in Kosovo incidence of TB was decreased in less than 1000 cases per year and 10-20 cases per year of TB meningoencephalitis. Still Kosovo has limited numbers of TB. TBM is diagnosed on the basis of clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, and radiological findings. Clinical picture, neurological status, anamnestic data, suspect (but not specific) lab tests, and imaging new methods, together can give very valuable help to clinicians for early adequate and successful treatment.

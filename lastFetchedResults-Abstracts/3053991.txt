At present, wavelet transform has become a standard tool in medical image compression. Although, the choice of wavelet filters is an essential issue that can be determined the compression image quality. The goal of this paper is to provide the comparison of applying different types of wavelet filters belonging to orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelets with different orders on the ultrasonic images. The wavelet filters used are Haar, Daubichies8, 6/10, 9/7 and 5/3 filters. The performance evaluation of the image quality is measured objectively using maximum difference (MD), normalized absolute error (NAE), and normalized mean square error (NMSE). Moreover, ultrasonographers do the subjective performance assessment. From the experimental evaluation, it can be concluded that objective assessment alone is not suitable objective scale to evaluate the quality of the compressed images. Therefore, subjective assessment is very important to take into account visual quality.

This paper presents a methodology for evaluating an optimum real power generation scheduling in a power system consisting of regulated and deregulated subsystems. A new approach using a distributed slack bus model is developed. Minimization of fuel cost is considered as the objective function for each generator of a subsystem participating in the economic dispatch in a deregulated market. The optimization approach adopted in the method is based on participation factors and uses decoupled load flow calculation. The results of generation schedule can be used by ISO for operation and control. The results obtained for a modified IEEE-30 bus system separated into six generating utilities show promise for practical implementation

This paper analyzes the potential benefits of using different schemes to control base station power during soft handover for UTRA WCDMA downlink. Balanced downlink power control, used to limit control power drifting, and the site selection diversity technique (SSDT) power control are compared with hybrid power control. A hybrid scheme switches dynamically from balanced power control to site selection diversity power control to decrease the base station power during congestion. The objective is to find out whether there is any additional improvement in cellular coverage and performance using these schemes. Total base station transmission power, individual traffic channel power for each mobile station and outage time are used for comparison

Objective
To identify cardiac metastases in a patient with a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and to clarify the relationship between cardiac metastases and sudden death.
Study design
Autopsy and retrospective chart review for a patient.
Methods
We studied a Japanese patient who suddenly died after the operation and radiation therapy, despite an absence of thanatoid symptoms. We performed a subsequent autopsy.
Results
The patient had four metastatic lesions in the heart, one of which was in the septum and infiltrated the region around the conducting system of the heart.
Conclusion
Cardiac metastasis of tongue cancer may cause sudden death.

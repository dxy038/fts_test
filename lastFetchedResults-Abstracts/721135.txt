The series of 2-benzylsulfanyl derivatives of benzoxazole and benzothiazole were synthesized, evaluated for their in vitro antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and the activity expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in Î¼mol/L. The substances bearing two nitro groups (4e, 4f, 5e, 5f) or a thioamide group (4i, 4j, 5i, 5j) exhibited appreciable activity particularly against non-tuberculous strains. The most active compounds were subjected to the toxicity assay and were evaluated as moderately cytotoxic.

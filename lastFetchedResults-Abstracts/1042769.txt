This work considers an inverse boundary design problem which involves radiation and convection heat transfer. The objective is finding the heat flux distribution required on heaters located on the top and side walls of a two-dimensional enclosure that satisfies both the temperature and heat flux distributions prescribed on the design surface of the enclosure. A turbulent air flow is generated by a fan located inside the chamber. The problem is described by a system of non-linear, ill-conditioned equations, which is solved by an iterative procedure. The solution are obtained by regularizing the system of equations by means of the TSVD method.

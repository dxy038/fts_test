Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are infrastructure-less and self-organized networks deployed among vehicles and other road users. Due to the limitations of the wireless technologies used and the rapid topology changes, designing efficient routing protocols for VANETs is becoming a major concern. In this study, we applied a multi-objective optimization metaheuristic, in order to find efficient OLSR parameterizations that improve the QoS of the OLSR RFC and a previous optimized configurations. Our optimized configuration significantly reduces OLSR scalability problems keeping competitive packet delivery rates. The OLSR routing overhead is reduced between 47% and 76% and the delivery times are between 32% and 38% shorter when using our optimized settings.

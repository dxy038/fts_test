At present, optimization modeling has become a powerful tool to tackle emergency logistics problems. A multi-objective material supply model in an emergent disaster is first constructed in the paper. The differential evolution (DE) algorithm with constraint handling methods, specialized for the material supply model, is then presented. Finally, a simulation experiment is performed and our results are compared with those obtained using a different method. We found that the proposed algorithm can quickly and robustly approach the best solution for both the single objective function and the multi-objective model. It is a more feasible and efficient way to handle material supply optimization in emergency logistics problems.

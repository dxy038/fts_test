 The purpose of this study was to investigate if a module consisting of 6 hours of voice training is effective in future teachers. Sixty-five students, enrolled in the academic teaching program at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, participated in this study. The trained group (nآ =آ 35) received 6 hours of voice training, whereas the control group (nآ =آ 30) received no voice training. A multidimensional test battery containing subjective judgments and objective measurements was applied in both groups at the study onset and after 4 months to evaluate the training outcome. No significant differences were observed for the subjective judgments. For the objective measurements, by contrast, several significant differences between the trained and the control groups were found. This outcome favors the systematic introduction of voice training during the schooling of future teachers.

Digital watermarking has attracted substantial attention as it is the most commonly applied method for the copyright protection of the intellectual property rights of digital media. In conformity with the characters of human vision, the objective of the paper is to be focused on the performance of proposed algorithm on the basis of invisibility, interference and robustness to attacks using scrambled hybrid wavelet-singular domain watermarking system. By the use of MATLAB 7.7.0, the efficiency of the watermarking scheme has been demonstrated via the experimental results. The results show the proposed algorithm can embed and distill digital watermark more effectively in comparison.

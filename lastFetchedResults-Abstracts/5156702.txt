In this paper, flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices are optimally allocated in a power network to achieve optimal power flow (OPF) solution. The location of FACTS devices and the setting of their control parameters are optimized by a bacterial swarming algorithm (BSA) to improve the performance of the power network. Two objective functions are simultaneously considered as the indexes of the system performance: maximization of system loadability in system security margin and minimization of total generation fuel cost. Four types of FACTS devices are modeled and incorporated in the OPF problem. Simulation studies are undertaken on a standard IEEE 30-bus test system. Results demonstrate that the steady state performance of the power system can be effectively enhanced due to the optimal allocation of multi-type FACTS devices.

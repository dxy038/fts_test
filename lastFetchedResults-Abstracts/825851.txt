In the course of commissioning unit II of the GKN nuclear power plant, a Quality Assurance Manual was introduced in 1988. The Quality Assurance Manual is essentially based on the quality assurance elements of KTA 1401; that is, the emphasis is on quality assurance procedures for safety relevant plant components. During the actual application of the Quality Assurance Manual, however, it soon became apparent that this one-dimensional approach to quality management is not sufficient for the efficient organization of the quality related operational processes and procedures. The management of GKN decided at the end of 1992 to carry out a revision of the Quality Assurance Manual, with the objective of using quality, within the meaning of DIN ISO 9001, as a comprehensive organizational element for all operational processes and procedures. BTB-Jansky GmbH, a consulting firm familiar with the operational processes and procedures was commissioned to revise the Quality Assurance Manual, to investigate the procedures and implement a quality management system. The introduction of the quality management system has made it possible for the quality relevant processes and procedures at GKN to be regulated comprehensively and in a systematically transparent and workable manner. The introduction of the quality management system took place within the framework of an efficiency raising programme. It becomes apparent from this that the introduction of a quality management system is able to provide economic benefits for the operator.

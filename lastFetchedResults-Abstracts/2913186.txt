The main objective of the knowledge bases group at ECRC, is to develop a fully comprehensive knowledge base management system. The authors concentrate on aspects of this work in which they are actively involved and essentially provide an overview of theoretical studies and software development which have recently been reported in detail in the literature. They give a brief assessment of the state-of-the-art in those areas of research from which the techniques for building a KBMS must be drawn. This is followed by a discussion of the nature of the problems which have to be solved before the ultimate objective can be achieved. Finally an outline is given of the solutions which have been devised in the context of a system currently under development at ECRC. The authors point out the main obstacles to progress: they show how some of them have been overcome, and how it is hoped to conquer those remaining

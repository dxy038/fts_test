In the architecture of Iranian traditional houses, the ornamentations available in the inscriptions
of houses entrance portal express the identity of architects and personality of houses owners and are rooted in their
religious and national beliefs and faiths. The main hypothesis of this research is changing the physique and application
of religious contents in compliance with the thoughts and beliefs of people in Dezfoul historical city in the epigraphs of
houses entrance portals. The objective of this study is reviewing the development trend of texts, concepts and physique
of inscriptions as well as analyzing the factors effective on the quality and diversity of application of inscriptions. The
present research is an applied study and descriptive-analytical method has been applied, and the data was collected by
library and survey studies. The population of this research includes historical houses, houses damages in war (Iran &
Iraq) and renovated and new tissue and new-built houses of Dezfoul, from Qajar era so far. Random sampling method
has been applied in this study and dispersal area includes the city. Data analysis method in this study is qualitative
and quantitative. The results of this study indicate that today the inscriptions available in the entrance portal of houses
in Dezfoul comparing to inscriptions in Qajar1 and Pahlavi2 era is very simple and has lower aesthetic value. One of
causes for such superficial and contextual gap between inscriptions seems to be the war and renovations during and
after destruction.

Real-world optimization problems often require the minimization/maximization of more than one objective, which, in general, conflict with each other. These problems (multiobjective optimization problems, vector optimization problems) are usually treated by using weighted sums or other decision-making schemes. An alternative way is to look for the pareto-optimal front. In this paper, the particle swarm algorithm is modified to detect the pareto-optimal front.

The objective of the current study was to compare tick loads, growth and carcass characteristics of dipped and non-dipped
Nguni, Bonsmara and Angus steers raised on natural pasture. One hundred 7-month-old castrated weaners were kept at the
University of Fort Hare Farm for 12 months. There were 30 weaners each of Angus and Bonsmara, and 40 weaners of the
Nguni breed. Half the Bonsmara, Angus and 14 Nguni weaners were dipped every fortnight. The rest were not dipped. Monthly
weights and tick counts under the tail, on scrotum, belly, sternum and ears of the steers were recorded. The dipped Nguni
steers had lowest (P,0.05) tick counts, and the non-dipped Angus steers had the highest (P,0.05) tick counts. There were
more ticks (P,0.05) during the warm wet season than during the cool dry season. Ears had the highest (P,0.05) tick
infestation. Average daily gain (ADG) was similar (P.0.05) among the three breeds. The non-dipped Bonsmara steers had the
heaviest (P,0.05) carcasses (14265.4) while the non-dipped Nguni steers had the lightest (P,0.05) carcasses
(11164.5 kg). The non-dipped Bonsmara had the highest (P,0.05) eye muscle area (39966120.8mm2) while the nondipped
Angus had the smallest (P,0.05) eye muscle area (32916210.6mm2). The non-dipped Bonsmara also had the highest
(P,0.05) dressing percentage (53.861.01) while the non-dipped Nguni had the lowest (P,0.05) dressing percentage
(50.360.84). The current study has shown that while the non-dipped steers had higher (P,0.05) tick loads than the dipped
steers, their growth and carcass characteristics were similar (P.0.05). The study has also shown that, despite being a smallframed
breed, the Nguni steers had similar (P.0.05) ADG to the large-framed Bonsmara and Angus steers. Therefore, the
Nguni cattle have the potential to produce organic beef. However, a reasonable assessment of organic beef production
potential of the Nguni requires an evaluation of its meat quality traits under natural pasture.

Objective To assess the correlation between
clinical characteristics and the caregiving
experience of caregivers of patients with schizophrenia.
Patients and methods Two hundred and one
patients with schizophrenia and their caregivers were
recruited from a psychiatric clinic. The involvement
evaluation questionnaire (IEQ) and the general health
questionnaire (GHQ) were administered to the caregivers.
The patients were assessed by the Structured
Clinical Interview, the positive and negative syndrome
scale (PANSS) and the global assessment of functioning
scale (GAF). Correlation analysis and regression
analysis was performed to identify the best
predictors of caregiver stress. Results The most
important clinical predictor of caregiver stress as assessed
using IEQ was the GAF, followed by PANSSPos
and Neg scores and admission. Positive symptoms
contributed more to overall caregiver stress than
negative symptoms. Discussion Both symptom
severity and patient function were important factors
in the caregiver experience. Treatment should aim not
only to reduce symptoms but also maximize function.
Service planning should include psychosocial intervention
involving caregivers.

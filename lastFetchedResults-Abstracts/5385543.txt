DC microgrids are suitable for a local area power system which includes dc output distributed generations, batteries and dc loads. In this paper, we propose an analysis method for a dc microgrid using hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS). In this case, a fast response bidirectional dc voltage source is essential for high accuracy analysis. We developed the bidirectional dc source, and installed it to a small scale experimental system of dc microgrid with a real-time simulator. The experimental results showed the validity of the proposed analysis method under some simple cases.

Objective
ent resistant depression is a common clinical problem and a major public health concern. The use of antidepressant combinations to overcome treatment resistance, while somewhat controversial, is a popular strategy in practice. This paper reviews published trials on combination antidepressants with a view to inform clinical practice.

ematic but selective review of the published literature was conducted using EMBASE, PSYCHLIT and MEDLINE with relevant search terms.
s
er of trials suggesting efficacy of combination antidepressants were found. These are incorporated into a number of treatment guidelines for the management of treatment refractory depression. Clinicians should be cautious regarding pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, including the serotonin syndrome, however combination strategies are an effective option.
sions
ntidepressants can be usefully combined especially if they engage separate mechanisms of action. Clinically, antidepressant combinations provide a useful resort in otherwise treatment resistant individuals. However, much further research is needed to determine relative efficacy and determine long term outcome.

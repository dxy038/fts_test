A new approach for the design of two-channel perfect reconstruction FIR filter banks with short reconstruction delays is presented. A low-order filter is first designed and the objective function of the filter bank is formulated as a quadratic programming problem with linear constraints. The Lagrange-multiplier method is then used to design a higher-order filter. The method is simple, efficient, and flexible and leads to a closed-form solution. A design example is included to illustrate the advantages of the method

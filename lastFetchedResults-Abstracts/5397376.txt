The family of chaotic bidirectional associative memory (C-BAM family) can reach all stored patterns during the chaotic behavior. Therefore, in this case, C-BAM family can not converge towards a specific pattern, consequently, a desired output is not available. We introduce a control strategy to make heteroassociative chaotic networks converge towards a non-accessible memory and towards a last state of a trajectory. Computer simulations showed that the chaos of C-BAM family could be controlled through the pinning control method, in which any stored output can be recalled from its associated stimulus.

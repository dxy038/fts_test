STARS (Students, Teachers and Resources in the Sciences) is a National Science Foundation GK-12 funded project whose objective is to foster systemic change in elementary curricula and enrich math, science and long-term professional development of teachers. The program aims to decrease the current educational gap in science and math present in schools within the same school district, as reflected in the Florida comprehensive assessment test (FCAT). One challenging task is the development of new and innovative modules that introduce advanced science and engineering concepts to third, fourth and fifth grade students from diverse backgrounds. The modules have been designed by graduate fellows (resources) with knowledge in science, engineering, math and technology. This paper discusses the methodology for module development, formatting and design of the lessons, and implementation in the classroom. A discussion regarding the modules from the viewpoint of teachers, students and fellows is also provided.

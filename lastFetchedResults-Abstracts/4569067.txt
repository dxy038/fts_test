Established the frame finite element model in a certain type of heavy truck, determined the boundary conditions and loads, and verified the electrical test. Select the frame rails and the beams as a sensitivity analysis of the object. According to the results of the analysis to select the design variables, with the maximum stress and displacement of the body as state variables, with the total mass of the body as the objective function, in order to achieve the optimization of the heavy truck.

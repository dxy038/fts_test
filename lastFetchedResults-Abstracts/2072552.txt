Objective: Losing weight in consequence of appetite loss can be a sign of a serious underlying condition. Currently, the most widely prescribed medication for anorexia is cyproheptadine hydrochloride. However, the clinical use of cyproheptadine hydrochloride is limited by its side effects. In Iranian traditional medicine, Coriandrum sativum stimulates the appetite. Therefore, the effect of Coriandrum sativum (coriander) hydroalcoholic extract was investigated on food intake in rats. Material and Methods: Thirty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups. Two control groups were used, one group received 0.5 ml water per day (vehicle group), and another group did not receive anything (control group). The other 3 groups were daily treated by 50, 100 or 150 mg/kg of coriander for 7 days, respectively. The daily amount of the food eaten by each rat was measured for 10 days. The amount of energy intake of each rat was also calculated for 7 days during the intervention. The difference in energy intake was calculated and compared between groups. Result: There was no significant change in energy intake between control and vehicle groups. The change in energy intake after treatment by 100 and 150 mg/kg of the extract was significantly higher than other groups (p=0.030 and p=0.007) Conclusion: This study indicated that coriander had positive effects on appetite of rats. Future studies are needed to evaluate the mechanisms of the effects of this plant on appetite. Â

Influenza virus induces cell death in tissues of animals and human. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the histopathologic changes of the heart in the chickens, which have been infected experimentally with H9N2 serotype of avian influenza virus, (A/chicken/Iran/772/2000). In this study, 20 SPF chickens 3- week old were divided equally into two groups. The first group was infected with 0.2ml of 1:10 dilution and 107.5EID50 titer of the virus intranasaly and the second group was treated with saline normal in the same manner. After 72 hours of experiment, tissue specimens of cardiac tissues were collected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The prepared microscopic sections with thickness of 6 microns were stained by H&E. Histological examinations indicated pathological changes including necrosis, hemorrahage and inflammatory reactions in the heart of treatment group. In comparison with control group, the severity of these damages was significant in infected chickens. The results of this study indicated that influenza virus H9N2 (A/chicken/Iran/772/2000) is able to induce cell death and myocarditis in cardiac tissue of chicken. Vet.J.of Islamic.Azad.

Gas hydrates can cause serious problems in oil- and gas industry. It can be formed by synergies of gas- and water molecules at low temperature and high pressure. The major objective of this article is to present gas hydrateÂ´s formation at laboratory conditions and to examining the curve of hydrate based on the measured values. Furthermore, another main aim of this paper is to compare the results of laboratory to the values measured at gas production wells.

The objective of this paper is to develop numerically simple and effective methods for system analysis using truncated ellipsoids. The paper studies linear time-invariant systems subject to persistent disturbance and state constraint. The maximal output under a set of initial conditions and the overshoot under a given step input are estimated. Attempts are also made to detect an invariant set, as large as possible, within state/output constraint. The results are based on the set invariance condition for the truncated ellipsoid, and a characterization of the set where the output possibly reaches a local extreme.

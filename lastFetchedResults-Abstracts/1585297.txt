The objective of this paper is to study certain order-theoretic properties of locally connected topologies. In the main theorem we prove that the assertion that a locally connected topology which satisfies the countable chain condition has the continuous representability property is undecidable in ZFC set theory. Some related problems and generalizations are also included.

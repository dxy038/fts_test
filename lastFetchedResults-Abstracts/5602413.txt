Targeting at Civil Engineering teaching situation in China, we design Virtual Engineering Structural Experimental System using virtual technology. Based on object-oriented development process, we put up the general system frame. We complete function analysis and use case model. We work out the detailed use case description by activity diagram, and system design by class diagram. We finish all above work by UML(the unified modeling language). Based on the design and analysis we finish the system implementation which has been used in practice and achieved good effects. The system realizes the simulation of real experiment by the interaction of the system and user. The system has advantages of saving resources, being repeatable and having no objective condition limitations comparing with traditional experiment. The virtual test system has significance on teaching and production of Civil Engineering.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcome of acute pulmonary embolism in elderly in comparison to the younger patients. Methods: Study population consisted of 136 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Clinical characteristics and thromboembolic risk factors were analyzed between the elderly (≥65 years of age) and the younger (<65 years of age) patients. In-hospital mortality was used as a measure of outcome. Results: Elderly group consisted of 70 patients (age 76.4±8.3 years, range 65–96 years; females 58%) and younger group of 66 patients (age 48.5±12 years, range 18–64 years, females 59%). Syncope was more frequent in elderly group (19% vs. 6%, P=0.03) but the symptoms of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain were not significantly different between groups. Malignancy was the most common risk factor for thrombo-embolism, but immobilization predominated among patients in elderly group (21% vs. 6%, P=0.01). Tachycardia was common in younger patients compared to the elderly. Ventilation–perfusion scan was used more commonly in younger patients (76% vs. 57%, P=0.02), whereas, helical computed-tomography scan was used equally in both groups. Most of the patients had lower extremity duplex study (97% in each group). Inferior vena cava filter placement was common and thrombolytic therapy rare among elderly patients. Patients in elderly group had higher in-hospital mortality (17% vs. 5%, P=0.02). Conclusions: Syncope is a more frequent presenting symptom and immobilization a common risk factor in elderly patients with acute pulmonary embolism. In addition, they have higher in-hospital mortality.

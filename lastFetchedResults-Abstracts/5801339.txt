The success of eliminating the disease Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) depends on the detection capabilities of medical organizations. In Malaysia government hospitals perform the major part of this particular task. An important ingredient of the diagnostic process in government hospital is the visual interpretation of standard chest X-ray films. Problems associated with this type of visual interpretation are well known. In this study, we propose an objective method, involving wavelets, for the purpose of detecting MTB.

The main constraint in lagoon treatment is the high suspended solids (SS) in the effluents, which is primarily due to high concentrations of algal cells in the finished effluent. The objective of this study was to remove turbidity originating from algae present in oxidation pond effluents by an easy and inexpensive method. For this reason, a novel lab-scale step feed dual treatment (SFDT) process was developed and the effectiveness of the trickling filter (TF) unit within the system in removing algae and organic matter was investigated. The SFDT process developed in this study is a unique and inexpensive way to scavenge algae from oxidation pond effluents. As opposed to earlier and somewhat unsuccessful studies where pond effluent post treatment was tested on oncethrough trickling filters, in this study pond effluents were directed to a step fed TF, so as to provide a dual treatment. Step feeding provided the necessary substrate to maintain a biofilm in TF, thereby affecting organic particles interception. The stabilization pond was not simulated in the study since the main focus was on the behaviour of the TF unit. The hydraulic loading rate (HLR) (0.5–2–4 m3/m2 day), influent COD (150–550 mg/L) and influent Chl-a concentrations (250–600 μg/L) were selected as operational variables. It was observed that, in general, removal percentages for turbidity, Chl-a, SS and COD increased considerably with the decreasing HLR, such as the removal efficiency of Chl-a was increased from 89.4% to about 97% when HLR was decreased from 4 m3/m2 day to 2 m3/m2 day. As a result, trickling filter produced clear effluents, with less than 2 NTU and the removal efficiency of turbidity being higher than 88%, and also removal percentages for Chl-a were higher than 95% for most of the cases.

The objective of this paper is to study the effect of using different chemicals on material removal rate, with varied stand off distances and chemical concentration in abrasive water jet machining. The use of such chemicals on the taperness of drilled holes is also studied. The study reveals the use of polymer can reduce the taper of the holes drilled.

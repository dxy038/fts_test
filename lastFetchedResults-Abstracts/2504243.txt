Background: In patients with anovulatory infertility the first choice of treatment for ovulation
induction is an antiestrogen, most commonly clomiphene citrate (CC). However, 20-25% of the
women are resistant to CC and do not ovulate perhaps due to antiestrogenic mechanism of the CC
action, which involves long-lasting estrogen receptor (ER) depletion.
Objective: The objective of the study was to mimic the action of CC without depletion of ERs by
the administration of an aromatase inhibitor letrozole in a selected group of Poly Cystic Ovary
(PCO) patients who demonstrated failure to ovulate after treatment with CC.
Materials and Methods: 20 patients with anovulation due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),
who had previously inadequately responded to CC were selected for study. The aromatase inhibitor
letrozole was administered orally in a dose of 2.5 mg on days 3-7 of the menstrual cycle. Then,
occurrence of ovulation, endometrial thickness, and pregnancy rates were determined.
Result(s): Only one patient had one dominant follicle (1.8 cm diameter) on day 14 of the cycle
(estradiol = 200 pg/ml). IUI was done; however, no pregnancy took place. In the remaining cases,
several sonographies were done between days 9 to 15 of the cycle; however, all cycles were
cancelled due to absence of a dominant follicle ( > 1.4 cm).
Conclusion(s): Our study did not confirm the favorable effect of letrozole for induction of
ovulation in patients with clomiphene resistant PCO.

Minimization of maximum production time (Makespan) in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) scheduling problems is an important objective and may result in good system performances. To realize a makespan close to the global minimum production time is a suitable goal for scheduling But answering the question how close this goal can be approached is a very complicated problem. In this paper bottleneck scheduling and Lot Streaming (LS) are used for a Job shop Scheduling Problem (JSP). The new contribution of the paper is applying a Brute Force Method (BFM) to LS. The effect of setup times is considered and numerical example is given.

Anticentromere autoantibodies (ACA) are associated with Raynaud's disease and systemic sclerosis (SSc). ACA usually bind at least one of three major centromere proteins (CENPs), particularly CENP-B. We identified 16 patients with ACA who do not have Raynaud's disease or SSc. The objective of this study was to determine whether these 16 ACA differ in antigenic specificity from the ACA found in patients with Raynaud's disease or SSc. Binding of these serum ACA was tested using competition experiments with recombinant CENP-B, and native centromere proteins from HEp-2 cells and HeLa nuclear extracts in ELISAs, immunoblots, and indirect immunofluorescence assays. The ACA from these 16 patients are strikingly different from those obtained from patients who have Raynaud's disease or SSc. Only 5 of the 16 index sera (31.25%) bound CENP-B from two or more different sources by at least two methods. Six of these 16 sera (37.5%) did not bind CENP-B on ELISA, and 8 of 16 (43.75%) did not bind CENP-B on immunoblots. Three sera did not bind CENP-B either by ELISA or immunoblots. Of the 13 sera that bound CENP-B, their patterns of binding to CENP-B strongly suggested that they bind different epitopes within the CENP-B antigen. Independently of their binding to CENP-B, these sera reacted mainly with minor CENP antigens detected by HeLa nuclear extracts. We have identified unusual ACA not associated with Raynaud's disease or SSc.

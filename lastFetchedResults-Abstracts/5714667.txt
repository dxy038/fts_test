This paper reports the first results of an ongoing work which aims at providing numerical tools useful to the design of a family of high speed parallel robots. The objective is to find sets of feasible values for the design parameters unlike more usual design procedures relying on optimization techniques. These tools are mainly based on interval analysis and take into account the dynamics of the parallel robots. Moreover, they can deal with bounded uncertainties that affect some physical parameters involved in the dynamics. Following the statement of the design problems considered, a general method is presented. Then, this method is illustrated with the study of a 2-DOF parallel robot.

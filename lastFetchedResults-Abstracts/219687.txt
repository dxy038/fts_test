The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship
between isometric GM torque and the degree of frontal plane
pelvic drop during running. Twenty-one healthy, recreational
runners (9 males, 12 females) who ran 8.05 km or more per
week were obtained from a sample of convenience. GM maximal
isometric torque was collected prior to the run. Subjects
then ran on a treadmill for 30 minutes while bilateral threedimensional
pelvic kinematic data were collected for 10 seconds
at each 2 minute increment. Left side pelvic drop showed a
slight increase (effect size = 0.61); while, the right side pelvic
drop remained stable (effect size = 0.18). Pearsonâ€™s Correlations
showed no relationship between GM isometric torque and frontal
plane pelvic drop for any of the data collection periods during
the 30-minute run. These results suggest that isometric GM
torque was a poor predictor of frontal plane pelvic drop. One
should question whether a dynamic rather than static measure of
GM strength would be more appropriate. Future research is
needed to identify dynamic strength measures that would better
predict biomechanical components of running gait.

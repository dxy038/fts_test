A new soft-switched bidirectional dc-dc converter is proposed in the paper. The proposed converter can operate with soft-switching, a continuous inductor current, fixed switching frequency, and the switch stresses of a conventional PWM converter regardless of the direction of power flow. These features are due to a very simple auxiliary circuit that is operational regardless of the direction of power flow. In the paper, the converterpsilas operation will be discussed in detail and results obtained from an experimental prototype that confirm the feasibility of the converter are presented.

This paper describes the comparison of input stimuli as a means of testing mixed-signal circuits. Current testing that measures the integral of the power supply current in the time-domain is used to detect faults. The main objective is to achieve real-time testing in which there is no need to analyze the results of testing. Simulation results show that a step-voltage input stimulus is effective for detection of bridging and breaking faults in an A/D converter. Since this input signal allows the current to be measured at discrete time intervals, it is applicable for real-time current testing and can be used for built-in test and production test

A new hierarchical self-healing ring (H-SHR) architecture for survivability is proposed and dimensioned. First, the dimensioning of single SHRs (unidirectional and bidirectional) is considered. Closed form expressions of required capacity are presented for single SHRs under three uniform demand patterns. For general demand, a new routing algorithm which complements the shortest path routing algorithm in attempt to reduce the capacity requirement is proposed. Then it is shown that the dimensioning of H-SHRs can be converted into the dimensioning of each single rings inside it by performing translation of original demand. Thus the new routing algorithm can be used in dimensioning of H-SHR networks. Closed form expressions for uniform H-SHRs using shortest path routing are also presented

This paper reviews sustainable developments and new trends in process visualization methods - especially the use for the RFID (radio frequency identification system) technology. Starting from the motivation for developing a new process visualization method named Glauto process chain paradigm in chapter I. Afterwards is be found an overview about existing process visualization methods. The next chapter introduces the research objective for the Glauto method and defines the position in the existing landscape of methods for process visualization. Several expertsÂ´ opinions by a survey to several companies and research facilities, which are using process modeling and - analyzing methods, are used as a basis to develop the new method. Afterwards the procedure of process recording with Glauto as well as process types and key figures for Glauto will be defined. Next is to be found a sample for process visualization with Glauto. It contains the operation block diagrams as well as basic operations, connecting- and logic symbols.

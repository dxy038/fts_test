For the same target, the combat effect is varied while missile hits different part of target. How to choose rational aim-point is an effective method of improving the missile attack efficiency. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP for short) combines qualitative and quantitative analysis method. Through analyses the factors and their correlations in complex system, the system can be decompounded into different elements. Then these elements are classified into different levels, so multilayer analysis structure model is constructed objectively. Importance of varied factors in reality is difficult to quantify can be solved by this method. This paper takes communication building as example. According to a vast amount of data of experts and analyzing the experts&#194;&#191; opinions, the priority sequence of aim-points is determined when a missile targets on communication building with AHP. Satellite receiving set is the first aim-point to be attacked through analysis. In actual combat, satellite receiving set is placed on the top of a building. It can be detected, identified and attacked easily. Once the satellite receiving set is destroyed, communication building will lose its combat significance. The analysis result is accurate and objective, and it has feasibility.

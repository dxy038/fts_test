An automated maneuver control framework for a remotely operate vehicle (ROV) is presented. This framework entails a three-layered control architecture, a principled approach to design and implementation within the architecture, and hybrid systems design techniques. The control architecture is structured according to the principle of composition of vehicle motions from a minimal set of elemental maneuvers that are designed and verified independently. The principled approach is based on distributed hybrid systems techniques, and spans integrated design, simulation and implementation as the same model is used throughout. Hybrid systems control techniques are used to synthesize the elemental maneuvers and to design protocols, which coordinate the execution of elemental maneuvers within a complex maneuver. The architecture is fault-tolerant by design since it uses verified maneuvers. This work is part of the Inspection of Underwater Structures (IES) project whose main objective is the implementation of a ROV-based system for the inspection of underwater structures

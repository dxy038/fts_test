In contribution of solar gas turbine modelling research, the present paper seeks a numerical study and simulation development of high output solar gas turbine power plant by a simulator adapted with a capacity of 20MWe, with good performance and profitability. The study of modelling and simulation of the installation will be done initially by the calculation of the matrix efficiency of the solar field, then we proceed to the numerical simulation by TRNSYS 16 including TESS and STEC 3.0 library for the different components of the installation. The main objective of this study is to calculate the efficiencies of solar-electric and hybrid cycles for two operating systems of installation, first without regenerator then with regenerator and evaluate their feasibility in Be&#769;char area (in south of Algeria).

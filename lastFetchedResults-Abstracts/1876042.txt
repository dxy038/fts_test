Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate gender differences in quality of life (QOL) in a large sample of age-matched and ejection fraction (EF)-matched patients with heart failure. Design: Matched comparisons of secondary data were used. Setting: The setting consisted of multicenter Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction trials. Sample: The sample included 1382 patients (691 men and 691 women) who were age-matched and EF-matched. Outcome Measures: Global QOL and the QOL dimensions of physical function, emotional distress, social health, and general health were measured using the Ladder of Life, items from the Profile of Mood States Inventory, the Functional Status Questionnaire, the β-Blocker Heart Attack Trial instrument, and an item from the RAND Medical Outcomes Study instrument. Results: Women had significantly worse general life satisfaction, physical function, and social and general health scores than men. There were no significant differences found between gender groups for current life situation or emotional distress. After controlling for New York Heart Association classification, women still had significantly worse ratings for intermediate activities of daily living (a sub-dimension of physical functioning) and social activity. Conclusions: Despite controlling for age, EF, and New York Heart Association classification, women had worse QOL ratings than did men for intermediate activities of daily living and social activity. Research should focus on identifying why differences exist and developing measures to improve QOL, particularly physical functioning, in women with heart failure. (Heart Lung® 2001;30:105-16.)

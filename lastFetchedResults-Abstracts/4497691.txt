The main issues of network reconfiguration after a complete blackout are to restore the generating units and to establish a stable network. This paper presents a framework containing three objectives of network reconfiguration. Maximizing the total number of restored generation nodes is the first objective to be optimized, so as to accelerate the reconfiguration process. The second objective is to minimize the total charging capacitor of the restoration paths to decrease the reactive power generated by the transmission lines. The third and final objective is to reduce as much as possible the risks of the strategy. The uncertainties of transmission lines are also considered in the framework developed, with the use of the scenario-based method to address the uncertainty. Next, the well-established differential evolution algorithm and the Dijkstra algorithm are used to seek an optimal strategy through solving the multi-objective optimization problem. Finally, the New England 10-unit 39-bus power system is employed to demonstrate the proposed method.

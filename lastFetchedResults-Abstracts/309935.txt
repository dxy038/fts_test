Objective:
To evaluate the clinical use of Homocysteine–Primavette®, a new blood collection medium for total homocysteine (tHcy) assay.
Methods:
The agreement between baseline tHcy and tHcy in stabilized samples (40 h) was assessed for FPIA, HPLC, GC-MS, LC-MS, and ICL.
Results:
tHcy concentrations in whole blood were stable for 40 h in Hcy–Primavette tubes.
Conclusion:
Primavette tubes are a good alternative for the accurate tHcy measurement and no readjustment of reference intervals is needed.

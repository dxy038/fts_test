The specific objective of the Green Radio program isto investigate and create innovative methods for the reduction of the total energy needed to operate a radio access network and to identify appropriate radio architectures that enable such a power reduction. Moreover, the recent development of hierarchical macro/femto cell based broadband wireless access networks is drawing the attention of wireless service providers more than ever due to their enhanced indoor coverage. The scope of this article is to describe a novel handover decision policy forfemtocell network, towards reducing energy consumption while taking in count usersÂ´ priority.

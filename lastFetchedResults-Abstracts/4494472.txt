This paper introduces remote monitoring of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) output data system design scheme based on GPRS-Internet, It includes hardware and software systems. According to the power output data complete solar power output device reliability monitoring, as the same time, analysis solar maximum power point tracking output deviceÂ´s efficiency, provides a quick and convenient means long-distance maintenance for solar power and related equipment, save a lot of maintenance costs, also can provide a objective data platform about the solar maximum power point tracking output devices. Using GPRS-DTU and GPRS-Internet communications connection realize remote monitoring. It uses force control software to storage and analysis data. Operation results show that the system stability, conveniently installation and operation.

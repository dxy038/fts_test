Looks closely into the effect of objective function optimisation on the architecture of systolic arrays. Various objective functions such as area, speed, throughput, AT and AT<sup>2</sup> have been considered. In each case, when the objective function is optimised, a different systolic array is produced. The authors present their approach systematically using the space-time techniques of mapping algorithms into systolic arrays.

This paper deals with the robust control problem for damping power system low-frequency oscillations considering the uncertainties. In the process of designing the damp controller, uncertain parameters are introduced into perturbation matrix, meanwhile, both the H&#8734; disturbance depression and the optimal H2 performances of the closed-loop control system are satisfied simultaneously for all allowable uncertainties. To solve the proposed multi-objective optimization problem, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are deduced based on the LMI optimization technology to obtain the output feedback controller. Simulation results of 4-machine-11-bus IEEE test system show that the proposed method is effective and robust.

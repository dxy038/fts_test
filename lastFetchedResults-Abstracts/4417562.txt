A full-duplex optical single sideband (OSSB) modulated radio-over-fiber (ROF) system with centralized light source is proposed and demonstrated. The proposed system can realize light source centralization based on optical sideband reuse, which not only avoids the use of a specific light source in the base station (BS) but also reduces signal distortion due to bidirectional fiber transmission. Using a simple optical filtering scheme in the BS, OSSB modulations for both downstream and upstream signals are achieved, which solves the power fading problem induced by fiber dispersion. In addition, no frequency up/down-conversion is required in the BS, leading to a simplified configuration. An experiment is carried out. Performance of the established 18 GHz full-duplex ROF system with bidirectional transmission through 20 km single mode fiber (SMF) is investigated. The results can verify that the proposed architecture is a good candidate for future high-speed and low-cost ROF networks.

Integrated optimization of structural topology and control system is considered. The problem is formulated
as mixed discrete-continuous multi-objective programming with a linear quadratic regulator cost index, and
measures of robustness and controllability as objectives. The Genetic Algorithm (GA), a guided random
search technique, is adopted for the problem-solving. A member elimination strategy that allows deleted
members to be recovered is suggested in the search procedure. As veri√ûcation for the proposed method,
optimum layout and actuator placement for a 45-bar truss is illustrated. Numerical results indicate that the
genetic algorithm can converge to optimum solutions by searching only a minor fraction of the solution
space. Discussions on the algorithm are presented

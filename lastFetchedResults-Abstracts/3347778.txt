Grid-connected microgrids with storage systems are reliable configurations for critical loads which can not tolerate interruptions of energy supply. In such cases, some of the energy resources should be scheduled in order to coordinate optimally the power generation according to a defined objective function. This paper defines a generationside power scheduling and economic dispatch of a grid-connected microgrid that supplies a fixed load and then, the scheduling is enhanced by including penalties in order to increase the use of the renewable energy sources and guarantee a high state of charge in the storage system for the next day. Linear models are proposed for the scheduling which are implemented in GAMS. The microgrid model is obtained deploying MATLAB/Simulink toolbox and then downloaded into dSPACE 1006 platform based on real-time simulation to test the economic dispatch. A compromise between cost and use of renewable energy is achieved.

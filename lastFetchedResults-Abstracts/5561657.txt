Photovoltaic inverterÂ´s well all-weather featured and inherent characteristic it requires unique high reliability and high efficiency. In this paper, Dual-BUCK grid-connected inverter as the research objective, for the present study SPWM control and hysteresis current control algorithm shortcomings, a least squares fixed switching frequency hysteresis current control algorithm for Dual-BUCK grid connected inverter control is proposed. Simulation and experimental results prove the feasibility of the algorithm and high reliability, switching frequency stability, high efficiency of the system, and the output current has the same frequency as grid voltage.

Reports on research geared toward recovering high-level abstractions from structured specifications. Our research goal is to investigate how other sources besides code can be used in the reverse engineering of software systems. Departing from structured specifications, we designed a process to recover business rules and domain facts. We use a simple representation scheme based on natural language with the objective to help the communication between software engineers and clients. Our results made us believe that our process is feasible and should aggregate value to the traditional code-level reverse engineering approaches

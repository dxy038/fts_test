One of the crises of our contemporary man is his nihilistic idea that says Existence is useless and denies any objective ground of moral truth. Nihilism has always had its many bad effects on human life such as the decline of families, mental harms or spiritual injuries. However, today’s thinkers have risen against those crises and proved that every other way except religious Faith and Godly belief will bring no positive result for humanity; and this has been exactly indicated through experience by practical proofs; otherwise, human social existence will definitely sink deeper in the mire of decadence. This is at the time when religious beliefs including Mahdism Thought can raise up a strong barricade against the attack of Nihilism to save today’s man from such a misfortune.
The writer of this article has tried to clarify and explain the effects of Mahdism and its basis to provide the clear road for traversing out of Nihilism to produce a meaningful life. This writing has also gone through the results of the Imam’s presence, our Expectation and Belief to do away with the dirty effects of Nihilism.

Modeling, in conjunction with testing, is a rich source of insight. Model parameters are easily controlled and monitoring can be done unobtrusively. The ability to inject faults without otherwise affecting performance is particularly critical. Many iterations can be done quickly with a model while varying parameters and conditions based on a small number of validation tests. The objective of model-based reliability analysis (MBRA) is to identify ways to capitalize on the insights gained from modeling to make both qualitative and quantitative statements about product reliability. MBRA is developed and exercised in the realm of weapon system development and maintenance, where the challenges of severe environmental requirements, limited production quantities, and use of oneshot devices can make testing prohibitively expensive. However, the general principles are also applicable to other product types

Purpoe
To determine with electronic monitoring an objective meaurement of adherence in two population of ubject: thoe uing once-daily protaglandin analog a ole ocular hypotenive therapy (one-drug group) and thoe requiring an adjunctive medicine to the protaglandin analog (two-drug group).
Deign

ingle-ite, open-label, nonrandomized, parallel deign of 60 day.
Method

ixty-two conecutive adult ubject with a diagnoi of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertenion: 31 were taking one drug and 31 were taking two drug. An electronic event medication monitoring device wa ued to record each bottle opening. The main outcome meaure were doing error (number of under-adherence or over-adherence event) and coverage (proportion of pharmacologic duration covered by doing) relative to the ophthalmologit-precribed regimen.
Reult

Adherence to the protaglandin once daily wa good in both group by all meaure (≤10% of ubject with more than five doing error and mean coverage of 97.2% ± 6.1%). Adherence to the econd medication in the two-drug group wa poorer (37% of ubject with more than five doing error and mean coverage of 85.6% ± 12.6%). For the ubject uing β-adrenoceptor antagonit, 24.8% ± 18.4% of doe were taken at le than 10-hour interval (over-adherence).
Concluion

The incorporation of a time component in electronic monitoring provide more information than precription refill rate or other method. We found that more complex doing regimen reult in poorer adherence, although once-daily drug in a complex doing regimen were found to have good adherence.

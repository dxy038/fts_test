The authors derive the storage capacity of a discrete bidirectional associative memory (BAM) based on the correct learning condition. The correct learning condition is a relaxed sufficient condition for a BAM matrix to possess the perfect recall property. In fact, the perfect recall property depends only on the way the equilibrium points are formed, since a discrete BAM is always asymptotically stable. The storage capacity provides a measure of probability that a given input to the BAM is perfectly recalled under the given situation. A comparison study between analytical and experimental results is reported. This experimental verification demonstrates the accuracy of the analytically derived formula for storage capacity

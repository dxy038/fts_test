A demonstration is presented of how to represent the objective function of the memory repair problem as a neural network energy function, and how to utilize the neural net´s convergence property to find near-optimal solutions. Two algorithms have been developed using a neural network, and their performance is compared with the ´repair most´ algorithm that is used commercially. For randomly generated defect patterns, the proposed algorithm with a hill-climbing capability has been found to be successful in repairing memory arrays in 98% of the cases, as opposed to the repair most algorithm´s 20% of cases.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

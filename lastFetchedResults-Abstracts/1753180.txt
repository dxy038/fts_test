To investigate the percentage reactor animals to SCCIT in sheep and goat the present study was carried out by using bovine and avian PPDs at 7 Livestock Experiment Stations of Punjab and villages around two cities. The overall percentage of reactor animals to SCCIT at farms in sheep and goat was 0.9% and 2.4%, while it was 0.4% and 0.0% around two cities, respectively. Hundred percent of goat and 86% of sheep farms under study had positive reactor animals. The reactor animals to SCCIT around two cities were 0% in goat and 0.4% in sheep. Goats (P &lt; 0.05) and sheep (P &lt; 0.001) kept with large ruminants at farms had higher percentage of reactor animals. Age showed significant (P &lt; 0.01) association with tuberculosis in sheep and goat. In goats of more than 6 years of age, the reactor animals to SCCIT were 5, 8 and 11 times higher than goats of 4.1–6, 3–4 and &lt;3 years of age. The reactor animals were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in goats of &lt;30 kg (3.5%) and &gt; 40 kg (3.5%) body weights, while these were less in goats weighing between 30 and 40 kg (1.5%). Sheep and goat breeds showed significant (P &lt; 0.001; P &lt; 0.05) difference in percentage of reactor animals to SCCIT. Beetal (3.9%) and Teddy breeds (2.9%) had 3.3 and 2.4 times higher percentages of reactor animals to SCCIT as compared to Pak-Angora (1.2%) breed. However, no animal of Nachhi and Dera Din Pinah breeds showed positive reaction to PPDs.

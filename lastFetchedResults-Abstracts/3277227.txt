The paper presents a power-compensated, 3&#215;3 reconfigurable, multiwavelength and bidirectional optical cross-connect (RMB-OXC) for all-optical communications networks. RMB-OXC characteristics and its performance are experimentally verified in a bidirectional 8-channel &#215; 10 Gb/s capacity system. We have observed only ~0.5 dB power penalty in the bidirectional transmission in comparison to the unidirectional transmission. The proposed RMB-OXC can be utilised in many applications in high-speed wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks.

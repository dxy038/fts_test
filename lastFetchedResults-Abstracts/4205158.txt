HASMOS is a system that has been developed in partnership by the Highways Agency (HA), WSP and its supply chain. Its ultimate objective is to enable Regional Control Centre (RCC) operators to monitor the motorway hard shoulder for obstructions by exception. HASMOS began as a project to research the feasibility of fusing disparate vehicle detector data and has progressed to its current status as a proof of concept using scanning millimetre wave radar as the primary means of detection. The most recent work has involved an on-road evaluation of HASMOS on the M42, which has shown the technology to be effective and has highlighted some areas for further development.

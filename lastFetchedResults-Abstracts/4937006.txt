The spatial optimal design of public investment can be genetic algorithm (GA) based. The basic public investment model with income maximization objective was established by reconstructing optimal economic growth model to resolve spatial fund distribution problem. The objective function and constraints were handled on basis of GA. Binary string method was applied to design encoding and decoding approach. Case study shows the validity of the basic public investment model and the GA-based solution. Table analysis describes how the weights of different regions and sectors affect the income maximization objective. It is verified that the model is able to provide reliable reference for governmental economic decision.

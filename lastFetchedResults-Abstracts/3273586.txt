The main objective of the paper is to do stability assessment of power electronics based electrical power system of TOSA electric bus. This paper mainly focuses on the stability of the common dc bus that multiple power converters are connected to. The TOSA bus electrical power system is modeled with Matlab/Simulink. The common dc bus stability is investigated under different operating conditions.

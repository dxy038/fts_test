Over the past decade, the power industry in many countries around the world has been undergoing massive changes to introduce competition. In power systems under transmission open access, an optimal schedule of generation of units to satisfy the demand at the minimum production and transmission costs with consideration of system operation constraints is an important issue. In this paper, a method for centralized economic dispatch in deregulated power systems is presented. The considered constraints are minimum and maximum power generation of units, capacity of transmission lines and ramp rate limits. A genetic algorithm is used to solve a nonlinear objective function. Simulations are performed on an IEEE 30-bus test system and the results are analyzed and commented.

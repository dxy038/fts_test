Objective
This study was undertaken to determine whether the N-acetyltransferase (NAT) phenotype contributes to the susceptibility for the development of preeclampsia.
Study design
The NAT acetylator status was determined by measuring urinary caffeine metabolites in 134 nonpregnant women with a history of preeclampsia and in 109 control women with uncomplicated pregnancy. The Ï‡2 and logistic regression analyses were used for statistical evaluation of differences in acetylator status.
Results
Significantly more fast acetylators were found among the women with a history of preeclampsia (46.3%) than among the controls (25.4%). Fast acetylators showed an odds ratio of 2.5 (95% CI 1.4-4.3) for preeclampsia. No differences in the acetylator status were found between women with a history of preeclampsia only and those with the HELLP syndrome as well.
Conclusion
The fast NAT acetylator status, which may result in altered NAT detoxifaction capacity, is associated with preeclampsia.

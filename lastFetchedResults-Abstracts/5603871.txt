This paper presents a new methodology of sizing optimization of a stand-alone hybrid renewable energy system. The developed approach makes use of a deterministic algorithm to minimize the life cycle cost of the system while guaranteeing the availability of the energy. Firstly, the mathematical modeling of the principal elements of the hybrid wind/PV system is exposed showing the main sizing variables. Then, the deterministic algorithm is presented and implemented to minimize the objective function which is equal to the life cycle cost of the hybrid system and finally, the obtained results are exposed and discussed.

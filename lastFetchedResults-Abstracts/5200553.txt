In this paper, we present a comparison of three control techniques: Nested Saturations, Backstepping and Sliding Modes. The control objective consists of obtaining the best control strategy to stabilize the position of a quad-rotor when using visual feedback. We propose a method to measure translational speed as well as the UAV 3D position in a local frame. The selected controllers were implemented and tested in real-time experiments. The obtained results demonstrate the performance of such methodologies applied to the quad-rotor system.

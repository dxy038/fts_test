The main objective of the study is to comprehend the dynamics of interactions between partners (caregivers, promoters, consultants, patients and managers) involved in the implementation process of an integrated delivery system designed to support the treatment of women with breast cancer. Preliminary findings permit to identify adoption/resistance factors at individual, professional and organizational levels in addition to technological factors. They give insights on the challenges to be faced when redesigning work processes in an interorganizational setting. Significant adoption factors include individual participation to the project and positive assessment of benefits of the system by individuals as well as by professional groups. On the other hand, the absence of a multidisciplinary committee and the complexity of the environment, the tasks and the technology are among the factors identified as troublesome. In terms of the dynamics of the process, our observation reveals that promoters have adopted a contingent and political approach. While this strategy is usually considered appropriate in healthcare organizations, information generated by this study has allowed for a better understanding of important factors and mechanisms to consider and address in the subsequent phases of implementation.

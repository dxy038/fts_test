Through Cochran's formula, 154 men and women of West Azerbaijan youth sports administrators were randomly selected. Data collections instruments consisted of two highly reliable questionnaires, namely, Clifford taxes and colleagues (2007) (α = .81) questionnaire of motivating factors and Lussier's (1993) questionnaire measuring ethical behavior (α = .78). Data submitted to a series of statistical analysis performed through IBM SPSS Ver.19 showed a significantly negative correlation between motivating factors and the ethical behavior of the staff in the organization.. This means that increase in the motivating factors may lead to a kind of flattery decision by the individual in terms of adhering to the ethical morals of behavior.

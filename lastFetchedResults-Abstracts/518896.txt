Objective- This randomized, double blind trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe, a new cholesterol-lowering agent with atorvastatin (Lipitor), a potent cholesterolinhibitor derivative. Method- Between September 2004 and March 2005, a total of 120 hyperlipidemic patients, aged 28-80 years, were randomized to receive ezetimibe 10 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg orally daily for 8 weeks after a 4-week washout phase and diet on NCEP step II. Mean changes of serum lipoproteins after 4 and 8 weeks of drug therapy were measured and compared in both groups of patients. Results- Ezetimibe reduced LDLc and total cholesterol by a mean of 27% and 16% compared with 32% and 24% for atorvastatin, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion- Ezetimibe and atorvastatin both reduced LDLc and TC with no statistically significant difference (Iranian Heart Journal 2007; 8 (1): 33-37).

This paper presents a Direct adaptive Fuzzy technique as a Power System Stabilizer (DFPSS). The technique utilizes fuzzy systems directly as a controller that incorporates fuzzy control rules in the design of the control law. In direct adaptive control, the parameters of the controller are directly adjusted to reduce the norm of the output error that represents mismatch between the plant and the reference model. The main objective of the designed controller is to damp local and inter-area oscillations that normally occur following power system disturbance. The performance of the proposed technique is illustrated through simulation studies of a two-area four-machine system. The article also includes a performance comparison between DFPSS and a well-tuned conventional power system stabilizer (CPSS).

Study Objective: We documented such menstrual disorders as dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB): dangerous health problem during adolescence.
Design, Setting, Participants: We gave a questionnaire containing 29 questions about menstruation to 3000 secondary school students in Adana, Turkey.
Results: The mean age of the students was 15.8 years; their menarche age was 12.9 years. Irregular periods were observed in 26.7% of the cases, 62.2% had at least one irregular bleeding in their lives, 11.3% visited a gynecologist for irregular bleeding, and 4.5% were treated for it. Dysmenorrhea occurred in 38.7% of the students. Forty-one percent used pain killers during their menstruation; half of them received the drugs from their family, and the other half received them over-the-counter without a prescription. Almost half (46.6%) of the girls experienced premenstrual problems. Most of the students (71.4%) discussed their menstrual problems with their mothers. Among the school girls, 15.8% claimed that there was a correlation between school examinations and irregular menses.
Conclusion: The questionnaire's results show that such menstrual disorders during adolescence as DUB are common but neglected. Medical staff who specialize in adolescent gynecology must address the problem.

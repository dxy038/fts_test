ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is recognized as one of the most common oral mucosal diseases without known pathogenesis. Free radicals can play an important role in the pathogenesis of   RAS. The aim of this study was investigation of salivary oxidative stress and antioxidant system of patients with oral aphthae in compared to healthy individuals.
METHODS: In this case-control study, 20 patients with RAS (case group) and 20 age and gender-matched healthy subjects (control group) were selected. Unstimulated saliva of the RAS patients in ulcerative stage and healthy subjects was collected. Salivary TAC (total antioxidant capacity) and MDA (malondialdehyde) of two groups were investigated and compared using FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) and TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) methods respectively.
FINDINGS: The mean and standard deviation of salivary MDA in case group was 0.526± 0.092 ?M and in control group was 0.232±0.061 ?M (p < 0.0001). The mean and standard deviation of salivary TAC in case group was 542.60±113.509 ?M and in control group was 619.30±131.303 ?M. No significant difference in the level of TAC was found between the two groups. TAC was reduced in case and control groups in line with increase in the level of MDA (p=0.022, r= -0.36).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that oxidant level increases and TAC does not change in RAS patients.

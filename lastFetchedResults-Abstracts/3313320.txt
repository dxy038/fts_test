The main objective of this work is to develop an observer for aerospace application. The proposed mechanism of attitude control of satellite involves estimation of key parameters for Ex: Angle of inclination, Velocity of system, of the system by an observer and then generating the appropriate control action. An observer or state observer is a device which observes or estimates the state variables of a system. The observer sends the control signal to the controller which generates appropriate control action for the system such that the system will be stabilized. First, the controller is designed to stabilize, following pole placement technique. Then observer is determined, which estimates the non-measurable state variables and gives appropriate feedback to the controller such that the controller generates suitable control signal and the satellite attitude can be controlled.

Objective Patient’s language, tradition, conventions, and
customs may all determine integration into a society and are
also part of the doctor–patient relationship that influences
diagnostic and therapeutic outcome. Language barrier and
sociocultural disparity of Eastern and Southern European
patients may hamper recovery from pain and depression
compared to Middle European patients in Switzerland.
Methods In a prospective naturalistic observational trial
we investigated the influence of regional origin on treatment
outcome in 420 pain sufferers with depressive
symptoms from all over Switzerland who were treated with
venlafaxine by 122 physicians in primary care. Physicians
rated severity of depressive symptoms using the clinical
global impression severity scale and pain intensity by
means of visual analogue scales. We hypothesized that in
Eastern and Southern European patients the magnitude of
pain reduction under treatment with venlafaxine is less
compared to Middle European patients.
Results Three months after study entry, Middle European
patients were found to profit more from treatment with
venlafaxine in terms of severity of depression and pain
intensity than patients from Eastern Europe and Southern
Europe.
Conclusion Regional origin may contribute to the magnitude
of pain reduction in patients with depressive
symptoms under treatment with venlafaxine. Our results
provide a rational for care provider educational programs
aimed at improving capacities in treating patients from
different regional origin with psychosomatic complaints
such as depression and comorbid pain

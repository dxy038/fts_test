Mandible or facial bone reconstruction is a serious challenge in craniomaxillofacial surgery. Careful presurgical planning or availability of objective methods to evaluate the three-dimensional (3-D) shape of the patient mandible is necessary to achieve predictable outcomes. The aim of this paper is to apply 3-D techniques of volumetric reconstruction and image processing for planning distraction osteogenesis of the mandible, involving the use of 3-D modeling. To accomplish this task, suitable two-dimensional (2-D)-to-3-D image processing is used in order to obtain a 3-D model of the mandible from standard 2-D computed tomography images. The goal of this paper is to provide the surgeon with a 3-D model of the patient mandible, where it would be possible to find, in the presurgical phase, the exact point of implant with respect to the patientÂ´s anatomy and to build a custom-made prosthesis that properly fits the bone surface of the patient for correct control of the vector during the progressive traction of the bone segments

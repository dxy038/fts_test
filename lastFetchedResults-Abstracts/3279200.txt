The objectives of the current paper are, firstly a treat of two principal elements in any manufacturing system thatÂ´s are, the maintenance of an equipment and quality of product. These two elements are generally treated almost in isolation from different approaches. The second objective is a design of meta-model approach using multi-agent system on quality control and machine maintenance in production system. The agent-based system framework, in which various intelligent agents worked together to perform maintenance tasks and quality control in an autonomous and collaborative way, is addressed.

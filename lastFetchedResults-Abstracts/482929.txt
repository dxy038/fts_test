Introduction: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a tropical diseases caused by Leishmania major, which sandflies are vectors and rodents are reservoirs host. Turkmen Sahara after Isfahan, is the most important endemic disease focus in Iran.
Objective: Determination of Leishmania Infections in Rodents, Reservoir Hosts of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leismaniasis in Turkemen Sahara, Gonbad, Golastan Province.
Materials and Methods: Rodents were captured by live-capture tarps. Cucumber and sometimes date were used for bating, A part of rodents ears was used to have serousite. Serosite transferred into NNN media, a part of rodents ears was used for sliding and staining for amastigote detection and other parts were used for inoculation to susceptible animal (Balb/c) in suspension form and biopsy was used.
Results: 40 rodents were captured, 27 were Rhombomis opimus, 12 were Meriones libycus and one was Meriones persicus. Of 40 rodents captured, 5 were positive in routine laboratory methods which 3 positive were M. libycus, one was R. opimus and one was M. persicus
Conclusion: Besides these new findings in R. opimus as well as in M libycus and M. persicus. These two rodents should be considered as reservoirs of ZCL in region.

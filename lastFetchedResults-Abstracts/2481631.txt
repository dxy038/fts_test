Background: Inhibition of angiogenesis is one of the goals of cancer treatment. In traditional medicine, Allium sativum L. and Ferula assa-foetida are consider as the important medicinal plants. The effect of electromagnetic field (EMF) on different aspects of cell growth has been confirmed.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of shoots of Allium sativum L., Ferula assa-foetida extract and low frequency EMF on angiogenesis.
Methods: 100 fertilized eggs were randomly divided into 10 groups: control (treated with distilled water), sham one (normal saline), sham two (EMF off), experimental one (shoot of Allium sativum L. extract), experimental two (shoot of Ferula assa-foetida), experimental three (combination of Allium sativum L. and Ferula assa-foetida), experimental four (EMF with intensity of 100 gauss), experimental five (Allium sativum L. + EMF), experimental six (Ferula assafoetida + EMF), experimental seven (combination of Allium sativum L. and Ferula assa-foetida + EMF). Extract was injected on the 8th day of incubation and samples were exposed to EMF on 10th day. On 12th day, Chorioalantoic membrane was photographed and the length and numbers of vessels were measured.
Results: There was a significant decrease in mean number and length of vessels in experimental groups one, two, four, five and six compared with the control group. The most significant decrease was created in group three, especially in group seven (P < 0.05). In addition, extract of Ferula assa-foetida has anti-angiogenesis effect more than Allium sativum L.
Conclusion: Allium sativum L. and Ferula assa-foetida have inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and these effects amplifying by EMF.

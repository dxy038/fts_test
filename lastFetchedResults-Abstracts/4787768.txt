Multi-objective decision making is in urgent need for spatial multi-criteria evaluation and it is necessary to make further developed within GIS. Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) is a relatively new Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) method. In GIS-based OWA method, both criteria weights and order weights are considered. According to the results of GIS-based ordered weighted averaging method, a compromise solution to the multi-objective problems with conflicting objectives is investigated. Calculation method of order weights based on Orness, and construction method of comparison matrix for criteria weights based on analytical hierarchy program (AHP), are introduced. Single objective multi-criteria evaluations with GIS-based OWA method for conflicting objectives are worked out. As an example application in Tangshan City, single-objective suitability maps are obtained, and the multi-objective problem is solved. Finally, the calculating results are analyzed, and some advice is proposed.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical and biochemical outcome of patients with advanced prostate cancer treated by complete androgen blockage (CAB).Material and Methods: A total number of thirty patients with histologically confirmed advance prostate cancer and serum PSA level of more than 30ng/ml were subjected to bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy, supplemented with oral antiandrogens. These patients were followed for a period of two years by recording their symptoms and serum PSA level at twelve weeks intervals.Results: Only 16(53.33%) patients complied with the protocol of the study and observed two years followup. 12(75%) patients showed complete response to CAB while 4(25%) patients showed rising PSA levels and became symptomatic after one year of treatment.Conclusion: CAB is still the treatment of choice for patients with advanced prostate cancer.

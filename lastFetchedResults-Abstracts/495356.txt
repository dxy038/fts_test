BACKGROUND and objective: Intensive care units are hot zones for emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Pneumonia is the most frequent nosocomial infection in ICUs and may have up to 70 percent mortality rate. Our study was designed to identify the antibiotic-resistance of Gram negative bacillus which separated from cultures of ICU-patients respiratory secretion in Yahya-nejad hospital's ICU.

Materials and methods: this descriptive cross-sectional study performed from all patients who stay more than three days at ICU, with five days interval regularly and achieve to 300 cultures from 91 patients at last. Antibiotic-resistance pattern of Gram negative bacillus that grew in cultures was determined.

Results: Entrobacter (43/3%) and pseudomonas aeroginosa (8%) were the most frequent bacteria grew in die cultures. Gram negative bacillus was sensitive to Imipenem more than the others. In 8 cultures, the Gram negative micro-organisms were resistant to all type of antibiotics.

CONCLUSION: It's better to recognize the most frequent bacteria and their antibiotic-sensitivity pattern in each ICU wherever in the world and choose an appropriate strategy for empirical therapy in these cases with consult with infectious specialist.

Hybrid power generation systems are becoming very popular due to the advance in renewable energy technologies. Solar and wind are the most widely used renewable energy sources for generating the electrical power. Their availability usually is shifted in time. Therefore; it may be advantageous to consider both sources as simultaneous option when designing an electricity supply system in an arid sites. In this work a system with hybrid power supply, harvesting PV and wind power in combination, integrated with battery storage, is studied, with the objective of satisfying the electricity demand while optimizing the cost. The algorithm efficiency and the results of the presented new Electricity System Cascade Analysis (ESCA) were demonstrated by a case of study of a house and three water pumps. The daily energy consumption of the system is 44.235 kWh. The size of the installed PVP, wind turbine capacity and the inverter has been minimized using the modified procedure.

This paper introduces a system based on light sensors that can, associated with a computational methodology, extract information about public lighting points. The objective is to give electricity companies exact information about the actual luminaries and bulbs installed on the lighting poles, thus minimizing commercial losses. A brief description of the equipment is presented, as well as the theoretical background on the technique applied to classify lamp types and wattages. The system performance is initially evaluated from the first experimental results, obtained from laboratory and field tests.

Concept of Virtual Power Plant (VPP) can be used to aggregate Distributed Energy Resources (DER) units into restructured power systems. This paper presents an optimization model that provides optimal operating strategy and benefit maximization scheme as well as the reduction of the emission for a VPP. The VPP considered in this paper consists of a wind turbine, a CHP
system, several DGs, and loads with curtailment options. VPP can be participated in wholesale power market as an entity with dual role including producer and consumer. The presented model is a nonlinear mixed-integer programming problem with constraints. In this problem, Objective function is VPP profit with aim supply both thermal and electrical energy demands.The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach to satisfy the demand and to reduce emissions.

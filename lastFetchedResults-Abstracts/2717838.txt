This paper proposes a novel integrated converter topology for interfacing between the energy storage system and the dc bus for a residential microgrid application. The proposed integrated full-bridge-forward dc&#8211;dc converter presents the following features: low number of active devices compared to the converters usually applied to similar applications, low input and output current ripple, high voltage ratio, bidirectional power flow, and galvanic isolation. A double-ended forward converter with particularities such as no extra transformer demagnetizing circuit is originated from the integration process. This converter is approached in detail in this paper, including three different clamping circuits which are analyzed and compared. The structure, principle of operation, analysis, transformer design methodology, comparison with the dual active bridge converter, and experimental results of the proposed topology are presented.

This paper provides an improved search algorithm for optimal route planning by rebuilding the search area in intelligent transport system. The theory foundation is that the classical Dijsktra algorithm has not any directional feature during searching the optimal path, and the bidirectional Dijsktra has its own limit. Based on the analysis of the two algorithms, the new improved algorithm proposed in this paper reduces the search area and the time complexity. Finally, combining with the practical application of route planning algorithm in intelligent transport system, one example is given. Theory analysis and test result show that the improved algorithm costs less search time and visits less nodes of road network. Besides that, some methods are proposed to handle unexpected disturbance, such as accident or traffic limit. Two models for introducing dynamics in the system are introduced as individual edge dynamics and geometrical objects. These methods are useful in practice.

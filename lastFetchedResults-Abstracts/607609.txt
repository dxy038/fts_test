An important part of engineering controllable problems, in particular chemical engineering, is the regulator kind. In other side, the modified conjugate gradient method and the embedding method have strong abilities in solving these problems. This paper with illustrating the two methods algorithms for solving such problems will compare these two approaches analytically and numerically. Also, they will be applied for calculating the trajectory and optimal control of a continuous stirred tank of a chemical reactor, which is not computed with these two methods yet. For this purpose, by presenting numerical examples, the optimal value of objective function with the obtained trajectory and optimal control via these methods, will be compared.

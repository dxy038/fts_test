This study is concerned with the problem of robust reliable dissipative fllter design for networked control systems (NCSs) with sensor failures and random packet dropouts. The considered NCS model is subject to the sources of uncertainty in the system parameters. The sensor signals are modelled by sequences of a Bernoulli distributed white sequence and the packet dropouts may occur randomly during transmission. The main objective is to design a suitable reliable dissipative fllter such that, for all network-induced imperfections, a resulting error system is robustly stochastically stable and strictly (Q, S, R) dissipative. The results are obtained for known as well as unknown sensor failure rates, so the results are more general one because it can guarantee the dissipativity of system whether or not the sensor encounter failures. The sufflcient conditions for existence of fllters are derived in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach and the corresponding fllter parameters can be obtained by solution to a set of LMIs, which can be easily solved by using some standard numerical packages. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed fllter design.

Objectives Vocal modulations characterize many styles of singing. Vibrato, trill, and trillo are some of the ornaments that Western classical singers use. Likewise, taan is one of the basic frequency modulations demonstrated by Hindustani Indian classical singers. The objective of this descriptive study was to discover the F0 contour of taan; establish selected acoustic, aerodynamic, and glottographic characteristics of the taan gesture; and explore the pedagogical taan utterances demonstrated by a well-known singer and teacher. Study Design Exploratory. Methods Fundamental frequency, alternating current (AC) glottal flow, and electroglottographic width measures were obtained for taan productions by the classical Indian singer and teacher who demonstrated taan rate variations based on his pedagogical approach. Results The structure of the taan gesture was found to be an F0 lowering and rising (the â€œtaan dipâ€‌) followed by a relatively flat portion (the â€œtaan superior surfaceâ€‌). Rate of the F0 structure of the taan gestures ranged from approximately 1.65 to 3.41آ Hz, and the F0 extent ranged from 1.87 to 2.21آ semitone (ST). As the rate of the taan gesture increased, the superior surface shortened, whereas the taan dip stayed relatively constant (ranging from 170 to 230 ms). AC flow was greater for the lowest frequencies of the dip and faster rates. Conclusions The pedagogical taan gesture has a specific structure of an F0 dip followed by a relatively flat F0 portion that shortens as taan rate increases. The F0 dip and extent are relatively robust across rate. The taan productions are voluntarily controlled, in contrast to vibrato productions.

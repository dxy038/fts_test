Objective
This study was undertaken to determine how consistently indigent, predominantly Hispanic women who had previously selected male condoms as their contraceptive method had used condoms and emergency contraception (EC) during the 2 weeks before their family planning clinic visit and reasons for any nonuse.
Study design
Cross-sectional survey with no personal identifiers collected.
Results
Two hundred forty-eight women were surveyed. Overall, 43.8% of sexually active women reported inconsistent condom use during the prior 14 days. Only 39% of women who had not used condoms consistently used EC at least once. The most common reason for nonuse of both condoms (44%) and EC (41%) was that the woman did not perceive that she was at risk.
Conclusion
Inconsistent use of condoms and low use of EC are very frequent, even in a short-time frame. Patients may be reluctant to volunteer to clinicians their real contraceptive choices. Risk taking occurs at high rates, even among couples provided ready and free access to male condoms and EC.

Infliximab is a tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor (neutralising antibody), which is increasingly being used as an immunosuppressant to manage inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease. Its side effects include diabetes mellitus, an increased incidence of lymphoma and greater susceptibility to infections such as pulmonary tuberculosis. In patients on infliximab, the oral cavity may act as a bacterial reservoir leading to unwanted local or systemic complications. To date no report describes the potential implication/s of infliximab in patients having oral surgery. This case report may be the first in the English language to report the development of mandibular osteomyelitis after surgical extraction in a patient on infliximab.

Background and Objective: One of the major concerns of surgeons and patients is repairing of bone loss due to various factors. Many materials have been made to improve the quantity and quality of bone loss repair. The aim of this research was radiographic evaluation of healing process of human bone loss created after implantation of HECBMG (Human Endochondral Bone Matrix Gelatin) and DBM (Demineralized Bone Matrix) placed in tooth extraction defects.

Materials and Methods: Statistical society of this study was all teeth extracted from one group and its remaining bone socket that their owners agreed to work via a constant sheet. Samples were randomly divided into three groups. At the main group, 2 milligrams “HECBMG” was placed into bone defect. The defects of positive control group were filled by 2 milligrams of “DBM” and the defects of the third group that was negative control group were left empty.

Results: Statistical test(fridman)showed  Significant difference in radiographic results between main group and negative control group at the 4th month of post-operative (p<0.05) “HECBMG” group was superior to negative control group at the 4th post-operative month (p<0.03) and “DBM” group was superior to negative control group at the 4th post-operative month (p<0.02) too. 

Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that satisfactory healing occurred in human bone loss defect by use of HECBMG more than DBM.

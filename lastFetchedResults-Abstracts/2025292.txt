Banana bacterial wilt caused by Xanthomonas campestri pv musacearum (Xcm) threatens the banana industry which contributes 22% of the GDP in Uganda. An important step in controlling this disease involves understanding how it is spread. The occurrence of isolated cases of disease in remote places in various districts far from the originally identified places suggest involvement of long distance vectors in the transmission. This study was initiated with the objective of establishing bats & birdsâ€™ vectors and transmission mechanisms of Xcm.  An inventory of bats & birds species associated with banana inflorescence was carried out so as to investigate possible sources of inoculums in banana plants and determine bat and bird species that carried the bacterium on their bodies and thus possible vectors of the disease. The longest period the bacterium could stay viable on bats & birds mouth parts was determined. The purpose was to find out the possibility of involvement in long distance transmission of Xcm. The most birds visiting the male flowers are Eastern grey plantain eater, Double toothed barbet, Sunbird and village weaverbird. Bats that visited the male flower were Aidulon helvum, Epomophorus labiatus and Epomaps franquet.  Bacterial cells have been isolated from these species and some of them were able to retain viable cells up to five days increasing the possibility of being involved in long distance transmission of Xcm.

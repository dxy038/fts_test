Identification of multiple auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) can be made by objective detection techniques. According to general literature on the subject, the spectral F test (SFT) is one of the frequency domain techniques that can be utilized. This study has the objective to evaluate how parameters like sweep length and number of bins affects the performance of the detector based on SFT, in order to determine the best parameters to monitor ASSRs. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, applied on signals that have been collected from 14 subjects aged between 10 and 26, was the performance measurement adopted. The results obtained suggest the utilization of 8 seconds sweep length and 20 adjacent bins.

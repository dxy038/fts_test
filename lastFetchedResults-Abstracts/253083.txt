The capacity of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli to
multiply in the roots of 12 non-host plant species was
determined with the objective of selecting potential
candidates for crop rotation and/or green manuring in
infested bean ®elds. The plants were inoculated at the
seedling stage by a benomyl-resistant mutant of the
pathogen using the root-dip technique and transplanted
to natural soil. The number of colony forming units/g
dry root tissue (CFU/g) was determined at the full bloom
stage. Quantitatively, the root colonization diered
greatly among the plant species. The roots and lower
stem of Dolichos lablab, Phaseolus lunatus, Mucuna
aterrima, Canavalia ensiforme and Vigna unguiculata
were the most compatible with the pathogen and those of
Sorghum bicolor, Crotalaria juncea, Oryza sativa and Zea
mays were least compatible. No disease symptoms
developed on any plant species. Chlamydospore germi-
nation in the rhizosphere also diered signi®cantly
among the plant species. There was no correlation
between percentage chlamydospore germination in the
rhizosphere and extent of root colonization. Most plant
species recommended for green manuring in bean ®elds
allowed extensive root and stem colonization by F. o. f.
sp. phaseoli and were considered as reservoir hosts. All
three of the gramineous species tested and C. juncea were
classed as non-reservoir host, because the pathogen did
not colonize the stem and its multiplication in the roots
was very low. These plant species appear to be good
candidates for long-term ®eld evaluation to determine
their usefulness in an integrated management of Fusa-
rium bean-wilt.

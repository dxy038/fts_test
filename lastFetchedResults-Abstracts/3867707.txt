A 610 kG gate array with simultaneous bidirectional I/O circuits has been developed using 0.5 &#956;m CMOS four metal layer process technology. The number of I/O circuits is 608. A digitally-impedance-controlled low voltage swing output buffer circuit achieves high data throughput and low power. The maximum effective communication bandwidth is 600 Mb/s per pin, and the average power consumption of the I/O circuits is 12 mW per pin. A PLL can create the proper clock edge timing to latch data of 300 Mb/s with 120 ps of peak-to-peak jitter. Wide data band width can be obtained using a 1000 pin-class package for parallel processor systems

The main objective of virtual laboratories (VLABs) is to solve the various time and/or space type problems that prevent the normal working of real laboratories but the VLABs services are permanent target of different dangerous. In this paper, we present a dynamic public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure the inter users and a VLAB communications. Our VLAB is constituted of a set of manipulations stations (MSTs) and their common security server (SS). Our PKI environment is composed of a PKI server (PKIServ) to manage the users-VLAB communications security and a monitoring service (MS) to automate its functioning. A prototype has been implemented with CORBA environment and same experimental results are presented.

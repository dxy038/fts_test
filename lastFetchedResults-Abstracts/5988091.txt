Before being executed, Grid workflow activity diagram models should be analyzed and corrected as early as possible to avoid any costly maintenance delays due to runtime errors. To reach this objective, we define a verification framework which verifies UML activity diagrams against some workflow requirements using NuSMV model checker. For this we propose an homomorphic transformation to realize a correct and complete mapping from UML activity diagrams to NuSMV language.

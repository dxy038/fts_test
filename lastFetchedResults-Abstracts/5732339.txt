The objective of this article is to propose a new method to adapt the weight factor applying for partial interference cancellation in multirate CDMA cellular mobile communication systems. The proposed scheme in weight factor decision utilizing matched filter output variance from the previous stage is compared with groupwise weighted PIC (GW-PIC) and standard PIC (SPIC). The simulation results show that performance of the proposed method is better than that of the GW-PIC and the SPIC

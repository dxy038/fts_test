Bidirectional motion compensation is an efficient method for frame rate upconversion application. To enhance bidirectional motion vector field (MVF) accuracy, most recent approaches derive it from unidirectional motion vectors (MVs), which may introduce blocking artifacts around object boundaries due to the block-wise motion assignment. Presented is a joint trilateral motion vector filter to improve the MV accuracy of boundary pixels by increasing the resolution of the block-wise unidirectional MVF to a pixel basis. The MV of each pixel is computed as a weighted average of its neighbouring block MVs. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the MV accuracy of boundary pixels effectively. Frames interpolated by the proposed method achieve better performance compared with conventional methods.

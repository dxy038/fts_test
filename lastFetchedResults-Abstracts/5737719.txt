A combined O3/BAC (biological activated carbon) process for the removal of DBP(disinfection by-product) precursors from drinking water and maintenance of biological stability in distribution system is being investigated. The objective of this study is to evaluate removal of THMFP and AOC (assimilable organic carbon) during long term operation of an O3/BAC process. A pilot scale experiment for drinking water supply was operated for one year in a water treatment plant in southern China. AOC and THMFP removal were maintained at 35.2% and 11.8%, respectively and as a result, THMs concentration and bacterial regrowth maintained at a low level in water distribution system.

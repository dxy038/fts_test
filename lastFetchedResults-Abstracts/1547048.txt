This paper investigates the problem of designing a nonlinear H âˆž feedback controller for polynomial discrete-time systems with and without polytopic uncertainties. The objective is to design a controller such that the ratio between the energy of the regulated outputs and the energy of the exogenous disturbance/inputs is minimized or guaranteed to be less or equal to a prescribed value. It is well known that the state dependant or parameter dependant Lyapunov function is always chosen for synthesizing polynomial discrete-time systems. This leads the solution to be nonconvex because the Lyapunov function and the controller matrix are coupled and therefore cannot be solved by semidefinite programming (SDP). Hence, in this paper, an integrator is proposed to be incorporated into the controller structure. In doing so, the coupling of Lyapunov function and controller matrix can be eliminated effectively. This somehow simplifies the numerical solution of the problem. Then, by using SOS decomposition approach, sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed controller are provided in terms of solvability of the state-dependent linear matrix inequalities (SDLMIs) which can be solved by SDP. A tunnel diode circuit is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrator approach.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the freeze drying and solvent dehydration allograft preservation methods on the mechanical properties of the graft material. Methods: Bone blocks obtained from bovine humeri were divided into three groups. Samples in the first group were freeze dried, samples in the second group were dehydrated by solvents and samples in the third group were used as controls. All samples underwent three point bending test to investigate bending strength and were evaluated for calcium content. Results: Bending strength of both the freeze-dried and solvent-dehydrated samples were found to have decreased significantly compared to that of the control group. The calcium content of the solvent dehydrated group was also significantly lower than that of the control group. Conclusion: Our results suggested that both preservation techniques, used to dehydrate bone, have negative effects on the bending strength of bone as they decrease the mechanical properties of the graft material.

Comprehensive utilization of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy is a hot issue nowadays, but how to decide capacity ratio of EV charging infrastructures, EV batteries and wind power generators in micro-grid is still unsolved. The present paper presents a model to perform the optimum sizing of a non-grid-connected wind power system integrated with battery-exchange stations. In the model, the objective function is minimum total cost considering energy storage capacity of battery-exchange mode and EVsÂ´ energy demand, including total cost of investment, operation and energy shortage, and the constraint conditions of wind power system, recharge and discharge machines and EV batteries are considered. Differential evolution (DE) algorithm is then used to solve optimal capacity allocation. In the end, the system planning example of an area shows that the model is effective and logical.

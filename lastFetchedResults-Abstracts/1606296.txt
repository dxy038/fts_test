BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Red lentil is a leguminous species that can provide an important source of phenolic compounds in human diets. The present study was performed with the aim of investigating the hepatoprotective potential of the ethanolic extract of red lentil against carbon tetrachloride induced liver damage in mice.
METHODS: This experimental study was performed on 50 male mature albino mice. Animals were divided into five groups. Group 1 received normal saline orally for 10 days, group 2 received carbon tetrachloride (1 ml/kg, ip) only on the 10th day; groups 3-5 received extract orally in doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively, during 10 days and carbon tetrachloride (1 ml/kg, ip) on the 10th day 1 hour after last dose of extract. Blood and liver samples were collected 24 h after carbon tetrachloride injection. Then serum activity of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was measured. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated in liver homogenates. The biochemical findings were matched with histopathological verifications.
FINDINGS: Carbon tetrachloride significantly increased lipid peroxidation and Levels of hepatic enzymes. Red lentil extract administration significantly reduced the activity of liver enzymes compared with carbon tetrachloride. Effective dose (400 mg/kg) reduces the enzymes AST, ALT and ALP of 341.43±12.15, 116.43±9.40, 243.34±9.21 to 242.12±14.32 (p=0.007), 78.70±8.13 (p=0.002) and 78.70±8.13 (p =0.004) respectively. Histological results showed that carbon tetrachloride could lead to liver damage and necrosis is obvious. 
CONCLUSION: The results revealed that hydroalcoholic extract of red lentil has protective effect on liver toxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride.

Web services have received much interest due to their potential to design and build complex interenterprise business applications. A particular interest concerns dynamic web services composition that offers the opportunity for creating new web services at runtime from those already published in uddi registry. However, this composition requires necessarily quantifying criteria for web service selection to build a more appropriated one. The objective of this paper is to suggest an answer of this challenge by proposing a flexible architecture for dynamic web services composition related to userÂ´s requirements and to the availability of critical resources. In addition, this architecture has the ability to re-configure at runtime the created composite service, if some failures happen, in order to maintain a better quality of composite service.

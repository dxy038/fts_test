In todayÂ´s commercial data centers, the computation density grows continuously as the number of hardware components and workloads in units of virtual machines increase. The service availability guaranteed by data centers heavily depends on the reliability of the physical and virtual servers. In this study, we conduct an analysis on 10K virtual and physical machines hosted on five commercial data centers over an observation period of one year. Our objective is to establish a sound understanding of the differences and similarities between failures of physical and virtual machines. We first capture their failure patterns, i.e., the failure rates, the distributions of times between failures and of repair times, as well as, the time and space dependency of failures. Moreover, we correlate failures with the resource capacity and run-time usage to identify the characteristics of failing servers. Finally, we discuss how virtual machine management actions, i.e., consolidation and on/off frequency, impact virtual machine failures.

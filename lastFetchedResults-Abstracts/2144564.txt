Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are toxic contaminants with a persistent character and adverse effects on humans and wildlife. Therefore, the deposition of these chemicals in vegetation must be carefully controlled. Our objective was to determine PBDE concentrations (BDEs 28, 47, 66, 85, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 and 209) in Pleurozium schreberi collected in a heavily industrialized urban agglomeration. High PBDE concentrations in the moss confirm the presence of active sources of atmospheric pollution in an area tested. The distribution of these xenobiotics was related to the vegetation cover being lower in sites surrounded by forests which indicates that PBDEs may have a tendency to be trapped from the air by tree leaves and needles. Congener profiles in P. schreberi were dominated by BDE 209 which was for 79% (in case of the coke smelter) to 95% (in case of the chemical plant) part of the total PBDE burden in this moss. The principal component and classification analysis classifying the concentration of PBDEs in P. schreberi allowed us to distinguish the pattern of these compounds characteristic for the origin of pollution. P. schreberi may be used as a bioindicator for PBDEs in areas contaminated with these chemicals.

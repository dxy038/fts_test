The main objective of the SONATA project, within the European Union ACTS programme, is to define and demonstrate a single-layer network platform for end-to-end optical connections between a large number of network terminals, including both business and residential customer terminals. The &#8220;switchless&#8221; network concept was originally proposed to provide all customer connections within a national-scale, all-optical network, simply by employing time and wavelength agility at the network terminals (WDMA/TDMA). This paper describes the work underway in ACTS SONATA to demonstrate the concept and further define it in terms of network control, management and interfacing issues, as well as further physical impairments

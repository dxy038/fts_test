Introduction: The formation of oxides on the surface of the metal are proven to contribute to the formation of strong bonding. However, the base metal alloys are expected to exhibit more oxidation than high gold alloys, increase in oxide layer thickness due to repeated firing in them can reduce the bond strength.
Objective:The aim of this study was to compare the effect of porcelain firing on the bond strenght of of two base metal allays(1 ranian super cast and original super cast) The cast of original alloy is more expensive that Iranian one and there was no Comparison between the bond strenght of these two alloys.
Materials and Methods: A sample from both alloys with dimensions of 24x 6x 0.5 was obtained and applied on the middle one third of metal plates andther tested in a instrun 1195 machine and data were analyzed with student t test. (P50.05)
Result: The mean of bond strenght Iranian super cast was 13 N and original was 13.13 N.
Conclusion: That results showed no significant differences between bonds and (P=0.651) both alloys passed the ISO 9693 exam.

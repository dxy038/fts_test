A new high efficiency zero-voltage and zero- current switching (ZVZCS) bidirectional DC/DC converter is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter consists of two half-bridge cells as the input and output stages, symmetrically. MOSFETs of input stage are turned-on in ZVS condition, and those of output stage are turned-off in ZCS condition. In addition, MOSFETs of input and output stages have low voltage stresses clamped to input and output voltage, respectively. Therefore, the proposed converter has high efficiency and high power density. The operational principles are analyzed and the advantages of the proposed converter are described. The 300 W prototype of the proposed converter is implemented for 42 V hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) application in order to verify the operational principles and advantages

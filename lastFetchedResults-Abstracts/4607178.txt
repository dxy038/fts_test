The Grid service application workflow models are composed and built on an abstract level using UML Activity Diagram composition patterns. By following the MDA principals, the provided models represent the Platform Independent Model. To be executed, workflow activity diagram models should be translated into BPEL4WS models which will be executed by the BPEL4WS engine. To reach this objective, we define a meta-model based transformation from UML activity diagrams to BPEL4WS language. To ensure the transformation between all Activity Diagram composition patterns and BPEL4WS constructs, we propose in this paper an extension of the BPEL4WS construct set. The extension deals with the alternative service composition pattern.

In this paper we present the distributor game, which is the first of a series of management games developed for todayÂ´s supply chain challenges such as globalization, increasing importance of the customer role and mass customization. The learning objective for players of the distributor game is centered around globalization and the real-time supply chain. The decision making processes of the distributors in the game are controlled by human players. To confront the human players with a complex and dynamic environment, suppliers and markets are represented by computer-controlled actors. After playing the game for the first time with 32 MBA students, it was evaluated using a detailed questionnaire, the results clearly showed the value of the game. Further research will focus on software services to make game instantiation easier and to enhance the support for development and use of simulation-based supply chain management games.

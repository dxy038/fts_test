The paper deals with the changes of the modal parameters of a r.c frame building sited in Camerino, Italy. Operational modal analysis were performed before and after the seismic retrofitting of the building achieved with an innovative system that uses external steel towers equipped with dissipative devices. Before retrofitting, ambient vibration tests were carried out with the aim of evaluating the actual linear dynamic behavior of the building including the contribution of non-structural components (e.g. external and internal walls); modal parameters, i.e. natural frequencies and mode shapes determined by means of experimental modal analysis, allowed the calibration of a predictive f.e. model of the building which was crucial for the final design of the retrofitting system. Tests were repeated after the retrofitting works, with the main objective to verify that changes of modal parameters are in agreement with those predicted by the f.e. model. Results and comparisons between the modal parameters obtained before and after the retrofitting works demonstrate that the ambient vibration tests and the data processing techniques used allow the identification of the dynamic behavior of r.c. few-storeys buildings under operating conditions and, then, the identification of dynamic changes due to seismic retrofitting works performed with external steel &#8220;dissipative towers&#8221;. A model updating procedure is carried out to identify the value of the elastic modulus of the different materials constituting structural and non-structural elements.

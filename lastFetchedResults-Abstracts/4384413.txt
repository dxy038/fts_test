In view of its special features, the brushless doubly fed induction generator (BDFIG) shows high potentials to be employed as a variable-speed drive or wind generator. However, the machine suffers from low efficiency and power factor and also high level of noise and vibration due to spatial harmonics. These harmonics arise mainly from rotor winding configuration, slotting effects, and saturation. In this paper, analytical equations are derived for spatial harmonics and their effects on leakage flux, additional loss, noise, and vibration. Using the derived equations and an electromagnetic-thermal model, a simple design procedure is presented, while the design variables are selected based on sensitivity analyses. A multiobjective optimization method using an imperialist competitive algorithm as the solver is established to maximize efficiency, power factor, and power-to-weight ratio, as well as to reduce rotor spatial harmonic distortion and voltage regulation simultaneously. Several constraints on dimensions, magnetic flux densities, temperatures, vibration level, and converter voltage and rating are imposed to ensure feasibility of the designed machine. The results show a significant improvement in the objective function. Finally, the analytical results of the optimized structure are validated using finite-element method and are compared to the experimental results of the D180 frame size prototype BDFIG.

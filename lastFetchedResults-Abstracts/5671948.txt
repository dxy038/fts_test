This paper presents a new initialization technique for the simulation of control diagrams in transient analysis of power systems. The new technique has been implemented and tested in the EMTP (Electromagnetic Transients Program). It is based on a generic idea reusable in other transient analysis applications. The first objective is to significantly reduce computation time by avoiding unwanted simulation startup transients. The second objective is to increase the level of automation for the initialization of control block variables based on desired steady-state conditions. The new method has been used for a study in the Hydro-Quebec network with more than 40 controlled machines aggregating the generation of 30 GW. Comparing the fast steady-state solution obtained through time-domain simulation, with the desired steady-state operating conditions, provides validation

Proper customer use and application of Electric Thermal Storage (ETS) space and water heating devices on the customer-side-of-the-meter indicates that ETS can be considered as a viable utility load management concept. These conclusions are based on a comprehensive analysis of field test results by American Electric Power (AEP) personnel. AEPÂ´s Residential Energy Storage Program monitored the use of such devices in 71 homes in five of their seven state service area. Subjective and objective test results indicate positive benefits for the customer and the utility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) DNA and antibody to the virus in the serum and colostrum of sows vaccinated prior to mating and in their offspring. Seventy-seven sows were randomly distributed into vaccinated (V, n = 36) and non-vaccinated (NV, n = 41) groups. One week before mating, sows were given a PCV2 vaccine (V group) or PBS (NV group) IM. Blood samples were taken from the sows at fixed time-points and colostrum samples were taken at farrowing. Blood samples were also taken from the piglets of the sows at 4 weeks of age. The results indicated that vaccination prior to mating elicited a strong, homogeneous humoral response and, in consequence, more homogeneous colostral PCV2 antibody concentrations.

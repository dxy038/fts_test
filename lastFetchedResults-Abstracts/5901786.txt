Based on the health standard of air quality in public places and its grade bounds prescribed by the state, the evaluation grades are classified. A mathematical model is established by using fuzzy mathematics methods, and the quantify indexes in the model are described by using the maximum membership rule. Compared with the traditional evaluation model, ours makes the evaluation results more objective and reasonable. Our model makes the evaluation more accurate and perfect. The computer software corresponding to our model is designed, which can be used to the air quality detection in practice. Practice proves the efficiency and reliability of our software.

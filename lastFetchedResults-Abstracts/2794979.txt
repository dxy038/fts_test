In this paper, the optimal mechatronic design of a regenerative chatter controller in a lathe machine is presented. As an innovative consideration, a structured artificial immune system (AIS) is utilized for optimization of the topology and the parameter values of the system. To remove the chatter in a specific spindle speed, a mechatronic system including smart piezoelectric actuator, piezoelectric sensor and controller is designed. A rather comprehensive structure is considered for the transfer function of the controller with the aim to cover common types of industrial controllers. The overall objective of the present work is to design an active vibration suppression system in order to increase the allowable depth of cut at a specific spindle speed, with minimum energy consumption.

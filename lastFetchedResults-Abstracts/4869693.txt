The author´s objective is to show that there is nothing exceptional in the existence of power oscillations in the power system (indeed we should be surprised if they were absent). Since we are powerless to prevent them, we should regard them as no more of a nuisance than switching overvoltages, transformer inrush, trapped charge, or any one of the myriad of inconveniences that an AC system presents to network designers. The author gives some ideas on how to do just that: how to detect system oscillations, what practical steps that can be taken to alleviate any that do occur, and how to lessen their impact on system operation. The author draws from two principal sources: a CIGRE task force of utility and manufacturing engineers, and Scottish Power´s own experience over the past two decades of dealing with oscillations on the GB network

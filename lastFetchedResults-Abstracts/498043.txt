Background an objective: Cholera disease has had complete correlation with human history. There has been 7 registered pandemic till now. We had some epidemics in Iran that the last one occurred in 1384 causing 1311 cases and 12 deaths. Climate condition is an important and effective factor in transmission of water and food born diseases. In this survey, cholera disease in Iran and its relation with climate condition was studied.

Materials and methods: This is a descriptive retrospective study. Data are gathered from line list of Eltor and NAG cholera disease reported to Center of Disease Control, Ministry of Health in 1374 to 1385 period and data of climate condition are obtained from Iran meteorology organization.

Results: from 15666 patients, 24.6% were under 5 and upper 65 years old. Case Fatality Rate was more in 55 and upper years old (4.5%).men were affected more (53.7%) than women. Dominant biotype, serotype and serogroup were orderly eltor, ogawa and 01. In relation to climate condition, spread of disease has significant relation with higher temperature (p<0.01) and higher pressure (p<0.014).

Conclusion: In spite of influence some factors in cholera disease event, climate is important especially in developing countries and we can use it for early warning system.

This paper presents an effective video retargeting method with the assessment of jittery artifact. Our method firstly constructs a new energy function by including both spatial and temporal constrains. Then the retargeting processing can be performed effectively by minimizing our proposed energy function for each frame. We also propose a new objective measurement to assess temporal coherence after video retargeting, the accuracy of which is verified by psycho-visual tests. Experimental results show that our video retargeting method is able to provide comfortable resized videos in terms of subjective and objective measurements.

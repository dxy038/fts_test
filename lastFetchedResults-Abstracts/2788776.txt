In video streaming service, the user´s Quality of Experience (QoE) is not only related with video signal quality, also user´s interest for a video content must be considered. In this context, this work proposes a video quality assessment method that takes into account the user preference for video content. In order to perform this task, the users´ profiles that include their preferences are saved in the video content provider platform. We conducted subjective tests, in which evaluators had different content preferences. Results show that evaluators´ QoE is highly correlated with the user´s preference for video content type. Based on these results, different correction factors are defined, which are used to adjust the quality index values obtained by a video quality objective metric running in the end user´s device. Furthermore, a network architecture solution is presented, in which the proposed video quality assessment methodology is implemented.

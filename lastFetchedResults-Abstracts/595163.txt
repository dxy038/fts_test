Objective: To know the outcome of posterior wall strengthening with Vicryl darn in patients with inguinal hernias.Material and Methods: This study was conducted at Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar during the period of 14 years from March 1991 to February 2005. All patients underwent posterior wall repair with Vicryl darn. Data was retrieved from computer software, maintained in personal computer over the years. Patients were admitted from OPD, preoperative assessment was done in the ward. Postoperative morbidity and mortality was recorded. Follow up period was from one to ten years.Results: A total number of 1150 inguinal hernias in 1090 patients (60 had bilateral hernias) were operated by the principle author during the time period. Common age was 30-59 years. Males predominated with a male to female ratio of 40:1. All patients were operated by a single surgeon. Indirect inguinal hernias were more common with indirect and direct ratio of 5:1. Post-operative wound infection occurred in 52 cases (4.5%). Scrotal haematoma in 9 cases (0.8%). Recurrence has been recorded at a rate of 1.5% in patients who had completed 10 years follow-up. Out of 1090 patients, so for 202 (18.5 %) have been lost to follow up. Three patient died post-operatively due to co-morbid factors not directly related to surgery.Conclusion: In our set up posterior wall strengthening with Vicryl darn (repair) in patients with inguinal hernias still has excellent results. These results are comparable with mesh hernioplasty.

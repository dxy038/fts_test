In conjunction with the 2003 future energy challenge (FEC), a low-cost integrated machine end drive system is considered for residential applications between 50 and 500 W. The objective is to remain cost competitive with traditional single phase induction machine solutions while improving system performance. The basic architecture includes a power factor correction boost rectifier, a hex-bridge inverter, control circuitry implementing selective harmonic elimination, auxiliary power supplies, and a three phase induction machine designed for inverter operation. This paper discusses system design, performance, cost, and lifetime.

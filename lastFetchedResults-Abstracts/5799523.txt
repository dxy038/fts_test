This paper presents an orchid disease detection system using image processing and fuzzy logic. The main objective of this paper is to design a system that is able to detect an orchid disease by processing its leaf image. The system consists of two parts, image processing and fuzzy logic. The leaf image processing uses methods like grayscaling, threshold segmentation and noise removing. The data collected from the image processing are the centroid, area and number of diseased spot. These data or numbers is then fed through the fuzzy logic system to be processed through fuzzification, fuzzy inference and defuzzification in order to get the output. The result shows that the orchid disease can be detected by using image processing and fuzzy logic.

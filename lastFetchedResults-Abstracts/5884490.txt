Bidirectional converter that is able to manage storage, is a basic power electronics device and it is a major component of renewable energy sources, micro grid and also smart grid concept. In this paper single phase bidirectional converter topology is discussed. State space model has been derived and a simple model based predictive current controller has been utilized to derive the inverter. Control block diagrams has been designed and tested with MATLAB Simulation. Experimental results presented and give credibility to the derived model and control method.

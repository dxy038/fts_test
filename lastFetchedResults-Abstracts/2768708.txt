Total hip arthroplasty (TGA) is a successful surgical procedure to treat patients with hip osteoarthritis. Clinicians use different questionnaires to evaluate these patients. Gait velocity and these questionnaires; usually show significant improvement after TGA . This clinical evaluation does, however, not provide objective, quantifiable information about the movement patterns underlying the functional capacity, which is clinically important and can currently only be obtained in a gait laboratory. There is a need to improve patient instructions and to quantify the rehabilitation process. The sit-to-stand (STS) movement is an objective performance-based task, whose assessment is related with the evaluation of functional recovery. Twenty two patients with hip osteoarthritis participated in this study. For each patient, validated questionnaires were administered and gait velocity was measured. Time, ground reaction forces, and lower limb asymmetry parameters were calculated using the instrumented force shoes (IFS) during STS movement with and without armrest. Significant inter-limb asymmetry was observed. No correlation was found between any parameter and gait velocity and questionnaires outcomes. Significant differences in time and force parameters between with/without armrest were found. Concluding, inter-limb asymmetry can be evaluated with the IFS supplying important additional information not represented by gait velocity and questionnaires usually used.

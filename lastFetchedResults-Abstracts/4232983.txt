We present the development of a framework for a high capacity wireless network for Internet applications. By replacing some of the network nodes with wireless routers, we form a wireless multihop network overlaid an a cellular structure. This paper addresses the problem of jointly optimizing routing, channel scheduling, and power control to maximin the total system throughput under a transmit power constraint. We demonstrate that by considering the interrelationship among the network, data link, and physical layers, we increase the network throughput. The work is based on minimizing a defined objective function which includes the cost related to the transmit power for emptying the buffer with a certain amount of information and the selected route to the final destination.

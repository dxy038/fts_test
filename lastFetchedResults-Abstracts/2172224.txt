The objective of this study was to investigate the hypolipidemic effects of powdered whole persimmon leaf supplement in rats fed high-fat diet. Three groups of male Spragueâ€“Dawley rats during 6 weeks were fed different diet: normal control (NC), high-fat (HF), and high-fat supplemented with powdered whole persimmon leaf (PL; 5%, wt/wt) groups. Body weight and relative weight of interscapular brown adipose tissue were significantly lower in the PL group than in the HF group, while plasma leptin concentration was higher. The supplementation of persimmon leaf significantly lowered the plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, whereas elevated the ratio of HDL-C/total-C and improved the atherogenic index. Persimmon leaf supplementation led the hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride values to similar levels to the NC group. Accumulation of hepatic lipid droplets and the epididymal white adipocyte size of PL group were diminished comparing to the HF group. Hepatic HMG-CoA and ACAT activities were significantly higher in the PL group than in other groups. Contents of fecal triglyceride, cholesterol and acidic sterol were significantly higher in the PL group than in the HF group. Accordingly, we suggest that supplementation of the powdered whole persimmon leaf improves plasma and hepatic lipid levels profile partly via the increased fecal lipids in high-fat fed rats. These beneficial effects may be due to the properties of its phenolic compounds (1.15 g/100 g) and high fiber (63.48 g/100 g) content in the powdered persimmon leaf.

A new incremental learning algorithm for function approximation problems is presented where the neural network learner dynamically selects during training the most informative patterns from a candidate training set. The incremental learning algorithm uses its current knowledge about the function to be approximated, in the form of output sensitivity information, to incrementally grow the training set with patterns that have the highest influence on the learning objective

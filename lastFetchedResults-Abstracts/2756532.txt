Current-fed quasi-Z-source inverters (qZSIs) have many advantages over traditional current source inverters and current-fed Z-source inverters. This paper presents and analyzes novel adjustable speed drive systems based on the current-fed qZSI that could provide bidirectional power flow, including their topologies, operating principle, and voltage gain. The simulation results are given to verify the rationality and feasibility of the proposed topologies.

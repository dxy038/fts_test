Electromigration under bidirectional current is studied on dual damascene copper interconnects for the 65 nm node. Physical analyses confirm void location a both ends of the line and copper transport over long distance. Resistance evolution was studied and correlated to void healing/growth kinetics. Finally, we show the interest of bidirectional tests to study multimodal failure mode.

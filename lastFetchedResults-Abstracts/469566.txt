Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether a junior faculty mentoring program is beneficial to participants and to identify particular positive and negative aspects of such a program to enable others to institute similar programs.
Study design
In 2001 a pilot program was instituted in our obstetrics and gynecology department for interested faculty members. There were 3 focus groups and a written survey that assessed the project. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods were used for data analysis; Fisher's exact test was used.
Results
Two recurring themes emerged from the focus group sessions: participants felt better supported by the department and appreciated a greater sense of camaraderie. Most mentees noted the program's success in the following areas of having a role model (83.3%), having increased visibility (82.3%), and having to whom someone to turn (93.8%).
Conclusion
The faculty mentoring program had significant benefits for everyone who participated.

An approach to increase customer reliability worth by network reconfiguration is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the reliability cost/worth model of distribution systems and the evaluation approach-analytical technique are introduced; then the corresponding mathematical model in which the objective function is to minimize customer interruption costs is constructed, and an improved genetic algorithm is introduced to the network optimization that searches the global optimal solution. Based on the presented model and algorithm, a computational program has been developed. The test results for the IEEE-RBTS Bus 2 system have demonstrated the feasibility and validity of the suggested method. Finally, in comparison with reconfiguration aiming at improving system reliability, some conclusions can be obtained.

The streaming of video service, either live or video on-demand streaming is in receipt of remarkable attraction from the users and industry. The ISPs nowadays provide the smart TV access over the Internet connectivity, where the users can access the real-time contents adjoining to the trendy contents like web browsing, email and downloading. The multimedia applications, specifically video streaming contains delay, bandwidth and packets loss requirements. The congestion over the network is a critical factor that creates packets loss, consequently the quality of streaming video is degraded. In this paper, evaluation of the video streaming performance has been performed by applying different simulation scenarios over IP-based network. The core objective is to analyse the network behaviour and video quality. The network behaviour includes packets loss, end-to-end delay and throughput. The received video quality is compared and analysed using application level values, which include Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) method and Mean Opinion Score (MOS) scale. In this paper, each experiment performed in simulation, shows different network behaviour and quality of received video depending on the network congestion and sent with dummy background traffic.

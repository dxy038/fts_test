Nowadays, Banks as the most important payers of the financial market are facing two main challenges seeming to be contradictory. On one hand, they are pushing to serve their consumers at the shortest time and the best quality, and on the other hand, they are forced to minimize their operational cost to keep the competitive advantage. One way to meet these goals at once is to optimize the capacity of the branches which influences both the perceived expectation of the customers and the operational costs. The main objective of this paper is to find the optimum capacity of one branch of Saman Bank. One step toward that is to describe the customer demand in a queuing model and the other step is to use the output of the model to analyze the costs connected to serve the service demanded. One item which can be calculated as the output is the number of cashiers in the bank.

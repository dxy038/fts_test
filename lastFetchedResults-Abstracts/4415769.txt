This paper proposes a smart battery charging strategy for Electric Vehicles (EVs) targeting the future smart homes. The proposed strategy consists in regulate the EV battery charging current in function of the total home current, aiming to prevent overcurrent trips in the main switch breaker. Computational and experimental results were obtained under real-time conditions to validate the proposed strategy. For such purpose was adapted a bidirectional EV battery charger prototype to operate in accordance with the aforementioned strategy. The proposed strategy was validated through experimental results obtained both in steady and transient states. The results show the correct operation of the EV battery charger even under heavy load variations.

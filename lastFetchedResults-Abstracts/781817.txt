Background and Objective: How brain hemispheres control movement is one the most challenging in neuroscience and is faced with opposite views. Comparing dominant and non dominant hand is of the methods used to investigate hemispheres function. The goal of this study was to compare implicit and explicit motor learning with dominant and non dominant hand.
Subjects and Methods: Sixty students of Shahid Beheshti university were divided into two groups (n=15 each): implicit and explicit, participated in this study. One group performed the task with dominant hand and the other with non dominant hand. The task used in this study was Serial Reaction Time Task in which participants in explicit group were aware of the sequences of stimulants and those of implicit group were unaware.
Results: Comparing response error and time in regular blocks in explicit and implicit learning tasks with dominant and non dominant hand showed no significant differences except in implicit and explicit learning speed of dominant hand. Speed of explicit learning was higher than in implicit learning (P=0.016).
Conclusion: Implicit and explicit motor learning of dominant and non dominant hand are similar. Therefore it may be possible that brain parts involving in implicit learning overlap with those of explicit learning. More explicit learning in right hand may be the result of left hemisphere dominance in explicit learning.

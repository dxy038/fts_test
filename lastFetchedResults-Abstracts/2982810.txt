In the competitive telecommunication market, an administrator or manager often draws up various alternatives of administration and chooses the optimal one by evaluating their operational circumstances. Besides, to increase the products or the sales, a manager usually sets the goal of business for all administration centers and evaluates their performances. Therefore, the goal setting and evaluation is necessary to administer a company. In the past, the methods used to set a goal and evaluate performance fully depended on expertsÂ´ subjective recognitions and need many iterations to acquire consistent results. In this study, fuzzy set theory is adopted to describe the linguistic data of experts, and then a fuzzy multi-objective model is proposed to search complete and independent significant factor. Then, a solution procedure derived from grey relational analysis is proposed to set the goal of sales in telecommunication services under the evaluation of variously operational circumstances of administration centers. Finally, the case of the Mobil Phone Service is illustrated with satisfactory results.

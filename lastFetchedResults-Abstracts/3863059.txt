The technology challenges for miniature optical pickups include high-numerical-aperture objective lens design, servo actuator functions and performance, and component assembly tolerance. In this paper, a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based miniature optical pickup is proposed for DVD and blue disk systems. A high-order diffractive objective lens with a continuous surface relief is designed. Focus, tilt, and tracking servos are implanted with MEMS micro actuators. Preliminary design and test results are presented.

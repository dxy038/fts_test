Objective: Type I diabetes is an immunologically-mediated devastation of insulin producing
cells (IPCs) in the pancreatic islet. Stem cells that produce B-cells are a new
promising tool. Adult stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self renewing
multi potent cells showing capabilities to differentiate into ectodermal, mesodermal
and endodermal tissues. Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox factor 1 (PDX1)
is a master regulator gene required for embryonic development of the pancreas and
is crucial for normal pancreatic islets activities in adults.
Materials and Methods: We induced the over-expression of the PDX1 gene in human
bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs) by Lenti-PDX1 in order to generate IPCs. Next, we examine
the ability of the cells by measuring insulin/c-peptide production and INSULIN and
PDX1 gene expressions.
Results: After transduction, MSCs changed their morphology at day 5 and gradually differentiated
into IPCs. INSULIN and PDX1 expressions were confirmed by real time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunostaining. IPC secreted insulin and C-peptide
in the media that contained different glucose concentrations.
Conclusion: MSCs differentiated into IPCs by genetic manipulation. Our result
showed that lentiviral vectors could deliver PDX1 gene to MSCs and induce pancreatic
differentiation.

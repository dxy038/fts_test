This paper addresses the roadmapping technique of computer vision and imaging for CCTV. The Imaging Faraday Partnership (IFP) has been consulting widely with the imaging community to form a roadmap for the area. The objective of the roadmap is to help the whole community review current directions, enable it to highlight the long-term objectives of the discipline and to communicate the excitement, relevance and potential of computer vision and imaging. The roadmap addresses the whole area rather than just the use of imaging for crime prevention and detection but the general conclusions are directly applicable in the area of crime reduction. Three important conclusions can be drawn from the roadmap are, first the UK has a very strong computer vision and imaging Research base that is outward facing and both draws on and contributes to many other disciplines. Second, if the short-term preoccupations of industry and academia are disregarded, then there is a remarkable coincidence between industry need and fundamental research problems. The final important conclusion is that the technology will increasingly have widespread impact.

The main objective of this study was to figure out a relationship between space weather environment phenomena (linked to solar and geomagnetic activity) and ionospheric events that impact L-band operating satellite systems (scintillations, electron content gradients), especially satellite navigation services, in the Nordic European area. A simple empirical model to forecast index of rate of change of the total electron content (ROTI) at high latitude has been developed associated with Kp geomagnetic prediction and the use of solar electron energy flux.

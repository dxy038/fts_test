Discussion of a paper by H. V. Putman and J. E. Clem published in the December 1934 issue, pages 1594&#8211;7, and presented for oral discussion at the insulation and protection session of the South West District meeting, Oklahoma City, Okla., April 24, 1935. This paper was also presented at the winter convention, New York, N. Y., January 22, 1935, and other discussion was published in the July 1935 issue, pages 770&#8211;1. J. K. Hodnette (Westinghouse Elec. and Mfg. Co., Sharon, Pa.): There has been considerable discussion recently amongst engineers relative to a revision in the proposed standards for transformers to more closely co-ordinate the transformer insulation levels with protective devices. This applies particularly in the lower voltage or distribution classes of transformers where a reduction in the insulation levels would be made. It is believed that this has been an outcome of the transformer subcommitteeÂ´s proposal to increase the 60 cycle dielectric tests on the lower voltage transformers and had as its objective a reduction in distribution transformer costs.

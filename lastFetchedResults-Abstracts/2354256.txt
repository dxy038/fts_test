Objective: Podophyllotoxin (PTOX), a natural compound in numerous plants, contains
remarkable biological properties that include anti-tumor, anti-viral such as anti-human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) activities. In order to avoid its adverse effects, various compounds
have been derived from PTOX. 6-methoxy PTOX (MPTOX) is one of the natural
PTOX derivatives with an extra methoxy group. MPTOX is mostly isolated from the Linum
species. This study has sought to determine the biological effects of MPTOX on cancer
cell lines, 5637 and K562.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we treated the 5637 and K562 cancer
cell lines with MPTOX in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis was examined
by flow cytometry and viability rate was analyzed by the MTT assay. Expressions of the
tubulin (TUBB3) and topoisomerase II (TOPIIA) genes were determined by real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR).
Results: Treatment with MPTOX led to significant induction of apoptosis in cancer cells
compared to control cells. Gene expression analysis showed reduced levels of TUBB3 and
TOPIIA mRNA following MPTOX treatment.
Conclusion: MPTOX inhibited TUBB3 and TOPIIA gene expression and subsequently
induced cell death through apoptosis. These results suggested that MPTOX could be
considered a potential anti-tumor agent.

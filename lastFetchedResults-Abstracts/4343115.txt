The goal of this paper is to develop a set of software of boundary-scan test (BST) generation using some test generation algorithms and test data. In order to get the test data quickly and effectively, a new innovative method of establishing test project description (TPD) file is presented. During the testing of two different boundary-scan circuit boards, all faults can be detected, indicating that the expected design objective is achieved.

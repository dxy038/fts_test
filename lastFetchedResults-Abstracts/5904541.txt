The objective of this paper is to explore the theoretical framework employed to identify, examine and describe how the socio-cultural factors support a teacher to effectively integrate information technology (IT) into a secondary school classroom environment. This paper discusses the advantages of using activity theory as a theoretical framework to analyse effective IT integration in a secondary school classroom environment. The paper uses the data from one of the case studies to show how the activity system can be operationalised in practice.

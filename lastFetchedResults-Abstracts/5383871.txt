We present a computer-based computational observer method for the analysis and evaluation of digitized ultrasound images of the contrast-detail phantom, which was developed earlier. This evaluation method evolved from image evaluation studies, which demonstrates that human observer performance is not sufficiently consistent or accurate for objective evaluation of images or imaging system. The computational observer measures the detection threshold for imaged targets of known contrast, and computes contrast-detail data from this information. We find that our new method meets the criteria of being objective, accurate, reproducible, transportable, and relevant to human observer image evaluations.

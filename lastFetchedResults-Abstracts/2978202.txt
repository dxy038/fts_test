The main objective of our work is detecting different sea structures south the Iberian Peninsula. Waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea have different temperatures, salinities and levels. The structures are complex and reduced, presenting a great number of eddies, filaments and upwellings. This work centers in the use of different thresholds, during the border detection process, in order to emphasize different elements of the sea structures

In this paper, we systematically investigate adaptive Runge–Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) methods for hyperbolic conservation laws with different indicators which were based on the troubled cell indicators studied by Qiu and Shu [J. Qiu, C.-W. Shu, A comparison of troubled-cell indicators for Runge–Kutta discontinuous Galerkin mehtods using weighted essentially non-osillatory limiters, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 27 (2005) 995–1013]. The emphasis is on comparison of the performance of adaptive RKDG method using different indicators, with an objective of obtaining efficient and reliable indicators to obtain better performance for adaptive computation to save computational cost. Both h-version and r-version adaptive methods are considered in the paper. The idea is to first identify “troubled cells” by different troubled-cell indicators, namely those cells where limiting might be needed and discontinuities might appear, then adopt an adaptive approach in these cells. A detailed numerical study in one-dimensional case is performed, addressing the issues of efficiency (less CPU cost and more accurate), non-oscillatory property, and resolution of discontinuities.

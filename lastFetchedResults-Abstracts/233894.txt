This article describes experimental and modelling results from CFD simulation of an air diffuser for industrial spaces. The main
objective of this paper is to validate a manufacturer model of the diffuser. In the air diffuser, the low velocity part is placed on top of
a multi-cone diffuser in order to increase airflow rates and maximize the cooling capacity of a single diffuser unit. This kind of
configuration should ensure appropriate performance of industrial air diffusers, which is discussed briefly at the end of the article.
The paper illustrates the importance of a simulation model jointly with the manufacturer’s product model and the grid layout near
the ventilation device to achieve accurate results. Parameters for diffuser modelling were adapted from literature and manufacturer’s
product data. Correct specification of diffuser geometry and numerical boundary conditions for CFD simulations are critical for
prediction. The standard k–e model was chosen to model turbulence because it represents the best-known model utilized and
validated for air diffuser performance. CFD simulations were compared systematically with data from laboratory measurements; air
velocity was measured by ultrasonic sensors. Results show that CFD simulation with a standard k–e model accurately predicts nonisothermal
airflow around the diffuser. Additionally, smoke tests revealed that the flow around the diffuser is not completely
symmetrical as predicted by CFD. The cause of the observed asymmetry was not identified. This was the main reason why some
simulation results deviate from the measured values

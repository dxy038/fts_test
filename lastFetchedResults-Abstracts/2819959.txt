Filter design is a fundamental problem in signal processing and important in many applications. In this paper we consider a communication application with spectral constraints, using filter designs that can be solved globally via convex optimization. Tradeoffs are discussed in order to determine which design is the most appropriate, and for these applications, finite impulse response filters appear to be more suitable than infinite impulse response filters since they allow for more flexible objective functions, shorter transients, and faster filter implementations.

The overall objective of this research is to design an electrical model to describe regulated and deregulated cerebral blood flow during elevated intracranial pressure. This model is based on the hypothesis that during elevated intracranial pressure and regulated cerebral blood flow, venous flow just prior to entry into the cranial sinuses is briefly stopped during positive pressure inhalation; as a corollary, during deregulated cerebral blood flow venous flow into the cranial sinuses is not occluded during positive pressure inhalation. The model incorporates an &#8220;on-off&#8221; switching mechanism to simulate the posited synchronous &#8220;on-off&#8221; venous flow into the cranial sinuses produced by ventilation. During deregulated cerebral blood flow, venous flow is not occluded during ventilation. The &#8220;on-off&#8221; switch is not present. A comparison between the experimentally recorded and simulated intracranial pressure and venous pressure signals during conditions of regulated flow and deregulated flow reveals marked similarities

The state of the art of stray load losses in induction machines is discussed with respect to definition, origin and effects, and measurement techniques. The historical search for a definitive evaluation technique for these losses is discussed together with the recognized criticisms of each approach. It is noted that although this subject has been the object of intensive investigations for more than seventy years there is still very little agreement on either the origin or evaluation of stray load loss. This paper discusses the major works in the area with the objective of delimiting the problem so that a rational approach for future work may be promulgated.

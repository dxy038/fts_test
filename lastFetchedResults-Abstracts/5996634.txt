The land use special planning of tourism industry (LUSPTI) was promoted in 2009. The aim is to solve the prominent contradiction between the development of tourism industry and the land use in Yunnan province, and meet the development of tourism industry. The LUSPTI is based on remote sensing image data. The land used for tourism distribution, present situation, cover of an area and the characteristics is determined rapidly and accurately by using the visual interpretation from known to unknown, first macro after micro, and utilizing comprehensively of multi-source data and many interpretation methods, and explored and developed many new tourist attractions. According to the image, it is reasonably determined of the tourism projects land scale, four border and layout of construction land. It also guided reasonable zoning, optimizing distribution in LUSPTI. There are some advantages by using remote sensing image as base data for LUSPTI, such as abundant and objective information, comprehensive and strong image data, unified accurate and reliable statistical data.

Background and Objective: Type 2 diabetes represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of vitamin E supplementation on metabolic status and serum lipoprotein (a) level in type 2 diabetic patients. 
Materials and Methods: In this randomized double-blind, controlled clinical trial 83 type 2 diabetic patients (men and woman) were assigned into two groups as the intervention and control groups. The intervention group (n=42) took 400 IU vitamin E per day and the control group (n=41) received placebo for 8 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, dietary intake data and fasting blood samples were obtained from each patient before and after the end of study. 
Results: Serum vitamin E and lipid-standardized ?-tocopherol significantly increased after vitamin E supplementation in the intervention group (P=0.0001). A significant decrease in fasting blood glucose was observed in the vitamin E group compared with the placebo group at the end of the study (P=0.027). Alterations in body mass index, dietary intakes, levels of lipoprotein (a) and other serum lipids were not significant in any of the groups. 
Conclusion: Vitamin E supplementation led to an improvement in the status of serum vitamin E and glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. Vitamin E as pertained to the dose and duration throughout this study did not produce any significant difference in other variables. Further studies are suggested to evaluate  the possible outcomes of vitamin E on metabolic control in type 2 diabetic patients.

An object file format is the file format with the logic level closest to any hardware platform. This format is designed with the main objective of providing formatted binary machine code for execution and linkage of programs. In the case of the UNB-RISC16 processor, the object file format must provide a pattern that favors the efficiency of memory space required. This is needed because the UNB-RISC16 only has a limited size of 64KB of RAM memory. This work presents the design of a compact executable and linkable file format along with its tools for the UNB-RISC16 processor. Results show that the proposed format is able to save some space by stripping unnecessary information for embedded applications and by optimizing the linking process.

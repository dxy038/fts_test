Abstract: The main thrust of the present article is to discuss the truth of man, place of his soul and spirit, the truth of manifestation of Godâ€™s spirit in man and veiling of his qualities in veils and shortcomings of the expanse of his existence. Since the main objective of creation is to achieve perfection, the sublimation of soul in the curve of ascension and in returning to the Absolute Truth,  wayfaring different stages, and exaltation of his deserving degree is subject to descent and attachment of body to the material world so that he would achieve the purified life and become the manifestation of divine lights. The contention of the present article is that the path of achievement and wayfaring of the wayfarer is through acquisition of gnosis, labor, and purification of soul so that in the way towards God he would achieve annihilation. This can be achieved only by obeying the Lord, Prophet of Allah, the Infallible Imams and the holy Quran.

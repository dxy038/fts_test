BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Midazolam is the only drug of benzodiazepine category that because of its fast effect and least cardiovascular complications is used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Also, halothane is the most common drug for maintenance of anesthesia with some complications that causes a tendency to use IV anesthesia. This study was done to determine the effect of midazolam and halothane on hemodynamic changes in maintenance of anesthesia.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 100 cases (16-60 years old) in ASA class I (American society of anesthesiologists). They were randomly divided into two groups (each group 50 persons). Subjects in both groups were administered with premedication and induction of anesthesia with an equal dose according to their weight and then tracheal intubation was done. For the maintenance of anesthesia, control and case group received halothane (0.5-1%) and midazolam (1.tg/kg/min), respectively and both groups received N20 and oxygen (50%) equally. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured and recorded after premedication, 1 min after induction and every 10 min during 90 minutes and then data was compared.
FINDINGS: According to the obtained results, the changes of heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in midazolam group was less than halothane group and there was not a statistically significant difference. The range of systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes in midazolam group in comparison to halothane group was less and it was statistically considered significant ( p< 0.05). Emergence from general anesthesia in midazolam group was less than halothane that this difference was meaningful (p= 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Hemodynamic changes in maintenance of anesthesia with infusion of midazolam in comparison to halothane was similar or less. If it is necessary, continuous infusion of midazolam can be used instead of halothane with regard to its some complications.

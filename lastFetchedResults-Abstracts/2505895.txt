<p style="text-align: justify;">Orofacial clefts, including cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL (P)), are common congenital malformations, second only to clubfoot in frequency of occurrence. The epidemiology and genetics of this disorder have been studied extensively in various countries by several investigators. The objective of this study is to assess the epidemiology and some genetic aspects of orofacial clefting at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran. This study was a 7-year case series (retrospective) study from 1999 to 2006. The setting for the study was Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran, and the participants were all consecutive surgical cases with orofacial clefts referred to this hospital. One hundred and 77 cases of cleft lip and/or cleft palate were recorded during these 7 years. Seventy four of them (41.8%) were female and 103(58.2%) were male (M/F Ratio=1.39). Of all patients, 40 persons (22.6%) had isolated CP, 45 (25.4%) had cleft lip without cleft palate, and 92 (52%) had cleft lip with cleft palate (CL+P). Their M/F ratios were 1.66, 0.6 and 1.96 respectively. Of all CL (P) probands, 41 patients (29.9%) were bilaterally affected. In unilateral cases, the left side was affected nearly twice as frequently as the right side. Among the patients, 23 cases (13%) had other malformations; most commonly head and face abnormalities and then congenital heart disease. Fifty-four patients (30.5%) had consanguine parents; 33 (18.6%) were first cousins, 7 (4%) were second cousins, and 14 (7.9%) were distant relatives. There was a positive family history for cleft syndrome in 23 cases; most commonly CL-P. Our study reveals that the epidemiologic aspects of oral clefts in Iran are very similar to other Caucasian populations. It also suggests that a routine screening such as echocardiography and ruling out skeletal, hearing and visual problems may be necessary in cleft patients especially in children. It seems that genetic counseling and karyotyping can be very useful in patients with multiple malformations.</p>

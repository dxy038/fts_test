Low loss composites have been fabricated in thick and thin film forms for a broad range of frequency applications. The
thin film composites of barium strontium titanium oxide BSTO.have been primarily developed by the pulsed laser ablation
 PLA.method. This deposition technique has produced high quality thin films of BSTO composites on various substrates wS.

thin films. The material characterization and the electronic parameters of the thin films will also be presented. Finally, the
patterning techniques required to fabricate the BSTO composite thin film phase shifters will be discussed. Some preliminary
results of the phase shifter characterization will also be presented. q1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

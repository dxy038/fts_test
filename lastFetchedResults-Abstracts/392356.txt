Objective: The prognosis for acute acoustic trauma (AAT) is difficult to predict. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used in this study to determine which factors were most strongly related to outcome for patients with AAT. Methods: The study group was comprised of 52 patients (52 ears). Separate analyses were performed on the no change and partial recovery groups, and on the no change and full recovery groups. The following eight factors were examined as explanatory variables, age; number of days before the start of treatment; use of earplugs; drug therapy (adrenocortical hormones, low molecular weight dextrans, and vitamin B12), mean hearing levels at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz (pure tone average, PTA), and mean hearing levels at 4 and 8 kHz (high tone average, HTA). Results: Factors determined to be most strongly related to outcome were the number of days before the start of treatment, PTA, and HTA. No significant relation to outcome was determined for the five following factors, age; use of earplugs; and drug therapy (adrenocortical hormones, low molecular weight dextrans, and vitamin B12). Conclusion: Our results will increase the ability to prognosticate the outcome for AAT.

Some semantic-automatic service composition frameworks including Tsinghua-KEG SWSCF are reasonable solutions, which allow users to use semantic process templates to capture the semantic requirement of the process. However, it is a challenging problem in searching and selecting the concrete Web services that not only capture the semantic capabilities of each activity of an abstract process but also best fit the overall composed business process. In this paper, we define service chain and present an algorithm for searching service chain. Then, we present subject-objective service chain selection model to for evaluating Web service chains. At last, service chain searching and selection model are proved to be effective by some experiments.

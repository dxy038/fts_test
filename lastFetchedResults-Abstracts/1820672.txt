Objective
rrent study was performed to test the hypothesis that periodontal disease produces age-dependent activation of apoptotic markers in the gingival tissues.
s
ress the hypothesis a prospective experimental study was designed and twenty-two patients were enrolled. Out of the twenty-two patients, gingival tissue biopsies samples were obtained from active sites of ten and twelve periodontal-healthy (HS) and periodontal disease (PD, probing depths &gt;5 mm patients, respectively. The groups were further divided into 25–50 and &lt;5 years age subgroups.
s
ificant decrease in the expression of TRADD (Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Death Domain) was observed in 25–50 years of PD group compared to the HS group. Bax (BCL2-associated X protein) expression in the PD groups was significantly decreased in PD 25–50 years age group but increased in the &gt;50 years age group compared to respective HS age groups. PD patients of both 25–50 years and &gt;50 years age exhibited a significant increase in the expression of Cytochrome C and Caspase-3 compared to the respective HS groups. The PD patients exhibited a stronger correlation with age in the expression of TRADD and Bax compared to the HS groups. Further analyses revealed that the expression of Caspase-3 correlated with an increase in the age of the healthy patients.
sions
ta suggested that modulation of apoptotic cascade may contribute to the damage of gingival tissues particularly in PD patients &gt;50 years age.

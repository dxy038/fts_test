Objective : To discuss the effects of Chrysan them um morifolium on mRNA expressions of p53 and Bax in the Human Umbilical Vein Cells(HUVEC) under Induction and Cultivation of high glucose. Methods: Make four groups of the HUVEC as normal cells group, normal glucose only deal cells group high glucose -only deal cells group and Chrysanthemum morifolium + high glucose acting cells group. After 18~24h, the mRNA expressions of p53 and Bax were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Results: High glucose can up-regulation the mRNA expressions of p53 and Bax, and Chrysanthemum morifolium can decline the mRNA expressions of p53 and Bax in a dose-dependent manner,and the role of middle-dose is most manifest. Conclusion: Chrysanthemum morifolium can down-regulation the mRNA expressions of p53 and Bax, to prevent and cure diabetic vascular complications.

The mobile user objective system (MUOS) is a global satellite-based communications system that will provide third generation (3G) wide band code division multiple access (WCDMA) services including simultaneous voice, data, and video to subscribers. MUOS, being developed for the Department of Defense (DoD), has an advanced network management system (NMS) that enables network sharing to provide global mobile communications to currently un-served users including homeland defense and coalition partners. Network sharing technologies could be used to enhance MUOS future service offering with virtual satellite private network (VSPN) services. This would allow virtual satellite private network operators (VSPNO) to have their private subscriber database and specific communications service requirements. There are different commercial off the shelf (COTS) based shared network solutions implemented by industry. This paper describes the subscriber-based, common shared network and shared radio network solutions which are applicable to MUOS VSPN services

Objective(s): The object of the study is to examine the effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) against oxidative stress in the blood and excretion of THC metabolites in urine of type 2 diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: The control (n=8), THC control (n=6), diabetes (n=8) and diabetes + THC (n=7) groups were created. Type 2 diabetes was induced by nicotinamide (NA, 85 mg/kg) + streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg). THC was administered intraperitoneally for seven days. The glutathione (GSH) level in erythrocytes and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities in plasma were measured. THC metabolites were analyzed in urine. Results: The results showed that the erythrocyte GSH levels were significantly increased (P<0.05), but plasma MDA levels were non-significantly decreased in diabetes group treated with THC when compared with the diabetes group. The CAT activity was non-significantly reduced and SOD was significantly increased (P<0.01) in the plasma of diabetes induced by THC in comparison with the diabetic group. The excretion of THC metabolites was higher in the urine of diabetes + THC rats as compared to the THC control rats. Conclusion: These findings highlight that THC treatment may attenuate slightly the oxidative stress in diabetic rats. The excretion rate of THC may vary in the type 2 diabetes mellitus status.

Objective: Considering the inhibitory effect of integrin-activity modulator (manganese) on the development of morphine tolerance; in this study we have tried to assess the effect of chronic administration of both morphine and manganese on the expression levels of (31 and P2 integrins in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord.
Materials and Methods: Morphine tolerance was induced by intrathecal injection of mor­phine, 15 |jg/rat twice a day for five days. In order to study the effect of manganese on tol­erance development; we injected manganese alone or in combination with morphine. The analgesic effect of morphine was assessed by using the tail flick test. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to assess the ex­pression levels of p1 and p2 integrins.
Results: As assessed on day 6, five days administration of morphine significantly in­creased the expression levels of integrins Pt and P2. Combined administration of mor­phine and manganese, which inhibited morphine tolerance, prevented the effect of mor­phine on integrins' expression.
Conclusion: Increased expression of integrins may be due to direct effect of chronic mor­phine or a negative feedback that resulted from the potent inhibitory effect of morphine on integrins' activity. It seems that the activating of integrins via manganese in the presence of morphine can reverse feedback and consequently the effect of chronic administration of morphine on P1 and P2 integrins' and expression. Our findings suggest a role for intra­cellular matrix molecules in the development of morphine tolerance and possibly other forms of synaptic plasticity.

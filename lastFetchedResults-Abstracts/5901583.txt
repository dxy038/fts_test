The objective of this work is to increase the capacity of watermark information in the audio watermarking method based on amplitude modification. We increase the capacity of watermark information by embedding multiple watermarks in the different levels of audio data independently. Moreover, we aim to improve the sound quality by modifying the scaling curve of the conventional method.

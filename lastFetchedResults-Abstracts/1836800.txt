Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an important clinical problem for which an effective treatment has yet to be developed. Importantly, the 5-year survival is below 50%. A better understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms could result in improvements in the prevention and treatment of this disease. The molecular mapping of chromosomal losses in renal cell cancer together with increased resolution of the human gene map will provide targets for therapeutic approaches. In this review, I summarize what is known regarding some tumor suppressor genes and candidate tumor suppressor genes in RCC, with reference to their location and expression.

The ACSE series of events aims to advance the adoption of software engineering tools and techniques by bringing together researchers and practitioners who investigate novel approaches to fostering the transition between limited-use research prototypes and broadly applicable practical solutions. One proven technique to aid adoption is to leverage existing commercial platforms and infrastructure. The key objective of ACSE 2004 is to explore innovative approaches to the adoption of proofof- concept systems by embedding them in extensions of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products and/or using middleware technologies to integrate the prototypes into existing toolsets.

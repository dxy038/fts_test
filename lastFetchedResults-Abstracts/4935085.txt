We investigate the problem of fair and robust joint transmitter and receiver power allocation for uplink multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmissions. The channel model is assumed to have Rayleigh flat fading. For fairness, the objective of power allocation is to minimize the maximum MSE among all users each of which has limited transmit power. For robustness, we consider joint power allocation with imperfect channel state information (CSI), where the CSI error is assumed to be unknown but bounded by a constant. We point out that this problem can be expressed as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem with bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints. Numerical results indicate the BER performance improvement obtained by taking fairness and robustness into account in the joint power allocation process.

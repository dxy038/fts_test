Characterization and isolation of Nocardia from clinical sample patients suspected of active tuberculosis 
Background and Aim: Nocardia as one of the most important genera of aerobic actinomycetes, soil dwellers in some cases, causes dangerous and lethal infections in susceptible patients, especially patients with various immune deficiencies. A number of species belonging to Nocardia can cause chronic pulmonary infections. In this study, Nocardiosis in patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis in patients who were negative for culture and microscopic slides were examined.
Material and Method: 90 patients suspected of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with negative sputum re-provision and Nocardia, isolated as pathogens were studied. Paraffin baiting technique and blood agar culture was used for isolation of Nocardia isolates. Clinical Isolates were tested by microbiological phenotypic methods for identification.
Result: Six clinical isolates of Nocardia from Tuberculosis patients with negative cultures and smears were isolated. 
Conclusion: In patients with suspected tuberculosis, detected by culture and negative microscopic, Nocardia as the cause of chronic lung disease can be important and should be considered.

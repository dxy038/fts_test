This paper is focused on the virtual reality area, where the main objective is to show our project, which allows us to create different virtual environments using one or more screens. We will also describe four applications for our system: The first application uses a remote control for navigating in a virtual world. The second one is the manipulation of a virtual environment taking into account the viewerpsilas position. Another application is the manipulation of a hands-free virtual environment in function of time. Finally, we mention a Cazes-type computer-based stereoscope.

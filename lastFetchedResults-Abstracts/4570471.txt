In this paper, several die attach adhesives (A to E) from different suppliers are investigated. The objective is to better understand the comprehensive properties of adhesives and to choose the right adhesive for a high-density memory stacked die packaging with improved packaging reliability. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to investigate curing behavior and curing kinetics. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is utilized to characterize the thermal and thermooxidative stability. The adhesion of die attach adhesives is determined at different temperatures. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and the test of fracture toughness of adhesives are carried out. In addition, the failure mode of adhesives after a die shear test is also discussed. The results show that adhesive A is more suitable for high-density memory stacked die packaging. This fundamental study can also help select die attach materials for other types of electronic packaging.

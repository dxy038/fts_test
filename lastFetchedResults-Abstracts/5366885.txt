The demand of delivering streaming media content in the Internet has become increasingly high for scientific, educational, and commercial applications. Three representative technologies have been developed for this purpose, each of which has its merits and serious limitations. Infrastructure-based CDNs with dedicated network bandwidths and powerful media replicas can provide high quality streaming services but at a high cost. Server-based proxies are cost-effective but not scalable due to the limited proxy capacity and its centralized control. Client-based P2P networks are scalable but do not guarantee high quality streaming service due to the transient nature of peers. To address these limitations, we present a novel and efficient design of a scalable and reliable media proxy system supported by P2P networks. This system is called PROP abbreviated from our technical theme of "collaborating and coordinating PROxy and its P2P clients". Our objective is to address both scalability and reliability issues of streaming media delivery in a cost-effective way. In the PROP system, the clients\Â´ machines in an intranet are self-organized into a structured P2P system to provide a large media storage and to actively participate in the streaming media delivery, where the proxy is also embedded as an important member to ensure quality of streaming service. The coordination and collaboration in the system are efficiently conducted by our P2P management structure and replacement policies. We have comparatively evaluated our system by trace-driven simulations with synthetic workloads and with a real-life workload trace extracted from the media server logs in an enterprise network. The results show that our design significantly improves the quality of media streaming and the system scalability.

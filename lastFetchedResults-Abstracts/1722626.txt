The enzymatic treatment of textile fibers is a nontoxic and environmentally benign process. The objective of the present study is to investigate the improvement of physic-chemical characteristics of wool fabrics by surface modification induced by corona discharge and enzymatic treatment with protease and cellulose. Thus, it was found that, compared with pristine wool fabric, the enzyme-treated fabrics exhibited lower tensile strength, increased elongation, and higher alkali solubility. The surface roughness and the zeta potential of the enzyme-treated wool fabrics decreased with increasing treatment duration.

Our world consists of complex macro-systems of various natures. These systems are collection of various subsystems providing defined functions and interconnected by processes of forced dynamics interaction and exchange of power, matter and information. These macro-systems are mathematically nonlinear, multi-dimensional and multi-connected. In these systems there are complex transients and critical and chaotic modes has place. Problems of system synthesis, i.e. finding of common objective laws of control processes in a such dynamics system are much actual, complicated and, in many respects, practically inaccessible for present control theory. In the report we consider fundamental basis of nonlinear theory of systemÂ´s synthesis based on synergetic approach in modern control theory as well as its application.

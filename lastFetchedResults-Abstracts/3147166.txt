An evaluation model of gray relational with weights based on DEA Cross-efficiency is proposed. In this model, the advantages of gray theory on the fields of performance evaluation of &#8220;small sample&#8221; and &#8220;poor data&#8221; are fully used, and the decision-makersÂ´ preference degree of evaluation is considered. This not only makes the evaluation result more objective and fairness, but also makes the result agree with the fact. Non-linear weighting method is adopted, which can efficiently avoid the potential imbalance of linear weighted. The ratio model based on DEA Cross-efficiency reduces the subjectivity caused by the direct empowerment to some extent. Empirical practices and simulation analysis show the advantage, practicability and applicability of this model on relative fields.

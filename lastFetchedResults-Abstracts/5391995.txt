It has been estimated by the U.S. DOT that more than 800,000 hazmat shipments of all classifications and quantities are transported daily; clearly hazmat transport is an essential component of the nationÂ´s freight transportation system. At the same time, hazmat shipments represent an area of great concern and potential vulnerability due to the various safety and economic consequences associated with accidents and terrorism. Although only a small percentage of hazmat shipments present a risk and/or danger, it is imperative for government and industry to work together to mitigate the possible vulnerabilities as well as develop and lest systems and solutions that will improve hazmat safety and security. The Hazardous Materials Safety and Security Field Operational Test (FOT is a joint FHWA and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration-sponsored project). The HM FOT combines an analytical risk assessment with an integrated suite of commercial off-the-shelf technologies and tested them on vehicles transporting hazardous materials. Specifically, the technologies included arc: wireless satellite or terrestrial communications, untethered trailer tracking, routing and geo-fenced mapping software, panic buttons, biometrics and smartcards, electronic cargo data systems, intelligent onboard computers, and electronic cargo seals. The FOT focused on 13 different price tiers of technology in four test scenarios: bulk fuel - flammable gas and liquids; less-than-truckload -high hazard materials; bulk - chemicals; and truckload - explosives. The project objective of the FOT was to demonstrate technology efficacy for safety and security as well as fleet operational efficiencies. Additional research components analyzed legal implications and industry cost-benefits.

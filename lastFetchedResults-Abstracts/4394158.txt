This paper represents the state-of-the-art of implementing a FPGA-based image processing algorithm in a mobile robot called NTACO (Novin Tarasheh Alborz Co.). The objective consists in performing image processing algorithms in a real-time manner and to provide the possibility of overcoming obstacle avoidance problem based on local vision navigation. To this end, image processing techniques are used such as Sobel, Roberts and Prewitt edge finders, median and averaging filters, morphology and some related techniques. The main contribution of this paper consists in implementins image processing alghorithms on Altera FPGA with Quartus 11.1 and NIOSII 11.1 softwares. As a result, the speed of receiving, processing and decision-making for obstacle detection are increased. Features such as hardware implementation, flexibility, exclusive architecture and high processing speed along with low weight and price in this processing core also make its use possible in mechatronics systems which require real-time image processing.

Control strategies for hybrid vehicles are algorithms that choose at each sampling time the power split between the engine and the motor. This paper presents global optimization algorithms based on the optimal control theory. The objective is to compute, in simulation, the minimum fuel consumption achievable with a given prototype on a given speed cycle. Results can be used as reference for the evaluation of real time control strategies and also for real-time control strategy synthesis.

Objective
tudy examined the effects of a dentifrice containing green tea catechins on gingival oxidative stress and periodontal inflammation using a rat model.

-four male Wister rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group (Control group) received no treatment for 8 weeks. Periodontal inflammation was induced in the second group for 8 weeks. Periodontal inflammation was induced in the last two groups for 8 weeks and dentifrices with or without green tea catechins were topically applied to the gingival sulcus daily for 4 weeks prior to the end of the experimental period.
s
hat had experimental periodontal inflammation showed apical migration of the junctional epithelium, alveolar bone loss and inflammatory cell infiltration in the connective tissue subjacent to the junctional epithelium at 8 weeks, whilst the control group showed no pathologic changes. Topical application of a green tea catechin-containing dentifrice reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in the periodontal lesions to a greater degree than the control dentifrice at 8 weeks. The gingiva in which green tea catechin-containing dentifrice was applied also showed a lower level of expression of hexanoyl-lysine (a marker of lipid peroxidation), nitrotyrosine (a marker of oxidative protein damage), and tumour necrosis factor-Î± (an indicator of pro-inflammatory cytokines) at 8 weeks compared to gingiva in which the control dentifrice was applied.
sions
 green tea catechins to a dentifrice may contribute to prevention of periodontal inflammation by decreasing gingival oxidative stress and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

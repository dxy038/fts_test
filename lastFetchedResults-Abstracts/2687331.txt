Light scattering models of snow are very important for the remote sensing of snow. Many previous models have used unrealistic assumptions about the snow particle shape and microstructure. In this paper, a new model is proposed, wherein a bicontinuous medium is used to simulate the snow microstructure, and geometric optics theory is used in combination with the Monte Carlo method to simulate the scattering properties of snow. Then, using the radiative transfer equation, the snow reflectance, including the polarized reflectance, can be simulated. Unlike other models that use Monte Carlo ray tracing, the new model is computationally efficient and can be used for massive simulations and practical applications. The simulation results of the new model are compared with the ground measurements and simulation results of a traditional model based on the Mie theory. Through validations and comparisons, the new model is shown to demonstrate a significantly improved capability in simulating the bidirectional reflectance of snow. The importance of the grain shape and microstructure modeling in the light scattering models of snow is confirmed by the comparison of the simulation results.

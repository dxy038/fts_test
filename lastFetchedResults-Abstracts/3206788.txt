In this paper, a Sector Based Clustered Routing (SBCR) protocol for distributed Data-Centric Storage (DCS) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is proposed. The research identified an optimally synchronized routing algorithm that can achieve high power efficiency whilst reducing updates and query traffic, end-to-end delay, and collisions. To achieve this objective, SBCR is cross pollinated with medium access control (MAC) layer (SMAC and/or TMAC) building a cross-layer optimization model. Based on the network-wide cluster flow distribution, each sector member is assigned a non-overlapping TDMA slot by their sector head for member-head collision free communication while a stateless location based multi-hop routing scheme is used for inter-sector communications. The paper also provides a description of the implementation of SBCR in open-source Castalia simulator. Simulation results show that SBCR yields significant efficiency improvements for DCS and data queries compared to existing approaches such as LEACH and GPSR.

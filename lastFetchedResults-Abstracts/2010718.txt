Liquid–liquid equilibria (LLE) of the binary system of methanol–cyclohexane were measured in the range of 277.79–317.94 K. LLE of two ternary systems, methanol–cyclohexane including either one of cyclic ethers of 1,3-dioxolane and 1,4-dioxane, were also measured at the temperatures of 277.79, 288.54, 298.63 and 308.64 K. Two liquid phase regions of the ternary systems were found in the range 0.2–0.04 mole fraction of the ethers, which were smaller than those of the ternary systems of methanol–heptane including the ethers of 0.35 to 0.1 mole fraction studied before. The results were successfully correlated with the UNIQUAC equation by minimizing an objective function with weighting factors.

Congestion is a multifaceted process. It is difficult to define congestion. It can be sensed through the degraded performance of the network. The user experiences long delays in the delivery of messages, perhaps heavy losses caused by buffer overflows. Regardless of the many years of research efforts in congestion control there is no universally accepted unique definition of congestion. Network congestion occurs when the aggregate demand for bandwidth exceeds the available capacity of the link and when the packet arrival rate to the router is greater than its departure. The remedy over this dilemma is to design an algorithm for congestion detection and avoidance in the router. This paper mainly focuses on the various methods of congestion control which have been considered by various researchers in this area. The main objective of this paper is mere study of various congestion control techniques and to explore the possibilities of further research in the area of congestion control.

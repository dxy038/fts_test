Worldwide a large number of Future Internet and Smart City infrastructures exist. To provide a global view on these infrastructures in Europe, the Infinity Project has developed an on-line catalog called the XiPi portal. Its main objective is to facilitate the construction of a sustainable market for infrastructure providers to advertise their capabilities and capacities for end-users. In this context, the requirement to provide up-to-date availability status information of individual infrastructures was raised. We introduce an architecture to provide these high-level monitoring information about the health of the involved infrastructures and their services by adopting existing Future Internet Research and Experimentation (FIRE) technologies. The approach has been integrated as an extension into the portal and selected infrastructures advertise their availability.

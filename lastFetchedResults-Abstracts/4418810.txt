A new scheme for the islanding partition of the distribution system with distributed generations (DGs) is proposed in this paper. A bi-objective optimization model is built; the fixed weight approach, fuzzy membership function and Memetic algorithm are employed to solve the islanding problem. The simulations on the American PG&amp;E 69-node distribution system show that the results obtained from the new model and Memetic algorithm can converge to an acceptable result rapidly, and the islands formed by the results possess better power quality than the single objective optimization case. The results of the case study demonstrate that an islanding scheme with good power quality can be obtained by the proposed model and algorithm after the fault occurred in the distribution system.

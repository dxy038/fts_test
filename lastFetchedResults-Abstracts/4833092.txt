Current sensor FDIR (fault detection, isolation, &amp; recovery) generally focuses on sensor bias and drift anomalies, which require models. However, dead sensors and excessive noise faults are more common in practice. The latter two faults are interesting in that they can be detected using only the measurements from each sensor. The objective of this paper is to show a few ways to detect common sensor faults and thus, enhance sensor reliability by using instrument signals to better advantage.

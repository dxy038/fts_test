Local site effects play a very important role in changing (amplification or de-amplification) the seismic characteristics of ground motions. The objective of this paper is to investigate local ground response in an alluvium region in Port Mahshar. In this regard, to perform dynamic analysis, soil layers dynamic characteristics are determined from geotechnical tests, performed at 10 borehole stations and, on the basis of the seismicity characteristics of the bedrock, 15 accelerograms of various earthquakes around the world are selected. Considering the local topography and soil conditions, one dimensional equivalent linear analysis is used and the results are presented in terms of microzonation maps and site specific design spectrum. The results indicate considerable seismic amplification in the case of weak to moderate earthquakes and de-amplification of waves in strong ground motions, due to the nonlinear behavior of alluvium deposits.

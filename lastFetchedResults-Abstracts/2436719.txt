In a conventional traffic signals controller, the lights change at constant cycle time. In many cities, automatic traffic signals are often based on a constant green-to-red cycle. The time period for green light (or red light) to be on is determined based on a stochastic model. The traditional vehicle-actuated control of isolated intersections attempts continuously to adjust green times. The decision to change green light duration involves fuzzy factors that cannot be precisely determined.

in objective of this paper is to develop a fuzzy logic traffic system that considers the two two-way intersections and is able to adjust changes in time intervals of a traffic signal based on traffic situation level.

oposed system has been applied and tested using real data collected from signalized intersection in Hawalli governorate in the State of Kuwait. Twenty-seven iterations have been done; the results show that the proposed fuzzy logic traffic system provides better performance in terms of total waiting time, total moving time, and vehicle queue. Finally, it can be observed from the results that the proposed system can be used to accelerate the cycle time and to give other phases the chance to gain more benefit from the green time lost.

This paper proposes a novel high-conversion-ratio high-efficiency isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter. The proposed converter is operated in the step-down stage. The dc-blocking capacitor in the high-voltage side is used to reduce the voltage on the transformer, and the current-doubler circuits are used in the low-voltage side to reduce the output current ripple. The energy stored in the leakage inductance is recycled to the dc-blocking capacitor. When the proposed converter is operated with a step-up function, dual current-fed circuits on the low-voltage side are used to reduce the current ripples and conduction losses of the switches in the low-voltage side. The voltage-doubler circuit in the high-voltage side increases the conversion ratio. The proposed converter can achieve high conversion with high efficiency. Experimental results based on a prototype implemented in the laboratory with a high voltage of 200 V, low voltage of 24 V, and output power of 200 W verify the performance of the proposed converter. The peak efficiency of the proposed converter in the high-step-down and high-step-up stages is 96.3% and 95.6%, respectively.

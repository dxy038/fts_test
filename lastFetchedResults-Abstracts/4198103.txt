The coded anti-collision radar system is larger studied for safety applications. The problem of this sensor is the choice of coding and detection algorithm. The use it in automotive environment could make it necessary to have a large number of the used codes. This study looks for new codes available in a larger amount. In addition, to increase the radar detection performances, the new time delay estimators based on higher order statistics (HOS) can be used. The objective of this paper is to compare the all possible code-algorithm associations. The simulations results show that the Kasami codes associated to the CORR2 (correlation power two) algorithm is the best configuration for the coded radar.

A herd of 250 apparently healthy Bunaji cattle of Santuwa village in Jalingo local government area of Taraba state were tested for tuberculosis with the aim of determining the prevalence of the disease in the herd using two screening tests; tuberculin skin test and Quicking® bovine tuberculosis antibodies (QBTB Ab) rapid test. Caudal fold tuberculin skin test of bovine purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium bovis was used. Sera samples obtained from the animals prior to the tuberculin skin test were screened using QBTB Ab rapid test. Seven animals reacted positively to the tuberculin skin test and all the animals showed no visible reaction to the QBTB Ab rapid test. The overall prevalence of tuberculosis in the herd was 2.8 %. Further test such as single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin test, culture, isolation of the bacilli or ELISA test is required to establish the true prevalence of the disease in the herd.  Quicking® bovine tuberculosis antibody rapid test kit alone may not be reliable for screening cattle of tuberculosis especially in the developing countries as additional test is required to validate its result.

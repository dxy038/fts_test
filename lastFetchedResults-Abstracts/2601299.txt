Background and Objective: Based on previous studies, inflammation and oxidative stress play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, we aimed to examine the protective effects of crocin, as a potent antiinflammatory and antioxidant, on kidney function and oxidative stress in an experimental model of diabetic nephropathy in male wistar rats.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, male wistar rats (190220 g) were randomly divided into four groups (each n=6); normal, normal treatment, diabetic, diabetic treatment. The rats were made diabetic by an intravenous injection of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg). Treated rats received crocin intraperitoneally with a dose of 40 mg/kg/day for eight weeks. Blood samples were collected for measurement of blood glucose and creatinine levels. The Malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrate contents of kidney also were assessed.

Results: Chronic hyperglycemia (blood glucose &gt;400 mg/dL) significantly increased the blood creatinine of the diabetic group (4.51&±0.45 mg/dL) compared with normal rats (0.72&±0.09 mg/dL, P&lt;0.001). Hyperglycemia also decreased the nitrate content (37%) accompanied by an increase in the MDA content (13.00&±0.19 &amp;micro;g/mg protein) compared with normal group (10.22&±0.54 &amp;micro;g/mg protein). Crocin significantly decreased the blood creatinine of diabetic rats (1.12&±0.13 mg/dL, P&lt;0.001), accompanied by a decrease in blood glucose (9%). Finally, the content of MDA significantly decreased by 29% in diabetic treated rats compare to diabetic untreated rats (P&lt;0.001).

Conclusion: Based on the findings of the present study, it is appeared that crocin has a role in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy through inhibition of oxidative stress and reducing lipid oxidation.

This paper introduces the study on a new method of conic fitting. The objective function based on algebraic distance is established. The method obtains six basic conics with six different constraints, and produces the final fitting conic by adding certain weights to coefficients of six basic conics based on least-squares theory. The feasibility and robustness of models were tested through the simulation experiments and appliance in omni-catadioptric system calibration.

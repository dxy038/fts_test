In this paper, we investigate the problem of minimizing objective function with single-term exponents subject to fuzzy relational equation specified in max-product composition. Two folds are presented. Firstly, we present some properties for this optimization problem under the assumption of both negative and nonnegative exponents in the objective function. Second, the new efficient method called min-max methods is provided to find an optimal solution without looking for all the potential minimal solutions. Numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility of the present method.

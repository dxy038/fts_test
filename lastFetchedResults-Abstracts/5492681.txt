Ninety percents energy and more than eighty percents industrial raw materials came from mineral resources at present. In fact, the exploitation of mineral resource consumes two resources: mineral resources and environmental resources. Opencast mining of resources particularly leads to great damage on ecological environment. This paper selected Xiangning County of Shanxi Province as the study area and regarded remote sensing images at three phases of 1990, 1999 and 2007 as the main part of data sources. We adopted the monitoring means of combining remote sensing and GIS technology to establish the evaluation index system and the evaluation method of ecological environment, then conducted the real-time monitoring of ecological environment on mining area to evaluate the ecological and environmental scientifically and forecast the variation tendency. It provides objective, plenty and accurate data for the future investigation of ecological environment to study area, and at the same time, offering a reference to the government departments for the management of ecological environment in future.

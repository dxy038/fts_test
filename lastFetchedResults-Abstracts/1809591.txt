Background: The human female reproductive tract (FRT) is constantly deal with the invading pathogens. Recognition of these pathogens is attributed to the family of Toll like receptors (TLR) as a major part of the innate immune system. We and others have previously revealed that TLRs1-6 express in the female reproductive tract. However, more studies should be done to detect TLRs 7-10 in the female reproductive tract, especially in the fallopian tubes.
Objective: To examine the expression of TLRs7-10 in human fallopian tube tissue.
Materials and Methods: Using immunostaining techniques, distribution of TLR7-10 was studied in surgical sections from the uterine tubes, obtained from patients undergoing tubal ligation and hysterectomy for benign gynecological conditions. RT-PCR was used to show the existence of TLR7-10 genes in fallopian tube tissue.
Results: TLR7-10 proteins were detected in the fallopian tube epithelium, although the intensity of staining was not equal in cases. TLR7-10 genes were expressed in human fallopian tube tissue.
Conclusion: This study indicates that TLR7-10 is expressed in fallopian tubes tissues, and may play an important role in microbial recognition, and in host defense against ascending infection.

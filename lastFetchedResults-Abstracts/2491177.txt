Explosive accidents within recent years resulted in vulnerability and reduction of life of plenty of structures including sensitive and crucial structures. Sensitivity of this problem resulted in laboratory and theoretical studies for utilization of absorbent layers as energy dissipater. In this paper, behavior of two types of sandwich absorbent layers including steel honeycomb and fragile concrete composite as concrete wall guard under explosive loading was analyzed aiding finite element software ABAQUS. Explosive pressure was simulated based on CONWEP method. Comparison of results obtained from analysis shows that function of said layers differs proportional to the objective and value of explosive samples so that although the both types of absorbent layers have a considerable effect on reduction of damage to the main structure, but in samples with low explosion intensity, fragile layer with higher energy absorption and reduction of deflection of concrete wallâ€™s central point has better function than crushable layer and in severe explosions, due to emergence of plastic behavior, steel crumpled layers have better function.

Invertible transforms with integer coefficients are highly desirable because of their fast, efficient, VLSI-suitable implementations and their lossless coding capability. In this paper, a large class of generalized lapped biorthogonal transforms with integer coefficients (IGLBT) is presented. The IGLBT also possesses a fast and efficient lattice that structurally enforces both linear phase and exact reconstruction properties. Preliminary image coding experiments show that the IGLBT yields comparable objective and subjective performance to those of popular state-of-the-art transforms with floating-point coefficients

Objective
e individuals, recovery from episodes of mental illness may be impeded by maladaptive illness beliefs and behaviors. For individuals with chronic illness, acceptance of its presence and consequences is necessary to seek appropriate treatment, adjust their lifestyle, and adhere to recommended management strategies. Some have difficulty adjusting out of the sick role or develop a degree of illness investment. The Illness Cognitions Scale (ICS) is a 17-item validated scale that measures cognitive factors associated with the sick role. We conducted analyses to test the hypothesis that there may be an association between illness cognitions and clinical and functional measures.
s
S was administered to 89 participants at the final study visit of a 24-month observational study involving patients with bipolar I disorder or schizoaffective disorder.
s
 scores on the ICS were correlated with more severe depression (p&lt;0.0001), worse general health (p=0.0002), worse functioning (p=0.0001), and worse scores in psychosocial measures including the State Hope Scale (p=0.0082), the Social Provisions Scale (p=0.0054) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (p=0.0025).
sions
s cognitions and behavior may be a neglected factor that could influence treatment outcomes in bipolar disorder. The ICS might be useful for identifying individuals whose recovery may be facilitated by targeted psychological intervention that addresses these factors.

Next generations of satellite communication systems demand the use of high frequency bands and the effect of the troposphere at these frequencies has a major impact in the signal attenuation. In this context, the objective of the work presented in this paper is to take advantage of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) system, capable of providing reanalysis and forecasts at high resolution, to be able to simulate the atmospheric conditions, to finally estimate the signal attenuation for slant path satellite links beyond 10 GHz. This is of paramount importance to effectively supplant the lack of measurements for the design of new satellite systems.

To analyze the education of a school, the first thing is to analyze the whole teacher team of that school. How to measure the quality of the team and the personal qualities of team members, to understand the development trend of the whole team and the potential ability becomes very necessary. A well established data analysis system for teachers can provide both macro-data and micro-data analysis for the decision-makers of schools. It is also an important way for improving the quality of teacher team and the ability of macro decision-making. In this paper, based on a large num of research and practice, we proposed a more comprehensive, objective, accurate and reasonable data analysis system for teachers, which can not only promote teachersÂ´ progress, but also help school to know about the whole team of teachers, to get academic development trends of school, to analyze the trends of teaching quality and to generate annual reports.

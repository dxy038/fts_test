The cold tube drawing process has high productivity and low cost, so it is regarded as an effective technology. It has been used instead of the swaging process to form monobloc tube shafts (MTS) with constant outer diameter or hollow shaft without surface defects. The objective of this study is to design an appropriate die shape that can prevent material fracture considering critical damage value (CDV) in the tube drawing process for the steering input shaft (SIS). In this study, the CDV was evaluated by the simple compression test. Based on the CDV, FE-analysis was used to design an appropriate die shape. Finally, the tube drawing experiment was performed to verify the effectiveness of the appropriate die.

The range of electric parameters of Distributed Power Generation Systems (DPGSs) is wide and uncertain. The main objective of this paper is to propose H&#8734; controller design for the grid-forming problem using structured uncertainties to improve the performance of the system facing parametric uncertainties, and to obtain fast transient response with minimum overshoot, precise current control with zero steady-state error, and low distortion and current ripple. The procedure is verified by simulation to demonstrate the performance of the proposed strategy for the nominal case and perturbed parameters cases.

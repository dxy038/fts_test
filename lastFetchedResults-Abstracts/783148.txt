Objective To evaluate the impact of demographic
and psychosocial background factors and psychiatric
and functional status before and at admission
on the patients’ satisfaction with care (PSC) among
first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients. Method One
year after entering the Parachute Project, 134 FEP patients
completed a patient satisfaction questionnaire.
The association with demographic and psychosocial
background factors, together with psychiatric and functional
status before and after admission, was analysed.
Results Twenty-nine per cent of the variance of PSC was
explained by factors such as educational level, social
network, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and
Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) the year prior
to onset. Negative symptoms and lack of hope at
admission were also predictors of PSC. The strongest
predictor was DUP. Conclusion Affecting the public
knowledge in psychiatric problems and psychiatric
treatment, together with early intervention strategies
aiming to decrease the prodromal and DUP period
among FEP patients, can positively influence the patients’
experience of given care. By increasing the
knowledge of available psychiatric treatment, the sense
of powerlessness might decrease among the affected
persons, and the possibility of early help seeking might
increase.

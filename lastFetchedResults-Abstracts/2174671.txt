This paper demonstrates an experimental scrutiny into turning process of hot work tool steel AISI H21 under dry machining plight. In this paper, face centered central composite design concealed by response surface methodology is practiced and analysis of variance is implemented to analyze the eloquent benefaction of machining parameters on responses. To access accommodate between the surface roughness and the MRR, an approach for concurrent optimization of multi-objective characteristics based on comprehensive desirability function is employed. The multi objective optimization concludes a spindle speed of 1599.568 rpm, feed rate of 0.262 mm/rev and depth of cut of 2 mm.

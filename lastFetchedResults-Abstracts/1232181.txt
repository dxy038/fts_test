Employing repeating unit cell (RUC) to represent the microstructure of periodic composite materials, this paper develops a numerical technique to calculate the plastic limit loads and failure modes of composites by means of homogenization technique and limit analysis in conjunction with the displacement-based finite element method. With the aid of homogenization theory, the classical kinematic limit theorem is generalized to incorporate the microstructure of composites. Using an associated flow rule, the plastic dissipation power for an ellipsoid yield criterion is expressed in terms of the kinematically admissible velocity. Based on nonlinear mathematical programming techniques, the finite element modelling of kinematic limit analysis is then developed as a nonlinear mathematical programming problem subject to only a small number of equality constraints. The objective function corresponds to the plastic dissipation power which is to be minimized and an upper bound to the limit load of a composite is then obtained. The nonlinear formulation has a very small number of constraints and requires much less computational effort than a linear formulation. An effective, direct iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting nonlinear programming problem. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method have been validated by several numerical examples. The proposed method can provide theoretical foundation and serve as a powerful numerical tool for the engineering design of composite materials.

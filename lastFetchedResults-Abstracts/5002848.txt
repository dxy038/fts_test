This paper incorporates the voltage stability view to reactive power dispatch and control problem. A multi-objective model of reactive power optimization (RPO) is established, which takes into account of power loss minimization, voltage stability margin maximization and high service quality. In order to measure voltage stability, the least singular value of converged load flow Jacobian is employed as an objective of RPO problem. In this paper, a parallel particle swarm optimization is presented and applied to reactive power optimization problem. The proposed method can keep the population diversity and overcome the premature demerit of classical PSO and modified PSO. The simulations have been carried out on IEEE 14,30 bus system and an actual power system, and the results show the good performance of the proposed algorithm

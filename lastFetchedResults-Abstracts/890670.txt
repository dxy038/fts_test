Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement for transmitted video sequences over packet error
prone channels is an inevitable necessity. Due to the intrinsic properties of packet error prone channels
in imposing quality degradation on transmitted media and also, the costly and time-consuming nature
of subjective quality measurement techniques, exact modeling of the impact of packet loss on measured
video quality based on on-line objective measurement methods is an important task. In the current work,
a low-complexity objective video quality measurement algorithm is developed by which by considering
various factors that may affect video quality, we can estimate subjective video quality with acceptable
accuracy. Then, the performance of the proposed objective algorithm is compared with popular objective
SSIM/VQM techniques. The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm has high level of
accuracy. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm has low-complexity which makes it suitable for
online implementation. Some important and related patents in the field of QoE measurements and
monitoring in networks are investigated.

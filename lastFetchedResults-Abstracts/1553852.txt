This paper describes the use of cubic splines for interpolating monotonic data sets. Interpolating cubic splines are popular for fitting data because they use low-order polynomials and have C2 continuity, a property that permits them to satisfy a desirable smoothness constraint. Unfortunately, that same constraint often violates another desirable property: monotonicity. It is possible for a set of monotonically increasing (or decreasing) data points to yield a curve that is not monotonic, i.e., the spline may oscillate. In such cases, it is necessary to sacrifice some smoothness in order to preserve monotonicity.

al of this work is to determine the smoothest possible curve that passes through its control points while simultaneously satisfying the monotonicity constraint. We first describe a set of conditions that form the basis of the monotonic cubic spline interpolation algorithm presented in this paper. The conditions are simplified and consolidated to yield a fast method for determining monotonicity. This result is applied within an energy minimization framework to yield linear and nonlinear optimization-based methods. We consider various energy measures for the optimization objective functions. Comparisons among the different techniques are given, and superior monotonic C2 cubic spline interpolation results are presented. Extensions to shape preserving splines and data smoothing are described.

Canonical analysis is an ordination technique which allows a direct comparison of two data matrices. It is often applied in ecological studies and here it is shown how canonical analysis, in particular redundancy analysis, can be used to analyze sensory evaluation data. The example data are obtained with individual vocabulary profiling study of concert hall acoustics. The redundancy analysis is compared with hierarchical multiple factor analysis. In addition, it is shown how redundancy analysis can be used to explain the subjective data with different objective data, in this case room acoustical parameters and physical measures of the studied concert halls.

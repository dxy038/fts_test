The objective of the described research was to quantify the quality of real-time-traffic-information (RTTI), especially for color-coded speed maps. In a first step, an ex-post, offline reconstruction of the real traffic situation based on speed measurements is conducted. A spatio-temporal speed contour plot is therefore generated, using the adaptive smoothing method (ASM). In a second step, the broadcasted RTTI is fused into a grid-based contour plot. This allows the generation of virtual vehicle trajectories for the real traffic situation, as well as for the RTTI induced traffic state. In a final step, these two types of simulated trajectories are used to compute travel times, which are compared and fused into an overall Travel Time Difference (TTD) index.

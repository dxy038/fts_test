An optimization approach for estimating vocal tract configurations from the speech signal is presented. The scheme concatenates a gradient search and linear successive approximation, providing fast convergence and small errors. The objective function is generated by the least-absolute-value (<e1>l</e1><sub>1</sub>-norm) error between the model-derived and the speech-derived first three formants. The gradient search is accelerated by using an algorithm inspired by the Fletcher-Reeves method. Linear successive approximation assures convergence in the region near the optimum articulatory vector. Constraints are imposed on the articulatory parameters to avoid physiologically impossible configurations

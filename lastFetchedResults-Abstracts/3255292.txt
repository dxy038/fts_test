Active transmits antenna selection (ATAS) leads to minimize the energy consumption in MIMO transmission, via adaptively choosing the optimal active antenna configuration satisfying the capacity requirement at the same time. This paper proposes a new low complexity ATAS method in MIMO Broadcasting channels. A computationally efficient approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed and the particles are defined as the discrete binary antenna selection factor. The objective is to maximize energy efficiency corresponding to the specified antenna which is represented by the particles. Numerical results reveal that PSO algorithm with low complexity converges to optimal solution. Therefore, our proposed algorithm is proper for real-time applications.

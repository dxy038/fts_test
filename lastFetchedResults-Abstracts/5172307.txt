The problem of comparing steam turbine engines to electric drives in high-horsepower applications (greater than 200 hp) is addressed. Only the DC-motor drive is considered. The objective of this analysis is to identify, for four selected cases, the paper mill fuel chargeable to shaft power and the tie-line power associated with the paper machine drive application. Combined with local fuel and power costs, the energy-cost impacts of each drive alternative are calculated.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Research seems to point to an all asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) global network with the possibility of mobility, where different types of services will be provided. But before the telecommunications operators decide how to operate wireless communication systems up to these levels, ATM techniques can be used to improve capacity and performance in todayÂ´s cellular systems. The objective of this paper is to present one of the areas where ATM can enhance capacity and performance for mobile systems. The authors discuss the virtual connection tree (VCT) concept, based on ATM transport technology and how it is integrated with CDMA and the possibilities it may bring to present and future personal communications. A possible interface are presented, followed by a cellular system description and simulation to measure the number of handoffs saved when the number of cells covering a given area is increased (i.e. smaller cells imply greater capacity)

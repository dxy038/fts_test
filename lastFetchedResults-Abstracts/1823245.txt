Objective
m of this study was to evaluate possible immunologic relationships between sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and periodontal inflammation and its impact on serum cytokines.

-five Brazilian children of African descent were involved in this study and divided in two groups: SCA (n = 10): confirmed diagnosis of homozygous anaemia; and CTR-control (n = 15): no sickle anaemia. Clinical examination included comprehensive medical (routine physical evaluation) and periodontal exams: plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BoP), and haematological analysis. Serum samples were collected for cytokine evaluation by microarray. Clinical and laboratorial parameters were compared statistically (alpha = 5%).
s
gher values of PI and BoP were similar for both groups (p &gt; 0.05) confirming a diagnosis of generalized gingivitis for all individuals. Intergroup analysis showed higher levels of interferon gamma (IFNγ), tumour necrosis alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-4, -5, -8, -10 and 13 only in the SCA group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, PI was negatively correlated with IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13, while BoP was positively correlated with IL-10.
sion
 the limits of the present study, it was concluded that SCA increase the levels of serum cytokines regardless of the presence of periodontal inflammation. Therefore, a direct immunological relationship between SCA and periodontal inflammation was not established.

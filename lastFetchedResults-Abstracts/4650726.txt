This paper mentions an approach which composes melodies reflecting user´s feelings by interactive genetic algorithms. One melody corresponds to a chromosome containing the information such as tone color, tune, the number of notes and the length of notes. Melodies are composed by the use of GA operations. A user listens to presented melodies and evaluates them whether they fit with his/her image of the melody or not. This evaluation process is performed not by objective fitness functions but by humans. Therefore, this approach uses the interactive GA. The chromosome with the best evaluation is chosen as an elite. Elite characteristics are inherited to chromosomes in the next generation. These procedures are repeated until the user finds a melody fitting with the image of the melody. Experiments are carried out in order to confirm the usefulness of the presented approach. The experimental results show that the presented approach composes melodies reflecting user´s feelings

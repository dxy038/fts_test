Critical to accurate reconstruction of sparse signals from low-dimensional Poisson observations is the solution of nonlinear optimization problems that promote sparse solutions. Theoretically, non-convex &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-norm minimization (0 &#8804; p &lt;; 1) would lead to more accurate reconstruction than the convex &#8467;<sub>1</sub>-norm relaxation commonly used in sparse signal recovery. In this paper, we propose an extension to the existing SPIRAL-&#8467;<sub>1</sub> algorithm based on the Generalized Soft-Thersholding (GST) function to better recover signals with mostly nonzero entries from Poisson observations. This approach is based on iteratively minimizing a sequence of separable subproblems of the nonnegatively constrained, &#8467;<sub>p</sub>-penalized negative Poisson log-likelihood objective function using the GST function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, called SPIRAL-&#8467;<sub>p</sub>, through numerical experiments.

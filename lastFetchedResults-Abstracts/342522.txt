An iron chelate, ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA), induces renal proximal tubular necrosis associated with lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage that finally leads to a high incidence of renal cell carcinoma in rodents. In the present study, we investigated what kinds of C2–12 saturated and unsaturated aldehydes and C7–12  acyloins, metabolites of saturated aldehydes, are produced in the kidney and liver within 24 h after single ip administration of 15 mg Fe/kg of Fe-NTA, or after repeated (1 or 3 wk) ip administration of 5–10 mg Fe/kg of Fe-NTA. Amounts of twenty one aldehydes and five acyloins were determined by capillary column gas chromatography-negative-ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry with ammonia as reagent gas. Most of the aldehydes and all the acyloins measured revealed a significant dose-dependent increase 1 to 3 h after single administration in the kidney, among which 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) showed the highest increase (27.3-fold) and malondialdehyde (MDA) was the most abundant aldehyde (2.40 nmol/100 mg wet tissue). In the liver, however, the increase in aldehydes and acyloins was less prominent. After repeated administration of Fe-NTA, only 9 aldehydes (ethanal; furfural; trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal; nonanal; trans-2,cis-6-nonadienal; HNE; decanal; trans-4,cis-4-decenal; MDA) and 4 acyloins (3-hydroxyheptan-2-one; 3-hydroxyoctan-2-one; 3-hydroxynonan-2-one; 3-hydroxydodecan-2-one) showed a significant increase. Immunohistochemistry further demonstrated an increased amount of HNE-modified and MDA-modified proteins in the renal proximal tubules after repeated Fe-NTA administration. Some of the aldehydes measured such as HNE and MDA are reportedly cytotoxic, genotoxic and mutagenic. Accumulation of these aldehydes may play a role in this renal carcinogenesis model.

The intregration of 362 nm period distributed Bragg reflectors on the surface of LiNbO<sub>3</sub> channel annealed-proton-exchanged waveguides, using laser ablation and characterisation of such structures, is reported. Multiple-pulse exposure was used to fabricate 6%, reflective grating, with a depth of ~50 nm. Mask imaging using a reflective grating, with a depth of ~50 nm. Mask imaging using a reflective objective was utilised

The Fusion Ignition Research Experiment (FIRE) is being designed as a next step option in the U.S. Fusion program. Based upon a review of the DOE Fusion Safety Standard, inventory thresholds for DOE facility hazard classification, radiological release limits to meet the no-evacuation objective, key safety functions, and the potential safety concerns that could threaten the safety functions have been identified. Safety analysis calculations of these events have been performed and the resulting thermal hydraulic behavior and radiological consequences are discussed. We conclude with an overall assessment of the safety of FIRE at this stage in the design process and discuss our future plans

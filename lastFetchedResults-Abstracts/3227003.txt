Multicore is a type of architecture where single computing component has two or more independent actual CPUÂ´s (called cores). In recent days Multicore technologies are used in Real-Time systems. Scheduling of the applications in such an environment is critical for performance of the systems. This scheduling problem can be considered as multiple objective optimization problems considering the objectives of minimizing the total execution time, minimizing the deadline misses and minimizing the power consumption. Conventional methods like, DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) can be used to minimize power consumption. But the blind apply of DVFS in soft real-time multicore systems can lead to more deadline misses. Many of the existing works deal with the offline scheduling with DVFS for power awareness. This paper introduces the PAS-SRTMS (Power Aware Scheduling of fixed priority tasks in Soft Real-Time Multicore Systems) scheduling algorithm. It is a combination of Offline and Online scheduling with DVFS to schedule fixed priority tasks on soft real-time Multicore systems.

High-performance and low-cost 10-Gb/s bidirectional optical subassembly (BOSA) modules that are obtained by adopting low-cost transistor outline (TO)-Can materials and processes are proposed and demonstrated. The BOSA module consists of an uncooled 1.3-mum distributed-feedback laser diode and a 1.5-mum p-i-n/transimpedance amplifier receiver (Rx), which integrate a 45deg tilted thin-film wavelength-division multiplexing filter to transmit a 1.3-mum light into the fiber and reflect a 1.55-mum light into the Rx. The matching resistor and low parasitic inductance packages are applied with the TO-Can laser diode to enable 10-Gb/s operation. A modulation bandwidth of 11.86 GHz and an OC-192 eye diagram of a 19% mask margin are obtained from the transmitter side. After a 10-km single-mode fiber (SMF) transmission, the mask margin for the OC-192 eye diagram decreases to 11%. For the Rx, an OC-192 eye diagram of a 31% mask margin is obtained under back-to-back connections. The mask margin is maintained at 29% after a 10-km SMF transmission. The measured crosstalk penalty is 0.9 d 15 at the Rx side. These results indicate that the BOSA module is capable of a 10-Gb/s bidirectional transmission. This unique high-performance 10-Gb/s BOSA module not only demonstrates the feasibility of a 10-Gb/s bidirectional transmission on an SMF for fiber-to-the-home applications but also shows the low-cost possibility to ensure the success of next-generation 10-Gb/s access networks.

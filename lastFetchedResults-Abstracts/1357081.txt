Garbage collectors are occupationally exposed to a variety of airborne contaminants. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the respiratory health of garbage collectors. This study was carried out in Fars Province, south of Iran. A group of 105 garbage collectors and 93 referent subjects were investigated. A standard questionnaire was administered to both groups. Furthermore, subjects underwent Pulmonary Function Tests. The data revealed that a few symptoms of respiratory disease were significantly more prevalent among garbage collectors. Likewise, significant decrements were observed in some parameters of pulmonary function such as FEV1and FEV1/FVC ratio among garbage collectors. The ventilatory disorder found in spirometry of garbage collectors was consistent with that of obstructive pulmonary disease. Our findings indicate that the prevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as impaired lung functional capacities were more common among garbage collectors than in their control counterparts. This is likely to be attributed to the occupational exposure of this group to workplace contaminants, particularly, bioaerosols.

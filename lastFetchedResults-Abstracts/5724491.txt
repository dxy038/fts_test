The application of L<sub>p</sub>-norm-based estimation techniques to beamforming using the MUSIC algorithm is addressed. An expression is developed for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates that minimizes a sum of terms to the <e1>p</e1><sup>th</sup> power, where <e1>p</e1> may assume values other than 2 (least squares). Additionally, an iterative technique is proposed whereby the effects of previously estimated directions of arrival can be removed from or reduced in DOA spectra, providing the opportunity to resolve arriving waves that were not resolved in the original spectra. Finally, an objective measure of DOA spectrum peak sharpness is presented, which may be used to select among candidate values of <e1>p</e1> for L<sub>p</sub>-norm estimation, and which in some cases provides a means for determining which spectrum peaks correspond to actual arriving waves

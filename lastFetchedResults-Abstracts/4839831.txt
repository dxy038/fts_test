Blind channel estimation algorithms for acoustic channels have generated much interest in recent years due to the innovations in consumer products including, but not limited to, tele- and video-conferencing. The direct path constrained NMCFLMS algorithm was proposed to enhance noise robustness of the conventional NMCFLMS algorithm. In this paper, we propose to extend the direct path constrained NMCFLMS algorithm with the aim of achieving a higher rate of convergence. This objective is achieved by introducing a penalty component to the multichannel blind adaptive cost function and we further derive the proposed extended-NMCFLMS algorithm from first principles. Simulation results show an improvement, both in convergence rate and noise robustness, compared to existing NMCFLMS algorithms.

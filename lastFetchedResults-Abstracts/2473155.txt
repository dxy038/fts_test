Objective
Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause of acute weakness
in children. It has multiple variant forms with different presentations. A rare
initial sign is ptosis. In this study, we present a 10-year-old girl with bilateral
ptosis without opthalmoplegia followed by a weakness in extremities with a
favourable response to intravenous immunoglobulin. Due to the patientâ€™s
initial eyelid levators, myasthenia gravis was ruled out by a Tensilon test and
electrophysiological studies. Our report highlights the possibility of GBS as a
cause of isolated ptosis, especially in cases without ophthalmoplegia

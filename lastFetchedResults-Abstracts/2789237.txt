We report the results obtained from our trials in making the HRP-2 humanoid robot climb vertical industrial-norm ladders. We integrated our multi-contact planner and multi-objective QP control as basic components. First, a set of contacts to climb the ladder is planned off-line and provided as an input for a finite state machine that sequences tasks to be realized by our multi-objective model-based QP in closed-loop control. The trials we made revealed that hardware changes are to be made on the HRP-2, and the software has to be made more robust. Yet, we confirmed that HRP-2 has power capability to climb real industrial ladders, such as those found in nuclear power plants and large scale manufacturings (e.g. airliners, shipyards and buildings).

In this paper optimal control strategies for active power filters working under non-sinusoidal voltage are approached using Pareto Optimal based multi-objective optimization. Where the voltages are distorted, there is some conflict between power factor improvement, current harmonics mitigation, and cost issues. The Strength Pareto multi objective optimization approach is used to simultaneously optimize a set of different objective functions such as current THD, power factor, distortion factor (DF), K factor, and the filter kVA. The result is a set (not a single point) of optimal results called Pareto Front. Designer can make decision to pick out one of the results which are more suitable considering some other requirements. Using multi objective optimization provides a more comprehensive design scenario giving us much more broaden view to the compensation strategy. The extensive simulation results of the optimization for several objective functions shows the suitability of the presented method.

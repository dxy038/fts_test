The main objective of this paper is to study the feasibility of the receding horizon (RH) strategy to generate the collision-free on-line optimal trajectory for articulated manipulators under dynamic environments. Firstly, we employ the elliptical set to represent the no-collision zone around each link, and explicitly formulate collision avoidance constraints using state-space inequalities. Secondly, to address the major drawback of intensive computation load, we adopt so called the external active-set strategy that is recently developed by Chung and Polak. Simulation results with two-link robot are presented to demonstrate how to implement the proposed method. Main features and related issues for the feasibility of the RH strategy are discussed in detail.

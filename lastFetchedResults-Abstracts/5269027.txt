Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), consisting of a large number of sensor nodes connected through wireless medium has emerged as a ground-breaking technology that offers the unprecedented ability to monitor the physical world accurately. Because of resource-constrained nature of sensor nodes, a number of issues have emerged out of which energy-efficiency is an important matter of concern. In this work, we propose an energy-efficient routing scheme called Enhanced Energy-Efficient Protocol with Static Clustering (E<sup>3</sup>PSC) which is basically a modification of an existing routing scheme, Energy-Efficient Protocol with Static Clustering (EEPSC). Similar to EEPSC, the present work partitions the network into distance-based static clusters. However, unlike EEPSC, cluster-head selection is performed by taking into account both the spatial distribution of sensors nodes in network and their residual energy with an objective to reduce the intra-cluster communication overhead among the nodes making the scheme more energy-efficient. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis is performed to establish our claim of energy efficiency of the proposed scheme. A set of experiments is carried out to evaluate the performance of the scheme and to compare the results with EEPSC. Based on our experimental results, it has been found that E<sup>3</sup>PSC outperforms EEPSC in terms of network lifetime and energy consumption.

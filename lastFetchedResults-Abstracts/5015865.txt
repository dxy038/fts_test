The objective of the proposed system is powering a residence with an array of PV modules with total power installed of 6kW. The choice among the series, parallel, and multi string arrangements is based on the analysis of photovoltaic (PV) under partial shading. Analyses are performed with different arrays of PV modules to obtain the better choice. From these analyses is designed a three-phase step-up isolated DC-DC converter with high frequency transformer to track the maximum power point and provide energy to a grid-connected inverter. Simulation results are presented for validation and demonstrate the advantages of using the DC-DC converter with the parallel array.

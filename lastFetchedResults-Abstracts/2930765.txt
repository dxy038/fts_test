The objective of this educational course is to use the inter-relation between chemistry, physics (electromagnetism and modern physics) and material science to gain an understanding of matter. Through the use of real-time interaction, animation, 3-D graphics, and simple artificial intelligence it is hoped that the student will gain a perspective of science not usually obtained from conventional textbooks. The format is to present a series of short modules each of which presents a concept which builds on the previous concept. Each module is expected to include a tutorial of the concept with graphical and/or animated illustrations, and an interactive component which allows the student to test their understanding of the concept.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

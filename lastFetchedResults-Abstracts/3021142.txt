Evaluation of human-machine interface design remains a challenging task. This paper presents a study on a more objective evaluation technique based on the combination of operators´ eye movement and hand movement behaviors. The eye movement reflects the operators´ cognitive process and attention allocation, and the hand movement reflects the operators´ physical hand action. Combination of these two kinds of behaviors may provide an important measuring technique to evaluate different human-machine interfaces and may further give more detailed information about the uses of the information displayed. The experiment was conducted to develop this new technique. The result of the study is promising.

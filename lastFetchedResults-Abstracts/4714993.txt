Detecting proteins in human blood holds the promise of a revolution in cancer diagnosis. Also, the ability to perform laboratory operations on small scales using miniaturized (lab-on-a-chip) devices has many benefits. Designing and fabricating such systems is extremely challenging, but physicists and engineers are beginning to construct such highly integrated and compact labs on chips with exciting functionality. This paper focuses on the presentation of the information technology layer in such an integrated platform that has been developed in the LOCCANDIA project. LOCCANDIA ultimate objective is to develop an innovative nano-technology based (lab-on-a-chip) platform for the medical-proteomics field. The paper presents the main engineering aspects and the architecture of the integrated Clinico-Proteomic environment.

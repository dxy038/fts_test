A new grouping strategy based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for the multiuser MIMO broadcast systems in this paper. Aiming at maximizing the system capacity, the PSO algorithm is introduced to seek the best users group. Besides, two objective functions in PSO applicable for the cases of different requirements on capacity and complexity are also presented, which can be denoted as PSO_I algorithm and PSO_II algorithm respectively. Simulation results reveal that the PSO_I strategy achieves nearly the same capacity performance to the optimal exhaustive search (ES) algorithm, and the PSO_II algorithm is slightly worse than PSO_I algorithm in terms of capacity performance, but with lower complexity.

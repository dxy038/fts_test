A final call for text proposals regarding the TR 25.9xx document for MIMO OTA testing have recently been placed. Previous documents include the methodologies for several anechoic chamber candidates and one mode-stirred reverberation chamber candidate. The objective of this contribution is to present the recent advances in mode-stirred reverberation chamber use for wireless MIMO Over-The-Air testing. This contribution was produced with the help of EMITE Ing, a supplier of mode-stirred reverberation chambers for single and multi-antenna OTA passive and active measurements.

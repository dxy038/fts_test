In the paper, an optimization method based on genetic algorithm was proposed. The objective of the optimization procedure is to minimize the material and construction costs of reinforced concrete structural elements subjected to serviceability and strength requirements described by the code for design of concrete structures Code. Different constraints conditions according to the code for design of concrete structures were given. The objective function of a structural design is penalized. From a two-story RC frame optimization design example, it can be seen that the method proposed in the paper is effective and applicable.

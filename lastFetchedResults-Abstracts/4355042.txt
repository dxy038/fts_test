Asynchronous transfer mode is widely recognized as the standard technology for the support of integrated services in high-speed networks both in the wide and in the local area. This paper proposes a scheme for handling high-speed computer communications, within the connection oriented ATM frame. Each traffic source is assumed to exploit a dynamic connection admission control policy to tune the amount of resources allocated within the ATM network according to the traffic needs. The objective is to investigate the effectiveness of dynamic connection admission control policies as a mean to tackle the burstiness of high-speed computer communications. The dependence of the performance of the proposed scheme on the characteristics of the dynamic connection admission control policy is evaluated, by analysis and simulation, taking into account both network delay and blocking probability

The objective of this study was to determine whether there was significant spatial and temporal variation in macroalgae epiphytic on pneumatophores
of the Grey Mangrove, Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh., in the Clyde River, located 280 km south of Sydney, Australia. Three estuarine
sites in the Clyde River were surveyed seasonally on four occasions over a two-year period, and algal distribution and abundance
assessed in respect to temporal, inter-site, intertidal (from front to back of mangrove stand) and vertical (from bottom to top of pneumatophores)
variation. Sediment and water characteristics, including nutrient levels, were also assessed in order to examine all variables of potential influence
on algal distribution and abundance. The results indicated that intertidal position within sites, and vertical height along the length of the pneumatophore,
were the greatest influence on algal frequency and biomass. Individual species dominated in different intertidal and vertical zones.
These observations, together with the identification of three species of macroalgae that fulfil the criteria for bioindicators/biomonitors of
environmental impacts are discussed.

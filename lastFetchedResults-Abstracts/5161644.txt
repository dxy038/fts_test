In this paper, we investigate coverage control for robotic camera sensor networks. The main objective is to establish a camera sensor network system in practice and to perform an experiment of coverage control. However, the camera sensor is one of the typical anisotropic sensors and we cannot apply most conventional algorithms assuming isotropic sensors. We thus employ the algorithm in which is one of our previous works, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical simulation and experiments.

With a shift to new teaching approaches based on modern learning theories like constructivism and connectivism, collaborative learning gets increasingly important. A basic requirement for collaborative activities is the formation of groups. This has to be taken into consideration for the development of tools supporting collaborative activities. Besides standard grouping functionalities, formal learning scenarios in higher education often require additional constraints for grouping, especially in the context of assessment. Thus, the objective of the project presented in the paper at hand was to create a tool to support rule-based grouping processes, which can be used by different collaboration tools within a single platform.

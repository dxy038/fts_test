In this paper, a hybrid meta-heuristic approach is proposed to optimize the mathematical
model of a system with mixed repairable and non-repairable components. In this
system, repairable and non-repairable components are connected in series. Redundant
components and preventive maintenance strategies are applied for non-repairable and
repairable components, respectively. The problem is formulated as a bi-objective
mathematical programming model aiming to reach a tradeoff between system reliability
and cost. By hybridizing a standard multi-objective fire fly (MOFA) and differential
evolution (DE) algorithms, a powerful and efficient approach called MOF-DE algorithm
which has inherited the advantages of the two algorithms is introduced to solve this
problem. In order to achieve the best performance of MOF-DE, response surface
methodology (RSM) is used to set proper values for the algorithm parameters. To
evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, various numerical examples are
tested and results are compared with methods like NSGA-II, MOPSO and standard
MOFA. From the experiments, it is concluded that the performance of the MOF-DE
algorithm is better than other methods at finding promising solutions. Finally,
sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate behavior of the proposed algorithm.

This paper deals with design and analysis of AVR using proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller optimized by Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm The optimum gain of the controller for the proposed model is obtained with objective function as Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE). The performance of the system is found to be better in every aspect in terms of the settling point, rise point &amp; peak overshoot. By changing the different components of AVR (sensor, generator, exciter &amp; amplifier) by &#177;50 % robustness analysis is performed.

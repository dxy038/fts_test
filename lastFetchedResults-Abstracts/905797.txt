The rapid release of saliva following cognitive or sensory stimulation is termed the cephalic phase salivary response. Optimal methods and conditions for measuring the cephalic phase salivary response have not been established. Consequently, determination of the extent to which the large inter and intra-individual variability reflect biological or procedural influences is not possible. The nutritional significance of the response may be great due to the multiple roles played by saliva in food selection and digestion. The cephalic phase salivary response has been proposed as an objective index of various individual states (e.g. hunger) and characteristics (e.g. dietary restraint, extroversion), but its value for such purposes requires further verification.

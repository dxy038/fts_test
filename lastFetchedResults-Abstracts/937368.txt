Abstract
Objective: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common complications of diabetes. Beside the known factors such as hyperglycemia in the pathogenesis of this complication, other etiologies may play role in the pathogenesis of this complication. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the role of serum vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels in this process. 
Material and Methods: We enrolled 76 diabetic patients (38 patients with DPN and 38 patients without DPN) who were matched in the terms of age, gender, BMI and duration of diabetes. Diagnosis of DPN was based on nerve conduction studies on sural, peroneal and tibial nerves. Serum vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels were measured in these two groups. 
Result: Case and control groups had not significant differences in demographic characteristics. Serum vitamin D level was slightly lower in case group (24.1 ± 19.3 ng/ml vs. 24.9 ± 22.3 ng/ml), but the difference was not significant (P=0.857). Serum vitamin B12 level was higher in patients with DPN without significant difference in the two groups (444.2 ± 273.5 pg/ml vs. 390.4 ± 213.9 pg/ml) (P=0.343). 
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that serum vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels had not significant difference in patients with and without DPN. Further studies are required to better evaluate the role of these factors in development and progression of DPN.

Motivated by the results of rational objective functions on spanning tree, assignment and cycle cover problems, etc. We consider rational objective functions with fixed scale subset problems which includes spanning tree, assignment and cycle cover problems. We design a preprocessing algorithm for it, and prove that our algorithm improves the result of N. Megiddo and the result of M. Shigeno, Y. Saruwatari, T. Matsui on computing complexities, respectively.

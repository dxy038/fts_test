Background: Increase in the prevalence of childhood and adolescence obesity in recent years caused many investigations to be held on effective factors on childhood obesity. Environmental factors have a strong impact and are investigated in many studies worldwide. The objective of this study was to determine the effective factors in Neishabur primary school children.
Materials and Method: Using two stage cluster sampling from 60 Neishbur primary schools, all students who had body mass index(BMI) ?95 percentile, were identified as obese (n=114) and 102 students of the same age and gender were indicated as non-obese pupils. Data were collected by questionnaires. 
Results: Our analyzed data showed that the mean birth weight in obese cases was significantly more than the others. The ratio of first and second born children in obese group was higher than of the non-obese. The ratio of pupils starting complementary feeding earlier than 6 month of age was significantly higher in obese (80.7%) than non-obese children (46.1%).  
Conclusion: High birth weight, birth order and early treatment with complementary foods were associated with obesity among Neishabur primary school children. This should be noted in interventional planning. [ZJRMS, 13(4):24-28]

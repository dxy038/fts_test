The comparative study among the PID controller, the fuzzy controller and the supervisory fuzzy controller, shows the efficiency of the fuzzy controllers over the PID controller. In the supervisory fuzzy controller, a rule base is written such that the upper level fuzzy controller changes the control parameters of the lower level PID controller. The application considered is heating and air conditioning

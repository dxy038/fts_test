Several propositions of NoC architectures claim to provide quality of service (QoS) guarantees, which is essential for e.g. real time and multimedia applications. The most widespread approach to attain some degree of QoS guarantee relies on a two-step process. The first step is to characterize application performance through traffic modeling and simulation. The second step consists in tuning a given network template to achieve some degree of QoS guarantee. These QoS targeted NoC templates usually provide specialized structures to allow either the creation of connections (circuit switching) or the assignment of priorities to connectionless flows. It is possible to identify three drawbacks in this approach. First, it is not possible to guarantee QoS for new applications expected to run on the system, if those are defined after the network design phase. Second, even with end-to-end delay guarantees, connectionless approaches introduce jitter. Third, to model traffic precisely for a complex application is a very hard task. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the area-performance trade-off and the limitations of circuit switching and priority scheduling to meet QoS. Preliminary results show the need of more research in this field, by considering the aggregation of more explicit techniques to control QoS

This area has a special strategic position due to the industrial centers, Shahid Babaee airport, Shahid Beheshti International Airport, railroads, transit road of Bandar Abbas- Esfahan, agricultural centers and vicinity to historical city of Esfahan. Consequently, investigation on the main cause of desertification phenomenon is the main objective of this study. Therefore, IMDPA model was used to study desertification intensity in Segzi plain. In this research, two criteria including geology – geomorphology and soil, consisting of seven indicators (sensitivity of the formation, land use, and slope based upon geology – geomorphology criterion, and soil texture, soil depth, percentage of stone and gravel, and EC based upon soil criterion) were studied. Desertification intensity map was generated by using geometric mean of criteria. With regard to the geometric mean of criteria, soil criterion, with a numerical value of 3.4, and   geology – geomorphology criterion, with a numerical value of 3, were classified in severe desertification class. Finally, the severity of desertification (DS) was calculated to be 3.26 indicating that the region was in severe desertification class. Results showed that EC, with an average value of 3.75, was classified as very intense indicator and had the most impact on desertification of the region.

Multi-objective optimal operation is an integral part of studying a power system. In this paper, a more practical and all-round multi-objective optimal model is developed. In objectives, some factors such as environment pollution and steady-state security regions are further considered as well as general objectives, including cost of generation with valve point loading and transmission losses. An "ideal point" method is applied to make the multi-objective problem a single objective, and an adjusting strategy and concept of optimal regulatory factory implemented to coordinate two kinds of control variables existing in the model are proposed. Finally, the single-objective model is solved via a novel evolutionary computation method developed by the author himself. The decision-making analysis process is tested on IEEE 30-bus experimental system. On the one hand, we can get the satisfactory solution which the decision maker of power systems wants to obtain. On the other hand, we can as yet get different solutions which show the preferred degree of decision to a certain objective. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and validity.

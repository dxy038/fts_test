Background and Objectives: Non-tuberculosis Mycobacteria (NTM) are important due to 
increase in the rate of clinical outbreaks and emerging antibiotic resistance. Mycobacterium
fortuitum is the most common NTMs in Iran. This study was aimed to molecular detection and genetic diversity of clinical isolates of M. foruitum in Iran using RAPD-PCR method. 
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 81 isolates of NTM 
isolated from various clinical samples. The primary identification of M. fortuitum was performed based on Acid Fast staining and routine biochemical tests. After confirmation of the isolates based on PCR, the PCR products were digested with AvaII, HphI and HpaII. The molecular 
typing of the M. fortuitum isolates were performed using PAPD analysis.
Results: Out of 81 tested NTM, 36 strains were confirmed as M. fortuitum. Based on RAPD primers, these isolates were classified into 10 main clusters. Most of the isolates were distributed into RAPD types of 1 (9 members, 25%), 2 (8 members, 22.2%) and 6 (6 members, 16.6%). In RAPD analysis, the major fragments were 300 bp (94.4%), followed by fragment 1000 bp (66.6%). 
Conclusion: The results showed high discriminatory ability of RAPDâ€“PCR method. This 
analysis is able to sufficiently discriminate the genotypic diversity and to prepare epidemiologic information of the M. fortuitum isolates. RAPD techniques is simple, rapid, inexpensive, and is less complicated than most of other molecular typing methods.

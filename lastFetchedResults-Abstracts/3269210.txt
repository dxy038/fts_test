Flexible Alternate Current Transmission System (FACTS) is an important way to improve the utilization of the electrical equipments and system voltage stability. The paper mainly controls the voltage stability in adjacent areas of power system, analyzes the characteristics of different voltage stability problems, and consider the characteristics and control laws of medium and long-term voltage stability and transient voltage stability, then puts forward a multi-objective voltage stability coordinated control strategy that based on SVC ( Static Var Compensator) and TCSC (Thyristor Controlled Series Compensation). Besides, the paper designs appropriate structure controllers of SVC and TCSC, and verifies the control strategy which can be an effective solution to controlling needs and achieve coordination of different voltage control functions in simulation platform.

This graphics extension uses a preprocessor which converts graphics commands into calls to a lower level graphics package. The preprocessor converts the source code containing the extended statements into a Fortran program. The objective is to generate contour plots or graphs with minimum effort by statements such as PLOT(U) or PLOT((X, Y)). In these cases, we are using the default options to specify scaling, coordinate labels, headings, etc. The user may override these default options at the expense of a more complex statement. Use of a preprocessor allows considerable freedom in the syntax.

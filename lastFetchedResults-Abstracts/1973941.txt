There are a large number of ham products produced and consumed throughout the world. The quality of ham is usually evaluated by human quality inspector based on grading standards. To maintain ham quality, processors need to carry out some destructive analysis of samples, which is usually laborious, time consuming and possesses the variability associated with human perception. Therefore, there is a need for the development of objective quality measurement or evaluation systems. Processors expect in-situ non-destructive measurements that can provide objective parameters with the incorporation of all the quality attributes and correlate them with the most demanding quality standards and consumer preferences. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a promising technology that integrates conventional imaging and spectroscopy to attain both spatial and spectral information from the sample. Although the hyperspectral imaging approach has not been widely used for the quality evaluation of hams, it possesses a great potential in attaining information about different physico-chemical properties of ham. With the application of this technology, quality of ham could be ensured in a non-destructive manner and with confidence. The aim of this review is to discuss about the opportunities relating to hyperspectral imaging techniques in the quality evaluation and control of ham.

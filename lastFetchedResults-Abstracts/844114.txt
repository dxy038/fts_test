In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and global stability of periodic solution
(i.e. stationary oscillation) for general bidirectional associative memory neural networks
with impulses. Some sufficient conditions are obtained for stationary oscillation of the
nonautonomous bidirectional associative memory neural networks with impulses. It is
derived by using a new method which is different from those of previous literatures, and
a assumption in previous results does not required. The model considered is more general
and some previous results are extended and improved. An illustrative example is given to
demonstrate the effectiveness and less conservativeness of the obtained results.

In this paper, we discuss the application of a method called concept composition in manipulating a concept from the view-point of other concepts. In this regard, a matching procedure is presented which is capable of justifying the way the items derived from a concept can be observed within the framework of those derived from another concept. The proposed approach is expected to be successfully applicable in research &amp; innovation environments where the final objective is to create new chunks of knowledge based on the existing concepts.

This study seeks to widen the pool of knowledge on the use and characteristics of geosynthetics, specifically in the area of circular foundations supported by geosynthetic reinforced sand. The main objective of the work was to increase the awareness of circular foundation systems and thus increase the accuracy of current laboratory methods. Also, compare the results with that of previous papers on the subject and to provide new model curves to estimate the bearing capacity of circular foundations. In this respect, the foundation and the soil underneath was modeled using four nots isoparameters finite element aid, while, for geogrid reinforcement, the four nots one-dimentional finite element model was used. The sand behavior was based on demolition elasto-plastic drucker-prager criteria and for the reinforcement the linear criteria was used. The paper investigates the effects of the reinforcement placing properties, soil properties, reinforcement properties, and the geometric properties of circular foundations. The results showed that; the bearing capacity ratio at a settlement level for geogrid reinforced sand is effected considerably by parameters such as: reinforcement placement, reinforcement layers, reinforcement strength, geometric properties of circular foundations, and effects of using granular soils. Based on the results achieved, a number of design curves have been developed to assist with the estimation (design) of field bearing capacity of shallow foundations supported by geogrid reinforced soil. Keeping in mind the settlement limitations in real space, the curves have been developed for normal settlement levels up to a settlement ratio of 2.5%.

In this paper we propose a new model for query by image similarity. The model utilizes a fuzzy logic approach to cluster intrinsic image characteristics, which are extracted from subregions of the image. The clustering process provides a set of parameters that are used to compare a target image with a group of images. As a result, the system provides the images in the data set which are similar to the target image. We present as an example some queries by similarity on an image database composed of 20 types of animals. The main objective of this model is to develop an intelligent image query system that can be applied on the web and image databases

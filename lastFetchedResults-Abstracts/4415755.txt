In this paper, we propose a bi- objective Operating Theater scheduling subject to order and assignment constraints. The first objective is to minimize the total time operating theater opening or the makespan. The second is the maximum constraints satisfaction. The problem is a two stage hybrid flow shop with blocking. We compare the firefly algorithm, bats algorithm, particles swarm optimization and local search. In addition to the care specific quantitative and qualitative parameters, we use the average deviation from the lower bound to confirm the effectiveness of the methods. The implementation is done on the operating theater of the paediatric hospital of Oran when it is properly and improperly sized.

In the study of electrical life of the vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) condition assessment, the traditional fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model only considers fuzziness and ignored randomness of uncertainty, while the cloud model considers fuzziness and randomness of uncertainty at the same time; we establish a new condition comprehensive model based on cloud model. Dig the new index parameter, get the actual evaluation vectors using cloud formula, and the entropy method is applied to get the objective weight of each indicator relating to the actual dataÂ´s change rate at the same time. Finally, the cloud model instead of the traditional range is used to dividing the insulating electrical life state level of circuit breaker. The value of each characteristic element is regarded as a cloud droplet which is used to calculate the membership degree of each grade cloud. Through case analysis we find that the result based on the new model is closer to the actual state.

This paper is an article of the control algorithm, the main object of study is linear quadratic Gaussian optimal controller, we call it LQG controller. There is a construction of 110m diameter radio telescope at Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory, CAS, large-diameter telescope has higher requirements of the control algorithm,this is the background of this paper: Based on the existing servo system of 25m telescope in Xinjiang, LQG controller can be studied. Firstly this paper describes the disadvantage of PID controller compared to the LQG controller, then introduces details of the LQG controller derivation of the theoretical model, including LQ controller model, Kalman filter model and the combination of LQG controller on this basis, finally introduces the process of simulation. We simulate LQG controller and PID controller using Simulink. By setting the controller parameters combined with 25 m telescope existing motor parameters the step response of positon loop of antenna control system and bandwidth of the closed loop system can be obtained. Finally we add noise to the controller and get out the filtered and get out the filtered and unfiltered response curve. Then satisfactory results can be obtained by comparing to two curves and the advantages of LQG controller is verified in the antenna control system.

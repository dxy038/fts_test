A novel approach for the design of two-channel QMF banks is proposed. In the design, instead of minimizing the objective function directly, an iterative procedure is used in each step in which the objective function is modified into a quadratic function whose minimum point can be obtained analytically. Compared with the iterative method proposed recently by Chen and Lee (1992) in which the perfect reconstruction condition is formulated in the frequency domain, the perfect reconstruction condition in our method is formulated in the time domain. This avoids calculating large matrices and leads to reduced computation complexity in the design. A case study is included which demonstrates that the proposed method needs only a fraction of the computation time required by the method of Chen and Lee

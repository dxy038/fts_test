The rapid advances of evolutionary methods for multi-objective (MO) optimization poses the difficulty of keeping track of the developments in this field as well as selecting an appropriate evolutionary approach that best suits the problem in-hand. This paper aims to analyze the strength and weakness of different evolutionary methods proposed in the literature. For this purpose, ten existing well-known evolutionary MO approaches have been experimented and compared extensively on two benchmark problems with different MO optimization difficulties and characteristics. Besides considering the usual two important aspects of MO performance, i.e., the spread across the Pareto-optimal front as well as the ability to attain the global optimum or final trade-offs, this paper also proposes a few useful performance measures for better and comprehensive examination of each approach both quantitatively and qualitatively. Simulation results for the comparisons are commented and summarized

A measurement of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) with high spatial resolution was carried out in this study. HRTF measurement is difficult in the proximal region because of the lack of an appropriate acoustic point source. In this paper, a modified spark gap was used as the acoustic sound source. Our evaluation experiments showed that the spark gap was more like an acoustic point source than others previously used from the viewpoints of frequency response, directivity, power attenuation, and stability. Using this spark gap, high spatial resolution HRTFs were measured at 6344 spatial points, with distances from 20 to 160 cm, elevations from -40deg to 90deg, and azimuths from 0deg to 360deg. Based on these measurements, an HRTF database was obtained and its reliability was confirmed by both objective and subjective evaluations.

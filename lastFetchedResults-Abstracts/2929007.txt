Optimal glycaemic control is achieved by diet manipulation and insulin administration. The potential benefits in using decision support systems for diabetic patient management are the cost saving they provide in terms of expensive man hours of verbal instruction by medical experts and the support in terms of objective and consistent decision making by the experts. This paper describes an expert system to assist diabetic patient management by blood glycose monitoring through insulin administration. The system incorporates decision making situations of patient management in Greece where diet, life style and administration of insulin differ from Northern European countries. This application is carried out at the First Propaedeutic Medical Clinic, the Ahepa General Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece

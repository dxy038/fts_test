The objective of the study was to evaluate the general suitability of ergosterol content, CFU, and colony diameters determinations for a range of fungi representing food spoilage moulds for the assessment of their growth on solid substrates, in particular intermediate moisture foods. Sixteen food-borne mould species were inoculated onto DG18 agar overlaid with cellophane, allowing determination of a direct measurement of biomass density weighing. The samples were also evaluated with regard to visible and microscopic colony diameters, total ergosterol content, Thoma counts, viable CFU counts, and so on. The same parameters were assayed in the spore suspensions obtained from those cultures. Data were evaluated by multivariate data analysis using projection methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), showing some groupings among the measured variables, mainly linked to the sporulating/nonsporulating nature of the different species tested. Ratios among the different variables were obtained, compared among the species, and evaluated along time (2–10 days). It was concluded that, as a general rule for all the species, ergosterol content and colony diameters were better correlated to fungal biomass dry weight than CFU counts were. Conversion factors were 0.3–3 μg ergosterol mg−1 biomass dry weight and 76–227 mg biomass dry weight cm−2, depending on the species.

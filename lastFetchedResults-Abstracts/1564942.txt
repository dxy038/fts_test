As a result of our previous studies on finding the minimal element of a set in n-dimensional Euclidean space with respect to a total ordering cone, we introduced a method which we call “The Successive Weighted Sum Method” (Küçük et al., 2011 [1,2]). In this study, we compare the Weighted Sum Method to the Successive Weighted Sum Method. A vector-valued function is derived from the special type of set-valued function by using a total ordering cone, which is a process we called vectorization, and some properties of the given vector-valued function are presented. We also prove that this vector-valued function can be used instead of the set-valued map as an objective function of a set-valued optimization problem. Moreover, by giving two examples we show that there is no relationship between the continuity of set-valued map and the continuity of the vector-valued function derived from this set-valued map.

Background
It has been suggested that health professionals may discard measurement of hip circumference from public health screening efforts. Before discarding the hip circumference in epidemiological surveys, it is important to consider whether any important information is likely to be lost.
Objective

To evaluate the relationship between hip circumference and metabolic risk factors in an urban adult population of Tehranian women.
Design

In this population-based cross-sectional study, a representative sample of 5720 women aged 18–74 years, were included. Demographic data was collected; anthropometric indices and blood pressure were measured according to standard protocol. Hypertension was defined based on Joint National Committee VI (JNC VI). Biochemical analysis was conducted on fasting blood samples. Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dl or 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG) ≥ 200 mg/dl. Lipid disorders and components of metabolic syndrome were considered based on Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III).
Results

Mean age of women was 39.9 ± 14.6 years. Mean body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, waist and hip circumferences for subjects were 27.1 ± 5.1 kg/m2, 0.83 ± 0.08, 86.5 ± 13.1 cm and 103.5 ± 9.8 cm, respectively. Higher hip circumference was associated with lower levels of serum total- and LDL-cholesterol, serum triglyceride, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Subjects in the top quintile of hip circumference had higher values of serum HDL-cholesterol concentration compared to those in the lower category. After adjustment for potential confounding variables and anthropometric measures associated with higher hip circumference, a significant decreasing trend was observed for odds of having high LDL-cholesterol (odds ratios among quintiles: 1.00, 0.98, 0.97, 0.95, 0.84, respectively, P for trend = 0.04), diabetes (1.00, 0.68, 0.58, 0.45, 0.42, P for trend = 0.01), hypertension (1.00, 0.96, 0.82, 0.78, 0.70, P for trend 0.02), low serum HDL-cholesterol (1.00, 1.03, 0.86, 0.82, 0.56, P for trend = 0.04), elevated blood pressure (1.00, 0.99, 0.82, 0.70, 0.61, P for trend = 0.01) and abnormal glucose homeostasis (1.00, 0.69, 0.66, 0.54, 0.48, P for trend = 0.01) among hip circumference quintile categories. Individuals in the upper category of hip circumference had lower odds of having hypercholestrolemia (0.86 vs. 1.00) and high serum triglyceride levels (0.74 vs. 1.00) compared to those in the lowest category.
Conclusion

Hip circumference is independently and inversely associated with metabolic risk factors. This study underscores the importance of continuing to measure hip circumference in epidemiologic surveys in Tehranian adult women.

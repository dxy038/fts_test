Based on analyzing members and organizational structure of Green Construction Supply Chain Management (GCSCM), a mathematical programming model in GCSCM is proposed. The objective function maximized the total profits of normalized construction logistics, reverse logistics and environmental performance. Experiment results showed that the model can improve the total profit obviously. Besides, the paper studied the performance of key factors, including return ratio, subsidies from governmental organizations, and environmental performance in GCSCM. It was concluded that the proper return, subsidy and control strategy could improve GCSCM performance.

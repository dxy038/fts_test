The objective of the project reported in this paper was to study land use change over a period of 23 years using Landsat satellite images using a methodology based on territorial transformation. An analysis of land use change was realized from 1997 to 2000 in the municipality of Texcoco in Central Mexico. The analysis unit was determined by landscape, since modifications that have taken place over the study period are due to the dynamic effects of territorial occupation. The morphological situation was interpreted as it relates to structure and functional level in order to explain the territorial changes observable in this municipality. The land use change in the study area has intensified due to new transportation networks, urban growth and the current plan to extend the international Mexico City airport toward this municipality.

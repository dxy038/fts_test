This paper suggests a novel intelligent closed loop control strategy based on fractional order (FO) PID controller for head positioning servo control system. The design of FOPID controller has been formulated as a single objective optimization framework using time domain optimality criterion and is carried out with help of Differential Search (DS) algorithm. In order to digitally realize FOPID controller, an Oust Loup 5th order approximation has been used. It is shown that the servo system optimally moves the reader head on to the desired track when actuated with FOPID controller than a normal PID controller. Validation results of DS algorithm tuned FOPID controller are compared with PID controller, which shows the superior closed-loop response and robustness of the proposed approach.

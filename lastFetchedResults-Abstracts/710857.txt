Background
An adolescent patient with granulomatous nephritis presents with a large, solid pelvic mass. Pertinent differential diagnosis for this solid ovarian mass as well as discussion regarding treatment challenges for this patient is delineated.
Case
A 15-year-old female presented to her primary care doctor with fatigue and syncope. Initial laboratory workup revealed a hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, an elevated creatinine of 3.5 mmol/L, and an elevated ionized calcium of 13.1 mg/dL. Renal biopsy revealed diffuse non-caseating granulomatous nephritis with rare acid-fast bacilli.
Renal ultrasound first noted a pelvic mass. Pelvic ultrasound revealed a 15.0 × 8.4 × 12.2cm mass, characterized as mostly solid with diffuse spaces, in the location of the right ovary. CA-125 and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) tumor markers were elevated. The patient underwent a left salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic staging. Intra-operative frozen section revealed a dysgerminoma. Final pathology report revealed extensive non-caseating granulomatous inflammation within the ovarian tumor. Special stains showed no evidence of acid-fast organisms.
Conclusion
Dysgerminoma is the most likely solid ovarian tumor in a patient of this age. In light of her initial renal biopsy with acid-fast bacilli, pelvic tuberculosis needs to be considered. Due to its extreme rarity, sarcoidosis of her genital tract should be lower on the differential, yet this patient presented with pathology consistent with non-caseating granulomas suggesting this diagnosis. Once ovarian dysgerminoma was diagnosed, the possibility that this patient's renal findings may represent paraneoplastic syndrome also becomes important for her treatment.

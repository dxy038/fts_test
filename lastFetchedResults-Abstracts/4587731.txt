Stereoscopic 3D video is an important technology for immersive and interactive multimedia. Quality of Experience (QoE) provision is a key objective of the emerging multimedia delivery systems. While subjective assessment of QoE remains the most reliable option, objective metrics are often sought after while engineering practical media distribution solutions. While there have been several efforts in the recent past to develop metrics for stereoscopic video/image quality measurement, an objective metric to measure artefacts caused by transmission packet losses is yet to be realised. Furthermore, most of the existing metrics rely on disparity estimation techniques to provide a quality measure. This paper proposes two metrics for the measurement of compression artefacts and artefacts caused due to packet losses and concealment. The metrics are based on ANSI Video Quality Metric (VQM) metric, and do not rely on disparity estimation. The metrics are trained and validated by conducting two separate sets of subjective experiments, and which illustrate promising results.

Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluated causes and outcome of neonatal respiratory distress syndromes in NICU of Baqiyatallah Hospital.
Material and Methods: The main purpose of this cross-sectional study was evaluation of the causes of neonatal respiratory distress and outcome. 153 neonates admitted to the NICU due to respiratory distress, during one year period, were included in this study.
Results: Among these 153 neonates, HMD was seen in 79 (51.6%) TTN in 24 (15.7%), pneumonia and sepsis in 18 (11.76%) cardiac disease in 8 (5.2%), meconium aspiration in 6 (3.9%), asphyxia, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia in 14 (9.15%). The other causes were diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary nypoplasia, anatomical malformation and esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula. 117 subjects were discharged in good condition and 36 (24.2%) died. The cause of death was HMD in 67.6%, pneumonia and sepsis in 10.80%, cardiac disease in 8.1% and meconium aspiration in 2.7%. No deaths were seen following TTN. In this study pulmunary causes were the most and HMD was the most common cause of respiratory causes. HMD was correlated with lower gestational age and birth weight. HMD was also the most leading cause of death among various etiologies, which is in line with several previous studies.
Conclusion: With respect to our results, by prevention of preterm labour and treatment of affected subjects we may be able to decrease mortality and morbidity of respiratory distress syndromes.

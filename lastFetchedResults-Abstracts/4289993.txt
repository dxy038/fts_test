Titanium aluminides are light, resistant to high temperature and highly robust with a potential to become the materials of the future in the aviation and automobile industry. However, the market success of the TiAl-technology depends largely on the integrative design of the entire product-production system. The objective of the CoE-B&amp;T-Case described in this paper is the application and development of methods for the manufacturing system design in relation to the setting up of a casting facility for components of titanium aluminides in Aachen, Germany. The specific challenge of the B&amp;T-Case is the application of the interdisciplinary and integrative methodology for factory design, which was developed in the CoE. The corresponding planning results will be ensured by a process simulation as well as by an economic evaluation.

The effects of hydrogen implantation on the surface microtopography of 100:silicon single crystals were analyzed by
means of atomic force microscopy AFM.technique. The main objective of the study was to get a new insight into the
processes occurring during the early stages of hydrogen blister formation in SmartCutw technology used in Silicon-on-Insulator
devices manufacturing. The results revealed that hydrogen blistering sets in at doses about 4=1016 Hq2rcm2 by a
formation of small, few tens of nanometer high bubbles. The increase of the implantation dose results first in the growth of
the bubbles up to few hundreds nm and then in the formation of the next generation of small hydrogen clusters. The detailed
analysis of the SiO2 surface layer formed on the silicon crystals indicated the presence of small, few nm in size, hillock-like
structures which can be responsible for the difficulties in SiO2â€“SiO2face-to-face bonding. A possible use of implantation
induced microtopography changes in Microelectronics and Micromechanical Systems applications is also discussed. q1999

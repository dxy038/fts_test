Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase1 (PARP1) plays an important role in the onset and progeression of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of tannic acid[TA, poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitor] on myocardial lesion in STZ-induced diabetic rats and its mechanism. This study shows that expression of PARP1 and PARG protein in diabetic myocardial tissues was markedly (P&lt;;0.01) higher than in control rats, the expression levels of PARP1 and PARG were positively correlated (r=0.891, P&lt;;0.01). TA treatment for 12 weeks inhibited the expression of PARG, and at the same time, the expression of PARP1 was suppressed also. In addition, administration of TA significantly reduced the levels of plasma glucose, 8-OhdG and 3-NT, improved cardiac function. In summary, the role of tannic acid on the myocardium of diabetic rats has a protective effect.

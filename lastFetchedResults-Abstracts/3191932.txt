Nanotechnology is growing up in importance due to its application in several industrial sectors. Developed countries have defined research agendas in this area to develop new products and processes to meet future demands. Some of these countries are carrying out prospective studies, roadmaps and technology forecasting to orient their investments. As it regards to investments and ongoing research projects, the USA, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are the leading countries nowadays. Europe, Germany, England, and France are also running nanotechnology projects, most of them in universities and research institutions. China and India are the developing countries that have invested the most in this area. Based on both research and development (R&amp;D) initiatives and funding worldwide, ROCO (5) developed a conceptual model that can be used to orient prospective studies to help developing countries to define their investment strategies in nanotechnologies. The objective of this study is to use the ROCO model to set up guidelines to be followed by some R&amp;D institutions to optimize their efforts, capabilities and investments in nanotechnology. It is expected that some research institutions and universities can take advantage of its results.

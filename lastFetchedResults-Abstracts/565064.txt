The main objective of third and future wireless mobile communication networks is to provide services efficiently to the mobile users in all environments. In wireless mobile Communication the channel allocation and quality of service are the major factors and important issues to decide the system performance. Here in our work a Hybrid Channel Allocation(HCA)strategy for channel allocation and queuing technique applied to Hybrid Channel Allocation strategy for Quality of Service(QoS) provisioning are implemented. The proposed HCA strategy considers new calls in Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) method and handoff calls in Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA) method to reduce the call blocking and call dropping probabilities. The application of queuing technique applied to HCA strategy increases the efficiency of the cellular system performance especially in micro and pico cellular environments and effectively utilize the available allocated radio spectrum. The performance shows the decrease in call blocking and dropping and an increased number of users in the available channels.

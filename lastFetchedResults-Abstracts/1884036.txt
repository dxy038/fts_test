In this paper, the newly developed techno-economic assessment platform Odyssey introduced in Part 1 of this two-part series of papers is applied to an application example: the call for tenders from the French Energy Regulation Commission on PV installations greater than 250 kWp. In this context, two storage systems are studied: a bank of lead-acid batteries and a PEM hydrogen chain (PEM electrolyzer, H2/O2 PEM fuel-cell, H2 and O2 storages under pressure at 30 bars). The objective pursued in the study of this application case is to assess the economic value of these two energy storage technologies and to focus on different influencing factors. Therefore, in the context of this application case, it is shown how a suitable control strategy can considerably help in improving economic results. The influence of the reference meteorological year is also investigated showing that the variations of economic indicators between two different years are greater than the variation of the annual insolation. Furthermore, the investigation on the influence of the simulation time step shows that the use of large time step (30 min, 1 h) may lead to unsuitable sizing and inaccurate estimations of economic performances. Finally systems sizing have been optimized considering different aging modeling which has shown that the influence of aging on the optimal sizing may be important.

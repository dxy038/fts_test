The potential for addressing problems of uncertainty and nonstationarity in systems design using object-oriented representational techniques is considered. The author investigates cases where object instances are not presumed to be members of object classes with certainty; rather, they have a probability distribution over the set of available object classes. Other characteristics of object-oriented representational techniques are presumed to be carried over intact. The objective is the creation of more robust and adaptable design methodologies. It is shown that certain troublesome concepts in traditional information systems specification, such as the effect of a complex or unstable organizational structure and the application of internal controls, are simplified in a fuzzy object-oriented representational approach

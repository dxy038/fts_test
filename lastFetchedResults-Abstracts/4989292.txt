A novel high-voltage power device, the monolithic bidirectional switch (MBS) is investigated in this work. Planar MBS devices have been fabricated by a self-aligned fabrication process using local oxidation of silicon technique and self-aligned silicidation. Results obtained from electrical characterization are compared with numerical simulations. Using highly transparent universal contacts, bidirectional switching with an excellent on/off current ratio is demonstrated. On-current densities of 75 A/cm<sup>2</sup> at V<sub>on</sub> = 3 V have been achieved even in an exploratory device structure. Simulations further demonstrate the high potential of the MBS for future power electronic systems such as the matrix converter

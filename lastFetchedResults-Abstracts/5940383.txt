Until recently museums have been the sole repositories of an objective factual history. However, with the advent of online interactive media, there has been a shift to alternate forms of cultural exposition. This paper presents a project where 3D CVE is augmented with mobile devices in order to support a collaborative educational exploration of a famous historical site in Norway, where Battle of Stiklestad took place in 1030. This system can be used by both local and distant learning communities, working together towards a common goal. The paper presents a background for the project and describes the preliminary design. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges associated with developing educational augmented virtual heritage applications in a multicultural context.

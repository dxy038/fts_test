Objective The study aimed to examine
the distribution of psychopathic traits in a representative
household population to identify whether a
transition point is reached on a continuum of psychopathy
to indicate a ‘disease’ or categorical entity.
Method Mixture Poisson distribution and epidemiological
procedures were used to examine the distribution
of the Psychopathy Checklist Screening
Version (PCL:SV) score in a sample of 638 adults in
households in Great Britain. Analysis aimed to identify
a cut-off within the population using the distribution
of continuous scores (mean and ½ SD) and
validate a ‘probable’ psychopathy category using a
scale of social and behavioural problems as an
external validator. Results The distribution of psychopathy
within the population was quasicontinuous,
represented by a mixture of three-Poisson distributions
with differing demography and comorbid Axis I
and II psychopathology. Independent calculation
indicated a cut-score at 11.8 on the PCL:SV. There was
an exponential rise of associated social and behavioural
problems at a transition point of 11.3. The
prevalence of ‘probable’ psychopathy was 3.6% (95%
CI = 2.3–5.5%) above this level. Conclusions The
findings suggest a transition from a non-clinical to
clinical state of psychopathy which can be defined
categorically using a cut-off on the PCL:SV. The cutoff
approximates to that previously recommended for
identification of a case using the instrument. Above
this critical level, individuals are at exceptional risk of
compulsory care or incarceration due to multiple
social and behavioural problems. Psychopathy should
be considered for future inclusion in DSM-V and
successfully combines both categorical and dimensional
approaches to diagnosis

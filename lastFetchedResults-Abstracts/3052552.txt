The objective of this study was to develop a thermal display for simulating the thermal cues associated with making contact with materials with different thermal properties. The thermal display was designed based on a semiinfinite body model. The performance of subjects using this display was compared to that with real materials in a material identification experiment. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in material identification when subjects were presented with real or simulated materials. The decreases in skin temperature were also comparable in the two experiments and were related to the contact coefficient of the material palpated, which is consistent with the semiinfinite body model. These findings suggest that thermal feedback in a haptic display can facilitate object recognition when visual cues are limited.

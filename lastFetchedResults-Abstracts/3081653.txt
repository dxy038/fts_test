Secure communications between large number of sensor nodes that are randomly scattered over a hostile territory, necessitate efficient key distribution schemes. However, due to limited resources at sensor nodes such schemes cannot be based on post deployment computations. Instead, pairwise (symmetric) keys are required to be pre-distributed by assigning a list of keys, (a.k.a. key-chain), to each sensor node. If a pair of nodes does not have a common key after deployment then they must find a key-path with secured links. The objective is to minimize the keychain size while (i) maximizing pairwise key sharing probability and resilience, and (ii) minimizing average key-path length. This paper presents a deterministic key distribution scheme based on Expander Graphs. It shows how to map the parameters (e.g., degree, expansion, and diameter) of a Ramanujan Expander Graph to the desired properties of a key distribution scheme for a physical network topology.

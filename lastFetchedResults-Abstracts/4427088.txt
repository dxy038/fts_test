CommandersÂ´ predictive environment (CPE) is a multi- year program that has been undertaken by the Air Force Research Laboratory to develop ways to allow commanders to better anticipate and predict the outcomes of actions of both allied and opponent forces. One objective of this program is to use intuitive and innovative visualization techniques to present known and alternative courses of action within the command center. One such technique currently under development is termed knowledge glyphs. This paper explains and defines knowledge glyphs and presents initial examples of their use. The current model for knowledge glyphs was developed with the objectives that it be internally coherent, referentially comprehensive, and explicitly linked to the visual interface elements that are most critical to commanders when selecting courses of action.

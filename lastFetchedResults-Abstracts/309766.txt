Objective:
To discover and document cases of the rare disease analbuminemia.
Design and methods:
Blood specimens of a subject were analyzed by routine clinical laboratory procedures, by immunochemical tests for albumin, and by electrophoresis with immunofixation using anti-human serum albumin (HSA). Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP), heteroduplex analysis (HA), and DNA sequencing of the 14 exons of the HSA gene were conducted on DNA from leukocytes.
Results:
Albumin concentration was 0.003 g/L; serum globulins and cholesterol were elevated. Immunoelectrophoresis showed no trace of albumin in any of the serum components. The coding region plus all mRNA splice sites were normal and mutation-free, and SSCP and HA showed no abnormalities.
Conclusions:
Data define a bona fide case of analbuminemia. We suggest that the mutation causing the analbuminemic trait in this subject might involve a remote regulatory element.

&nbsp; Background & Aim: Nurses&rsquo; m ental health is an important dimension of quality of life and health care delivery. Job instability can be threatening for mental health of nurses. This study was conducted to assess the relationship between minor psychiatric disorders (MPD) among nurses with their job stability .

&nbsp; Methods & Materials: This was a cross-sectional-analytical study. A total of 771 nurses working in Bushehr and Fars provinces were recruited to the study through multi stage sampling. Mental health status was evaluated using the GHQ-12 questionnaire. The employment type -contractual, apprenticeship, permanent, and fixed term- were used as items to measure job stability. Data were analysed using latent class regression .&nbsp;

&nbsp; Results: About 27.48% of nurses suffered from MPDs. There was no significant relationship between the types of employment with MPD . There was a significant relationship between MPD with gender (P=0.049). Females were 20% more likely to have MPD .

&nbsp; Conclusion: Prevalence of MPD among nurses was in the moderate level. High prevalence of MPD among female nurses shows necessity of providing appropriate strategies to control MPDs such as anxiety and stress among nurses .

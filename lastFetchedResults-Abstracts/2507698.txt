Objective: Methylmalonic acidura (MMA) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of
metabolism. In this study we present a novel nucleotide change in the mutase (MUT)
gene of two unrelated Iranian pedigrees and introduce the methods used for its functional
analysis.
Materials and Methods: Two probands with definite diagnosis of MMA and a common
novel variant in the MUT were included in a descriptive study. Bioinformatic prediction of
the splicing variant was done with different prediction servers. Reverse transcription- polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) was done for splicing analysis and the products were
analyzed by sequencing.
Results: The included index patients showed elevated levels of propionylcarnitine (C3).
Urine organic acid analysis confirmed the diagnosis of MMA, and screening for mutations
in the MUT revealed a novel C to G variation at the 3Â´ splice acceptor site in intron
12. In silico analysis suggested the change as a mutation in a conserved sequence. The
splicing analysis showed that the C to G nucleotide change at position -3 in the acceptor
splice site can lead to retention of the intron 12 sequence.
Conclusion: This is the first report of a mutation at the position -3 in the MUT intron
12 (c.2125-3C > G). The results suggest that the identified variation can be associated
with the typical clinical manifestations of MMA.

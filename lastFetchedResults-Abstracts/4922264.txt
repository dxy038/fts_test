This paper presents a modified PSO algorithm for solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems. Based on the constraint dominance concept, the proposed approach defines two sets of selection rules for determining the cognitive and social components of the PSO algorithm. The simulation results to the four constrained multi-objective optimization problems demonstrate the proposed approach is able to find Pareto-optimal solutions effectively.

CMODE (Combining Multi-objective Optimization with Differential Evolution) technique has been proved to be very efficient to design a low power low phase noise LC Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO). The proposed technique optimizes the power consumption and phase noise of the 3.3-4 GHz LC-VCO for GSM-900 standard. The performance indices are optimized by using CMODE technique in MATLAB and corresponding optimal design parameters are obtained and implemented in 90 nm CMOS technology. The Figure Of Merit(FOM) is found out to be -192.436 dBc/Hz @ 3 MHz and -180.1 dBc/Hz @ 100 kHz offset with a very low power consumption of 849.7 &#956;W.

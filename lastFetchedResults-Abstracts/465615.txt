Objective: Recently, it has been proposed that hereditary coagulation abnormalities leading to an increased venous thrombosis risk may play a role in the development of preeclampsia. We tested this hypothesis in women who have had preeclampsia compared with matched control subjects. Study Design: We conducted a case-control study of 163 women with preeclampsia during 1991-1996. Control subjects were matched for age and delivery date. Patients and control subjects were tested for the presence of factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A allele, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiency. Logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. Results: The prevalence of these genetic risk factors was similar in the patient group (12.9%) and the control group (12.9%; odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-3.9). Unexpectedly, we found a high prevalence of factor V Leiden in the control group (9.2%). Conclusion: We found no differences in the prevalence of genetic risk factors of thrombosis in women with preeclampsia compared with control subjects. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:975-80.)

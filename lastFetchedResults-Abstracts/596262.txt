Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), also known as mice fever, is an acute viral zoonosis and it appears in the natural focus after the human contact with Hantaan virus infected mice. The objective (purpose) of this project is: to determinate the rate of Morbidity (Mb), Mortality and Lethality (Lt); to investigate the collective immunity in endemic focus. In this project we applied the epidemiological method of studying with retrospective-perspective, the serological method for determination and detecting antibodies from the persons of epidemical focus and statistical methods. The disease diagnosis is based on the epidemiological, clinical and serological records. The collected samples have been sent to referral laboratory in Medical Faculty-Institute of Microbiology Ljubljana for laboratory confirmation. From the results we came to conclusion that in the territory of Republic of Kosovo, the HFRS is still a serious health, economic and biological problem. The lethality rate from HFRS in 1986 was 15.4%, 1986-89 10.8%, from 1995-2006 8.70%.The lowest rates of morbidity, mortality and lethality of HFRS compared with the previous periods of time, prove collective immunity growth in Dukagjini valley. For collective immunity research and to conduct the persistence of antibodies for viral corresponding (relative) antigen, after the disease, the samples were collected in the time period of May-June 2008, with 203 persons that were tested with serological method IIF (Indirect immune fluorescence) from which 187 cases (92.1%) resulted sero-negative and 16 cases (7.9%) resulted sero-positive with HFRS. This proves the collective immunity increase for HFRS. Out of the total number of sero-positive persons with HFRS (16 cases) the highest number resulted in persons of first contact with 12 cases (75%) sero-positive with HFRS, while the lowest number in persons with hemodialysis with only 1 case (6.3%); (high level of antibody for HTN and DOB, with level 1:1024).The collected samples in the period May - June 2008, have been tested with serological method IIF in health workers and 20 healthy persons (control group). Antibodies for viral antigen were not found in any of the cases (HTN, PUU and DOB).From 13 recovered patients previously diagnosed with HFRS (1986-1989-1995), levels of antibodies were screened in 2008 with IIF. Out of 13 persons, positive antibodies were found in 10 cases, while 3 cases were negative for antibodies (HTN, PUU, and DOB).After 13, 19 and 22 years HTN, PUU and DOB antibodies persisted in level (1:16-1:512). Based on the gathered results, we came to conclusion that it is necessary to compile the National Strategy of Surveillance for the Kosovo Health System for a 5 year period, for avoiding this high risk disease.

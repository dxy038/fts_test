The objective of the paper is to put forward a portable, robust, applicable to wide variety of environments and user-friendly device to measure the level of awareness of human brain. The estimation process of consciousness-level is based on the electroencephalography (EEG). The device uses two skin surface electrodes (non-invasive). One electrode, acting as the measuring electrode, is placed on the frontal region of the human scalp to scan the bio-potential generated by the neuron network (representing oneÂ´s conscious awareness) with respect to a reference electrode (which is attached to the ear lobe of the subject). The device is powered by a simple but dedicated software algorithm for signal acquisition and signal conditioning followed by the display of results for necessary diagnosis. It scans the complex brain wave and identifies the presence of Beta (&#946;) waves (13-30Hz). These &#946;-waves indicate the awareness of the subject. The analysis software performs a faithful comparison of the acquired data with the standard database (stored in the memory device of the hand-held computer). The algorithm is programmed in LabVIEW environment to translate the information from the sensor to a meaningful data array for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency spectra. The results obtained through our proposed gadget are in closed agreements with the actual clinical conditions.

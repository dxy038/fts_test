In the construction machinery research and development design, the design of steering trapezium mechanism was essential. This article needed to discover one method that would realize fast to obtain the optimized design and the result output of steering trapezium in known wheelbase and vehicle tread and other design entity parameter situations. Through the wheel kinematics analysis in the steering process to the construction machinery, obtained the theory corner relations and the actual corner relations for left and right wheel under three ways for the front wheel steering and the four wheel steering and the crab shape. Introduce a concept for average angle deviation of internal wheel as the objective function. Established the partial objective function under three kinds steering the way separately. According to the construction machinery actual work operating mode request, had determined the weighting factor under the each kind steering way, has established the comprehensive objective function. Chooses the complex unification goal function method to take the optimized method, had compiled the optimized design and the computational procedure based on the C language. And by one kind of construction machinery took the computation example, has made the optimized design and computed result processing to its steering trapezium mechanism. The result indicated, optimized design model establishment and optimized design method choice were accuracy. The optimized design result conforms to the construction machinery to steering the performance requirement completely, and satisfies the construction machinery to steering under the front wheel steering and the four wheel steering and the crab shape three kind of work operating modes.

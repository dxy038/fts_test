This paper describes a new simple logical method for finding perspective rectangle structural shapes on the image. The proposed method uses a one (1) dimensional array to analyze the rectangular shape. Today machine vision is a useful tool for external feature measurement since it provides a reliable and objective means for evaluating products based on visual features. An ultimate goal of this project is to trap the rectangular shape objects. This paper focuses on one main primitive operation, i.e. shape analysis.

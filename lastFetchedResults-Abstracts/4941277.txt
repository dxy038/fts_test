The problems related to free sex and sexual deviance increase every year, and ironically, Muslims, and teenagers are the most involved. Various measures have been taken to solve these problems. However, none of them have been proven to be effective. The baby dumping and abortion cases tragically increase by years. As an Islamic country, it is wise to refer to the religious approach for solutions. Sex education in Islam provides guidelines in manners related to what is allowed and forbidden, and stresses the faith towards the religion. Islam believes that parents play the main role to educate their children about this matter. Even so, the parents seem to be unaware on the importance of this form of education. Furthermore, the deficiency of this `taboo´ learning material in conveying the information makes the situation more stressful. Thus, the objective of this study is to propose an Islamic Sex Education (ISE) interactive courseware. It also attempts to change the parents´ motivational level in encouraging the awareness towards Islamic sex education. This paper covers the motivational design and development of the ISE interactive courseware. Besides that, it also includes the literature review of the study and the methodology involved. In conclusion, the effort in designing and developing this courseware can hopefully be a parental guide to sex education, as well as a solution in reducing free sex and sexual deviance problems in Malaysia.

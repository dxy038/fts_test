This paper describes a risk-based approach for multi-objective maintenance schedule of transmission line. A novel risk index is calculated by probabilistic load flow method, which accounts for the fluctuation of generator power, loads and transmission lineÂ´s outages. Elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to find the optimal solutions in large search space. The test results on the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.

The objective of the paper is the description of the implementation of the WAVE model and language for highly parallel processing in open computer networks as well as an application of the distributed WAVE interpreter for modelling complex systems within an object-oriented philosophy. WAVE represents a new distributed programming paradigm enabling the dynamic creation and processing of arbitrary network-structured knowledge. The model operates in a spatial pattern-matching, logic-flow, mode, without any centralised control

Menaquinone (vitamin K2) is an essential component of the electron transfer chain in many pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus, and menaquinone biosynthesis is a potential target for antibiotic drug discovery. We report herein a series of mechanism-based inhibitors of MenE, an acyl-CoA synthetase that catalyzes adenylation and thioesterification of o-succinylbenzoic acid (OSB) during menaquinone biosynthesis. The most potent compound inhibits MenE with an IC50 value of 5.7 Î¼M.

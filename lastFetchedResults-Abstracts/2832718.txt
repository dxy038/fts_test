Recent research work reveals that the performance of translucent optical network is very near to fully opaque network but much better than transparent network in terms of cost and overall blocking. A translucent optical network is capable to reduce the network design cost as well as routing cost by dividing each light-path into one or limited number of segments by selecting some nodes as regenerator nodes in the network which helps retain the original optical signal quality. Minimization of the total number of placed regenerators and selection of their best locations to establish a path between every pair of source-destination nodes in the network are the main objective of translucent optical network design. This is known as regenerator Placement Problem (RPP) which has been proved to be NP-complete. This paper will provide an overview of various research works and heuristics developed on RPP along with their advantages, drawbacks and performance.

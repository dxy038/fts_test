Background Recent studies in Brazil have
demonstrated that suicide rates have been rising over
the last years. The objective of this study was to investigate
trends in suicide from 1979 to 1998 in Rio de Janeiro
State, with emphasis on age, period, and cohort effects.
Method Age-specific suicide rates from 1979 to 1998
were estimated for males and females based on mortality
data obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information
System, and population counts from the 1980, 1991
and 2000 censuses. Poisson regression and graphical
methods were used to evaluate age, period and cohort
effects. Results Suicide rates increased steadily with age,
particularly among males. In both males and females,
age-adjusted suicide rates decreased until 1992. In 1993,
rates started to rise.Cohort effects showed that younger
generations had significantly lower rates of suicide than
older ones. Conclusion The recent rise in suicide rates
might be a result of the increasing levels of firearm availability,
drug use, and unemployment. Follow-up over
longer periods and powerful epidemiological studies
are needed to sustain the implication of socio-economic
changes in the observed features.

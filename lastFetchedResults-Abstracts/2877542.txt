In this paper, an algorithm for many-objective evolutionary computation, which is based on the NSGA-II with the Chebyshev preference relation, is applied to multi-objective design optimization problem of dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator (DBDPA). The present optimization problem has four design parameters and six objective functions. The main goal of the paper is to extract useful design guidelines to predict control flow behavior based on the DBDPA parameter values using the resulting approximation Pareto set obtained by the optimization.

With the exploitation of resources, many resource-based cities faced with many difficulties of mining depletion and city decline, so how to realize effective transformation of industrial ecology and sustainable development becomes a focus of research and practice. A reasonable and scientific performance evaluation of eco-industrial transformation has important significance in guiding transformation work. The overall objective of this study is to set up a performance evaluation index system. This paper studied six special characteristics of performance evaluation of the transformation of industrial ecology in resource-based cities. A model of performance transformation of industrial ecology and performance evaluation index system based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) were set up. It is concluded that AHP is a scientific and reasonable method for performance evaluation and it is necessary to evaluate performance in the transformation of industrial ecology in resource-based cities.

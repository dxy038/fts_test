Gold and copper ball bonds were isothermally aged under moist conditions (85&#176;C and 85% relative humidity (RH)) and wet conditions (85&#176;C in DI water with and without NaCl) in an effort to better understand the corrosion mechanisms that operate under moist and wet conditions. The objective of this work is to undertake and report on the initial stages of a research project that aims to compare the performance and assess the performance limits of gold and copper ball bonds.

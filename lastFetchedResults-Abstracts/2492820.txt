Objective (s): This study aimed to assess the nutritional transition from a healthy nutrition pattern to unhealthy habits.
Methods: This was a descriptive study of a sample of 483 individual aged over years  living in Tabriz, Iran. We used multi-stage cluster sampling method and due to the intergenerational nature of the study, respondents were divided into three different groups: the youth (aged between 15 to 29 years old), the middle aged (aged between 30 to 54 years old) and adults (above 55 years olds). 
Results: Comparing the mean of intergenerational dietary pattern showed that the mean of dietary pattern (healthy, unhealthy) was significantly different among three studied generations. According to the results, the adult generation had the highest mean score of healthy food consumption and the youth had the lowest one. Additionally, by taking background variables into account, the mean score of respondentsâ€™ nutrition pattern was significantly different for middle-aged generation based on the birthplace and the level of education and for youth and middle-aged generation based on the variable of social class. 
Conclusion: The findings suggest that nutrition transition occur among younger generation Indeed raising the nutrition awareness and providing correct pattern of food consumption among young people is recommended.

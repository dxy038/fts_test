Supervised alternative clusterings is the problem of finding a set of clusterings which are of high quality and different from a given negative clustering. The task is therefore a clear multi-objective optimization problem. Optimizing two conflicting objectives requires dealing with trade-offs. Most approaches in the literature optimize these objectives sequentially or indirectly, resulting in solutions which are dominated. We develop a multi-objective algorithm, called COGNAC, able to optimize the objectives directly and simultaneously and producing solutions approximating the Pareto front. COGNAC performs the recombination operator at the cluster level instead of the object level as in traditional genetic algorithms. It can accept arbitrary clustering quality and dissimilarity objectives and provide solutions dominating those of other state-of-the-art algorithms. COGNAC can also be used to generate a sequence of alternative clusterings, each of which is guaranteed to be different from all previous ones.

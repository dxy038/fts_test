The energy management problem of finding the optimal split between the different sources of energy in a charge-sustaining parallel HEV, ensuring stability and optimality with respect to a performance objective (fuel consumption minimization over a driving cycle), is addressed in this paper. The paper develops a generic stability and optimality framework within which the energy management problem is cast in the form of a nonlinear optimal regulation (with disturbance rejection) problem and a control Lyapunov function is used to design the control law. Two theorems ensuring optimality and asymptotic stability of the energy management strategy are proposed and proved. The sufficient conditions for optimality and stability are used to derive an analytical expression for the control law as a function of the battery state of charge/state of energy and system parameters. The control law is implemented in a simplified backward vehicle simulator and its performance is evaluated against the global optimal solution obtained from dynamic programming. The strategy performs within 4% of the benchmark solution while guaranteeing optimality and stability for any driving cycle.

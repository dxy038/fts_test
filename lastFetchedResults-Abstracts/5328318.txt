So proposed a new load density forecasting method for objective network planning which based on the city´s objective planning identified by the nature of land area that can reduce the uncertainty of land area. Using this method to processing the collected data of the Zhongshan perspective land area and a large number of load information supplied by Zhongshan Power Supply Bureau, which can eliminate the conventional forecasting methods´ uncertainty in line with land area. The uncertainty of land area was locked in each load density, and comparing and anglicizing this forecasting method with the horizontal comparison method, and forecasted the level of forecasting electricity and load spatial distribution forecasting for Zhongshan. The results showed that it significantly reduced the load forecast uncertainty factors and improved the accuracy of load forecasting.

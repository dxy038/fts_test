In this paper, the critical parameters of a method of welding with shielding
gas arc welding (GMAW) are discussed; this method is an important process
in creating high quality metal permanent connections in various industries,
including the automobile industry to improve the quality of stem
diameter welding parameters. One of the most useful techniques for modeling
and solving the problems is Response Surface Method. In this paper,
considering five most important factors such as speed welder, torch angle
with the work piece, electrode diameter, wire speed, gas consumption ,and
CO2 levels as input variables, can be controlled independently from the
level of response, the relationship between the input variables and the response
variables were determined using linear regression. Then optimum
 value for each factor was calculated using non-linear programming model
to evaluate the results obtained along with the comparison of output of the
Simulation Annealing Algorithm.
In this study, both qualitative and quantitative variables are considered to
evaluate and optimize all response variables regarding that these variables
are not the same, and then fuzzy set theory and LP metric are used to find
answers for multi-objective optimization methods.

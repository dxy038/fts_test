In this paper an epistemological model of learning fields of probabilistic events is
formalized. It is used to explain resource allocation governed by pervasive complementarities as the
sign of unity of knowledge. Such an episteme is induced epistemologically into interacting, integrating
and evolutionary variables representing the problem at hand. The end result is the formalization of a
probabilistic model of learning that has no optimal points; only simulating the objective criterion. In
such an objective function, variables and their representations are simply learned continuously, and
this generates evolutionary general equilibrium points. Such points can be computed by computational
general equilibriums under the impact of learning in unity of knowledge. Of all approaches to such a
study only the doctrine of the paired universe of the Qur’an stands out as universal and unique. In this
regard the Qur’an says (36:36), “Glory to God, Who created in pairs all things that the earth produces,
as well as their own kind and things of which they have no knowledge.” Upon the episteme of unity is
constructed the probabilistic model of learning fields. In it we refer to the specific issue of money-real
economy linkages as a resource mobilization problem involving an asset valuation approach. Some
empirical evidence is placed in respect of the consequences expected from the study of probabilistic
models of learning fields applied to economic and financial problems.

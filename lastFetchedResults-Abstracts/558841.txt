Background: The emergence of resistance among bacteria makes it necessary to continuously quest for new antimicrobial agents.Objective: The present study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of essential oils from Artemisia and Cumin plants.Methods: This was an experimental study carried out at the School of Medicine of Tarbiat Modares University (Tehran, Iran) in 2005. Essential oils of Cuminum cyminum, Bunium persicum seeds and aerial parts of Artemisia turcomanica were prepared by hydrodistillation method. Essential oils of A. khorassanica, A. ciniformis, and A. kopetdaghensis were previously obtained and described. The activities of essential oils were evaluated against a clinical isolate of Vibrio cholerae (isolated during the recent outbreak of cholera in Iran), Escherichia coli ATCC25922, a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 using disc diffusion assay and broth microdilution method for determination of MIC. The components of oils were identified by Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.Findings: Essential oils showed an acceptable level of antibacterial activities. A. khorassanica and A. turcomanica oils demonstrated the highest activity (inhibition zone: 60 mm) followed by A. ciniformis, A. kopetdaghensis, C. cyminum, and B. persicum, respectively. The major constituent in A. turcomanica oil was camphor and that of Cuminum cyminum and Bunium persicum oils was cuminaldehyde.Conclusion: The results of the present study suggested the effects of essential oils against the tested bacteria in vitro, may contribute to the in vivo efficacy of these oils.

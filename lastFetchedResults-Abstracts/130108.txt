Women are faced with violence in the private sphere (by their father, husband) and in the society (public sphere). Regarding irretrievable impacts of violence on women and society, governments have not considered the matter seriously. The objective of this article is to present research findings on disguised violence that is violence in the family (domestic violence) which for many reasons are not reported.
This research is conducted in Shahre Kord (in west of Iran) with 162 married couples in the year of 2001. Variables such as employment status, educational level, relations before marriage type of marriage (decided by others or on their own), men's authority, age differences and others intervention (men's or women's relatives) have been analyzed.
The most significant variable related to violence against women is men's hegemony and authority in the family.

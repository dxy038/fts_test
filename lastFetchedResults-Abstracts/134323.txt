Objective: Determination of incidence of cancellation of ART cycles, and factors influencing the cancellation. Data collection and materials/methods included 400 patients undergoing induction ovulation for ART. Incidence of cancellation of ART cycles was estimated.
Results: Cancellation rate incidence was 10.5% that was higher in 35 year olds and older patients. Incidence of cancellation rate was higher in HMG user group and infertility due to tubal factor. The rate of cancellation was similar in patients with increasing drug dosage and those with fixed drug dosage. Rate of cancellation was also similar in both patients with more than two cycles and those with two cycles or less.
Discussion: This study supports previous observations, correlations between age and ovarian response. Incidence of cancellation rate was higher in patients with tubal factor which supports the thesis correlating
ovarian response and tuba-ovarian environment.
Conclusion: Cancellation rate incidence was 10.5%. Poor responses of ovaries for developing follicles and absence of oocytes after retrieval were the most frequent factors responsible for cancellation rate.

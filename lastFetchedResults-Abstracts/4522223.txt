A method of lightweight optimization design based on crash is developed for car body. The thicknesses of car body parts are optimized with an objective of minimized body weight and the restraint of body stiffness and modal. The crashes of car body and occupant restraint system are simulated to verify the safety performance of lightweight car body. The thicknesses of parts are modified with the result of crash simulation to satisfy the safety requirement of lightweight optimization design. The case study of the lightweight optimization design based on crash shows the feasibility of the method which can guarantee the safety performance of the lightweight car body.

Narrow-beam, low-sidelobe antennas may be used to enhance communication in the presence of sidelobe interferers. Protection against main-beam interferers as well can be obtained through the use of an adaptive multibeam antenna. Such an antenna, suitable for time-multiplexed, multichannel signals is described here. The objective is to permit successful communication and signal direction-of-arrival tracking in the presence of a large number of sidelobe interferers and a small number of main-beam interferers.

Consumers are increasingly concerned with the form and quantity of fat present in the foods they consume. This is leading to a shift in the way food is produced. In particular the animal industry is increasing the number of organic and naturally finished meat animals rather than finishing them on grains. The objective of this study was to determine if different pasture compositions (i.e. grass only or grass legume mixtures) would impact the fatty acid (FA) meat composition of beef steers (Bos taurus L.). The pasture treatments were tall fescue [Lollium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S.J. Darbysh] only, or tall fescue combined with either red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) or alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. ssp. sativa L.). Beef steers (n = 9â€“10 per treatment) rotationally grazed each pasture treatment. Forage from treatments were different for crude protein (CP), in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) and the FA myristric (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), palmitoleic (C16:1), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and total FA. Steers grazing mixtures with either red clover (RC) or alfalfa (ALF) had greater average daily gains (ADG) than tall fescue only. Additionally, RC treatment steers had larger ribeye areas (REA) and greater finishing weights than those in the ALF treatment. However, the differences found between pasture treatments in FA concentration did not translate to any differences in the FA concentration of meat harvested from steers. Thus, it is concluded that although the pastures contained different FA concentrations, with the levels of legumes present, this does not influence the FA composition of beef.

In this paper, we focus on the positioning of an unknown radio interference source (RIS) in cellular networks. To locate the unknown RIS in the current cellular system-s without modifying existing base station (BS) structure, we propose a novel positioning scheme based on received signal strength (RSS) information at the BS antenna ports. To solve the positioning objective function, we propose an algorithm named gradient search to achieve a good tradeoff between the positioning accuracy and computational complexity. The results show that the proposed positioning algorithm has a comparable accuracy with the maximum likelihood (ML) solution. Whereas, the computational complexity is much lower and it can be easily implemented in real systems.

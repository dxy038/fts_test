The objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of alternative monetary rules on real
exchange rate persistence. Using a two-country stochastic dynamic general equilibrium with
nominal price stickiness and local currency pricing, we will show how the persistence of
purchasing power parity deviations can be related to a monetary theory of these deviations.
When monetary policy lean against the wind, there is no relationship of proportionality
between the time during which prices remain sticky and the persistence of the response of the
real exchange rate: in this case high nominal price rigidity is not sufficient, per se, in generating
any persistence following a monetary shock. Moreover, we emphasize the role of interest rates
smoothing policies and relative price stickiness within countries in understanding the
relationshipbetween the real exchange rate and monetary shocks. With reasonable parameters
values, a wide range of monetary policy rules can generate real exchange rate autocorrelations
around the ones observed in the data.

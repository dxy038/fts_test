Objective. This study was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of transmural capillary ingrowth into the inner surface of biosynthetic vascular prostheses (Omniflow, BioNova, Melbourne, Australia) through perforations created by an excimer laser, thus inducing an endothelial cell coverage.
Method. Biosynthetic vascular prostheses (Omniflow, 10 cm length, 6 mm diameter) were perforated with an excimer laser (diameter of the holes 50 to 100 Î¼m, distance 4 mm) and implanted into the carotid arteries of eight sheep. They were compared to untreated Omniflow prostheses implanted at the contralateral side. Three months after implantation the prostheses were explanted and evaluated by gross morphology, histologic examination, scanning electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical staining for factor VIII to identify endothelial cells.
Results. All grafts remained patent. Gross morphologic examination revealed no significant difference in the thrombus-free surface between perforated and untreated prostheses. However, scanning electron microscopy showed endothelial cells in the midgraft portion of all perforated prostheses, whereas collagen fibers, fibrin meshwork, and activated platelets formed the inner layer in six of eight untreated Omniflow prostheses. Transmural capillary ingrowth in the laser group was verified by positive factor VIII staining for endothelial cells in the laser channels.
Conclusion. Spontaneous endothelialization of biosynthetic vascular prostheses can be achieved by transmural capillary ingrowth through perforations in the wall of the prostheses in an experimental sheep model.

This paper focuses on Ad Hoc routing problems on IEEE 802.15.4 in which nodesÂ´ speeds and courses are different. The objective is to optimize the performance of the proactive OLSR routing protocol in terms of key metrics for real time services - End-to-End Delay and Throughput - within the selected stable-connecting route, in terms of the number of link disconnection during a unit of time. The fuzzy heuristic probability is used as the key for routing metric. For validation purposes, the protocol is applied to compare to conventional OLSR algorithm, in terms of the minimum hop, and the fuzzy routing metric. Simulations are evaluated with focusing on the constant packet traffic within the realistic-road mobility scenario. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm approaches the significant performance improvement of the scenarios and metrics of interest. The contribution for this routing is for solving inter-vehicle communications, or VANET routing problems.

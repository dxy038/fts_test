For determine the performance of footwear it is nee essary assesses its effects on plantar pressure. Pr evious studies have found that the design change in shape and sole structure can significantly alter shoe plantar pressure in specific regions of the foot, which would prevent illnesses and supply more comfort. A pilot study was carried out in order to evaluate the plan tar pressure distribution of a new design of footwear with the curved sole on a group of females who works in a dental clinic. Objective: The aim of this preliminary study was to directly assess the effect of the footwear with the curved sole on plantar pressure distribution patterns in standing position. Methods: The pilot study was conducted in two sessions with an interval of 20 days. Records were taken using a platform of pressure measurement distribution in normal subjects, in (a) bare foot, (b) conventional shoes and (c) footwear with the curved sole. Mean pressure and contact area were collected. This study has revealed significant differences between the plantar pressure patterns found in normal subjects wearing footwear with curved sole compared to those found when they were wearing conventional shoes in standing position.

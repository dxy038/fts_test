The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to present empirical findings, using data drawn from a comprehensive two year study of biomedical practice and patients perceptions of treatment and recovery done in a Mexico City public hospital, identifying specific  aspects of the doctor-patient relationship that impact on patient perceived recovery. Second, and flowing from the first, the objective is to consider broader theoretical issues relevant to the doctor-patient relationship, the role it plays in the healing process and in biomedical practice, especially in a developing nation such as Mexico. The paper is divided into two sections: in Section I, the problem is defined and the methodology and findings are described, employing statistical and qualitative analyses. While enormous importance has been given to the doctor-patient relationship in biomedicine, the results of the study using statistical analysis, reveal that only particular components of the physician-patient encounter significantly influence differential treatment outcomes. In Section II the significance of the findings are discussed and theoretical issues are addressed bearing on the physician-patient relationship, and patients' perceptions of treatment. To illuminate the differential perceptions of treatment outcomes by patients with non-life-threatening disorders, the concept of life's lesions is proposed.

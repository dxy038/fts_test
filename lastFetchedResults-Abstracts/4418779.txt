The paper deals with the development of a real time system for the reproduction of an immersive audio field considering the crosstalk cancellation and the room response equalization issues. In particular, the real-time system is composed of two parts: a crosstalk cancellation network and a combined multipoint equalization structure. The former is required in order to have a spatialized audio and it is based on the free-field relationship in order to not introduce a timbre alteration. The latter is used to improve the objective and subjective quality of sound reproduction systems by compensating the room and loudspeakers transfer function. Both steps are based on a-priori analysis of the real environment using real impulse responses measured in different positions. In particular, an offline procedure capable of determining the tuning parameters for the crosstalk network and of deriving the final filters for the equalization structure, is adopted. Several results are presented in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms considering objective and subjective evaluations and comparing the presented approach with the state of the art.

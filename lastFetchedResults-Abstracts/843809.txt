In this paper, some sufficient conditions are obtained for checking the existence and exponential stability of almost periodic solution for bidirectional associative memory Hopfield-type neural networks with impulse. The approaches are based on contraction principle and Gronwall–Bellman’s inequality. This paper is considering the almost periodic solution for impulsive Hopfield-type neural networks.

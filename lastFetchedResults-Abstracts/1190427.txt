Nodes of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are typically powered by batteries with a limited capacity. Thus, energy is a primary constraint in the design and deployment of WSNs. Since radio communication is in general the main cause of power consumption, the different techniques proposed in the literature to improve energy efficiency have mainly focused on limiting transmission/reception of data, for instance, by adopting data compression and/or aggregation. The limited resources available in a sensor node demand, however, the development of specifically designed algorithms. To this aim, we propose an approach to perform lossy compression on single node based on a differential pulse code modulation scheme with quantization of the differences between consecutive samples. Since different combinations of the quantization process parameters determine different trade-offs between compression performance and information loss, we exploit a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to generate a set of combinations of these parameters corresponding to different optimal trade-offs. The user can therefore choose the combination with the most suitable trade-off for the specific application. We tested our lossy compression approach on three datasets collected by real WSNs. We show that our approach can achieve significant compression ratios despite negligible reconstruction errors. Further, we discuss how our approach outperforms LTC, a lossy compression algorithm purposely designed to be embedded in sensor nodes, in terms of compression rate and complexity.

Context: Abuse during pregnancy is common and has adverse health effects on maternal and infant health. To prevent abuse to pregnant women, predictors must be identified and incorporated into routine screening and intervention protocols.
Objective: To investigate whether or not symbolic violence and threats of violence by a male intimate were associated with physical violence against pregnant Hispanic women.
Design: Cross-sectional interview survey questionnaire.
Setting: Urban, public health prenatal clinics.
Participants: 329 pregnant, physically abused Hispanic women.
Main Outcome Measure: Physical abuse against pregnant Hispanic women as measured on the Severity of Violence Against Women Scale.
Results: Regression analysis showed that symbolic violence and threats of violence by the perpetrator were jointly and independently significantly (P < .0005) associated with physical violence.
Conclusions: Because symbolic violence is significantly associated with physical violence against pregnant women, screening and early intervention programs should focus on such behavior.

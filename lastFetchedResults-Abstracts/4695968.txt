This paper investigates the use of fuzzy logic to implement some nonlinear control laws in bidirectional power converters. The authors design a minimum time control scheme of a buck power converter by means of fuzzy logic approximation. The proposed controller is implemented by means of an analog hardware architecture which is able to efficiently implement neuro-fuzzy models. By combining the main features of digital and analog alternatives, it is possible to provide a high degree of flexibility (in terms of number of inputs, number of membership functions per input and number of fuzzy rules) when handling real world tasks. Also, the authors have created a program for validating, via software, the proposed architecture. Computer simulation results for a buck power converter structure illustrate the design and the implementation. VLSI ASIC mixed-mode implementation details are also included

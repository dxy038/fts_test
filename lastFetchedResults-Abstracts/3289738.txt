The QoS (Quality of Service) multicast routing satisfying the multi-constraints is one of the key technologies for transmission of the new-generation network information. Because the basic ant colony algorithm is slow and prone to congestion when solving the multi-constrained QoS routing, we propose MMR-ACO(Multi-Objective Multicast Routing based on Ant Colony Optimization), which speeds up the convergence rate of the search by adjusting pheromone dynamically, avoids congestion by the related load factors such as joining and delay, delay jitter, packet loss rate etc and satisfies the requirements of multiple QoS constraints by the successive updates of pheromone according to the constrains such as delay and delay jitter. The simulation results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper is superior to basic ant colony algorithm in the speed of the multi-constrained QoS routing and avoidance of congestion.

This research is investigated on the multi-objective performance optimization of a parallel robotic machine tool which is expected to be applied as a next generation of computer numerical control (CNC) machine. The system configuration and the kinematic model are detailed introduced. The performance maps including dexterity and workspace are generated and illustrated. The multi-objective optimal performance indices are investigated based on the integration of the evolutionary algorithm and Pareto frontier sets. The developed technologies and approaches are generic and also feasible for the design, modeling and improvement of other parallel kinematic machines.

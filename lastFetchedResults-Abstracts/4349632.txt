The scope of realization of the analysis of interaction of the antenna and target in problems of processing of microwave radar images with use of plane wave decomposition has been considered. The problem of parameter determination of target in the form of a metal strip was considered. For its decision the method of quasisolution searching was used. The compromise approach simultaneously considering finiteness of the aperture sizes and at it quickly computing model radar image has been considered. Influence of finiteness of the aperture sizes and target on reflection coefficient is analyzed. Approach of overcoming of a problem of multiextremal of objective function is demonstrated. Accuracy properties of the method are analyzed.

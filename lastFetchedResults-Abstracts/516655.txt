The genus Ballota (Lamiaceae) is comprised of about 90 species all over the
world. Remarkably, three species of this genus are growing in Iran, that is used in traditional
medicine [1].
Objective: Investigation on the essential oil composition of Ballota nigra ssp. anatolica.
Methods: The aerial parts of B. nigra ssp. anatolica were collected during the flowering
stage from Shahnajar village, Kojur, Mazandaran Province, in July 2007. Hydrodistillation
was performed using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 hours to yield 0.7% (w/w) of yellowish
oil. Essential oil was analyzed with GC and GC/MS techniques. The constituents of the
essential oil were identified by comparison of their mass spectra and retention indices (RI)
with those given in the literature and authentic samples.
Results: Twelve components were determined in the essential oil of B. nigra spp. anatolica,
representing 91.8% of the oil.
Conclusion: Germacrene D 18.1%), Nerolidol epoxyacetate (15.4%), Sclareoloxide
(12.1%), Linalyl acetate (11.5%), Î² - Caryophyllene (10.5%), were found to be the major
constituents.
The oil of B. nigra spp. anatolica consists of oxygenated monoterpens (18.1%) and
sesquiterpens (73.7%).

Greece is one of the major small ruminantsâ€™ milk production countries, in terms of annual
per habitant production. The most part of this milk is used for the manufacture of a variety
of cheeses, with brined cheeses like Feta maintaining the first place. Brined cheeses is the
group of cheese varieties ripened and preserved in brine for a considerable amount of time,
i.e. until consumption, whereas White brined cheeses are brined cheeses made from curds
that are not subjected to any heat treatment. The objective of this review paper is to present
briefly the cheese making technology and the most recent publications about the ripening
characteristics of the brined cheeses produced in Greece from the milk of small ruminants.

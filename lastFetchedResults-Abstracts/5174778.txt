This paper presents a new algorithm that allows us to generate 3D geometry from a single monocular image through the optimisation of an objective function. Weighted smoothness constraint is designed and added to the objective function to provide adequate smooth restraints in accordance with local image gradients. By using wavelet, the objective function is minimised to recover geometry from the input image. Results and comparisons with those from existing methods are provided in the paper. These results demonstrate the better performance of the proposed method over the existing methods.

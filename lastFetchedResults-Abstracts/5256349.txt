Bangladesh is a developing country with large population. Only 32% of the total population has access to grid electricity. It is extremely difficult to extend high-tension transmission lines to these areas as some of the places are separated from the mainland and from each other by wide rivers, creeks and hills. Renewable energy is considered to be the right choice for providing clean energy to these remote settlements. Village-level mini grids based on biomass gasifier, solar photovoltaic, and wind-diesel hybrid can be used for supplying electricity to domestic and commercial applications. The objective of this paper is to design and analyze a mini solar grid system consisting of PV panels, charge controller, battery and inverter to serve a remote locality. A mini solar grid of 10 kW capacity has been designed [1]. The design was verified by RETScreen software, technical and financial data were compared with an existing solar grid in Barkal, Rangamati Hill district.

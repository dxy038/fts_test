The error rate performance of a binary differentially encoded phase-shift keying (DPSK) system in the presence of both thermal noise and multiple co-channel interferers is theoretically analyzed in the fast Rayleigh fading environment encountered in the typical UHF or microwave land mobile radio channels. The main objective is to show the additional degradation of an error rate of a binary DPSK system when undesired multiple co-channel M-ary DPSK interferers are virtually generated in a practical land mobile radio channel. The error probabilities are presented by a simple closed form as a function of noise correlation, interferer correlation, the number of interferers, M-ary modulating phase of interferer, Doppler frequency, carrier-to-noise (CNR) and carrier-to-interference (CIR) average power ratios.

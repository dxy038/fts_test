The primary goal of this research and development project is to develop a pick and place robot for material handling systems. Possessing two degrees of freedom, this semi-automatic pick and place robot integrates object detection with the pick and place process whereby the detection of an object would power the object gripper; kick starting the pick and place process. With the objective of creating a user friendly and affordable system, the developed model high significantly demonstrates the use of technology in material handling systems.

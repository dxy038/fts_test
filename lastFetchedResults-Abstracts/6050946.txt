Cognitive radio networks (CRN) have been proposed to solve such problem of low utilization in wireless spectrum. In this paper, we propose a novel cross layer scheduling strategy with interference management for multiple cognitive users, which working are working at the same area with a primary user. The design objective for this scheme is to decrease the average interference to the primary user with efficient bandwidth utilization and without significantly dropping the QoS. The proposed scheduler uses a general priority function (PRF) to address these conflicting objectives. An extensive set of simulation results show that the scheme results in significant performance improvement compared with the existing algorithms.

Background: Pistacia sp. has been used in folk medicine for many years and previous studies have demonstrated its hypnotic effects.
Objective: In this research, the effects of P. vera gum hydroalcoholic extract on muscle relaxation, sleep and anxiety were studied in mice.
Methods: The effects of the intraperitoneal injection of the extract on muscle relaxation and coordination (traction and Rotarod tests, 30 and 60 min. after injection, respectively), sleep latency and duration of the sleep induced by pentobarbital (injected 30 min. after the extract), anti-anxiety effects (Elevated plus maze, 30 min. after injection) and locomotion activity (Open field test, 60 min. after injection) were studied.
Results: The extract (doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 g/kg) showed hypnotic effect, increase in duration of sleep by all doses and decrease in the sleep latency only by the dose of 1 g/kg), anti-anxiety effect in elevated plus maze, muscle relaxant effect (only effective at the dose of 1 g/kg in the traction test) and locomotion depressant effect at all doses (P<0.001).
Conclusion: This study showed that the hydroalcoholic extract of P. vera gum has hypnotic, anti-anxiety and muscle relaxant activities. Thus, it may be effective in the alleviation of the muscles contractions disorders, insomnia and anxiety.

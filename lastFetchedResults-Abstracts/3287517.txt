The objective of this paper is to develop a method of walking pattern generation with non-constant body height towards quasi natural walking. Unlike the traditional LIPM or GCIPM based method, our proposed method divides the walking cycle into 3 parts, including lowering down, rising up and inverted pendulum process, all described by specific trajectory equations. After modelling the dynamics of the biped walking robot with three mass points and properly designing ZMP reference, smooth spatial hip trajectory with non-constant height is obtained, as well as joint trajectories solved by inverse kinematics. The stability of biped walking pattern is verified through simulation and actual walking experiments on a biped robot developed in our lab.

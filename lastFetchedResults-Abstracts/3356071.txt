This paper presents the ongoing work for developing a Ka- and Q-band satellite beacon receiving station at the University of Vigo. The ground station has been developed in order to join the Alphasat Aldo Paraboni propagation experiment. This new European measurement campaign will be possible thanks to the Alphasat Aldo Paraboni payload, which has been supported by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) as contribution to the Alphasat project that is executed by the European Space Agency (ESA) in the framework of the ARTES 8 Telecom programme. The objective of this campaign is the simultaneous acquisition of Ka- and Q-band propagation measurements in several receiving stations in Europe. This contribution describes the Vigo ground station for the Alphasat Aldo Paraboni propagation experiment, analyzes its specifications and presents the first measurements and results.

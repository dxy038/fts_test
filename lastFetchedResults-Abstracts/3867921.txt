As wireless systems evolve toward supporting a wide array of services, including traditional voice service, using packet-switched transport, it becomes increasingly important to assess the impact of packet-switched transport protocols on voice quality, in this article we present a tutorial on voice quality evaluation for wireless packet-switched systems. We introduce an evaluation methodology that combines elementary objective voice quality metrics with a frame synchronization mechanism. The methodology allows networking researchers to conduct effective and accurate quality evaluation of packet voice. To illustrate the use of the described evaluation methodology and interpretation of the results, we conduct a case study of the impact of robust header compression (ROHC) on the voice quality achieved with real-time transmission of GSM encoded voice over a wireless link.

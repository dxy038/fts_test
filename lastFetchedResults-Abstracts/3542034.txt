This paper presents a new circuit scheme called a transient sensitive accelerator (TSA) circuit for highly resistive interconnects. The TSA can reduce both delay time and crosstalk voltage. Using the TSA with an interconnect length of 30 mm reduces delay time and crosstalk voltage by 29% and 20%, respectively. A further advantage is that the TSA operates in self-time and thus can be applied to bidirectional signal communication

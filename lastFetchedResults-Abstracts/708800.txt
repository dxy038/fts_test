Background and Objective: Diabetes mellitus accompanies enhanced oxidative stress and decreased activity of antioxidant defense system. Due to the significant role of enhanced oxidative stress in development of renal damage and nephropathy in diabetes and with regard to antidiabetic and antioxidant effect of apigenin, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of this flavonoid on the level of some oxidative stress-associated factors in kidney tissue of diabetic rats.

Materials and Methods: Male rats were divided into 4 groups, i.e. control, apigenin-treated control, diabetic, and apigenin-treated diabetic groups. Apigenin was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg for three weeks starting seven days after diabetes induction using streptozotocin. Tissue level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite and nitrate and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in kidney tissue were measured at the end of the study. 

Results: Diabetic rats had a significant increase in tissue level of malondialdehyde (p < 0.01) and nitrite (p < 0.05) and a lower level of SOD activity (p < 0.01) as compared to control group and treatment of diabetic rats with apigenin did not significantly reduce MDA and nitrite level and also did not significantly enhance SOD activity in diabetic group.

Conclusion: Chronic apigenin treatment could not significantly change some measured markers of oxidative stress in renal tissue in this study from diabetic rats and its antioxidant effect is not potent enough to prevent renal damage in streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes.

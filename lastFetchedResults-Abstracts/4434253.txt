In this paper, an electric motor controller for motorbike racing application is presented. Both the bidirectional DC/DC power converter and its logic control system are designed, and then modeled and simulated in Matlab Simulink environment, along with the whole motorbike power train and mechanical load. In particular, a novel motor thermal control logic has been conceived and developed, to dynamically and automatically fit the power delivered to the motor depending on its actual temperature, according to preset motor maps: like this, motor overheating and burnout risk during the race are avoided, meanwhile the best achievable performance is not prevented. The controller design was conducted to suit the characteristics and the needs of the electric racing motorcycle eCRP 1.4, produced by CRP Technology, which takes part in TTXGP Championship.

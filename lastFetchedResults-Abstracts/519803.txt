This paper presents a proposal for transmitting images using Multiple Description Coding (MDC) techniques over multiple links in a mesh network, while using network coding technique to add protection paths. In pure MDC, the losses of one or two of the multiple descriptions degrade the received image quality. In the proposed technique, the protection paths ensure that all the descriptions are received even when one or two descriptions are lost, but at the expense of additional links and data bandwidth. A comparative evaluation based on simulation and objective quality metrics is presented.

An adaptive Recursive algorithm based on a simple two sensor system for accurate estimation of the incident angle of a radar reflecting object or alternatively an active emitter is proposed. The overall objective is to find a low complexity method, which provides high resolution estimates and which is capable of adapting to a time varying scenario. Time delay estimation is followed by calculation of the actual incident angle. The considered simple system, comprised of two sensors only, is less complex and requires less computational power than does an array based receiver with possibly several antenna elements. An adaptive Lagrange interpolator is incorporated in order to obtain time delay estimates with a high resolution, in fractions of a sample. The possible performance of the proposed scheme is compared to time-varying lower CRBÂ´s, which are also derived here.

For multiple antenna multiuser channels, the perfect channel state information (CSI) at the base station is assumed to achieve the sum rate advantage provided by the multiple antennas. The objective of this paper is to find the effect of channel mismatch at the base station in the joint optimization of linear prefilter and non-linear vector perturbation for the MIMO multiuser precoder.

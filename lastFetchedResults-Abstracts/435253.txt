Background
Pediatric diminutive right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction with homografts or porcine xenografts remains challenging because of limited availability, early degeneration, tissue ingrowth, and child growth. The objective of this study was to assess whether Contegra valved bovine conduit, implanted as monocuspid transannular patch, might be an interesting alternative to overcome these problems.
Methods
We reconstructed the RVOT of 12 patients with tetralogy of Fallot, by the use of a Contegra conduit, tailored as a monocuspid valved transannular patch. The patients were 4 females and 8 males, with a mean age of 12.8 ± 15.1 months and a mean weight of 7.2 ± 1.9 kg. The mean pulmonary artery annulus size was 8.2 ± 1.6 mm.
Results
The Contegra tissue was suitable for suturing and for reconstruction of even severely hypoplasic RVOT . We did not observe any sign of conduit or valve degeneration during the follow-up of 28.1 ± 17.1 months. There were no early or late deaths, and no device-related adverse events. A peak transvalvular gradient of 36.5 ± 4.7 mm Hg was measured by echocardiography in 4 patients postoperatively, and it decreased during the follow-up to 20 ± 7.6 mm Hg. Pulmonary valve incompetence was grade 3 in 2 patients and grade 4 in 2 patients.
Conclusions
The Contegra monocuspid transannular patch is widely applicable to RVOT reconstruction with satisfactory midterm results, particularly in patients with small pulmonary annulus. Its main advantage is to reduce the potential risk of supravalvular stenosis due to the narrowing at the distal suture line, as demonstrated when used as conduits, especially in the smaller sizes.

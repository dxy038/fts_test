The immune system does not response in equal probability to every epitope of an invader. We investigate the immune systemâ€™s decision making process using optimal control principles. Mathematically, this formulation requires the solution of a two-point boundary-value problem, which is a challenging task especially when the control variables are bounded. In this work, we develop a computational approach based on the shooting technique for bounded optimal control problems. We then utilize the computational approach to carry out extensive numerical studies on a simple immune response model of two competing controls. Numerical solutions demonstrate that the results of optimal control depend on the objective function, the limitations on control inputs, as well as the amounts of peptides. Moreover, the state space of peptides can be divided into different regions according the properties of the solutions. The developed algorithm not only provides a useful tool for understanding decision making strategies of the immune system but can also be utilized to solve other complex optimal control problems.

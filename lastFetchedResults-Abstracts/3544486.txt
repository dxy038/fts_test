This paper is the result of editorial license in the effect that it is designed to augment the invited papers for enhancement and restoration in this issue. Unfortunately this editor found the genesis of a special issue to be a very dynamic process, and as such this paper has experienced many contortions. However, it is hoped that a few topics not covered earlier, but which warrant some discussion in a digital image enhancement issue, can find a home (albeit brief and uneasy) in this editorial. The topics discussed below include some heuristic techniques which might be useful to the image enhancement objective, some superresolution and positive restoration techniques (still of esoteric interest), some comments on experimental methods, and a bibliography restricted to digital techniques for image restoration and/or enhancement.

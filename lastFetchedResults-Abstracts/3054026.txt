A growing concern of video researchers and broadcasters is the assurance and maintenance of an acceptable service quality level for the distribution of video signal. Subjective tests are the most reliable but they are too time-consuming for wide application. To overcome this problem many objective quality metrics have been proposed. In this paper we review some of the main proposed schemes and standards. Also we provide the potentials of new techniques for online visual quality evaluation systems.

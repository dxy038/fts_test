A Novel bidirectional three phase Boost DC/DC converter is proposed in this paper. The circuit topology is similar to a traditional three phase AC PWM rectifier, but the inputs are alternated by DC power sources, such as DC bus or batteries. The purposed converter can be used as front-end stage for high power applications. Also, it can be applied for dual input-voltage power supplies, such as a wind/photovoltaic energy hybrid system, where DC bus and AC bus are coexisted. Because the topology of the converter is derived from three phase AC devices, it has a natural capability to deal with this problem well. Simplified Three-Dimensional Space Vector Modulation (3D-SVM) strategy is employed to deal with unbalanced three phase sources or unbalanced three phase sources. The analysis has been verified by experimental results.

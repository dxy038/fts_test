In this paper, both the reactive power which delivered back to the source and from the load in the isolated bidirectional dual-active-bridge (DAB) dc-dc converter using the conventional phase-shift (CPS) control strategy are analyzed with mathematical expressions. An extended dual-phase-shift (EDPS) control is proposed and the reactive power losses are defined with regard to different operating cases. The experimental results reveal that the EDPS can effectively enhance the overall efficiency especially with the proposed method of reactive power losses minimization.

For the prevalent research in wireless sensor networks, the main objective is to maximize the lifetime of a sensor network subject to the battery-energy at the sensor nodes. Various heuristic approaches have been proposed to achieve this objective and many simulation results have been presented in the existing literature. However, hardly exists any analytic framework to govern this network lifetime issue. In this paper, we analytically determine the lifetime of a sensor network under different data reporting schemes. Those schemes include direct data reporting by each node to the sink or the base station, cluster-data reporting based on the hexagonal clustering with arbitrary cluster-heads, and cluster-data reporting based on the hexagonal clustering with centroid cluster-heads.We will evaluate the lifetimes of the sensor network under these different reporting methods analytically or via simulations. Moreover, the effects of both path-loss exponent and compression-ratio on the network performances subject to these aforementioned schemes will also be investigated.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between cytokine genotypes and preeclampsia.
Study design
We conducted a case-control study that examined cytokine genotypes among 150 primiparous preeclamptic women and 661 primiparous, normotensive women. Analyses were adjusted for age, prepregnancy cigarette smoking, and education.
Results
Preeclamptic white women were more likely than normotensive white women to carry the up-regulating tumor necrosis factor–α–308 A/A (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.1-15.3) genotype. Both black and white women with preeclampsia were more likely than normotensive control subjects to carry the interleukin-1α–producing–4845 G/G genotype (black odds ratio, 11.6; 95% CI, 1.5-89.3; white odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.7-3.9), –889 C/C genotype (black odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 0.6-41.6; white odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 0.8-4.7), and the interleukin-1α–4845/interleukin-1α–889/interleukin-1β–3957 GCC/GCC haplotype (black odds ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3-8.7; white odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4-3.2).
Conclusion
Cytokine genotypes were associated with preeclampsia and may identify women who are at high risk for preeclampsia.

The objective of this paper is to find out the peak age of person getting anger in Chennai, for that we study the dimensions of personality of person. Personality has been classified in to five factors as Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Negative Emotion. Each of these dimensions has six facets. For the first time in 1998 fuzzy matrix theory was developed by W.B. Vasantha and V. Indira to study the passenger transportation. To study this problem, they divided and defined four types of matrices are called Initial Raw Data Matrix, Average Time Dependent Data matrix (ATD Matrix), Refined Time Dependent Data matrix (RTD Matrix) and Combined Effect Time Dependent Data Matrix (CETD Matrix). In the year 2003 the same technique was used by W.B. Vasantha to study the migrant laborers who were affected by HIV/AIDS. In 2012 and 2013, A. Victor Devadoss, M. Clement Joe Anand and A.

Based on reviews on existing knowledge integration researches, the paper introduces a WSR system methodology along with a three dimensional analysis framework comprising three elements in knowledge integration: the Wuli, Shili and Renli. The objective factors and the behavior-based human factors in the process of knowledge integration are discussed from multiple perspectives of Wuli, Shili and Renli. The paper provides a theoretical foundation and guiding principle for promoting effective knowledge management.

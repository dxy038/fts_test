In this paper, we use AHP/DEA model to analyze the efficiency of investment in the Water Infrastructure of the World Bank. Through the input and output index, we select the relative importance of index as a basis for AHP/DEA model, and according to the result of calculations with AHP/DEA model, we evaluate the efficiency of the second loan project of the inland water in the World Bank. With the help of AHP/DEA model, we find the efficiency of the loan projects in the World Bank; can be more objective to be evaluated.

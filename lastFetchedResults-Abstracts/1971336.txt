Buffering agents are added to many diverse foods to control the pH of the system. Limited data exist on the effects these buffers have on the Maillard reaction. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of buffer type and concentration on the Maillard reaction. The loss of glycine and the formation of brown pigment were evaluated in phosphate and citrate buffer solutions of various concentrations at pH 7 and 25 Â°C. No glycine loss nor brown pigment formation was observed in the citrate buffer solutions. However, citrate did not appear to be functioning as an inhibitor of the reaction. The rates of glycine loss and browning increased with increasing phosphate buffer concentration. The bifunctional catalytic ability of the phosphate anion was proposed as an explanation for the differing effects of the buffers.

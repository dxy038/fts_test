Based on the introduction of particle swarm optimization algorithm, this paper applies it to the land use structure optimization. The objective functions, variables and restraint functions are constructed for land use structure optimization. The corresponding software is also developed. And land use structure optimization for HeChuan District of ChongQing City is taken as the example for the case study. The satisfactory optimization result proves that application of the particle swarm optimization algorithm for land use structure is feasible and effective, which supplies a new idea and method.

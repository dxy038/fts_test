A series of tryptamine derivatives with modified sulfonamide were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their ability to stimulate cAMP accumulation in CHO cells expressing the cloned human β3-adrenergic receptor (AR). For this series of compounds, our objective was to symmetrize the α-position of the tryptamine moiety maintaining its activity and reducing the cost of production. Compound 11h, having m-aminobenzene, exhibited excellent agonistic activity for β3-AR with excellent subtype selectivity.

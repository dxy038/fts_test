Objective: This project was designed to follow-up prior evidence that demonstrated a significant
association between vitamin B12 transport and metabolism and the frailty syndrome in community-dwelling older
women. The cross-sectional relationship between genetic variants within six candidate genes along this pathway
with serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels and frailty was evaluated in this same population of older women.
Methods: Baseline measures were collected prior to folate fortification from 326 women in the Womenâ€™s Health
and Aging Studies I and II. Odds ratios and statistical tests were estimated for single SNP and haplotype via
linear regression models for serum MMA, a marker for available vitamin B12, and in logistic regression models
for frailty. Results: Fifty-six SNPs from CBS, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, TCN1 and TCN2 genes were genotyped.
Several SNPs in MTHFR, MTR and MTRR demonstrated a modest association to elevated MMA, while SNPs in
TCN2 showed significant association to the frailty syndrome. TCN2 polymorphisms, particularly one SNP
reported to be in perfect LD with functional variant Pro259Arg, were significantly associated with increased odds
of frailty, after adjustment for age, presence of cardiovascular disease and elevated MMA (OR = 2.25, p-value =
0.009). Conclusions: Using MMA as a marker for vitamin B12, these results suggest that TCN2 gene variants
may lead to decreased vitamin B12 availability, leading to reduced energy metabolism, ultimately contributing to
frailty pathology. Further studies to determine the biological role of functional TCN2 polymorphisms in frailty
are needed.

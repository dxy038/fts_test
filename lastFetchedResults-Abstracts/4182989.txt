A new hierarchical partitioning placement algorithm is presented. The objective function is formulated as a weighted sum of the total wire length and the maximum circuit delay. Special balancing rules are used to assure a good balance between the numbers of components in the regions. Total wire length and maximum circuit delay are estimated and updated efficiently at each step of the partitioning process. Experimental results are very encouraging

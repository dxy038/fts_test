In this study the genotoxic effects induced by a treatment with different doses of sodium selenite in Vicia faba seedlings were evaluated with or without the addition of carboxymethylcellulose. A further objective of this study was to verify whether the adduct selenite-carboxymethylcellulose was also able to reduce the genotoxic damages induced by the herbicide maleic hydrazide, a strong mutagenic agent in plants, at a higher extent than selenite alone. The results obtained showed a genotoxic activity of sodium selenite at concentrations up to 8.6 mg L−1. In the treatments with selenite–carboxymethylcellulose, the genotoxicity induced by the complex was significantly lower in comparison to how much was observed in the treatment with selenite only. When sodium selenite's protective activity against the genotoxic effects induced by the herbicide maleic hydrazide was tested, a reduction of mutagenic damages was observed at the highest application doses of selenite (from 86 mg L−1). The treatments with selenite–carboxymethyl cellulose resulted in a further increase of selenium protective activity, which was observable for all doses used. These findings suggest a possible role played by carboxymethylcellulose in the regulation of the genotoxic activity of selenium

POSM (pseudo-objective function substitution method), is an unconstrained optimization algorithm. This algorithm, requiring neither derivative calculation nor linear search step, substitutes the objective function by a second-order approximated formulation, enhancing the convergence rate substantially and implemented in the general-purpose Analysis and Design Program for Integrated Circuits, (ADIC-2.C). To show the effectiveness and efficiency of this algorithm, it was evaluated using a number of numerical examples and some practical IC designs

Everyday, Smart Cities are closer to becoming ubiquitous around the world; current deployments include not only city wide parking systems but also energy-aware lightning and smart grid applications. This exponentially growing field is backed with several standards for communication and interaction, from the physical to the application level, such as RFC5548 on routing requirements for LLNs, and the RPL routing protocol, as defined by RFC6550. One of the critical design elements for routing in LLNs today is power consumption: both the network lifespan and the sensing coverage depend on this factor. In this paper, we analyse in detail latency, energy consumption and packet loss performance under a set Objective Functions on a connected scenario, using combined metrics in order to evaluate the best energy-aware option, a combination of HC (Hop Count) and ENG (Remaining Energy) under several restrictions.

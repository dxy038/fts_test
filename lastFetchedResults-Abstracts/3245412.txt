Bangladesh is a developing country which has been suffering from severe electricity crisis due to shortage of efficient technical plan, less trained personnel, mismanagement of distribution system &amp; poor infrastructure . The objective of this paper is to develop a logistic type numerical optimum model of hybrid grid, taking into consideration of renewable and conventional fossil resources of Bangladesh.The Hybrid Optimization Model of Renewable Energy (HOMER) simulation software was used to conduct a cost benefit analysis for the proposed model . Simulation model was used to find out the best technically feasible renewable energy system, which is cost effective for various households in a city area . The impact on the environment due to conventional fossil fuel generation was analyzed for the proposed model. Sensitivity analysis was carried out with diesel price and wind speed to get optimum result for the proposed hybrid grid system. Implementation of this model in Bangladesh can show a potential way to produce electricity at less cost to mitigate the huge demand of the customer.

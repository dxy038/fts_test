The objective of this work is to develop a new tuning strategy for multivariable extended predictive control (EPC). A natural concern is the problem of ill conditionality in controlling multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. The main advantage of EPC is that it has a simple and effective tuning strategy that results in a well-conditioned system which can achieve tight closed-loop response. Moreover, unlike most existing model predictive control tuning strategies, the proposed strategy establishes a direct relationship between one main tuning parameter for each subprocess of the MIMO system. This tuning method has been derived based on the assumption of an infinite control horizon resulting in powerful stability for the nominal case and in the presence of model uncertainty. This tuning method is applicable to unconstrained multivariable processes, and was proven to have good control on nonsquare systems. The main features of the new tuning strategy are practically illustrated on a MIMO temperature system with improved control performance as compared to move suppressed predictive control.

Objective: The phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus has high linkage disequilibrium. Haplotypes
related to this locus may thus be considered sufficiently informative for genetic diagnosis
and carrier screening using multi-allelic markers. In this study, we present an efficient
method for haplotype analysis of PAH locus using multiplexing dyes. In addition, we explain
how to resolve the dye shift challenge in multiplex short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping.
Materials and Methods: One hundred family trios were included in this descriptive
study. The forward primer of a tetra-nucleotide STR and the reverse primer of a variable
number tandem repeat (VNTR) were labeled with three different non-overlapping dyes
5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), 6-carboxy-N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylrhodamine (HEX) and 6-carboxy-
N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
products from each family trio were multiplexed for capillary electrophoresis and results
were analyzed using Peak Scanner software.
Results: Multiplexing trio products decreased the cost significantly. The TAMRA labeled products
had a significant predictable shift (migrated at a slower electrophoretic rate) relative to the
HEX and FAM labeled products. Through our methodology we achieve, the less inter-dye shift
than intra-dye shift variance. Correcting the dye shift in the labeled products, according to the
reference allele size, significantly decreased the inter-dye variability (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Multiplexing trio products helps to detect and resolve the dye shift accurately
in each family, which otherwise would result in diagnostic error. The dye system of FAM,
HEX and TAMRA is more feasible and cheaper than other dye systems.

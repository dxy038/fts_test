RAMP has been demonstrated to be a potentially valuable molecular marker for the study of genetic relationships in cultivated plant species. The objective of this study was to optimize the application of RAMP markers for the molecular characterization of a F<sub>1</sub> almond progeny from the cross between ‘Tuono’ and ‘Shahrood-12’ cultivar. In this first study, genomic DNA was extracted from young leaf tissues and PCR reactions were done using two nuclear SSR markers (assaying forward and reverse primers) and two selected RAPD primers. In addition, to check the transferability of these RAMP markers across <em>Prunus </em>genus, a F<sub>1</sub> apricot progeny from the cross between the North American cultivar ‘Goldrich’ and the Spanish ‘Currot’ was assayed. Results showed the dominant nature of these markers with a great abundance and transferability although with a reduced polymorphism.</div><div id="__hggasdgjhsagd_once" style="display: none;"> </div>

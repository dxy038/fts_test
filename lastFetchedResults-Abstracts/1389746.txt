Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is common in dogs and can lead to serious disorders. Current treatments can relieve clinical signs of disease, but do not restore IVD function. The development of regenerative strategies for IVD dysfunction requires detailed knowledge of the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration and its underlying mechanisms. Histological examination of IVDs at different stages of degeneration might provide this knowledge, but as there is currently no histological grading scheme for canine IVD degeneration, the aim of this study, which is the first of a two-part series, was to design and validate an appropriate scheme.

independent observers evaluated 35 IVDs at different stages of degeneration using the scheme. Glycosaminoglycan contents of the nucleus pulposus and macroscopic grading according to Thompson, which are considered ‘gold standards’ for IVD degeneration, were used to validate the scheme. Reproducibility was assessed by analysing the inter-observer reliability of all individual variables of the grading scheme, using a weighted κ analysis. Significant correlations were found between Thompson grading and total histological score (r = 0.94; P &lt; 0.01) and between glycosaminoglycan content and total histological score (r = −0.72; P &lt; 0.01). Most individual histological variables showed ‘moderate’ to ‘almost perfect’ inter-observer reliability. The high correlation with the gold standards in combination with the high reproducibility indicates that the proposed histological grading scheme is reliable and objective for classification of IVD degeneration in both chondrodystrophic and non-chondrodystrophic dog breeds.

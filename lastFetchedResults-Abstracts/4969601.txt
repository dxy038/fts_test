The design of network to collect the products is a very important problem in reverse logistics. Most models in research are single objective models which only minimize the cost of designing the network. However, there usually involves multiple and conflicting objectives in the problem such as cost and service level. This paper proposes a bi-objective integer programming which optimize the cost and service level simultaneously to design the reverse logistics network. To solve the model, we design an evolutionary algorithm which can find the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Furthermore, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is presented on the Pareto-optimal set.

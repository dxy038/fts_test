The main objective of this study is to run a complete structural reliability analysis of an existing villa, located in Lebanon. The structural components, such as slabs, beams, columns, and footings, are first analyzed independently, and the reliability index for each failure mode, is being evaluated at the component level. The structural failure modes are grouped into two categories: the ultimate limit state failure modes, such as moment, shear, and axial bending; and the serviceability limit state failure modes, such as deflection. The structureÂ´s components along with their related failure modes are then laid in parallel and series configuration in order to evaluate the reliability of the system. This evaluation helps in depicting the critical components that might render the structure unsafe or susceptible to collapse. This approach will eventually help in improving the safety of an existing structure, by laying out the true structural topology of the structure which reveals the true exiting structural health of the villa. Finally, observations are made on the importance of a good reliable foundation to ensure a safe structure

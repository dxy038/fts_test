Objective: To observe the relationship between the expression of PETA-3 and clinicopathological factors in breast cancer. Methods: 40 breast cancer samples were detected by the real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining to analyze the expression of PETA-3. The relationship between the expression of and clinicopathological factors was analyzed. Results: Compared to that in the adjacent tissues, the expression of PETA-3mRNA was markedly increased in breast cancer tissues. PETA-3 expression was significantly higher in metastatic breast cancer than in non-metastatic tumors. Furthermore PETA-3 expression levels of breast cancer were correlated with estrogen receptor status. Conclusions: Increased expression of PETA-3 suggests its involvement in the pathogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer.

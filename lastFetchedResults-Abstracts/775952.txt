Electricity production using solar thermal energy is one of the main research areas at present in the field of renewable
energies, these systems being characterised by the need of reliable control systems aimed at maintaining desired operating
conditions in the face of changes in solar radiation, which is the main source of energy. A new prototype of solar system
with parabolic trough collectors was implemented at the Plataforma Solar de Almerı´a (PSA, South-East Spain) to investigate
the direct steam generation process under real solar conditions in the parabolic solar collector field of a thermal
power plant prototype. This paper presents details and some results of the application of a control scheme designed
and tested for the recirculation operation mode, for which the main objective is to obtain steam at constant temperature
and pressure at the outlet of the solar field, so that changes produced in the inlet water conditions and/or solar radiation
will only affect the amount of steam produced by the solar field. The steam quality and consequently the nominal efficiency
of the plant are thus maintained.

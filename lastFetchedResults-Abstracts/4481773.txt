This paper explains the whole process of a system design for the remote control of a stepper motor via web server. For this purpose a hardware structure is fully designed and implemented. Two types of communications were used to operate with the stepper motor. The first is realized by serial RS-232 protocol and the second one uses TCP/IP protocol for remote control. The TCP/IP protocol provides communication between server and client computers. The proposed control system is connected to the server. The main objective of this paper was to obtain a precise control of velocity or number of steps of the stepper motor. Validity and effectiveness of the used algorithm were verified through both simulations and experiments.

Demonstration is a joint project of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the Association of Maximum Service Telecasters (MST). It was initiated two years ago with the overall objective of assuring that terrestrial broadcasters would remain technically competitive with other video media. Specifically, this meant informing the industry of the progress of HDTV development and making the Federal Communications Commission aware of broadcaster needs for the delivery of HDTV. The first phase of this project concluded earlier this year with the successful operation of a high definition television (HDTV) broadcast station WWHD-TV in Washington, DC.

 Our objective is to study the vocal and laryngeal effect as well as the negative signs and sensations related to the voiced tongue vibration technique (VTVT), regarding the time of performance (from 0 to 7 minutes). Thirty adults (15 men and 15 women) with no vocal complaints nor laryngeal disorders were involved. All subjects underwent laryngostroboscopic and auditory perceptual analysis and answered about the existence of uncomfortable sensations that occurred during the exercise (1, 3, 5, and 7 minutes) and postexercise. For the auditory perceptual analysis, the female group presented better outcomes in the third minute of exercise, whereas in general the male group showed no modification because of performance time. Some men presented a significant change in the parameters involved from the fifth minute on. Men and women showed a gradual increase of undesirable sensations. It is extremely important that the performance time of the VTVT is properly prescribed to provide the expected results, without causing undue injuries to the vocal system. Therefore, we suggest this technique should be recommended for 3 and 5 minutes for women and men, respectively.

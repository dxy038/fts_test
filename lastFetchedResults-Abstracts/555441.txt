Establishing appropriate relationship between theory and research is an important factor in development of scientific disciplines and production of knowledge in different disciplines including social science and in particular, International Relations. The PhD dissertations, where the main objective is to reach to appropriate scientific outcomes, constitute one arena of producing knowledge in all countries. Therefore, existence of an appropriate relation between theoretical frameworks and empirical studies of PhD dissertations is considered as one of the conditions of success in knowledge production. The reason for this research, as a probing and describing research, is to attain a general picture of the state of relationship between theory and research in international relations PhD dissertations in three major Iranian state universities which have PhD program in this discipline. Our research findings show serious difficulties in understanding and practical establishment of relationship between theory and research. These findings show also that research is not directly relied on propositions and hypothesis of theories, not any attempt has been made to improve theories, theories have not been verified, testing particular theories and propositions are not considered and no grounded theory (reaching a theory through empirical studies) is offered.

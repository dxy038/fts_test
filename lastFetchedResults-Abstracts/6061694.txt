The objective of this article is to summarize and analyze the variance of clinical pathway in children with bronchopneumonia and come to a rectification in order to reduce variance cases. The objects are children with bronchopneumonia from April 2010 to April 2011 in our hospital. We made a statistic about the number of variance cases and variance reasons and got the results as below: (1) there were 46 cases into the pathway totally in the first 5 months. And 12 of them developed variance (26.1%) among which plus-variance accounts for 83.3%. Then we adjusted the standard for the averaged length of stay (ALS) from 7~14 days to 5~10 days. After that, there were 121 cases into the pathway. And 42 of them developed variance (34.7%); (2) the causes for variance include: the rapid recovery (31.9%), secondary infection (26.2%), severe condition (23.8%), accompanied by other diseases (11.9%) and applications by patientsÂ´ parents (7.1%). So we draw the conclusions: (1) it is reasonable to make 5~10 days as the standard for ALS for children with bronchopneumonia in our hospital; (2) taking precautions against hospital infection would decrease variance rate effectively.

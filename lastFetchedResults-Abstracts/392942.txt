Objective
One of the pathologic conditions underlying benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is degeneration of the otolith organs. In this study, we examined changes in the parameters of stabilometry under an upright condition and head-tilt conditions in patients with BPPV.
Methods
We performed stabilometry on 21 patients with right BPPV, on 21 patients with left BPPV and on 21 controls. First, the subject stood barefoot in an upright position with both feet together on the platform with eyes closed. Next, tilting of the head about 30° to the left was added. Then, tilting about 30° to the right was performed.
Results
In right BPPV patients, the total length of velocity vectors in the right or left direction on right or left head-tilt were significantly smaller than those in an upright position. The enveloped area and total length of velocity vectors in the right or left direction were significantly larger than those in controls. In left BPPV patients, there were no parameters that showed any significant difference.
Conclusions
In this study, lesions of right BPPV patients were coincidentally more severe than those in left BPPV patients, and velocity vectors with head-tilts were significantly smaller than in an upright position. Using the total length of the velocity vectors, head-tilting stabilometry has the potential to become a reliable otolith function examination method.

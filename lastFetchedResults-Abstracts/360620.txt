Study objective: We evaluated the efficacy of safety devices (seat belts and air bags) on hospital resource use and injury severity while controlling for variables known to affect outcome of motor vehicle crashes. Methods:  We conducted a prospective observational study of motor vehicle crash victims who were transported to the hospital in a suburban-rural county with a population of 1.4 million. Out-of-hospital providers recorded patient demographic characteristics, mechanism of injury (based on American College of Surgeons criteria), and use of seat belts or air bags. Hospital charts were reviewed for hospital admission, length of hospital stay, ICU stay, surgery, major nonorthopedic surgery or death, and severe injury (Injury Severity Score > 15). Results:  The study group comprised 1,446 motor vehicle crash victims. Median age was 30 years, 47% were male, and 69% used safety devices. The use of safety devices reduced the likelihood of hospital admission (adjusted odds ratio [OR], .67; 95% confidence interval [CI], .46 to .98), surgery (adjusted OR, .52; 95% CI, .27 to 1.01), major surgery or death (adjusted OR, .14; 95% CI, .04 to .52), and severe injuries (adjusted OR of Injury Severity Score > 15, .39; 95% CI, .19 to .83). Conclusion:  The use of safety devices is associated with decreased hospital resource use and less severe injuries for victims of motor vehicle crashes who are transported to the hospital by emergency medical services providers, even after adjustment for many other variables known to affect the outcome of motor vehicle crashes. Continued efforts to promote safety device use are warranted.

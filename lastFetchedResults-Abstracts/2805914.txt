This paper proposes a non-uniformly distributed threemicrophone array speech enhancement system to suppress directional interferences and diffuse noise simultaneously. Each pair of microphones is designed to tackle one kind of noise. Unlike other hybrid systems, which combine different noise suppression techniques derived in different domains, the proposed system integrates two noise suppression techniques derived in the unified power spectral density domain. In terms of objective LLR and PESQ measures, the proposed hybrid system is demonstrated more effective in eliminating directional and diffuse noise under various SNR conditions than each individual suppression technique.

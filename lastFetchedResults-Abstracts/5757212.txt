In emerging agile all-optical networks, the next generation time division multiplexing technique in the optical domain is implemented on top of wavelength-division multiplexing to increase channel utilization and to support dynamic bandwidth demands. However, the corresponding dynamic routing, wavelength and timeslot assignment (DRWTA) problem has not yet been well addressed with respect to appropriately handling the bandwidth available. In this paper, we use dynamic programming and take the bottom-up approach to solve the DRWTA problem with the objective of minimizing blocking probability. We consider the ring topology and apply a distributed scheme to accommodate dynamic bandwidth requests in order to enhance network survivability and to decrease the degree of coordination among nodes. The proposed dynamic programming method decreases the runtime and improves time-related performance of the network

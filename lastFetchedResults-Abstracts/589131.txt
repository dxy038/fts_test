Objective: The main goal of the present research was to investigate the ICT utilization level by faculty members of Isfahan Universities as a criterion for accepting innovation in curriculum based on Concern Based Adoption Model (CBAM).
Methodoloy: A descriptive survey was conducted on a sample was randomly drawn from faculty members at both Isfahan University (126) and Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (174). The instrument employed was the CBAM standard evaluation of ICT application in Education (Ver.1.1).
Findings: Referring to CBAM, the majority of University professors (65.9%) were placed at levels 2 through 5 of ICT adoption (beginners to Intermediate). Female faculty members and full professors demonstrated relatively lower levels of ICT adoption. Isfahan University professors demonstrated lower levels of ICT adoption compared to those in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. No significance was found between lengths of tenured service with adoption of ICT. Since the majority of faculty members at these universities were at level 2 through five of ICT adoption, therefore the essential groundwork should be laid for them to apply ICT in the curriculum.

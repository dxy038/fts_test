The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) is the next generation Department of Defense (DoD) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) satellite communications (SATCOM) system that will provide the Warfighter with modern worldwide mobile communication services. To sustain the current UHF SATCOM constellation capabilities, the MUOS satellites will also offer a legacy UHF communications payload that will provide capabilities to existing deployed UHF terminals, utilizing dedicated and time division multiple access (TDMA) waveforms such as Integrated Waveform (IW) and Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA). The MUOS satellite will be very flexible in that it will support new network-centric and legacy users; however, the two payloads will not be interconnected. As such, there is no translation between the legacy and new network-centric waveforms. With the expected life of the satellite being at 2024 and with the large number of existing legacy terminals, a legacy UHF to MUOS translation capability was deemed necessary by Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) for Network and Information Integration (NII). The MUOS to Legacy UHF Gateway Component (MLGC) will be developed within the Emerging Technologies Program Management Office (PMO) within the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). This paper describes the recommended solution under consideration for this initiative.

The Current study examines contradictions in Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri’s political poetry. Al-Jawahiri led most of his life amidst the turmoil caused by the political events and developments that Iraq has undergone through different periods beginning with the 1920 Revolution led by religious leaders and ending with al-Ba‘th Party and Saddam Hussein. Al-Jawahiri has beencontradictory in his poems onal-Ba‘th Party, religious leaders, the contemporary Islamic movement, and the red communist tide which dominated Iraq in Abd al-Karim Qasim’s era. Al-Jawahiri has assumed such ironic and sarcastic stances toward events through his poems. An in-depth inspection of the true nature of his political positions demands an objective and historical study of his political poetry.

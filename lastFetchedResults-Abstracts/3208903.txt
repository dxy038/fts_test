We are currently experiencing a boom in the presence of Spanish language in the world, which is reflected in its inclusion as a second language in the educational system of countries like Brazil and the emergence of language in the U.S. and China. To confront this situation there is a wide variety of courses for learning Spanish. However, specific initiatives combining proven teaching methods in university classroom experiences with the creation of new multidisciplinary content displayed on 3D virtual sets have not been detected. The objective of this research, supported by the SLROUTE project, is the creation of an integrated technology platform that enables the creation, development and deployment of contents for teaching Spanish in an educational video game. Such environment will promote an immersive, creative and collaborative experience in the process of learning Spanish.

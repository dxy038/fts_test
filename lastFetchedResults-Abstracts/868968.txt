This paper models the seaport system with the objective of determining the optimal storage strategy for various container-handling schedules. A container location model (CLM) is developed, with an objective function designed to minimise the turn around time of container ships, and solved using genetic algorithm (GA). The results section presents an analyses of different resource levels and a comparison with current practice at the Port of Brisbane.

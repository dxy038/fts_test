In 1986, the B&amp;W Owners Group (B&amp;WOG) Operator Support Committee (OSC) embarked on a program aimed at improving the nuclear plant operator´s ability to control the plant, particularly during transient conditions. The concept that involved was termed ´operator burden´. Operator burden was defined as those factors which inordinately hinder the plant operator´s ability to prevent a reactor trip or mitigate plant transients posttrip. This effort was developed as a multiphase project which included reviews of previously performed studies, transients, operator interviews, and OSC discussions. The primary objective of the overall program were to: (1) identify the areas where the control-room operators have been unnecessarily burdened; and (2) implement actions to reduce operator burden and thus improve safety by reducing the frequency and severity of complex transients. The result of this program was a report identifying several areas of action. Some of these action items have already been completed. Specific recommendations have been incorporated into the B&amp;WOG Safety and Performance Improvement Program.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

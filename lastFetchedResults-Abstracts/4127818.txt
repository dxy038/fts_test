A method is described for the design and realisation of optimised receiver filters based on the numerical optimisation of preselected low order structures using a modified Chernoff bound on error probability as the objective function. The filters are readily realised by doubly terminated L-C ladder networks and have a performance that is very close indeed to the strict optimum. They have low complexity and low sensitivity, in addition to improved robustness and performance compared with conventional designs

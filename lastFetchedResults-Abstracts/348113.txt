Objective: To correlate repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) decrement in different muscles with the predominant clinical presentation in myasthenia gravis (MG), and to study single fibre EMG (SFEMG) sensitivity in ocular MG.
Methods: Sixty-nine, untreated, consecutive patients suspected for MG were observed prospectively for a minimum of 6 months. Those who improved on medical treatment were diagnosed as MG. The others, in whom the neurophysiological studies were normal and that did not improve on medical treatment served as a control group, from which normative data for RNS and SFEMG was obtained. The MG patients were further classified in 3 subgroups according to the predominant clinical presentation: group I (ocular); group b (bulbar); and group a (axial). We performed RNS in nasalis, trapezius, anconeus, and abductor digiti minimi. All patients with ocular MG underwent jitter determination of the orbicularis oculi muscle.
Results: Thirty-seven patients were diagnosed as MG (group I, 15; group b, 13; group a, 9). In group I, RNS was abnormal in 33% of the patients. RNS studies disclosed at least one abnormal muscle response in every patient in groups a and b. Trapezius was significantly more sensitive in group a, and anconeus and nasalis in group b (P<0.01). Jitter was abnormal in all patients in group I, and the most sensitive parameter was an increased number of unstable pairs, 100%.
Conclusions: Based on these observations, we recommend that a shoulder muscle, as the trapezius, should be studied first in the limb-axial presentation of MG, and the anconeusâ€“nasalis muscles in predominant bulbar MG. In ocular MG, RNS is not sensitive and jitter should be performed in facial muscles.
Significance: This paper shows the unequal sensitivity of several muscles to RNS in different forms of MG.

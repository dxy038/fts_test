The optimum design visualization is one of the focuses study at present, this paper will apply the visualization technology into the optimum design based on Genetic Algorithms(namely GAs). For the multi-variable objective function in the mathematics model, a new visualization approach for displaying N-dimensional function in 3-D Euclid Space is used in function graph. For the GAs population visualization, every individual in N-dimensional genetic space will be mapped to the polyline by using the Parallel Coordinate System(namely PCS). After optimum design, optimal results and middle data will be displayed in the standardized form. At last, a new visualization model for optimum design based on GAs is established in this paper.

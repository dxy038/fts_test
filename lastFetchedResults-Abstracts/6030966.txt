The market of security software solutions for smartphones has grown considerably in the last few years. A wide range of products is available. The objective of our work is to develop an overview of security software solutions for smartphones. At first we identify basic threats and typical security measures for smartphones. Then we explore current security software solutions and describe how these can be classified. Furthermore, we analyse which security software solutions (respectively classes of security software solutions) can prevent or mitigate which threats.

Correct software cost estimation is important in software engineering. So it is significant to reasonably evaluate current lots of software cost estimation methods and subsequently select the most suitable one. The evaluation framework of software cost estimation methods is brought forward. The framework summarizes all aspects that should be considered by estimation methods. Fuzzy-Grey comprehensive evaluation method which combines fuzzy evaluation and grey theory is used in the evaluation model of software cost estimation methods. It can make full use of fuzziness and grayness of evaluation information by experts which makes the evaluation more objective and accurate. Eventually, through an example the evaluation model is proved to be useful and feasible in software development project practice.

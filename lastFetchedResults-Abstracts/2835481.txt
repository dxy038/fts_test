Energy efficient and mobility information is a key problem in wireless sensor networks. Save more energy in network processing such as mobility, data aggregation and gateway deployment is a widely used technique. The large-scale deployment of wireless sensor networks and the need for data aggregation, mobility controlling and also necessitate to deploying the gateways among the network, for the purpose of balancing the load and prolonging the lifetime. In this paper, a new approximation algorithm named as Mobile Sink Clustering Algorithm (MSCA) to propose approach the mobility control of sensor nodes. The controlling methods of gateway deployment and handing over the path for mobile sink travel and collect the data from different gateways are aggregated by exploit redundancy with the objective of minimizing energy consumption in transmission. According to the recent study, it has been proved that the sink mobility along a constrained path, can improve energy effectiveness in wireless sensor networks. Due to path constrained the mobile sink has collected the data from the gateways, which are placed at random. The performance of proposed system also has been discussed. Also extend the analysis to improve the energy calculating and show the data aggregation.

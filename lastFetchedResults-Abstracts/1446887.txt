Our objective was to determine if increased glycolytic enzyme capacity accommodates rapid glycolysis, which leads to inferior pork color and water-holding capacity. Progeny from HAL-1843 free Duroc (n=16) or Pietrain (n=16) sires were harvested over a 2-week period. Coupled enzyme assays were used to quantify total capacity of pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) in the sarcoplasmic fractions and crude homogenates of longissimus muscle (LM), respectively. Capacity of PK was not correlated with LM pH (20, 45, 180 min or 24 h), purge, drip loss, or CIE L* (P &gt; 0.2). However, PFK capacity was inversely related to fluid loss (P&lt;0.05). This finding was unexpected, but may result from PFK becoming partially denatured and inactivated by 20 min postmortem in samples that undergo a rapid pH decline. These data indicate that lighter pork color and reduced water-holding capacity are not associated with an increase in the capacity of enzymes that catalyze regulated steps of glycolysis.

Testing is one of the most important and crucial activities of software life cycle. The objective of testing is to make sure that the functionalities of a system are correctly implemented. This is done in three steps. First, test cases are generated from the specification of the system and/or test purposes. Then, the generated test cases are applied to the implementation of the system under test and the reactions of the later are observed. Finally, the test results are analyzed and a verdict is concluded. Indeed, if the outputs of each test case match those expected (i.e., derived from the specification) the implementation is said to conform to the specification; otherwise, the implementation is faulty and the diagnosis process is started to locate and fix the fault.

A new optimization method for microwave broadband amplifier based on orthogonal design is presented. This approach is more effective for the optimization of the complicated objective function and the indistinct expression than conventional optimization methods. It has fast convergence rate and can overcome the shortcoming of conventional optimization methods that rely on starting values strongly. The example performed with orthogonal design shows that it is effective and useful for the optimization of microwave broadband amplifier.

The objective of my Ph.D is to develop a computational model of social relations for artificial companions. Such a model should consider the representation of the social relation, its initialization and its dynamics over time. Moreover, the influence of this relation on the agentÂ´s decision-making should be modeled. In the proposed computational model described in this paper, the representation, initialization, and dynamics of the social relation are based on the research in Human and Social Sciences, considering the influence of individual and social parameters such as the personality of the agent or its social role.

The objective of this work is the calculation of the static effective permittivity for a periodic lattice composed of cylinders (/spl epsiv//sub r/) with complex shape suspended in a host medium (/spl epsiv//sub b/). The cylinders are infinitely long and parallel to each other. The charge-neutral lattice is infinite and isotropic in a two-dimensional space and is illuminated by a constant electric field.

The medical curriculum has changed with the adoption of the student-centered and case-based learning paradigm. Information and communication technologies can be useful tools to complement clinical reasoning learning (CRL) sessions. Our objective was to use computers in order to coordinate remote CRL sessions, integrating electronic resources at every step of the reasoning process. CRL sessions will be enriched by multimedia medical data. We created Virtu@l Consult@tion a computer-supported collaborative learning environment for CRL sessions. It can be used for undergraduates, internships, residency or continuing medical education at distance. It can also be useful to prepare physicians for telemedicine technologies

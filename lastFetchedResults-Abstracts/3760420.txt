We demonstrate the controlled stretching and recompression of ultrashort optical pulses using bidirectional reflection from both ends of a single linearly chirped fiber grating. We identify operating regimes for minimal pulse distortion due to the phase and filtering responses of a simple linear grating and experimentally demonstrate complete pulse reconstruction.

Integration of modeling, embedding of knowledge and intelligence in models, and communication on the Internet are receiving increased attention in product engineering. The objective of lifecycle management of product related engineering activities (PLM) requires this attention. One of the problems in this area is integration of processes for creation, models for description, and knowledge for decision within a closely related set of engineering objects. Efficient communication with other engineering object is also a critical problem. As a possible solution, the authors propose integrated model object (IMO) as a complex model for description of closely related engineering objects. IMO establishes intent-based behavioral adaptivity (IBA) for connection of behaviors, adaptive actions, and human intent to assist management of changes of engineering objects at development or correction. Any modification of any engineering object initiates analysis for its effect on the same and other objects. Implementation of IMO is proposed as an extension to industrial portal centered collaborative engineering modeling systems. In this paper, the authors propose integrated model object (IMO) as environment adaptive unit for modeling of closely related engineering objects. Following this, representation of engineer intent as knowledge that is understandable for engineers and assessed by authorized humans before any application at engineering activities is discussed. Finally, interdependent definitions of characteristics and behaviors of engineering objects, as two essential issues at implementation of IMO, are emphasized

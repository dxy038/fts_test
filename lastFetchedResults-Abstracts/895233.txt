Objective (s): This study aimed to investigate the quality of life in older people suffering from abuse by family members in comparison with older patients without such experiences.
Methods: Using a quantitative design and a cross-sectional approach, 360 older people (180 abused and 180 non- abused older people) aged over 65 years was entered into the study. Data were collected using the Iranian version of Abbreviated Mental Test Score, the Domestic Elder Abuse Questionnaire and the Iranian version of 36-item Short form Health Survey (SF-36) via face-to-face interviews.
Results: It was found that the older people who did not experience abuse from family members reported higher quality of life in comparison with the abused older people(P < 0.00001). Significant differences were observed between male and female with regard to health-related quality of life (P < 0.00001). 
Conclusion: The findings suggest that detecting the symptoms of abuse in older people is important. Indeed providing preventive and supportive care for this population seems necessary.

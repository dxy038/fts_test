This paper is a continuation to the authorÂ´s previous paper on novel lithium-ion battery charger based on pulse charging technique where a central power supply acting as a controlled current source is sequentially connected in parallel with different batteries through an array of switches. Here the idea is extended to more wide range of AC-DC applications. Though the idea of central power supply can be extended to any power range, more emphasis is given on medium power applications, with lesser stringent harmonic requirements yet appreciable power efficiency. Various CCM-S2PFC topologies with forward converter based current source are presented. Simulation results to demonstrate the proposed methodology are presented. There are various topologies of S2PFC available both in the academia and industry. The objective of this paper is to discuss the prospects of them to develop the novel current source based charger

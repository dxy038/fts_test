In this paper, a planar wideband bandpass filter with complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR)-loaded transmission line is optimally designed taking into account a multi-regional objective function. Eight physical dimensions are set to be design parameters of the filter structure, and the Evolution Strategy (ES) algorithm is adopted to optimize the multi-parameter problem. The result shows that a simple gap capacitance model can make wideband bandpass filter and accomplish the design goal well with smaller size by the proposed optimization technique.

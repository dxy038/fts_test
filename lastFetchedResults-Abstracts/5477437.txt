Mitigating the effects process variations on power-frequency distributions can be done by using a system of locally-generated body biases. This system allows for highly localized circuit optimizations with very little overhead in silicon area and routing resources. We present a multiple objective algorithm to find near-optimal configurations of these biases which can be applied during post-fabrication testing. The system can improve an initial yield of 12% to 77%.

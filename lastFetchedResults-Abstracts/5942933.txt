Currently there are little objective parameters that can quantify the success of one form of prostate surgical removal over another. Accordingly, at Old Dominion University (ODU) we have been developing a process resulting in the use of software algorithms to assess the coverage and depth of extra-capsular soft tissue removed with the prostate by the various surgical approaches. Parameters such as the percent of capsule that is bare of soft tissue and where present the depth and extent of coverage have been assessed. First, visualization methods and tools are developed for images of prostate slices that are provided to ODU by the Pathology Department at Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS). The visualization tools interpolate and present 3D models of the prostates. Measurement algorithms are then applied to determine statistics about extra-capsular tissue coverage. This paper addresses the modeling, visualization, and analysis of prostate gland tissue to aid in quantifying prostate surgery success. Particular attention is directed towards the accuracy of these measurements and is addressed in the analysis discussions.

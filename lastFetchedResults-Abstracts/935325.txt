Natural reef structures in inshore waters have for centuries provided a focus for the growth of high densities of fish populations. Recent decades have seen the successful replication of this effect using artificial reef structures, particularly those created in the Gulf of Mexico using redundant oil and gas platforms. Recognising the success elsewhere has led to a consideration of the potential of this approach in North Sea waters, exemplified by a feasibility study for establishing an artificial reef in the Moray Firth (Scotland, UK). The Moray Firth is an area of outstanding biological importance which, like other Scottish estuaries, is under increasing threat from the pressure of industry, shipping and recreational activities. A necessary first step towards proper conservation and management of natural resources is the collation of detailed knowledge of the marine and coastal characteristics of the Firth. Most of the existing relevant data on the Moray Firth is in map or tabular form. As a contribution to the systematic collection of environmental data in a computer compatible form, data on prioritized themes were input to a geographical information system (GIS) as a series of computerized baseline datasets. From this GIS it is possible to practise rational planning of environmental resources, based on objective criteria. It is also possible to model and evaluate the likely impact of a proposed development. A recent example was concerned with the feasibility of constructing a steel `artificial reef' from `materials of opportunity', using decommissioned platforms from the oil and gas industry in the North Sea. The results obtained by applying established conventional empirical procedures for site selection were compared with the results of a rigorous GIS-based approach, to identify optimal locations for the possible siting of an `artificial reef'.

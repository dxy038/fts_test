Furthermore the related reports from different sources were noted.   The extensive studies have important information about malaria vectors. In this study the data about malaria vectors and related training courses are listed. During this study the related papers, Books and thesises which have been reviewed.   Although efforts, surveillance system, diagnostic and treatment facilities, as well as knowledge and attitude of peoples regarding to health behavior are improved nowadays, there are significant improvements about decreasing the malaria cases. Risk of the disease exists because of population exchange and asymptomatic cases. The malaria can be studied with both public health and economical aspects. This paper represents entomological studies of malaria during 1935 by the end of 2008.   Conclusion: our study revealed that, based on recent malaria national program, the authorities should make an emphasis on vector control monitoring, resistance management, malaria evaluation and because of weak supervision on all malaria operation at stage of elimination of malaria, accurate and careful suppersional require to reach the objective and goal of elimination.

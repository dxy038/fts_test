The objective of the research reported in this paper was to develop a proof of concept self-healing tool for the personal computing environment operating in a peer-to-peer mode and consisting of a pulse monitor and a vital signs health monitor. The prototype developed in Java, JNI and C utilising UDP to communicate to its peers proved the feasibility of the pulse and vital signs concepts and their ability to provide some self-healing properties within a PC environment. The functionality also opens new opportunities to provide self-configuring, self-optimising and self-protecting autonomic capabilities to personal computing.

With the development of smart distribution network, the tie rate increases gradually, which has further requirements for new service restoration methods. Traditional service restoration methods can get ideal restoration plan, but the convergence is slow and the load balancing is neglected. So a service restoration method based on load balance expectation searching (LBES) for smart distribution network is proposed in this paper. Under the condition of maximum restoration, each tie feeder takes load balance expectation as the searching objective, which makes restoration plan be formed quickly and accurately. This new method also has the advantages of single objective comparison, clear direction and low computational complexity. To prove the effectiveness of this method, an example is given in this paper at last.

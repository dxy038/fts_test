The overall objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of climate policy and technology learning on future investments in the Swedish power sector. Methodologically we assess the lifetime engineering costs of different power generation technologies in Sweden, and analyze the impact of carbon pricing on the competitive cost position of these technologies under varying rate-of-return requirements. We also argue that technological learning in the Swedish power sector – not the least in the case of wind power – is strongly related to the presence of international learning and R&amp;D spillovers, and for this reason capacity expansions abroad have important influences of the future cost of power generation in Sweden. The results suggest that renewable power will benefit from existing EU climate policy measures, but overall additional policy instruments (e.g., green certificate schemes) are also needed to stimulate the diffusion of renewable power. Moreover, under a recent European Commission scenario and using estimated learning rates for wind power and the combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), wind power gains considerable competitive ground due to international technology learning impacts. These latter results are, however, very sensitive to the assumed learning-by-doing rates for wind power and CCGT, respectively.

We present a framework for analyzing the human body 3D motion of golf swing from single-camera video sequences. The system is different from the methods in the literature as it evaluates the 3D model for each major body part separately to derive a more accurate 3D representation. The human body parts used for the analysis are automatically extracted using a video object segmentation technique. This 2D information estimated from the segmented body parts is utilized to obtain 3D body part models, consisting of head, upper arms, lower arms, body trunk, upper legs, lower legs and feet. The objective of the system is to obtain the 3D motion information for performance evaluation in golf swinging and comparing this information for different players.

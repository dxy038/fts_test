Pedestrian underpass and pedestrian overcrossing belong to pedestrian facility to cross street. It is an important work to evaluate the plan between pedestrian underpass with pedestrian overcrossing, which Many factors should be concerned during the process. Commonly, there are some methods can resolve the problem from different aspects. Under the basic of building the index system about pedestrian facility. The paper puts forward the new method of Projection Pursuit Cluster Model which comes of statistics. By means of Genetic Algorithm, it describes the key steps of Projection Pursuit Cluster Model with an example, and points out that the method is more objective application in the decision-making system which contains abound data and legible properties.

The objective of the corrective switching algorithm (CSA) is to identify switching candidates to eliminate or reduce system overloads. This paper describes the implementation of the CSA for on-line contingency analysis. The developed program searches for the best switching candidates from a user specified list, which normally includes all branches in the study area and most typical switching operations (openings and closings) at main substations. The developed algorithm has the unique ability to process complicated substation busbar switching scenarios, including multiple switching scenarios per any substation. The selection algorithm is based on a linearized DC model, but all selected candidates are verified using AC load flows. The program has been used as part of the security analysis program at Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&amp;G) since Summer 1993 and has proved its reliability and efficiency

The objective of the present study was to formulate naproxen–eudragit® RS100 nanoparticles and investigate the physicochemical characteristics of the prepared nanoparticles. The nanoparticles of naproxen with eudragit® RS100 were formulated using the solvent evaporation/extraction technique (the single emulsion technique). The effect of several process parameters, i.e., drug/polymer ratio, aqueous phase volume and speed of homogenization were considered on the size of the nanoformulations. The physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles were studied applying particle size analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray crystallography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The release rate of naproxen from various drug/polymer nanoparticles was investigated as well. All the prepared formulations using eudragit® RS100 resulted in nano-range size particles with relative spherical smooth morphology. The nanoparticles of naproxen–eudragit® RS100 displayed lower crystallinity. The intermolecular interaction between naproxen and eudragit® RS100 was detected in the FT-IR spectrum of the nanoparticles. All the nanoparticles displayed a slowed release pattern with the reduced burst release in comparison with the intact drug powder and physical mixtures of drug and polymer. According of these findings, formulation of the naproxen–eudragit® RS100 nanoparticles was able to improve the physicochemical characteristics of the drug and possibly will increase the anti-inflammatory effects of drug following its ocular or intra-joint administration.

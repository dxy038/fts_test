Monitoring for cracks has been studied for decades as an important objective of the structural health monitoring system. But there is still no suitable sensor of convenience, low-cost, and wireless with high sensitivity for crack monitoring coming into practice. This paper will introduce a newly developed crack monitoring sensor based on the microstrip patch antenna. This is important as a resonant frequency shift will occur when a crack is introduced on the antenna patch. As a result, measuring the resonant frequency shift of the microstrip patch antenna can be utilized to monitor the crack length and orientation. This method was validated through both simulation and experiments. As a result, it was shown that the experiment results are in good agreement with the simulation results for crack detection and the patch antenna sensors can sufficiently detect the sub-millimeter crack with a pretty high resolution. Therefore this research can provide a preliminary theoretical basis for the application of this method in the area of wireless structural health monitoring.

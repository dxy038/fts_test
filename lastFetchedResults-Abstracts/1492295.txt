Background and objective: Health as one of the main metaparadigm
of health theories is set next to concepts of human
and the environment. Health has objective and subjective
dimensions which unfortunately less attention has been
paid to the subjective dimension. The aim of this study is
to determine the level of subjective well-being and related
factors among students of GUMS.
Methods: This descriptive– analytical cross-sectional study
was done on 314 students from the GUMS, which were
selected through stratified random sampling. Research
instrument of subjective well-being was: The standard
questionnaire of life satisfaction (SWLS) and the Positive
and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). For data analysis
SPSS21 was used.
Findings: Students’ levels of subjective well-being in
cognitive dimension was high and in emotional dimension
was low. There was significant negative relationship between
positive affect and student’s courses of education (p < 0.05).
In addition, there was a significant relationship between
gender and negative affect, also between marital status and
satisfaction with life(p < 0.05).
Conclusion: In general, the level of subjective well-being in
students of GUMS was low. Meanwhile the suitable cognitive
and emotional dimensions of subjective well-being were
fundamental necessity for the suitable social role playing.
Therefore paying attention to cognitive and emotional
dimensions of subjective well-being and factors affecting in
this important group have a paramount importance

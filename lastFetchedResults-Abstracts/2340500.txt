A two-level layout optimization strategy is proposed in this paper for large-scale composite wing structures. Design requirements are adjusted at the system level according to structural deformation, while the layout is optimized at the subsystem level to satisfy the constraints from system level. The approaching degrees of various failure critical loads in wing panels are employed to gauge the structure's carrying efficiency. By optimizing the efficiency as an objective, the continuity of the problem could be guaranteed. Stiffened wing panels are modeled by the equivalent orthotropic plates, and the global buckling load is predicted by energy method. The nonlinear effect of stringers' support elasticity on skin local buckle resistance is investigated and approximated by neural network (NN) surrogate model. These failure predictions are based on analytical solutions, which could effectively save calculation resources. Finally, the integral optimization of a large-scale wing structure is completed as an example. The result fulfills design requirements and shows the feasibility of this method.

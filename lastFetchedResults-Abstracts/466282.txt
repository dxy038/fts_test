Objective: We conducted a population-based study of maternal and neonatal characteristics and delivery complications in relation to the outcome of a 75-g, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test at 25 to 30 weeks' gestation. Study Design: An oral glucose tolerance test was offered to pregnant women in a geographically defined population. Pregnancy outcome was analyzed according to the test result. Results: Among women delivered at Lund Hospital, we identified 4526 women with an oral glucose tolerance value of <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL), 131 women with a value of 7.8 to 8.9 mmol/L (140-162 mg/dL), and 116 women with gestational diabetes (≥9.0 mmol/L [≥162 mg/dL]). A further 28 cases of gestational diabetes were identified, giving a prevalence of 1.2%. An increased rate of cesarean delivery and infant macrosomia was observed in the group with a glucose tolerance value of 7.8 to 8.9 mmol/L (140-162 mg/dL) and in the gestational diabetes group. Advanced maternal age and high body mass index were risk factors for increased oral glucose tolerance values in 12,657 screened women in the area. Conclusion: The study stresses the significance of moderately increased oral glucose tolerance values. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:77-83.)

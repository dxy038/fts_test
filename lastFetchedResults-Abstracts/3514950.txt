The metropolitan network environment is a fast-growing and challenging space for optical communications. The environment spans a large range of length scales, channel counts, data rates, and services/formats. The large range of this application space places some unique requirements on the network elements required to implement these networks. The objective of this workshop is to better understand the requirements, design, and implementation of these network elements from both a business and technical point of view-with a special emphasis on amplifiers and active elements. Panelists will provide brief presentations followed by a question and answer session.

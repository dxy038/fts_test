The objective of this paper is to present an alternative closure for turbulent heat transport, that has been established on the ground of v2â€“f model with so-called elliptic relaxation equation and the two-equation model for turbulent thermal field. New formulae on the eddy heat diffusivity is proposed. Additionally the production term of destruction rate of temperature variance transport equation is reformulated. No damping functions are involved in this model. Results of numerical computation have been compared with the experimental data for fully developed thermal field in the pipe and DNS heat transfer prediction for two-dimensional channel flow. The model predicts reasonably well the near-wall distribution of basic turbulence statistics.

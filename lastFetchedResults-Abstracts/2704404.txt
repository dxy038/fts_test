A novel zero current soft-switching (ZCS) pulse-width modulation (PWM) bidirectional dc-dc converter (BDC) with non-inverting polarity multi-mode voltage regulations is presented. In the proposed BDC, all the power devices commutate in ZCS with the aid of single-auxiliary switch-based edge-resonant cells; accordingly the switching power losses can be minimised. The effectiveness of the proposed BDC and its steady-state characteristics are verified in experiments with a 500 W-50 kHz prototype.

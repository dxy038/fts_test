At the same time, in order to improve the distribution service quality and market competition, add maximum work time, many vehicle types, and maximum running distance in restraint conditions in order to improve the applicability and universal characteristics of model. For multi-depot vehicle scheduling problem with time window is NP puzzle, get the optimization solution by improved genetic algorithm, which using hybrid coding to simplify the problem, using improved saving algorithm to construct initial solution to improve the genetic low´s searching efficiency, using individual amount control selection game in order to guarantee colony diversity, using partially matched crossover to improve convergent speed of algorithm so as to better solve the inconsistency between diversity and convergent speed, using 2-exchange mutation strategy to strengthen the partial searching ability of chromosome, improve the convergent speed of algorithm. Finally, the good performance of improved algorithm can be proved by experiment calculation and concrete examples.

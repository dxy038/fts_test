Introduction: Despite the impact of increased abdominal hypertension on organ dysfunction and increased mortality, data on the frequency and its related risk factors in critical care unit does not seem enough. While studies have shown that patients’ intra-abdominal pressure measured at admission to intensive care unit can serve as an independent prognostic factor for mortality and assess impacts of IAH on organ function.
Objective: This study aims to determine the frequency of increased abdominal hypertension and its related factors in patients hospitalized in ICUs.
Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive –analytical study was conducted on 76 intensive care unit patients in one o f the teaching hospitals in city of Rasht. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured every 8 hours for a 24-hour period through a Foley catheter (Korn method). Instrument used consisted of three parts: first part covered personal data (age, gender, Body Mass Index, disease diagnosis), second part included continuous assessment of organ dysfunction scale (respiratory condition, liver, kidney, hemodynamic, and level of conscious) and third part covered data related to IAH and accompanying variables(mean arterial pressure, abdominal perfusion pressure, peak airway pressure, maximum airway pressure, plateau pressure and positive end expiratory pressure) and demographic data, type of diagnosis, SOFA score, central venous pressure, mean airway pressure was recorded.
Result: Findings showed that the frequency of intra-abdominal hypertension was 18.42percent. Also Step wise regression method showed that the mean arterial pressure of 1.02 times can increase intra abdominal pressure.
Conclusion: Intra-abdominal pressure as a factor affecting the performance of other organs in patients in intensive care units is important and it's recommended that intra-abdominal pressure to be measured routinely in critically ill patients and through this prevent abdominal compartment syndrome and its complications.

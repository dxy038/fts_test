Chip organization must be reconsidered when moving from conventional (Permalloy) to ion-implanted bubble memory devices. Four different schemes merit attention at this time: circumferential major loop, simple major loop, simple loop with bidirectional propagation, and "shuttle." Required bubble manipulating function properties, performance, and other advantages and disadvantages are established for all four. "Shuttle" emerges as a favorite and thereby indicates the most desirable function properties. Bidirectional propagation is shown to be highly desirable.

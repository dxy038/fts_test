A discussion of dual microprocessors in a split-bus configuration to acquire and record sensor data and how this architecture is applied to a recording system is the objective of this paper. The data is collected using several kinds of expendable probes deployed from ship and aircraft platforms. These self-contained units automatically acquire and record the information received and provide basic operational facilities including optional programming, real time digital display and status items as well as system self tests. The function of data storage is provided by cassette recording. There are also external strip chart outputs as well as data transmission capabilities within these systems. To the user, these systems offer a simple operating task and are flexible enough to apply to different variations in data acquisition requirements.

In this paper, we present a receiver centric P2P-based multimedia streaming mechanism for heterogeneous network terminals. P2P networks possess the heterogeneous characteristics that are not known a priori, such dynamic conditions make the real time applications like multimedia streaming more challenging. We proposed an adaptive streaming mechanism to cope with the problem of dynamic characteristics and to meet the requirement of heterogeneous network terminals. The key characteristics of the mechanism include, media-aware, network-aware, and quality-aware. The main objective of this proposed streaming mechanism is to maximize the received throughput (total number of received packets) and to minimize the packet drop ratio in order to improve the overall Quality of Service (QoS). We evaluated the proposed P2P streaming mechanism by performing simulations using NS-2. The obtained results show a considerable improvement in the overall received QoS.

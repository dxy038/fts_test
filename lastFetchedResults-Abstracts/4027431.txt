The objective of this paper is to present a novel approach for limiting harmonic and improving reactive compensation for industrial power systems using single-tuned filters. The unique feature of the developed power distribution model is that it incorporates both the filter capacity and resonant point as design parameters. The model also considers the detuning effects due to temperature and frequency variations, as well as manufacturing tolerances. The proposed approach was implemented as a PC-based computer code, and it was integrated with a user-friendly graphical user interface. The developed analysis tool was employed to solve the harmonic problems of several industrial plants, and the results all showed great improvements after using this computer tool

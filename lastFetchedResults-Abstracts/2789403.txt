Adiabatic switching techniques based on energy recovery principle are one of the best solutions at circuit and logic level to achieve reduction in power. The main objective of this paper is Low Power Multiplexer design using diode free adiabatic logic and implementation of this logic into barrel shifter. A barrel shifter is a digital circuit that can shift a data word by a specified number of bits. It can be implemented as a sequence of multiplexers (mux), and in such an implementation the output of one mux is connected to the input of the next mux in a way that depends on the shift distance. The number of multiplexer required is N log<sub>2</sub>N. This paper compares conventional CMOS based design with diode free adiabatic logic (DFAL), the simulation is performed using a SPICE circuit simulator at 0.18um technology node &amp; 1.8V standard CMOS process. Comparison has shown a significant power saving to the extent of 60% in case of diode free adiabatic technique as compared to CMOS logic in 10-100MHz transition frequency range.

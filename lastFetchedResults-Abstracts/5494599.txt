Multiple criteria decision making models have been well researched and a variety of interactive solution methods have been derived with an implicit assumption of a single user. While these interactive methods suggest different individual preference elicitation techniques from a single decision maker, the need for preference aggregation and its significance when multiple decision makers are involved needs further investigation. The author draws on recent attempts to extend the use of multiple objective linear programming techniques, to group decision making within a group decision support framework. The modelling component of the prototype group decision support system consists of two parts; the interactive weighted Tchebycheff method (R.E. Steuer E.U. Choo, 1983) and an ordinal ranking and consensus formation model. The latter is designed to provide a group of decision makers with feedback on individual preferences regarding possible solutions to a multiobjective problem. The experimental results from the current study favor the integration of the Tchebycheff procedure with the ordinal ranking and consensus formation model when compared to the application of its unaugmented version

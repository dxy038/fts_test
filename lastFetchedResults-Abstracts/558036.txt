The objective of the present study was to estimate the genetic parameters for 13 linear type traits, somatic cell score (SCS) and longevity in Holstein population of Iran. Two set of data including 3000 (for SCS) and 12226(for longevity) in the first lactation records on cows distributed across 219 and 1500 herd-year-season groups were used. SAS software and GLM procedure were used to fit the fixed models for determination of significant fixed effects on traits. The Genetic parameters were estimated based on restricted maximum likelihood method with an animal model using ASREML software. Heritability estimates for the type traits ranged from 0.033(foot angle) to 0.29(stature). The Genetic correlation among type traits and longevity ranged from 0.41(udder depth) to -0.5 (chest with) and among type traits and SCS ranged from 0.85(rear udder width) to -0.6(fore udder attachment). The negative genetic correlation among some type traits with SCS and also the positive genetic correlation among some type traits with longevity indicate that these traits can be used within a selection index program in national progeny-testing. From genetic point of view, it is concluded that cows with higher body size have a more SCS and lower longevity.

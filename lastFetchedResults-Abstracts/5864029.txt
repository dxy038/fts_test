Evaluation of Chinese handwriting character quality is an important function of computer assisted Chinese learning technology it can point out the errors in a handwritten character and make objective assessment on the writing quality of the character. However, only a few studies were reported on this new research topic in the literature. In this paper, the main target of handwriting evaluation has been presented. The common layout errors in handwriting samples are summarized and then a new layout evaluation method is proposed. The method is consisted of three parts of stroke layout evaluation, component layout evaluation and entire character shape evaluation, through the application of nine assessment rules. The experiment results show that the method is capable for detecting layout errors of handwriting samples and making objective assessment on whether a character is written good or not.

Background
Ligaments may be subjected to higher than normal loads when one of the complementary ligament restraints of a joint or the ligament itself is injured. Damage can accumulate in a ligament due to cyclic and static loading under these increased loads, but it remains unknown whether one type of loading will cause rupture faster than the other in medial collateral ligament.
Methods

The objective of this study was to compare the time and strain behaviour of normal rabbit medial collateral ligaments under static and cyclic loading over a wide range of applied stresses, with particular emphasis on time-to-rupture. Stresses were normalized to ultimate tensile strength and selected from three regions of the stress–strain curve: two linear-region stresses (60% and 30% of the ultimate tensile strength) and one stress at the transition from the toe-region to the linear-region (15% of the ultimate tensile strength).
Findings

Cyclic loading caused faster rupture than static loading at all stresses. Strain–time profiles were different in that the increase in strain (strain relative to initial strain) was greater under static than cyclic loading prior to rupture. However, steady-state strain rate (when increase in strain reaches a plateau in the secondary strain stage) was greater under cyclic than static loading.
Interpretations

These results suggest that cyclic loading is more detrimental than static loading in ligaments that are subjected to higher than normal stresses following injury of a complementary restraint or the ligament itself.

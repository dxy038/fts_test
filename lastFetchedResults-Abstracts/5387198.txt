Staff scheduling in call center has been proved to be a typical NP-Hard problem. It brings much more challenges under multi-skill. Considering the properties of the multi-skill call center, a new viewpoint of understanding multi-skill was generated. Based on the new viewpoint and a reasonable assumption, a linear integer programming model, which has acceptable computation time, was built to solve the staff scheduling problem. A numerical experiment was presented to testify the performance of the model. An objective analysis of the model was made in the end.

Objective To determine the relationship
between schizophrenia knowledge and burden of care
among caregivers of people with schizophrenia in
Mzuzu, Malawi. Method We recruited 90 patients and
90 caregivers to a randomized, controlled trial of
group caregiver education in schizophrenia. At
baseline, we administered the Family Questionnaire,
which measures caregiversâ€™ knowledge of biomedical
and psychosocial aspects of schizophrenia. We measured
caregiver burden with the Involvement Evaluation
Questionnaire. Using multivariate analysis, we
examined the relationship between knowledge and
burden, controlling for other patient and caregiver
variables. We hypothesised that knowledge and burden
would be inversely related. Results Caregiver
burden was associated with knowledge (p = 0.001),
but contrary to our hypothesis, greater knowledge
was associated with greater burden. Conclusion In this
population, knowledge about schizophrenia was
associated with higher caregiver burden. This does
not prove that knowledge causes burden, but suggests
that cultural factors may mediate the relationship
between knowledge and burden, and that care is
needed when introducing caregiver education in new
cultures.

In this paper, we present a study based on the effect of using a fuzzy find matching technique with the objective of increasing the precision of textual information retrieval for image analysis while allowing for mismatches. This technique is very helpful for searching those areas of interest where chances of misspelling are more likely, for example retrieving text information from an image. The technique we propose can be used as an embedded component or a post-processing tool for image analysis resulting in a faster retrieval of corresponding information from images with given keywords. In the case of no hits, our technique outcome would suggest few close matches that can be further searched in keywords to get a closer match with improved speed of searching.

Objective(s): To determine age-specific rubella seroprevalence in the 0 to 45 years-old unvaccinated population in Uremia, Iran and also to propose a vaccination strategy against rubella this study designed. Material & Methods: A total of 770 unvaccinated persons 0 to 45 years old were selected for the study with cluster sampling. Sera from 392 females and 378 males were tested for rubella lgG antibody using enzyme linked immonosurbent assay (ELIZA) technique. Rubella seropositivity was defined as serum rubella IgG antibody level> or = 131U/ml.
Results: Of the 770 cases, 58.1% were scropositive. Due to maternal derived antibodies, 100% of the newborns was seropositive. This figure decreased with time until it became zero in children aged 9 months. Then from years 4 increased with age gradually until it peaked at 93.4% in the age group of 15-19 years. The seropositivity decreased to 85.7% in the age group of >35 years. Of women in the reproductive age groups (15-45years old), 89.6% were seropositive.
Conclusion:. Because a substantial proportion of women in their childbearing years are susceptible to rubella, immunization efforts should be directed at infants and/or prepubertal children.

This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model for the design of a waste
management system consisting of customers, transfer stations, landfills and collection
vehicles. The developed model aims to simultaneously minimize the total costs,
greenhouse gas emissions and the rates of energy consumption. To tackle the multiple
objectives in the problem, an interactive fuzzy programming solution approach is
utilized. The model is capable of determining the location and allocation of transfer
stations as well as the selection of the waste processing technologies. The proposed
model is applied to a case problem where real data is used for long-term planning of
solid waste of Tehran city.

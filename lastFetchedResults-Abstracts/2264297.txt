Introduction: Future is unpredictable and we need futuristic strategies for planning in higher education. If universities managed in a traditional manner, they would not react to the needs of future accordingly. The objective of this study is to investigate dimensions of futuristic universities and components of such a model.
Methods: This qualitative research thematic analysis was used. We gathered data from 18 experts through exploratory interviews. The reliability coefficient was calculated by intra-subject agreement using phi coefficient.
Results: According to the exploratory interviews, and existing literature, 38 factors with a Fi coefficient over 80 percent were identified. They were classified in eight dimensions with 100 percent agreement.
Conclusion: The findings indicate that a futuristic organization and specifically, a futuristic university should be future-oriented, observant of environment, agile, multi-facet, and attentive to future values of all stakeholders. Such universities should have futuristic culture, be equipped with positive people and science oriented.

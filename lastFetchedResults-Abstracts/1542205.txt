In English and Persian literature, nature has a special place. In this article, we are trying to prove that the attitude of Wordsworth towards nature is subjective while that of Manoochehri is objective. William Wordsworth looks for conscious, ethical, mystical, spiritual concepts and meanings behind nature elements. He brings simple farmers and villagers who have been cast aside from the arena of literature to the realm of literature. On the contrary, Manoochehri is the poet of the moment, looking for sensual experience. He is like a photographer who records the events he is observing and while photographing the nature, he does not manipulate and distort them. Manoochehri deals with mere description of nature elements and concepts. He does not look for anything but emotional poetic experience. For him, raindrops, spring flowers, dew, new-year wind are all beautiful as long as the poet himself is happy and gay. The research methodology of this article is based on the descriptive â€“analytical methodology of American school of comparative parallel literature which deals with comparative studies. And the focus of this article is on the comparison of the outlook of these two poets towards nature so as to study the depth of their attitude, and consequently put forward their commonalities and differences.

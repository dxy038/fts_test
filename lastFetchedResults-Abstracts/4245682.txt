The greatest hindrance to modern astronomy is the effect of the EarthÂ´s atmosphere on incoming light. The fundamental, or lowest mode of disturbance is tip and tilt, This mode causes the focused image of a distant point source to move about in a plane (X-Y motion) as viewed from a telescope objective. Tip-tilt correction systems can be used to correct for these disturbances in real time. We propose a novel application of adaptive control to address some unique problems inherent with tip-tilt correction systems for astronomical telescopes

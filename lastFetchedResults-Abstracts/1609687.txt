The objective of this paper is to experimentally determine the efficiency and viability of the performance of an advanced trigeneration system that consists of a micro gas turbine in which the exhaust gases heat hot thermal oil to produce cooling with an air cooled absorption chiller and hot water for heating and DHW. The micro gas turbine with a net power of 28 kW produces around 60 kW of heat to drive an ammonia/water air-cooled absorption chiller with a rated capacity of 17 kW. The trigeneration system was tested in different operating conditions by varying the output power of the micro gas turbine, the ambient temperature for the absorption unit, the chilled water outlet temperature and the thermal oil inlet temperature. The modelling performance of the trigeneration system and the electrical modelling of the micro gas turbine are presented and compared with experimental results. Finally, the primary energy saving and the economic analysis show the advantages and drawbacks of this trigeneration configuration.

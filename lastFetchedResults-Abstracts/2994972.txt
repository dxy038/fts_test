Designing control systems using multiobjective genetic algorithms can lead to a substantial computational load as a result of the repeated evaluation of the multiple objectives and the population-based nature of the search. A neural network approach, based on radial basis functions, is introduced to alleviate this problem by providing computationally inexpensive estimates of objective values during the search. A straightforward example demonstrates the utility of the approach

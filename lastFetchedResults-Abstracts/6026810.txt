In this paper, we present a new method for bidirectional relighting for 3D-aided 2D face recognition under large pose and illumination changes. During subject enrollment, we build subject-specific 3D annotated models by using the subjectsÂ´ raw 3D data and 2D texture. During authentication, the probe 2D images are projected onto a normalized image space using the subject-specific 3D model in the gallery. Then, a bidirectional relighting algorithm and two similarity metrics (a view-dependent complex wavelet structural similarity and a global similarity) are employed to compare the gallery and probe. We tested our algorithms on the UHDB11 and UHDB12 databases that contain 3D data with probe images under large lighting and pose variations. The experimental results show the robustness of our approach in recognizing faces in difficult situations.

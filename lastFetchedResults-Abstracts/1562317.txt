In this paper, we consider an optimal control problem of microbial fermentation process in which glycerol is converted to 1,3-propanediol by Klebsiella pneumoniae in fed-batch culture. During the period of reaction, the variation of pH value is monitored to determine glycerol replenishment quantity, guaranteeing that microorganism can always keep growing fast under enough nutrition. Every time pH value is lower than seven, the quantity of glycerol added is such that pH value returns seven again. Glycerol is poured into reactor at discrete time instant and the quantity is controllable. The problem is to determine for each discrete time instant the glycerol quantity to add and maximize the final concentration of 1,3-propanediol. We present a controlled explicit nonlinear impulsive dynamical system of fed-batch culture with state independent vector measures as controls and study the existence, uniqueness, boundedness, continuous dependence and GÃ¢teaux differentiability of its solution with respect to controls. We then propose a multiple objective programming model and demonstrate the regularity of cost functionals and weak compactness of admissible control set. Finally we discuss the existence of optimal control and implement a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the model optimally. Computational results are presented on a numerical example.

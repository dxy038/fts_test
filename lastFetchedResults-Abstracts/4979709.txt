This paper investigates the control of the active and reactive power injected into the grid by a variable-speed wind generator. Two different control schemes are studied to achieve a decoupled control of the active and the reactive power. First of all, a classical PI controller designed by means of the pole-placement technique is investigated. Secondly, a predictive-integral controller is realised. The objective of both control schemes has been set to obtain a deadbeat system. The design of these control systems is developed in discrete time and a thorough comparison of both methods is carried out by studying their transient responses, steady states and robustness properties. Simulation results are presented to validate the main contributions of this work

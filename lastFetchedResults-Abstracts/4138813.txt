The main objective of the present study was to determine if combining the two images from a conjugate counting system might improve the contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of small lesions in all regions of the breast compared to images from a single camera. Several methods for combining the opposing pixels of the two camera images were compared: multiplication, geometric mean, and summation. The image quality metrics measured were spatial resolution, lesion contrast and lesion SNR. These quantities were evaluated both theoretically and experimentally. A capillary phantom was used to measure the spatial resolution as a function of lesion depth and to assess the translation and angular offsets between the two cameras. An acrylic box phantom, with spherical lesions suspended inside, was used to evaluate contrast and SNR as a function of lesion position. Both theoretically and experimentally the spatial resolution in the product images was superior to that in the single images, geometric mean or summation images. Relative to the single camera images, the geometric mean or the summed images, the lesion contrast and SNR of the product images were superior, irrespective of lesion depth, and were more constant with changing lesion depth compared to the single camera images. These findings suggest that improved lesion detectability is possible by imaging simultaneously from both sides of the breast, and forming a combined image using pixel-by-pixel multiplication. This may be especially important if the location of the lesion within the breast is not known <i>a priori</i>.

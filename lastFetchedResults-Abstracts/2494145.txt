In this paper we deal with a problem of three-level location-inventories with the correlated demand and Justifiability of stock out. In this model we seek to minimize the overall supply chain costs, including costs of facility location, transportation and stock. As the problems is in the field of NP-Hard two meta-heuristic algorithm including Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) is proposed. The proposed algorithms are applied to several numerical problems which indicate the better performance of the GA method with respect to SA in terms of objective function, but the SA method has a better performance in terms of computation time.

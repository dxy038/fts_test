Background: Thymus, one of the important genus of Labiatae family, have been used since ancient times as folk remedies for some medical treatments.
Objective: In this study, chemical compositions of essential oil of Thymus caucasicus were analyzed and antibacterial effects of fractions were surveyed.
Methods: Thymus caucasicus (lamiaceae) at the flowering stage were collected, from Ardabil province (No. 41and 87 at Central Herbarium of Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR). The essential oil aerial parts of T. caucasicus was collected by Hydrodistillation and Steam distillation method. The essential oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and after filtaration, stored at +40C until tested and GC/MS analyzed. Antibacterial activities of essential oil and fractions of the plant were studied by agar dilution on eight bacterial strains.
Results: In hydro and steam distillation essence of T. caucasicus, 44 and 58 compounds were identified, respectively.
In vitro antimicrobial activities showed that was positive effect against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Meticillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Conclusion: Nerolidol was major compound in hydro and steam distillation essential oil of T. caucasicus. In this study, we showed the essential oil and n- butanol fraction of T. caucasicus have lower MIC against tested microorganisms.

Air temperature, one of the main climatic elements, could he also regarded as the most important index in every geographic area. In the past few years, Azerbaijan region, located in the north-west of Iran, has experienced some meaningful variations in air temperature values. Thus, the main objective of this study is to extract all primary and secondary components of Tabriz, air temperatures, using a few simple graphical and mathematical techniques.
Having these purposes, air temperature records (from 1951 to 2000) taking from Tabriz, Synoptic Station were analyzed. In the first step. four primary descriptive parameters including: raw dal, smoothed values, moving averages and fluctuating factors have been graphically displayed. In the second stage, four secondary descriptive such as: trend, cyclic, seasonal and irregular components were calculated and modeled. Finally, the Normalized Residual Mass Curve method was applied to enhance the current temperature changes. As a whole, the results found are indicators of some meaningful variations and fluctuations in all scales over the time addressed.

It has been previously established that nutrient pollution is the gravest and most prevalent problem of ocean health. Furthermore, upstream areas and non-point sources of pollution have been found to contribute with the majority of nutrients discharged into estuaries in the United States coastal zone. However, very scattered information is available related to upstream nutrient pollution sources with impact on the Mexican coast of the Gulf of México. The objective of this paper is two-fold. One purpose is to review the information related to the impact of upstream sources of agro-industrial pollution which affect the Mexican coast of the Gulf of México. The second purpose is to discuss the need of promoting cleaner production and environmentally sound biotechnologies as part of a strategy for the pollution prevention of such agro-industrial activities. The sugar industry was found to be by far the largest upstream nutrient pollution source. Coffee, alcohol and pig production were also found to be important pollution sources. A pollution prevention strategy based on water reuse and recycling, water reduction at the source and wastewater recycling by means of cost-effective and environmentally sound biotechnologies is proposed. Such a strategy could be part of the Integrated Coastal Area Management to be implemented for the states bordering the Gulf of México.

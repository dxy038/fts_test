The main theme of this paper is to save the lives of poor fishermen who is severely punishing by the other country coastal guards. This is achieved with the help of GPS and embedded system. GPS (Global Positioning System) is increasingly being used for a wide range of applications. It provides reliable positioning, navigation, and timing services to worldwide users on a continuous basis in all weather, day and night, anywhere on or near the earth. This paper deals on the versatility and the usefulness of a GPS device in the sea. The main objective of the paper is to help the fishermen not to navigate beyond other country´s border. If a fisherman navigates beyond the country´s border, an alarm is generated indicating that the fisherman has crossed the border. Additionally, a GSM transmitter interface will send a message to base station located on the sea shore indicating that a boat has crossed the border. Thus guards in the shore can assist and provide additional help to those fishermen if needed. Keeping in mind about lives of Indian fishermen, this device has been created to help them not to move beyond the border. On the whole, it is an attempt to build a suitable device for the fishermen at a reasonably low cost.

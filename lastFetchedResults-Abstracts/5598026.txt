The research with regards to digital ecosystems emerged in the end of last century, and has developed in this century. Due to its immaturity, some fields within it are deemed to be blank. This research proposes to fill one of the blanks in the digital ecosystems research. By analyzing the issues in the current research, we propose to develop a semantic search engine, with the purpose of querying services provided by SMEs. The objective of this research is to build a reliable and trustworthy link between SMEs in the digital ecosystems environment. Relevant research methods and steps are discussed in this paper.

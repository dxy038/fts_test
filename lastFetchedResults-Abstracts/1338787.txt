We consider a generalization of the classical quadratic assignment problem, where
coordinates of locations are uncertain and only upper and lower bounds are known for
each coordinate. We develop a mixed integer linear programming model as a robust
counterpart of the proposed uncertain model. A key challenge is that, since the uncertain
model involves nonlinear objective function of the uncertain data, classical robust
optimization approaches cannot be applied directly to construct its robust counterpart. We
exploit the problem structure to develop exact solution methods and present some
computational results.

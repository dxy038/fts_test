The contradiction between environment protecting and economic development has become increasingly prominent. The land resources conservation and intensive use based on the carbon balance are a fundamental way to enhance the development of sustainability. Based on the references, the study combined the carbon balance and land suitability evaluation, and established urban agglomerations land suitability evaluation index system based on the carbon balance from the economic, ecological and social point of views, the system includes carbon source suitability evaluation and carbon sinks suitability evaluation in two aspects. Full array polygon icon indicator approach is used to study the two types of value of comprehensive evaluation of the suitability. The carbon balance suitability evaluation results show that cities suitability has significant difference. Within the region there is a big potential for coordination. Based on the suitability evaluation, the studies select multiple objective programming to optimize the allocation of the carbon emissions. Then, the carbon emission optimization limit is introduced into the urban land use structure optimization problems. The studies get the result of land use structure optimization of each city in 2020, and compared with the overall land use planning, and further strengthen the development goals of the low-carbon economy. Allocation of carbon emissions is able to achieve the goals of the low-carbon economy, and carbon balance as one of the goals of ecological civilization construction has important guiding for the land sustainable use and ecological civilization.

It has been reported that a commercial zinc gluconate preparation disrupts spermatogenesis and apparently causes permanent sterilization in male dogs, but there is little information regarding similar approaches in the male cat. The objective of this study was to evaluate zinc gluconate as a permanent contraceptive for domestic male cats. Sixteen sexually mature mixed breed cats were allocated at random, by replicate, into two groups and given a single injection into each testis of either isotonic saline or zinc gluconate, respectively. Clinical and reproductive parameters were assessed immediately before injection and after 60 and 120 days.

 120 the testis size of treated cats was decreased (P &lt; 0.05). Azoospermia occurred in 8/11 (73%) cats, and penile spines were decreased in 6/11 (55%) and absent in 4/11 (36%) cats, and there were substantial reductions in male behavior. However, plasma testosterone concentrations (single samples collected at each assessment) were not significantly different between treated and control cats at any time point. Although additional studies are warranted, intratesticular injection of zinc gluconate might have potential as a permanent contraceptive for cats.

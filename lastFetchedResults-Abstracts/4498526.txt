In this paper a realization of the self-growing networks concept is developed by means of an adaptive algorithm that facilitates capacity and energy-efficient performance. The algorithm builds on two aspects of optimisation of the self-growing concept: goal-based optimisation and network-based optimisation. The former aspect elaborates on the performance of a network controlled by multi-objective functions while the latter addresses the achievable capacity and energy savings in a heterogeneous network when the density of the pico cell network is varied. The energy savings come from switching off sets of macro and pico cells and the ability of the self-growing algorithm to determine the priorities among the objectives where performance is maximised.

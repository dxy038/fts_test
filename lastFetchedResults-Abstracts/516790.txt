Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare Teasdale's "Schematic Mental Model" and Bower's "Association Network Theory" in explanation of depressive thinking. Method: 60 students were selected based on the inclu-sion criteria and were randomly divided into three groups. By playing movies negative and positive emotions were induced in the first and second groups respectively. The third group was the control group in which no emotion was induced. Subjects were examined using Sentence Completion Task and Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS)- Perfectionism and Approval seeking sub-tests, both before and after emotion induction. Results: Findings indicated that negative (depressive) mood replaced dysfunctional schematic mental models in which individuals consider their self-worth to be dependent upon success/failure or approval/disapproval. Conclusion: Depression could be better explained by schematic mental model (Teasdale's theory) rather than increased accessibility of negative memories and schemas (Bower's theory)

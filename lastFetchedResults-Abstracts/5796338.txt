The comprehensive evaluation of satellite systems is not an easy task because of system complexity, bandwidth limitation and cost. The objective of this work is to propose an evaluation of the system in order to choose the pertinent parameters to optimize the QoS and link utilization, for the satisfaction of users and operators. First, a selection of tools to achieve this evaluation will be presented; then, appropriate scenarios will be proposed in order to determine the behavior of the network and applications. The evaluation methods presented differs depending on the targeted application (e.g. VisioConference, VoIP, data transfer...).

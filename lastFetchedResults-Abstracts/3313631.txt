The development of the modern power system has led to an increasing complexity in the study of power systems, also presents new challenges to power system stability and in particular to the aspects of transient stability and small-signal stability together called the rotor angle stability. The rotor angle stability problem involves the study of the electromechanical oscillations inherent in power systems. These low frequency oscillations can be damped by the combination of power system stabilizer(PSS) and FACTS device. The presence of more than one controller in the system will have deleterious effect on the oscillations if not coordinated properly. Hence the objective of this paper lies in the coordinated tuning of PSS with a series FACTS device called Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) to damp out the local mode of oscillations. For the design purpose, the model of power system considered is the single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system. The simulations and analysis were carried out using the PSCAD/EMTDC Software Package.

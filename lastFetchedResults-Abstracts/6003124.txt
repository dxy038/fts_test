This paper discusses the use of linear programming techniques for the design of two-channel perfect-reconstruction (PR) biorthogonal FIR filter banks with low-delay. Both the objective function and the design constraints for the PR filter banks are formulated as a set of linear equations and inequalities. The method is simple and good stop-band attenuation can be obtained. A design example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

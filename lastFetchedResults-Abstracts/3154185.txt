Goal scoring is the main objective of the robot soccer game. This paper presents strategies of shooting for robot soccer systems. Using an algorithm based on fuzzy logic, we employ an arbiter to identify the most suitable shooter in a soccer team when attacking. We also propose an algorithm based on artificial potential field to plan an appropriate path for the chosen shooter. In the games, the team based on these strategies showed significantly good performances in shooting action.

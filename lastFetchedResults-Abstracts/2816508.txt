A PID-P controller is designed for a class of nonLinear processes using Cuckoo Optimization (CO) techniqe, where a proportional controller is used in the inner feedback loop which increases the stability of the non-linear process and the PID controller is connected in feed forward path for desired response. The objective function for CO optimization includes both the Integral Time Squared Error (ITSE) and the peak overshoot. Different non-linear processes are analyzed through simulation to show the effectiveness of the CO based PID-P controller. Real time experiment on three tank conical system is also performed to illustrate the robustness of the proposed method.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess microscopic hematuria as a predictive factor for detecting bladder cancer at cystoscopy in women with irritative voiding symptoms.
Study design
We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of women with irritative voiding symptoms who presented for urodynamic testing and cystoscopy. Irritative voiding symptoms were defined as urgency, urge incontinence, frequency, dysuria, and/or nocturia. Patient demographics, risk factors for bladder cancer, presence of microscopic hematuria, urodynamic findings, and cystoscopy and biopsy results were recorded.
Results
Of 735 patients with irritative voiding symptoms, 264 (35.9%) had microscopic hematuria and 471 (64.1%) had no hematuria. Bladder cancer was detected in 3 women, for an overall detection rate of 0.4%. Microscopic hematuria, urgency, frequency, dysuria, nocturia, age, and tobacco use were not significantly associated with bladder cancer.
Conclusion
In this cohort of women with irritative voiding symptoms, microscopic hematuria was not predictive for bladder cancer.

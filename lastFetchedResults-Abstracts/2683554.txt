The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the concentration of metals, lead, nickel, iron and copper in muscle tissue of White shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis) in three regions (Qeshm, Khamir port and Laft port) in Hormozgan Province. Sampling was conducted in summer and winter 1394. After the 180- captured biometric samples, muscle tissue was isolated. The preparation and analysis of samples was performed according to standard methods MOOPAM. The results indicated that the studied concentration in muscle tissue of White shrimp at sample locations showed significant difference statistically. In terms of concentration in the muscle tissue of White shrimp in the study area between summer and winter significant difference was observed, statistically (p < 0/05). As both in summer and winter concentrations of lead, nickel, iron and copper in muscle tissue of White shrimp in Qeshm is greater than the other two regions. The studied concentration in muscle tissue of White shrimp in Qeshm, Khamir port and Laft port international standards is less than the limit which indicates that the health of aquatic ecosystems contamination is not a problem.

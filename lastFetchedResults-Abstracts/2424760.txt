In most of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) studies, constant expander efficiency is considered for a wide range of cycle operating conditions and for various working fluids. This study presents an optimized modelling approach for the ORC based on radial inflow turbine, where the constant expander efficiency is replaced by dynamic efficiency that is unique for each set of cycle operating conditions and working fluid properties. Considering the size and performance of the ORC, the model was used to identify the key input variables that have significant effects on the turbine overall size and the cycle net electric power output. These parameters were then included in the optimization process using the DIRECT algorithm to maximize the ratio of cycle net electric power output to the turbine overall size (objective function) for six organic fluids. Results showed that, dynamic efficiency approach predicted considerable differences in the turbine efficiencies of various working fluids. The maximum difference of 6.13% between the turbine efficiencies of R245fa and isobutane was predicted. Also the optimization results showed that, the maximum objective function of 0.5748 kW/mm was achieved by isobutane with the cycle net electric power output and the turbine overall size of 90.3 kW and 157.2 mm respectively. Such results are better than the other studies and highlight the potential of the optimization technique to further improve the performance and reduce the size of the ORC based on small-scale radial turbines.

This paper studies the problem of mapping streaming applications that can be modeled by a series-parallel graph, onto a 2-dimensional tiled CMP architecture. The objective of the mapping is to minimize the energy consumption, using dynamic voltage scaling techniques, while maintaining a given level of performance, reflected by the rate of processing the data streams. This mapping problem turns out to be NP-hard, but we identify simpler instances, whose optimal solution can be computed by a dynamic programming algorithm in polynomial time. Several heuristics are proposed to tackle the general problem, building upon the theoretical results. Finally, we assess the performance of the heuristics through a set of comprehensive simulations.

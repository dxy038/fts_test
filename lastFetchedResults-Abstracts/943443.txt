Abstract
Introduction: Sepsis is a critical clinical condition caused by infections and associated with a high mortality. As definite diagnosis is documented with positive culture which needs a long time, some biochemical markers have been used for the rapid diagnosis of sepsis, one of this marker is procalcitonin (PCT).
Objective: This study aimed to determine the diagnostic value of PCT in the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill neonates hospitalized in neonatal and NICU wards.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 64 hospitalized neonates in the NICU and neonatal ward were divided into two equal groups; proven and suspected sepsis. Samples for procalcitonin were checked with sepsis work up test on the first day. Upon comparison of PCT level, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of procalcitonin were determined in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Data were entered into SPSS software for analysis.
Results: In this study, there were 64 neonates with proven and suspected sepsis (34 males, 30 females) with a mean age of 11.57 days. Procalcitonin values were significantly different in the two groups (P > 0.05).
The values were not significantly different within each group separately (P > 0.05). Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of PCT obtained were: 65.6%, 71.9% and 70%, respectively. 
Conclusion: The results show that PCT can be used for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. To confirm the diagnostic value of this marker, further studies are recommended.

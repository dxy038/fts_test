This work takes place in the framework of context awareness, with a particular objective to remotely follow up the activities of elderly persons living independently in their own home. Whereas many existing systems for detecting the activity of occupant require large numbers of sensors, invasive vision systems, or extensive installation procedures, we present an approach to extract information from the electrical appliances activities in home. Furthermore, we build a unique indicator which integrates all the activity of the person. Our system was experimented during 6 months within 12 flats occupied by single elderly persons.

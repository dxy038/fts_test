This work addresses an extension in the use of Concept Maps related to Linear Time-Invariant Systems in some Engineering curricula. The original work concerned the use of Concept Maps to define the granularity of Learning Objects on this discipline. The objective was to develop reusable and shareable Learning Objects. While the work was under development, the potential of Concept Maps to examine curricula containing courses related to Linear Time-Invariant Systems became obvious. Thus the extension to curricula analysis had two goals - identify potential users of the Learning Objects and map redundancies and holes in the curricula. A by-product was an interesting outcome - the mapping of all courseware related to the topics on Linear Time-Invariant Systems available on the Maxwell System, the university Institutional Repository.

The design of a hybrid solar/wind/Biomass electrical energy supply system is presented. Power requirements for a typical Algerian isolated village and the sizing of the electrical circuit are described. Some simulation results on PV solar panels and wind turbines behavior for different temperatures and wind speeds respectively are also given. A power flow strategy is also proposed. The objective is to reduce the zero available power intervals and optimize the global system cost. The work aims to be a modest contribution to the implementation of the system.

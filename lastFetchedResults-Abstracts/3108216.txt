The problem of mixing four-dimensional (4D) equipped aircraft - aircraft equipped with on-board guidance systems that can predict and control the touchdown time of an aircraft to an accuracy of a few seconds throughout the descent - with unequipped aircraft in the terminal area has been investigated via a real-time air traffic control simulation study. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of time errors (at 120 n. mi. from touchdown) on touchdown time scheduling, and to develop efficient algorithms and procedures to null the initial time errors prior to reaching the final control sector (30 n. mi. from touchdown). Results indicate that initial random errors of up to &#194;&#177;2 min can be handled via a single speed advisory issued in the arrival control sector, and thus the time schedule is not disrupted.

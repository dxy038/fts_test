I am deeply appreciative of the honor conferred on me by the AIEE through the presentation of the Edison Medal. It is a privilege indeed to have my work adjudged as following in the great tradition of accomplishment created by Thomas Alva Edison. I regard this honor not merely as a recognition of my work as an individual. More properly, it is a measure of the impact on present-day society of television, the primary objective of many men besides myself.

The objective of this paper is to present two methods to extend the response range of laser speckle imaging (LSI). We report on the use of two methods (image exposure time control and magnetomotive actuation of exogenous contrast agents) to enhance characterization of high- and low-flow vasculature, respectively. With an exposure time of 10 and 0.01 ms, the linear response range extended to 10 and 280 mm/s, respectively. With application of an AC magnetic field to a solution of stagnant SPIO particles, an apparent increase of ~3times in speckle flow index was induced.

Summary form only given. The growing class of personal multimedia devices (camera phone, digital camera, portable desk-tops, audio- and video-based multimedia products) as well as imaging systems and multimedia communication systems, that demand real-time processing capability with low power consumption, becomes one driving factor for developing efficient video processing and compression techniques with low power consumption. Being a state-of-the-art video coding standard which offers a powerful set of coding tools to meet the demands of various applications, H.264 extends its profile and also thinks about starting a new project which may be called as &#194;&#191;H.265&#194;&#191; to meet the demands of video contents with higher resolution, higher bit depths and color sampling format. Higher compression efficiency and lower power consumption are the two major challenges for the current development in video processing and coding techniques. In this talk, a brief overview of H.264 and its extensions will first be provided with the analysis on the performance relationships among them. Some emerging possibilities for new coding techniques will be summarized. Then, video processing and compression techniques targeting the objective of real-time and low-power processing are presented for different kinds of multimedia applications like smart car, video telephony, video surveillance, high definition video broadcast and etc. Since the different kinds of applications result in diversity in video content, the techniques are designed accordingly to pursue the best trade-off between the power consumption and processing performance. Algorithms together with the hardware implementation schemes are selectively introduced with performance comparison and discussion.

It is important that how to identify the commercialization potential of emerging technology, no matter in the theory studying or the activity practicing. But there are a separateness of subjective judgment and objective fact in the conventional methodologies. This paper argues that we should propose a conceptual framework of combining the subjective perspectives and the objective perspectives. The subjective perspectives of the conceptual framework resolve the problems of judging the marketing potential, the industrialization process and the profits obtaining of the emerging technology. On the other hand, the emerging technology is from the number of related technology achievements that it is the focus of attention in internet, patents, and policies and planning, etc. so, the evaluation on the commercialization potential of emerging technology should reflect all of the attention to the objective fact. Therefore, this paper proposes the conceptual framework of meeting the requirement of combining the subjective and objective together and the main steps of this methodology are illustrated at last.

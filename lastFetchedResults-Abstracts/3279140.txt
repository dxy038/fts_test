The purpose of this paper is the regulation of water level in a photovoltaic pumping system. To reach this objective, we have developed an algorithm with Matlab / simulink which gives as result, the value of the reference speed required for vector control of induction motor taking into account the level of water in the tank and the variation of solar illumination. The string of photovoltaic pumping is simulated under matlab-Simulink.

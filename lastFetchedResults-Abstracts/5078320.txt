Discrete dynamic programming method based on the state transformation matrix is to find out the optimal operation from all possible strategies. The importance of state transition matrix, which considering the use of the reservoir operation requirements, and reverse search for a viable strategy based on the objective function, to get a optimal solution of optimization. This method can be optimized for a single station calculated, also can be optimized for cascade hydropower stations calculated. This essay took the Jinping I&amp;II reservoirs as examples, showing that the method can obtain a better solution. Satisfied with the requirements of water used for ecological purpose and hydroelectric, cascade hydropower stations can get the largest power generation efficiency by optimal operation.

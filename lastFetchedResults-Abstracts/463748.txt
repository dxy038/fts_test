OBJECTIVE: Transcervical resection of the endometrium with the use of 1.5% glycine for irrigation is associated with postoperative nausea in some patients. This could be because of hyponatremia or toxic effects of glycine and its metabolites. Moreover, 1.5% glycine is hypoosmolar, and hemolysis and fibrinolysis are possible. Changes in plasma factors related to these potential complications of transcervical resection of the endometrium were measured.
STUDY DESIGN: In 101 patients undergoing transcervical resection of the endometrium sodium, ammonium, and coagulation factors were measured preoperatively and postoperatively at intervals. In the initial 30 patients glycine and 28 other amino acids were measured at the same intervals. The results were correlated with the patients' clinical status and operative parameters.
RESULTS: Glycine and nine other amino acids and ammonia showed increased postoperative plasma levels; these changes were correlated with the absorption of the irrigating glycine solution and the development of hyponatremia. Minor activation of fibrinolysis and hemolysis was also seen.
CONCLUSION: Nausea after transcervical resection of the endometrium with 1.5% glycine for irrigation may be partly explained by toxic effects of glycine and its secondary metabolites in addition to the effects of water intoxication and hyponatremia. Minor, clinically insignificant changes in the coagulation system may also occur. Studies on alternatives to glycine for creation of near-isotonic irrigating solutions are encouraged.

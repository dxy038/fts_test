This paper is focused on a parameter which could be used for automatic and objective assessment of dysfluent speech. The measurement is based on the analysis of read audio recordings of stutterers. The designed parameter analyzes the signal in the spectral domain, which correlates with the subjective assessment of two phoniatrics experts with a coefficient of -0.789. A Bayesian change-point detector (BACD) has been used for spectral analysis. This parameter could become a part of an automatic and objective assessment system.

Aggressive technology scaling causes chip multiprocessors increasingly error-prone. Core-level fault-tolerant approaches bind two cores to implement redundant execution and error detection. However, along with more cores integrated into one chip, existing static and dynamic binding schemes suffer from the scalability problem when considering the violation effects caused by external write operations. In this paper, we present a transparent dynamic binding (TDB) mechanism to address the issue. Learning from static binding schemes, we involve the private caches to hold identical data blocks, thus we reduce the global masters-lave consistency maintenance to the scale of the private caches. With our fault-tolerant cache coherence protocol, TDB satisfies the objective of private cache consistency, therefore provides excellent scalability and flexibility. Experimental results show that, for a set of parallel workloads, the overall performance of our TDB scheme is very close to that of baseline fault-tolerant systems, outperforming dynamic core coupling by 9.2%, 10.4%, 18% and 37.1% when considering 4, 8, 16 and 32 cores respectively.

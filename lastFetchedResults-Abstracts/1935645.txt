BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nephrotoxicity due to gentamicin consumption has been attributed to reactive oxygen species. Garlic possesses antioxidant activity. This study was aimed to find out whether garlic has ameliorative effects on GM nephrotoxicity. The phenolic content and antioxidant activity of garlic were also determined.  
METHODS: Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 equal groups as follows; I: Animals were kept in the same condition as others without receiving drugs. II: The rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) 100 mg/kg of gentamicin for 10 consecutive days. Group III: Rats in this group received garlic juice 20 mg/kg i.p. for 10 days. IV: rats in this group received gentamicin for 10 days then received 20 mg/kg garlic i.p. for the next 10 days. V: Rats in this group received a combination of intraperitoneally gentamicin and garlic 20 mg/kg for 10 days. The day after this period, serum BUN and creatinine (Cr) were measured. 
FINDINGS: Gentamicin treatment increased the serum levels of Cr and BUN about three and four times (p < 0.05) and post administration of garlic after 10 days of gentamicin treatment attenuated the damage score significantly to normal level. The flavonoid level in garlic extract was 6.1±0.5 mg/g (Rutin equivalent) and phenolic level was 12.9± 0.8 mg/g (garlic acid equivalent). The antioxidant activity (The percentage of inhibition or capacity of the plant extract in prevention of peroxide production in linoleic acid) was 52.6%. 
CONCLUSION: Garlic, having phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, is effective in attenuating tubular injury induced by GM. Further studies are recommended to reduce tubular injury.

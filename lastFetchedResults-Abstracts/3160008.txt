This paper deals with reduction design of eddy current loss in interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) using response surface methodology (RSM). In order to reduce computation time, 2D analysis which based on the eddy current loss is proportional to square of flux density and frequency, is firstly applied. The peak to peak value of flux density and total harmonics distortion of flux density variation versus rotor position in PM is designated by objective functions. RSM coupled with design of experiment (DOE) is used for optimal design. The eddy current loss of optimal model is finally calculated using 3D time transient analysis and compared with the one of initial model to verify the proposed design method in this paper.

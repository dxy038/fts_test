This paper addresses when and how to adjust bandwidth allocation on uplink and downlink in a multi-service mobile wireless network under dynamic traffic load conditions. Our design objective is to improve system bandwidth utilization while satisfying call level QoS requirements of various call classes. We first develop a new threshold-based multi-service admission control scheme (DMS-AC) as the study base for bandwidth re-allocation. When the traffic load brought by some specific classes under dynamic traffic conditions in a system exceeds the control range of DMS-AC, the QoS of some call classes may not be guaranteed. In such a situation, bandwidth re-allocation process is activated and the admission control scheme will try to meet the QoS requirements under the adjusted bandwidth allocation. We explore the relationship between admission thresholds and bandwidth allocation by identifying certain constraints for verifying the feasibility of the adjusted bandwidth allocation. We conduct extensive simulation experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed bandwidth re-allocation scheme. Numerical results show that when traffic pattern with certain bandwidth asymmetry between uplink and downlink changes, the system can re-allocate the bandwidth on uplink and downlink adaptively and at the same time improve the system performance significantly.

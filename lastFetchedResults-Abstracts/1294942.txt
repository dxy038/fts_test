The paper considers solving of linear programming problems with p-order conic constraints that are related to a certain class of stochastic optimization models with risk objective or constraints. The proposed approach is based on construction of polyhedral approximations for p-order cones, and then invoking a Benders decomposition scheme that allows for efficient solving of the approximating problems. The conducted case study of portfolio optimization with p-order conic constraints demonstrates that the developed computational techniques compare favorably against a number of benchmark methods, including second-order conic programming methods.

Tibial Fracture is the most common fracture of long bones. There are different methods of treat¬ment for dealing with Tibial Fracture. However, the treatment of choice should be the one that provides for good fixation and prevents any disturbance in the process of union as well as con¬sidering preserving the range of motion in the knees and ankles. It is also important to help patients work out weight bearing problems as soon as possible. The Objective of this study was to determine the potential benefits and likelihood of complications due to the use of Intra Medul¬lary Nailed Method with limited ream for the treatment of Tibial Fracture.In a cross-sectional descriptive study during the years of 2002 to 2004, 50 patients with Tibial Fracture were operated using the method of Intra Medullary Nailed with limited ream. Then, the post-operative pain and complications were evaluated. Finally, the statistical analysis was performed using chi square and T Test by SPSS software.Among the common causes of fracture, being involved in motorcycle accidents was found to be the most common one in the age range of 17-34 years. Sixty two percent of the subjects were able to walk with the help of a crutch with complete weight bearing within one week after the operation and 92% of them were able to walk comfortably, without a crutch, after 4 months. Finally, all the patients could unify the fractures within a mean period of 6 month.Intra Medullary Nailed with limited ream is a desirable method for the treatment of Tibial Frac¬ture, especially for comminuted and segmented fractures.

Optimal pricing of public parking can improve parking management. This leads to traffic flow, thereby reduces the cost of transportation network. In this paper, the transportation network with some origins, destinations, and public parking was considered. In the network, private cars drivers depending on travel time between origin and parking (driving time), travel time between parking and destination (walking time) and parking (price) cost, behave in a way to minimize the costs. The objective function is minimizing the network cost with regard to the equilibrium behavior of private vehicle drivers. As a result, optimalprices for each parking is determined. Modeling for the central region of Isfahan with 6 origins, 5 destinations and 18 public parking were conducted. Based on the results of modeling, Prices range from 1,000 to 10,000 rails was obtained that Farshadi Parking has the highest price. The next results of this study is determining the parking optimal amount and determining the parking optimal flow.

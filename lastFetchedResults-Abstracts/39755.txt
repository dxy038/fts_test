Blast furnace (BF) slag is a by-product of steel plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate experimental methods to determine the phosphorus sorption capacity of BF slag. The handling of BF slag, before usage and clogging were also considered, as well as estimating the phosphorus retention capacity. Agitation and pilot-scale experiments were performed using both wastewater and phosphate solutions. This investigation showed that sorption capacities derived by wastewater experiments were considerably lower compared to those by phosphate solutions. Fresh BF slag briefly exposed to rainfall had a higher phosphorus sorption than weathered BF slag, indicating the importance of handling the slag carefully before usage. The risk for leakage of sulfuric compounds is considerable, especially during the initial operation phase of BF slag filters. Locations of BF slag filter beds for wastewater treatment must be carefully chosen from an environmental point of view.

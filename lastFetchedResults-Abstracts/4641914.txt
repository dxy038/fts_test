Pedagogical Agents are intelligent agents supporting learning in virtual learning environments, VLE. The use of the multi-agent society model inhabited with intelligent virtual agents has shown to provide several benefits to learning. This paper reviews intelligent agents for learning and shows their educational value while demonstrating the new learning possibilities supported by them. Towards the objective of efficiently utilizing the agents in a distributed learning platform, the paper provides an evaluation of intelligent agent development frameworks. This evaluation will provide valuable information to those employing and integrating intelligent agents for different types of VLE with a view towards creating new learning scenarios.

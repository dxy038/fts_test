Development of forestation land use based on actual and potential capability of land in addition to economic and recreational benefits can be useful to preserve natural resources. Objective of this study is to evaluate land capability across Gheshlagh dam watershed area in Kurdistan province, western Iran (in 2011) to develop forestation land use for conservation purpose and increasing biological capability of the ecosystems in this region. At first, effective environmental criteria for land evaluation to develop forestation land use were clarified based on opinions of the experts and documented references. Then, requisite data were collected through field survey and using accessible information. Next, mapping, analysis and overlapping of the collected data were conducted through application of integrated GIS and fuzzy screening method. After that, map of land capability evaluation, to develop forestation land use, was provided by two classes including developed and non developed parts, whereas the final classified map of developed parts was obtained. The results showed that during the fuzzy screening method the land can only be evaluated by two classes, including developed and non developed parts for a single land use type and this method is incapable of classifying final environmental units. Also according to the obtained results capability classes for very suitable, suitable, moderately suitable, less suitable, much less suitable and non developed parts for forestation land use contained 5, 20, 24, 14, 6, and 31 percent of the study area, respectively.

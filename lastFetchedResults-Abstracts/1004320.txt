A study of the ac electrical transport properties of a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A-based epoxy resin (DGEBA) polymerized with a diethylene triamine (DETA) and reinforced with single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is presented. The main objective is the investigation of the particular electrical behavior of the conductive filler in the composite and the development of new nanocomposite materials based on epoxy resins with controlled structural and electrical properties. The structural and electrical characterization of the SWNTâ€“DGEBA/DETA hybrid system, performed by differential scanning calorimetry, Raman and ac impedance spectroscopy show interesting effects, including the particular interaction between the polymer and nanotubes, the tendency of the nanotube structure to increase the rate of reaction and substantial effects of the nanotube bundle conformation, dependent on matrix intercalation, on the dielectric behavior of the composite.

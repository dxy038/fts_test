This paper presents a novel optimization approach to combined economic and emission dispatch (CEED) problem using artificial immune system (AIS). The approach utilizes the clonal selection principle and evolutionary approach wherein cloning of antibodies is performed followed by hyper mutation. The developed AIS optimization technique uses the total operating cost as the objective function and is represented as the affinity measure. Through genetic evolution, the antibodies with high affinity measure are produced and the best individuals become the solution. The proposed algorithm has been tested with three and six-unit systems and the results are compared with other prevalent approaches. The simulation results reveal that the developed technique is easy to implement, has converged within an acceptable execution time and yields highly optimal solution for CEED problem with minimum total operating cost and minimum emission.

In this paper, a novel bidirectional DC-DC converter using improved ZVT method is proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional bidirectional DC-DC converter using general PWM methods and resonance. In order to achieve ZVT operation, auxiliary circuit is added to the conventional topology. The added auxiliary circuit consists of one inductor and two capacitors, two switches for bidirectional operation and resonant circuit. In fact, the structure of the ZVT, the auxiliary switch is turned off hard switching. But, because the main switch is turn-on and turn-off with ZVS that decrease losses. Also, Main diode is a big advantage without reverse recovery phenomenon. In this paper, the operational characteristic of the topology is analyzed, and simulation and experiment are performed to verify the validity of the topology.

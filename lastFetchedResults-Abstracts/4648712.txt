This paper proposes a specific CAD model architecture and a specific design method based on a functional analysis in order to reduce the time dedicated to routine engineering. This method is directly integrated into our ACSP PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) system in order to work in a worldwide and collaborative design environment. The main objective of our methodology is to define the CAD model geometry according to the modifications and the functional requirements. In order to obtain this control, we are able to identify functional parameters and functional rules through the functional requirements and we are also able to extract the specific parameters and the specific rules from the older CAD models stored in the PDM (Product Data Management) system of the previous, validated project. Our method explains how to obtain and to link the different kinds of parameters and rules. It defines also a specific architecture in order to perform and to build the foundation of a knowledge based engineering methodology.

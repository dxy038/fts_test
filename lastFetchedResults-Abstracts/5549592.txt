For the underwater degenerative image, atmospheric turbulence model is utilized to construct the restoration model. By computing the underwater image quality function which is used to estimate the adaptive degradation model parameter, underwater image is restored through Wiener filters. The connection between camera-altitude and model parameter in typical water is analyzed as well. The experiments show that the proposed method has a better improvement on contrast and definition of underwater image than other common preprocessing methods and is especially suitable for further degradation model analysis and objective detection.

This work presents the theoretical design and the experimental validation of a real time optimisation logic for distributed parameter systems. This logic consists of a hierarchy of two layers. The upper layer is responsible of obtaining the optimal control profile by a suitable combination of the control vector parameterisation approach with a hybrid global-local optimiser and the use of reduced models for distributed parameter systems. The lower layer corresponds to a PID controller designed in the framework of Internal Model Control to keep tracking capabilities at short time scales. This logic was applied to the real time optimisation of the thermal processing of packaged foods in batch retorts at the pilot plant available at the IIM-CSIC. The objective was to maximise food product quality while satisfying safety constraints. The proposed scheme was able to optimally operate the system under standard plant perturbations and under a pressure drop.

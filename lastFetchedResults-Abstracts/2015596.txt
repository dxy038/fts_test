One objective of the Third Industrial Fluid-Properties Simulation Challenge was the extrapolation of mixture phase equilibrium information obtained from one isotherm to other temperatures. In this work, we present modeling results for the vaporâ€“liquid equilibrium of the ethanol/1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFC-227ea) mixture obtained with the PC-SAFT equation of state. The required pure-component parameters were determined by fitting pure-component vapor pressures and liquid density data. To get a quantitative description of the mixture, a temperature-independent binary interaction parameter was adjusted to experimental bubble-point data at 283.17 K. Using these parameters, bubble-point pressures at T = 343.13 K were predicted for different concentrations.

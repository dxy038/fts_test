The 3D (3 dimensional) video technologies are emerging to provide more immersive media content compared to conventional 2D (2Dimensional) video applications. In this paper we propose a joint source channel coding scheme (JSCC) for colour and depth based 3D video coding using subjective quality of 3D video. We considered different source and channel coding rates to find the optimum JSCC scheme under a given channel bit rate for a WiMAX based communication channel. More often 3D video quality is measured using rigorous and time-consuming subjective evaluation test campaigns. Hence this paper further extends the above study to investigate the relationship between perceptual attributes of 3D video and overall 3D quality and the correlation of these perceptual attributes with several objective quality measures for 3D video content. The results show that, Gaussian and linear polynomial mathematical models can be used to approximate the relationship between depth perception and image quality with overall 3D quality. Also results implies that, VQM and SSIM quality measures of individual left and right views can be effectively used in predicting the image quality and depth perception of 3D video respectively.

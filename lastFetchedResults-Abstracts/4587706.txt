3D video quality evaluation received much attention from researchers due to the demand from the industry and to the complex nature of true 3D video perception. The availability of public 3D video databases provides an opportunity for researchers and developers to evaluate novel objective 3D video quality evaluation metrics. In this paper, a stereoscopic 3D video database for the evaluation of visual quality assessment metrics is described. The effects of random packet losses on the overall 3D perception (i.e., distortions due to different packet loss rates) are considered in this research. The database presented here contains 54 test stimuli from 9 reference test video sequences corresponding to 6 different packet loss rates, including the uncorrupted 3D video sequence. In order to obtain true 3D video perception, about 1730 individual human quality observations (Opinion Scores (OS) of subjects) are considered for this database. The obtained Differential Mean Opinion Scores (DMOS) can be effectively used for evaluating 3D video quality metrics, as well as for designing new 3D video quality evaluation methods. Together with DMOS values, we provide the corresponding objective quality measurements using several objective quality metrics. The designed 3D video database will be freely available for download and use in scientific research.

The ability to cope with dynamic bandwidth demands will be a particularly important asset for Quality of Service provisioning in networks carrying bandwidth hungry applications. This paper introduces a novel approach based on multi-objective optimization with fuzzy constraints for dynamic bandwidth allocation. This new approach deals with uncertain bandwidth demands more efficiently than an approach based on Classical Optimization Theory and yet supports Quality of Service commitments.

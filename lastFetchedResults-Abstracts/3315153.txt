Forest vehicle routing is an important step in optimization of forest transportation system to minimize the total cost. To perform this work, we propose a mathematical model and use a reactive tabu search metaheuristic approach. The objective is to minimize the total cost by respecting the time window of all customers which is sometimes important in this field. Finally, the experimental results obtained with the reactive tabu search metaheuristic approach of the named vehicle routing problem is showed, and compared to its extended great deluge results.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the method which can assess accurately and efficiently the effects of excitation systems on transient stability of power systems. At first, critical fault clearing time functions CCT(W:load) are defined by taking notice of the fact that transient stability is mainly controlled by fault clearing time and load. Next, the method to be enable to assess accurately and efficiently the effects of excitation systems on transient stability has been newly developed by using the above functions. Finally, it has been applied to the effect assessment in the occurrence of a three- phase fault in a model power system. Results of application have been clarified the effectiveness of the developed method.

Hard alloys are normally used as materials for excavators teeth in mining industry. In most cases these alloys do not have enough anti-wear properties and coatings are employed as a good alternative. The objective of this work is to test the abrasive wear resistance of several cast irons alloyed with different elements. Laboratory tests based on the ASTM G105-89 standard were compared to tests carried out under real working conditions of excavator teeth in mines.

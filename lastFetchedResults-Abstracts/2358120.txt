Objective
Increasing use of methadone in withdrawal programs has increased methadone
poisoning in children. This research aimed to study the causes of incidence of
poisoning in children and its side-effects.
Materials & Methods
In this research, The hospital records of all methadone-poisoned children
referred to Hamadan’s Be’sat Hospital from June 2007 to March 2013, were
studied. Children with a definite history of methadone use or proven existence
of methadone in their urine, were studied.
Results
During 5 years, 62 children with the mean age of 53.24±29.50 months were
hospitalized due to methadone use. There was a significant relationship between
delayed referral to hospital and increased bradypnea. According to their history,
25.8% and 58.1% of the children had been poisoned by methadone tablet and
syrup, respectively. The most common initial complaint expressed by parents,
was decreased consciousness (85.5%). During the initial examination, decreased
consciousness, meiosis, and respiratory depression were observed in 91.9%,
82.3%, and 69.4% of the cases, respectively. Nine patients required mechanical
ventilation. There was a significant relationship between the need for mechanical
ventilation and seizure with initial symptom of emesis. There were two cases of
death (3.2%), both of which were secondary to prolonged hypoxia and brain
death. There was a significant relationship between poor patient prognosis
(death) and presence of cyanosis in early symptoms, seizure, hypotension,
duration of decreased consciousness, and duration of mechanical ventilation.
Conclusion
This research indicated that the occurrence of seizure, hypotension, and cyanosis
in the early stages of poisoning is associated with an increased risk of sideeffects
and death and are serious warning signs. Early diagnosis and intervention
can improve outcomes of methadone-poisoned children.

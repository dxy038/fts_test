This paper gives an analysis of how intelligent control can be used to provide a viable solution in the development of a control system for a reconfigurable machine tool (RMT). Firstly, the principle of RMT is briefly explained and the challenges that hinder their development are inspected in order to bring forward the gap to be addressed by this paper. The objective in this paper is to look at the work that has been done by other scholars in the field of control and then integrating the knowledge from these in developing an open architecture (OA) based intelligent control system suitable for the RMT. The key focus areas in this paper are the analysis of commonly used controllers in industrial applications and the benefits of using open architecture control (OAC). Lastly a proposal on how the fuzzy-PID controller can be used in an OAC system for the RMT is given.

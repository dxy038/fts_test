Most traditional recommender systems focus on the objective of improving the accuracy of recommendations in a single domain. However, preferences of users may extend over multiple domains, especially in the Web where users often have browsing preferences that span across different sites, while being unaware of relevant resources on other sites. This work tackles the problem of recommending resources from various domains by exploiting the semantic content of these resources in combination with patterns of user browsing behavior. We overcome the lack of overlaps between domains by deriving connections based on the explored semantic content of Web resources. We present an approach that applies Support Vector Machines for learning the relevance of resources and predicting which ones are the most relevant to recommend to a user, given that the user is currently viewing a certain page. In real-world datasets of semantically-enriched logs of user browsing behavior at multiple Web sites, we study the impact of structure in generating accurate recommendations and conduct experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

A first order predicate calculus for the representation of mathematical optimization models is developed. It is shown that the relational scheme of a database can be inferred from the algebraic representation of the optimization models. More importantly, it is shown that the indices for an iterated operator can be inferred. This inference results in the reduction of syntactical burden on users of systems which will be based on this model. Assuming a relational representation of data, a relational model for the expression of constraints and objective functions of the optimization models is introduced

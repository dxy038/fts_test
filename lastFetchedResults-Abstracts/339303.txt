Objective
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) raise high hopes in clinical applications. However, the lack of common standards and a precise definition of MSC preparations remains a major obstacle in research and application of MSC. Whereas surface antigen markers have failed to precisely define this population, a combination of proteomic data and microarray data provides a new dimension for the definition of MSC preparations.
Methods

In our continuing effort to characterize MSC, we have analyzed the differential transcriptome and proteome expression profiles of MSC preparations isolated from human bone marrow under two different expansion media (BM-MSC-M1 and BM-MSC-M2).
Results

In proteomics, 136 protein spots were unambiguously identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and corresponding cDNA spots were selected on our “Human Transcriptome cDNA Microarray.” Combination of datasets revealed a correlation in differential gene expression and protein expression of BM-MSC-M1 vs BM-MSC-M2. Genes involved in metabolism were more highly expressed in BM-MSC-M1, whereas genes involved in development, morphogenesis, extracellular matrix, and differentiation were more highly expressed in BM-MSC-M2. Interchanging culture conditions for 8 days revealed that differential expression was retained in several genes whereas it was altered in others.
Conclusion

Our results have provided evidence that homogeneous BM-MSC preparations can reproducibly be isolated under standardized conditions, whereas culture conditions exert a prominent impact on transcriptome, proteome, and cellular organization of BM-MSC.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the method which can assess accurately and efficiently the effects of control systems for turbo-generators on transient stability of power systems. At first, critical fault clearing time functions CCT(W:load) are defined by taking notice of the fact that transient stability is mainly controlled by fault clearing time and load. Next, the method which can assess accurately and efficiently the effects of control systems on transient stability has been newly developed by using the above functions. Finally, it has been applied to the effect assessment of control systems in the occurrence of faults in two model power systems with 5 and 3 generators. Results of application have clarified the effectiveness of the developed method.

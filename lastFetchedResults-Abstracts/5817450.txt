In this paper we present a control strategy for tracking-interception of moving objects using wheeled mobile robots. This method makes use of geometric rules combined with the kinematics equations. The objective of the control strategy is to put the robot in a rendezvous course with the target. This is accomplished by keeping the robot in the line joining the target and a reference point. The control algorithm is illustrated using simulation, where two examples are considered.

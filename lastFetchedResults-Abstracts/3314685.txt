First responder applications often require safety surveillance using wireless camera networks [1]. To ensure visual sensing coverage, it is crucial to place optical sensor nodes at proper locations. Under the scenario of energy constrained wireless camera deployment, the issue of communication cost should also be considered. Previous camera deployment research (e.g Art Gallery Problem) mainly concerned sensing coverage. One well-known solution for the art gallery problem is to triangulate the objective polygon and then select vertices to ensure full coverage. However, deploying cameras only in the vertices of polygon may induce inefficiency both in number of necessary cameras and overall communication cost. To reduce the cost, we propose two deployment algorithms: 1) connected visibility region planning algorithm for static deployment given the floor plan is known, and 2) connected visibility region tracking algorithm for the dynamic deployment during the run time. In extensive simulations with real floor plans, our algorithms outperform previous solutions significantly.

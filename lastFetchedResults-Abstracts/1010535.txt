The objective of this work relates to the reduction of the CO2 emissions of a vehicle with a global thermal optimization approach where the optimization criterion is based on exergy analysis. A numerical model gathering, under the same simulation environment, the models of the power train, the cooling circuit and the thermal behavior of the engine was developed to predict the energy interactions between the systems. The simulation tool is of modular technological level and based on the bond graph concept. A bond graph is a graphical representation of a physical dynamic system. This tool provides a comprehensive graphical user interface allowing future extensions. The simulations carried out in transient mode make it possible to evaluate the performance of various solutions for the thermal management of the vehicle.

A floating-gate current-output analog memory is implemented in a 0.13-&#956;m digital CMOS process. The proposed memory cell achieves random-accessible and bidirectional updates with a sigmoid update rule. A novel writing scheme is proposed to obtain tunneling selectivity without on-chip highvoltage switches or charge pumps, and reduces interconnections and pin count. Parameters of empirical models for floating gate charge modification are extracted from measurements. Measurement and simulation results show that the proposed memory consumes 45 nW of power, has a 7-bit programming resolution, 53.8 dB dynamic range and 86.5 dB writing isolation.

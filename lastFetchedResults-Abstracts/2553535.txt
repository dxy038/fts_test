Background and Objective: Accurate working length determination of root canal is always considered by dentists. Radiographic techniques that commonly used in root canal therapy are periapical conventional techniques, but digital radiography has been of great interest in recent decades. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of conventional and digital radiography in measuring the working length of the canal. 
Materials and Methods: This experimental in vitro study conducted on 58 individuals molar teeth of the maxilla. After selecting the teeth, mounting in acryl, cavity preparation and inserting k-file number 15 in the canal, conventional and digital periapical (PSP) radiography has been taken of teeth. Then, the values of the working length of the canal which were obtained from three methods, digital radiography, conventional radiography and real values were compared. Data analyses were performed using SPSS Ver.19.
Results: A significant difference was found between the working length which is measured by conventional method and the real working length (p  <  0.0001); But, there was no significant difference between the working length measured by digital radiography and the real working length (p  >  0.124). Also, there was a significant difference between the working lengths measured by conventional radiography versus digital radiography (p  <  0.0001).
Conclusion: Digital radiography had greater accuracy in estimating the working length of the canal versus conventional radiography.

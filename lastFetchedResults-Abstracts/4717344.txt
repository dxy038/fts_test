Our research objective is to realize sensor based navigation by car-like mobile robots. The generalized Voronoi graph (GVG) can describe a mobile robot´s path for sensor based navigation from the point of view of completeness and safety. However, it is impossible to apply the path to a car-like mobile robot directly, because limitation of the minimum turning radius prevents following the non-smooth GVG. To solve the problem, we propose a local smooth path planning algorithm for car-like mobile robots. Basically, an initial path is generated by a conventional path planning algorithm using GVG theory, and it is deformed smoothly to enable car-like robots´ following by maximizing an evaluation function proposed in the paper. The key topics are: definition of our evaluation function; and how to modify the GVG. We introduce a local smooth path planning algorithm based on the GVG, and explain a detail of the evaluation function. Simulation results support validity of the algorithm

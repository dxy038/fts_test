The objective of this study was to determine the effect of mannan oligosaccharides derived from the outer cell wall of a select strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bio-Mos, Alltech Inc, USA) on mucus production, selected mucus immune parameters activity, gut morphology and in vivo and ex vivo gut bacterial translocation for European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Specimens were fed 4 g kg−1 dietary MOS level of inclusion in a commercial sea bass diet for eight weeks. At the end of this period, anterior gut mucosal folds height, width and folds surface area were increased by MOS supplementation (P &lt; 0.05, n = 240). Posterior gut presented shorter folds (P &lt; 0.05, n = 240) but wider that those fed control diet (P &lt; 0.05, n = 240) resulting in increased total surface area (P &lt; 0.05, n = 240). For rectum, feeding MOS reduced fold length (P &lt; 0.05, n = 240). Gut morphological analyses showed an enhancement in the number of cells secreting acid mucins by area unit, higher density of eosinophilic granulocytes (ECGs) in the mucosa for fish fed MOS together with an improvement in gut mucus lysozyme activity which could be related to the reduced in vivo and ex vivo gut bacterial translocation found. No differences were found for the skin mucus immune parameters evaluated.

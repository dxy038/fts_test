Warm mix recycled asphalt with bitumen emulsion is a technique still in development, which has proved to be very promising, both in economic and environmental terms.

echnology allows recycling at a lower temperature, increases the amount of recycled materials and thus, saves energy and reduces CO2 emissions. It allows to leverage existing raw materials on the degraded pavement and to reduce energy costs in the manufacture of the new mixture. The laboratory study was conducted to analyse the applicability of different design methods to be used with warm mix recycled asphalt, such as Marshall test, immersion compression test, evaluating of water sensitivity and stiffness modulus test. The objective of this paper is to contribute towards defining and developing a design method of such mixtures taking into account the heterogeneity of the recycled asphalt pavement (RAP).

The oil pollution is all unavoidable result or rapid increase in world population ant!
indusuiulization. lbe objective otrcscarch was to study barley, alfalfa and clover ability
in reducing the urnount of diesel fuel in contaminated soils. Barley. alfalfa and clover
\\'i.TO: planted in pots .... uh contaminated soils by diesel fuel ut 0,25, 100,500,3000 and
40000 ppm (rug-kg) concentration and one lrculm-':f!l was to control without any plant.
Aller J 20 days the concentration or residual pollutant were measured by Gas
Chromatograph. Based on the results obtained, the average percentage of decrease in the
level of the pollutant was 86%, for harley. ~I~'o tor alfulfu and 80% tor clover and tor
control pot (without plant) was 75;);;). Basically, the primary amounts of pollutant affect
plant ability to decrease diesel ful'! contamination. Il was distinguished lor dry mass
production. In general, barley W"lS more effective in phytoremediation than alfalfa and
clover, due to its scattering root system.

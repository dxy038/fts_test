Objective
Two single-base polymorphisms of the tumor necrosis factor-α gene (TNF-α) at positions −863 and −308 are associated with variation in production of TNF-α (TNF-α). TNF-α genotypes were tested for association with adverse outcomes in mother-infant pairs with preterm labor.
Study design
We analyzed a cohort of 118 mother-infant pairs with preterm labor before 34 weeks' gestation. Polymerase chain reaction was used on extracted deoxyribonucleic acid for polymorphism assay. Outcomes included amniotic fluid TNF-α concentration, histologic chorioamnionitis, delivery gestational age, and composite neonatal morbidity. Statistical significance was determined by χ2and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance.
Results
Mothers homozygous for the −863 polymorphism (AA) had significantly earlier deliveries (P = .02), more chorioamnionitis (P = .03), and greater composite neonatal morbidity (P = .03). Neither maternal nor fetal carriage of the −308 polymorphism was associated with adverse outcome.
Conclusion
In women with preterm labor before 34 weeks' gestation, maternal homozygous carriage of the −863 polymorphism may be associated with preterm delivery and adverse neonatal outcome.

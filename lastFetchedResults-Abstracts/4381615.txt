This paper presents a speech enhancement approach, where an adaptive threshold is statistically determined based on Student t Modeling of Teager energy (TE) operated perceptual wavelet packet (PWP) coefficients of noisy speech. In order to obtain an enhanced speech, the threshold thus derived is applied upon the PWP coefficients by employing a Student t pdf dependent custom thresholding function, which is designed based on a combination of modified hard and semisoft thresholding functions. Extensive simulations are carried out using the NOIZEUS database to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for car and multi-talker babble noise corrupted speech signals. Several standard objective measures and subjective evaluations including formal listening tests show that the proposed method outperforms some of the state-of-the-art speech enhancement methods at high as well as low levels of SNRs.

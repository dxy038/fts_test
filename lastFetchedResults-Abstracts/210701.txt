OBJECTIVE: To document the outcomes of open mesh repair in the management of various
hernias.
STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive case-series study.
SAMPLING TECHNIQUE: Non-probability purposive.
PLACE & DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Surgery, Unit-I Chandka Medical College Hospital, Larkana, from July 2003 to June 2008.
PATIENTS & METHODS: Two hundred and eighty patients of hernia operated by sublay mesh repair were analyzed for postoperative outcomes as pain, surgical site infection, haematoma/ seroma, sinus formation and recurrence. Data were collected by filling specially designed proforma for each patient. Follow up visits were scheduled at three weeks, six weeks, three months and six months postoperatively.
RESULTS: Polypropylene sublay mesh repair was performed in 280 patients of hernia comprising of 174 males and 106 females with male to female ratio of 1.6:1. Age ranged from 20 to 78 years, mean 51 years. Inguinoscrotal hernia was the commonest type (52.5%), followed by paraumbilical hernia (26.25%) and incisional hernia (13%). Postoperatively 254 (91%) patients had uneventful recovery, 15 (5.3%) had surgical site infection, while 11 (3.9%) patients developed seroma. Neither recurrence nor chronic discharging sinus were noted.
CONCLUSION: Open mesh repair for hernia is a safe and effective technique, associated with low morbidity. Technique has proved to be simple and easy to perform, with minimal postoperative pain and early mobilization.

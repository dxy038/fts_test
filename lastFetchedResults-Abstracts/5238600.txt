Model to minimize the objective function of the annual reduced cost with the constraints of hydraulic conditions in annular pipe water supply engineering is given in this paper and the genetic algorithm is applied to the actual question. The quick velocity update strategy of particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to modify the GApsilas evolutionary strategy. The advanced algorithm is tested on engineering projects and compared with basic GA. The good adaptability, validity and stability performance are fully shown by the result.

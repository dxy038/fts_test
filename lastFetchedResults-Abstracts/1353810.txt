  Sarcoidosis is a multisystem noncaseating granulomatous disease with a propensity for lung, eye, and skin which recently have been proposed that mycobacterium tuberculosis may contribute in its pathogenesis, and rarely involves central nervous system (CNS). Despite CD4+ lymphocytopenia, sarcoidosis by itself does not increase risk of opportunistic infections other than cryptococcosis. Nonetheless, simultaneous association of CNS cryptococcosis and tuberculosis infection remains extremely rare event in immunocompetent states, and has not been reported in sarcoidosis yet. We here presented such a case in a 42 years old man, a known case of sarcoidosis with diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties were encountered in a fourteen-month-long hospitaliza-tion period.

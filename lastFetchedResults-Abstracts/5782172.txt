The vertical integration within the system-in-package (SiP) approach is becoming more and more important. While system-on-ohip (SoC) and PCB design teams are operating with highly developed EDA tools, there is a lack of automation tools for the design of SiP. This is particularly true for the engineering of so called 2.5D SiP, which integrate heterogeneous components (ICÂ´s, passives etc.) over several vertical layers/modules. For these systems component placement today is a time consuming task. Even more important is the lack of a tool support for technology selection. This paper presents a new method for component autoplacement for folded and stacked 2.5D SiP integrated with technology selection on an objective basis. We propose a design approach that is based on the simultaneous consideration of numerous layout solutions. We discuss the structuring of physical design, present a novel modeling of technological components for folded and stacked 2.5D SiP, and sketch algorithms for technology constrained automated placement, based on multicriteria optimization. Together with a multicriteria decision support tool this results in a novel design approach for 2.5D SiP.

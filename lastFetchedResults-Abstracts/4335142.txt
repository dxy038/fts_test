Image quality assessment is an important issue addressed in various image processing applications such as image/video compression and image reconstruction. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) with the L<sup>2</sup>-metric is commonly used in objective image quality assessment. However, the measure does not agree very well with human visual perception in many cases. In this paper, a fuzzy image metric (FIM) is defined based on M. SugenoÂ´s (1974) fuzzy integral. This new objective image metric, which is to some extent a proper evaluation from the viewpoint of the judgement procedure, is closely approximates the subjective mean opinion score (MOS) with a correlation coefficient of about 0.94, as compared to 0.82 obtained using PSNR.

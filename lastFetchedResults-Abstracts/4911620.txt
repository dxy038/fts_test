This paper proposes an efficient method for the design of two-channel, quadrature mirror filter (QMF) bank using polyphase components. The design problem is formulated to minimize an objective function, which is a linear combination of pass-band error and stop-band residual energy of the low-pass analysis filter of the filter bank. Unlike the other techniques which involves linear and non linear optimization, our formulation reduces the design equation to an eigenvector problem. An objective function that minimizes the stop-band energy and square error of the distortion transfer function uses the polyphase components and optimization is done using the power method. Simulation results of the algorithm shows the improved performance of the proposed method. Polyphase decomposition results dramatic computational efficiency and reduces number of iterations.

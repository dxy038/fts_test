Structural optimization of an yttria crucible was considered, with the objective of developing a ceramic crucible for melting TiAl alloy. By optimizing the types and sizes of coarse and fine yttria raw material powders, together with the ratio thereof, it was possible to develop an improved type porous crucible with almost no separation of raw material powders. In comparison with other yttria crucible with various structures, it was confirmed that the developed improved type porous crucible allowed the greatest number of usage repetitions for induction melting of TiAl alloy, and that the resulting TiAl alloy ingots had the lowest amount of inclusions.

Communication performance comparisons, in terms of message latency, between mesh and hierarchical ring interconnection networks for shared-memory multiprocessors are developed. Traffic in the networks is assumed to consist of the short, fixed-length messages needed for remote-memory read/write operations and cache coherency control. Square-mesh networks with bidirectional links and no end-around connections are compared to two- and three-level hierarchical rings. Wormhole routing is used in the meshes, with messages consisting of / flits, with each flit containing b bits. In the ring networks, each ring segment can contain a complete message of f &#215; b bits. Meshes and three-level rings provide comparable delays for system sizes of up to 200 or 300 processor clusters. The delay comparisons are valid only for the lightly loaded traffic case in which contention and blocking are low. This is the situation in practical shared-memory multiprocessor systems with a low cache miss rate and a high physical locality of reference in the global address space.

The main objective of this paper is to increase the efficiency of the multi-junction solar cell. In general, the efficiency of the multi-junction solar cell depends upon various design parameters such as material type, thickness of the layers, doping concentration, type of texturing and thickness of anti-reflective coating. The performances of the solar cells are determined by using one-dimensional solar cell simulation software PC1D. Batch mode of PC1D allows to rapidly performing optimization study for a particular parameter rather than varying the parameters frequently. In batch mode, for each input parameter, the range to be varied over, the number of different values and type of variations (logarithmically or linearly) are to be specified. The efficiency is observed under one-sun, AM1.5 solar radiation, and constant intensity of 0.1 w/cm<sup>2</sup>.

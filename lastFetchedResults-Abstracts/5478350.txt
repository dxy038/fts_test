Without the ground truth image, there is no proper objective method to evaluate sprite generation. In this paper, we propose several complex camera motion patterns to generate synthetic video from original images. Our camera motion patterns include rotation, affine, and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) transformations. In addition, they also include combined patterns. Subsequently, we applied sprite generation to the synthetic videos. Objective evaluation is performed by comparing the ground truth image and sprite based on peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and size. Pattern algebra file is also provided for estimating the accuracy of sprite generation with respect to global motion parameters. Our result indicates that frame PSNR, picture PSNR, size, ground truth image, and pattern algebra file are good indicators of sprite quality.

The aim was to develop an objective and reproducible 3D organ segmentation using both SPECT and MR images. The method used mathematical morphology technics. We applied this method : 1-for renal volume quatification using in-vivo 99<sup>m</sup> Tc-DMSA SPECT imaging; 2-for myocardial defects quantification and left ventricular myocardium long axis detection (for automatic rest and stress images superposition) using thallium-201 SPECT imaging; 3-for MR images of phantom, the aim being to estimate the putamen nucleus volume. The two main advantages of our method are : simple and operator independent.

The mobile user objective system (MUOS) will be the successor to the NavyÂ´s UFO satellite communications system. One MUOS proposal relies on a constellation of GEO spacecraft that uses non-processing repeaters and multiple spotbeams for worldwide Earth-coverage. UHF frequency reuse greatly increases the number of narrowband voice/data channels available to mobile units. A key design element is the large antenna reflector with an area of 1250 square meters

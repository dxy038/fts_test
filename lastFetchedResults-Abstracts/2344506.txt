Background & Objective: A growing body of literature suggests that healthy and well-nourished women can safely participate in most forms of physical activity during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to determine the performance of pregnant women about exercise during pregnancy in Tehran.

Methods: we performed an analytical cross-sectional study on 400 pregnant women referred to prenatal care units in Imam Khomeini hospital. Information was obtained through a questionnaire designed to measure practice. Data analysis was performed by the Spss v 13.5 software package. We calculated means and standard deviation for practice in terms of independent variable and applied ANOVA test and regression model for detection of association between variables.

Results: The mean of practice scale was (14.23+/- 1.76). We observed significant association between performance of pregnant women regarding exercise and their occupation, education status and education status of their husbands (P<0.001).Education status of husbands had a significant predictive effect in regression model (p<0.001).

Conclusions: It seems that the majority of pregnant women, who exercise during pregnancy, do not follow the principles correctly therefore their performance is not adequate almost in all domains.

In today's intensely competitive world, successful industries are those who seize on every opportunity to optimise production, keep product quality high and minimise operating costs. 'Lighting ' is a productivity tool that can help to accomplish these goals and gain a competitive edge: On the other hand, it has been observed that industiral and public lighting affects peak-loads on national grid sharply, leading to frequent power-cuts and load shedding. In the present paper, an attempt is made to investigate the method of improving energy efficiency in relation to factory lighting. The prevailing situation of industrial lighting in India and some of the gaps in achieving energy saving objective are being studied and elucidated in this paper. A novel, industrial reflector with general contour, in which the derivation of reflector profile is tailored to the desired light distribution, is designed and fabricated. The optical designs of lamp and reflector are optimally matched for optimum light output with wide-spread light distribution. An effort is also made to put flexibility and controllability in light distribution to satisfy the varying needs offactory lighting in a cost-effective, energy-effective and user-friendly way. Photometric evaluation of the innovated lampreflector combination is made in order to verify its efficiency and manifest its suitability in industrial installations.

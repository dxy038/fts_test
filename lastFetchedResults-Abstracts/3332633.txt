This paper presents an advanced technique of resolving network reconfiguration problem with an objective of minimizing I2R losses of the network for an explicit set of loads. Amongst reasonably a lot of performance standards considered for optimal network reconfiguration, voltage constraint is a significant one. This problem calls for the determination of the best combination of feeders to be opened in the Radial Distribution system (RDS) so that the resultant RDS provides the optimal performance in the preferred settings. In answering this problem, a new heuristic population based optimization technique called as Group Search Optimization (GSO) algorithm is used to reconfigure the RDS. GSO follows an optimal pattern for sustaining the radial nature of the network at every stage of the solution. The anticipated scheme minimizes the objective function which has been given in the problem formulation so as to reduce the I2R losses in addition to balancing of loads in the feeders. The solution method includes determination of the best switching combinations and calculation of power loss and voltage profile. The practicality of the anticipated technique is confirmed in an IEEE standard Test distribution network, where the results obtained are compared by means of available literatures. Correspondingly it has been observed from the results that the network losses are reduced when the voltage stability is improved through the network reconfiguration.

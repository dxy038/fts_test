This paper proposes a reduced switch count three-phase AC motor drive system. The proposed drive system uses a five-leg converter topology, composed of ten switches and provides bidirectional power flow and power factor control. The pulse-width modulation technique for the five-leg converter is presented and the implementation of unity power factor control is investigated. Experimental and simulated results are presented

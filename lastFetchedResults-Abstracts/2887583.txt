This paper presents a new single image dehaze approach that uses a novel estimation of the atmospheric light and media transmission. Conventional dehaze methods often result in degraded images with low contrast and/or oversaturation of color in some regions. In order to mitigate these problems we use local atmospheric light and estimate the media transmission for each local region by using an objective function represented by modified saturation evaluation metric and intensity difference. Experimental results on a variety of outdoor haze images show that the proposed method achieves excellent restoration in terms of contrast, color fidelity and image visibility.

The paper presents a computer-based intelligent decision support system designed to achieve the optimization of the lapping of plane surfaces, by TaguchiÂ´s method of arrays of experiments. The steps to be followed for solving the issue of optimization are described, the most important ones concerning the defining of the targeted objective, establishing the factors influencing the process and their respective levels, selection of the optimum array of experiments, processing of the results and determining the optimum configuration of the levels of the considered factors.

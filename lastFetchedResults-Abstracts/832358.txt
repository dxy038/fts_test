The quality improvement in mesh optimisation techniques that preserve its connectivity are obtained by an iterative process in which each node of the mesh is moved to a new position that minimises a certain objective function. The objective function is derived from some quality measure of the local submesh, that is, the set of tetrahedra connected to the adjustable or free node. Although these objective functions are suitable to improve the quality of a mesh in which there are non-inverted elements, they are not when the mesh is tangled. This is due to the fact that usual objective functions are not defined on all R3 and they present several discontinuities and local minima that prevent the use of conventional optimisation procedures. Otherwise, when the mesh is tangled, there are local submeshes for which the free node is out of the feasible region, or this does not exist. In this paper we propose the substitution of objective functions having barriers by modified versions that are defined and regular on all R3. With these modifications, the optimisation process is also directly applicable to meshes with inverted elements, making a previous untangling procedure unnecessary. This simultaneous procedure allows to reduce the number of iterations for reaching a prescribed quality. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present several applications where it can be seen that our results clearly improve those obtained by other authors.

To solve the multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) especially in unknown complex environment, a novel dynamic algorithm was put forward with the advantages of wireless sensor network (WSN). The architecture and sensor fusion of WSN were discussed. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on bionic swarm intelligence was used for solution of the multi-objective optimization. A practical implementation with real WSN and real mobile robots were carried out. The successful implementation of tasks validates the efficiency, stability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

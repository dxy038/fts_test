Controller design is performed to meet some performance criteria. Some of them are the gain and phase margins, control effort, settling time, overshoot, amongst other indexes. Obtaining a controller or compensator that fits all these criteria (or some of them) for a closed loop control is done in both empirical and analytical procedures. The most of these procedures assumes the plant to be controlled could be modelled as first or second-order system. This paper aims to show a way to find the controller parameters based on the multi-objective optimization with a evolutionary approach. The systems to be controlled must be the type SISO (Single Input Single Output) whose transfer functions may have order higher than second order.

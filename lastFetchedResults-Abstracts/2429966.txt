One of the largest and best characterised fracture toughness data sets is the so called Euro data set developed in a European co-operation project some time ago. Probably the most objective analysis of the data set was made using a distribution comparison method. Recently, an improvement of the method has been achieved by combining the Rank probability estimates (based on toughness) with Binomial probability estimates (based on temperature). This novel combination of Rank and Binomial probability estimates double the number of independent individual point estimates, making the overall estimate more accurate with respect to the true value. The strength in this statistical analysis method lies in the objectiveness of the result. This new statistical assessment method is here applied to analyse the Euro fracture toughness data set once more. The results can be used to form a new basis for micro-mechanistic modelling of cleavage fracture.

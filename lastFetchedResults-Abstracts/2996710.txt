The Telecom Forecaster Predictor (TFP) fulfills the need for a powerful, easily adaptable, multi-mission telecommunications analysis tool. The software is used in operations by five JPL missions, and adaptations exist for 13 missions. Built upon MATLAB(R), the TFP combines both multimission and mission-specific models to predict performance. Basing new mission adaptations on existing ones while sharing common models reduces development time and the number of modeling errors. Link configurations are specified through a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI), and navigation inputs are provided through standard JPL NAIF SPICE<sup>2</sup> SPK trajectory and CK attitude files, which the TFP can read directly. Current work involves the development of a mission planning tool based on the TFP architecture. The objective is to create an evolvable telecommunications analysis tool to support missions from start to finish. The modular architecture of the TFP is a solid framework upon which other multi-mission tools can be modeled

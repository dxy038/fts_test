Objective:
The aim of the study was to investigate total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and homocysteine levels in children with acute rheumatic fever (ARF).
Design and methods:
Nineteen patients with ARF and twenty healthy children, age- and sex-matched were included in the study. Follow-up studies were made at the 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day of diagnosis.
Results:
Children with ARF had significantly higher serum homocysteine levels and lower TAC than the same parameters of the controls at all measurements. Following the anti-inflammatory therapy, we found a progressive increase in TAC and a decrease in homocysteine levels of the patients.
Conclusion:
We concluded that increased serum homocysteine levels and decreased serum TAC of the patients with ARF can be considered as a sign of increased inflammation and oxidative stress in these patients which needs to be considered during therapy. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of these findings.

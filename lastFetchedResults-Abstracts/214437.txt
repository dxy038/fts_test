Objective
This study was designed to determine the etiology of status epilepticus (SE) and its relation to mortality.
Materials and Methods
This descriptive study was carried out based on the medical records of 40 patients with diagnosis of SE discharged from pediatric hospital of Bandar Abbas between March 2002 and March 2004. Multivariant analysis was pereformed to determine the prevalence of the disorder and the relation between SE and other factors such as gender, age, response to treatment, and mortality. We classified the etiology according to international league against epilepsy (ILAE) classification and also uses another classification regarding underlying causes
such as fever (non-Cb'S infection), central nervous system infection, hypoxia, and metabolic causes.
Results
Status epilepticus was responsible for 0.3% of all hospital admissions during the study period. Based on the ILAE classification, frequencies for acute symptomatic, febrile, progressive encephalopathic, remote, and cryptogenic SE were 42.5%,32.5%, 10%, 7.5%, and 7.5%, respectively. The mostcommonunderlying causes resulting in SE werefever (45%), metabolic disorders (15%), CNS infection (12.5%), chronic neurologic diseases (7.5%), idiopathic (7.5%), hypoxia (5%), drug withdrawal (2.5%), CNS hemorrhage (2.5%), neurodegenerative disease (2.5%), brain abscess (2.5%), and post DPT (Diphteria,Pertusis,Tetanus) vaccination (2.5%). Mortality rate was 25% (80%in the patients younger than 5 years and 40% in those aged less than 1 year).
Occurrence of SE and its mortality was found to be related to age (pc 0.(5). 
Conclusion
For SE, if seizures continue for more than 5 minutes, treatment must be
initiated. The outcome is determined by etiology, age, seizure duration and management; however, all we cando isenhance themanagement and increase its effectiveness.

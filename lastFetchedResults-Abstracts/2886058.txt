Polarization imaging has advantages to reveal objective characteristics in foggy conditions. Quality assessment of polarization analysis images in imaging is rarely reported. A quality assessment method suitable to polarization analysis images in foggy conditions is proposed. Firstly, polarization characteristics in foggy conditions are analyzed. Three types of quality factors are selected, which are contrast factor based on brightness, the moment of inertia factor based on structure, and MSCN (Mean Subtracted Contrast Normalized) factor based on Stokes parameters. Corresponding assessment model is constructed, and pooling strategies are designed to map quality score of intensity of polarization image I and degree of polarization image P. Experiments on images captured by polarization camera in simulation foggy environment and generated by fog simulation of Photoshop. Results show that the proposed method is well consistent with subjective observation and analysis.

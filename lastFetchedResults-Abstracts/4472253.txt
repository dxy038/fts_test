With the objective of maximizing the sum-rate this paper tackles the subcarrier and the power allocation problems in the context of multi-user FBMC. Under highly frequency selective channels the demodulated data is affected by ISI and ICI. As a solution the band is partitioned into three subsets so that there is no overlapping between the subcarriers of the same subset. Then we propose a low complexity heuristic to carry out the resource allocation over each subset. Simulation-based results demonstrate that at low noise regime, the proposed solution is able to outperform the conventional approach.

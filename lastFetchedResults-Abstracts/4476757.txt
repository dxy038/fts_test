This paper presents the initial results of the Reliability Enhancement Testing (RET) being conducted by The Boeing Commercial Avionics Systems (CAS) group. The RET process was developed to improve the quality and maturity of avionics hardware before its introduction into service. The development of such testing is essential to the elimination of design and manufacturing deficiencies. It is considered whether this concept could be applied to avionics hardware to detect manufacturing process problems and design deficiencies. A major consideration in the efficient application of this process to production is the development and optimization of the sequences of test steps. The Boeing 777 aircraft will be the largest twin-engine jetliner, its introduction offering a new standard of quality, reliability, performance capabilities and passenger comfort. CAS has initiated the RET effort for the 777 Program in support of this increased emphasis on product integrity. The objective is to detect deficiencies, determine their fundamental cause, and implement appropriate corrective actions before delivery of the product to the airline. This pilot program is to establish a process to be applied to newly designed hardware to eliminate design and manufacturing deficiencies, and to mature both the hardware and processes before introduction into service. The initial results indicate that the RET approach has a sound foundation and its continued development is desirable. No test sequence or pattern of testing can guarantee detection of all deficiencies; this approach holds one of the keys to ensuring maturity of hardware before delivery

Objective: Tailor's bunion deformity is a lateral side bone and soft tissue prominence of the fifth metatarsal bone. The aim of our study was to assess the clinical and radiographic results of dis¬tal metatarsal osteotomies in patients with tailor's bunion deformity. Methods: This study included 24 feet of 14 patients with tailor's bunion who were treated with distal metatarsal osteotomy of the 5th metatarsal between 2006 and 2009. The mean follow-up time was 24.45 (range: 12 to 47) months. Patients were evaluated clinically and radiographical- ly. using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system with weight-bearing anteroposterior and lateral foot radiographs. Results: Average AOFAS scores of the patients were 64.83 preoperatively and 91.62 at the final follow-up. Three patients had complications; avascular necrosis. delayed union. and superficial wound infection. Conclusion: Distal metatarsal osteotomy is a safe and easy treatment option for the painful tai¬lor's bunion deformity and provides patient satisfaction rate of up to 96%.

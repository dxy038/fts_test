In the broadcast schedule construction problem in a radio network, a frame of minimum length provides every transceiver an opportunity for transmission after least amount delay. However, such a frame does not necessarily maximize the network throughput. The network throughput can be increased by choosing a frame of suboptimal length, although in this situation the throughput of some of the individual transceivers might decrease. We present a schedule construction scheme that takes into account the interests of the network as well as the individual transceivers and finds a balance between the two conflicting interests. The objective of this scheme is to maximize the network throughput without a significant adverse impact on the performance of individual transceivers. This scheme guarantees a network throughput that is at least as large as in the traditional scheduling schemes using the minimum length frame

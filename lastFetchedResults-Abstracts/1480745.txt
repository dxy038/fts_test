In many technical applications, like supersonic jets, noise with a characteristic spectrum including certain dominant frequencies (e.g. jet-screech) is prevalent, and the elimination of sharp peaks in the acoustic spectrum is the aim of active or passive flow/noise control efforts. A mathematical framework for the optimization of control strategies is introduced that uses a cost objective in frequency-space coupled to constraints in form of partial differential equations in the time domain. An iterative optimization scheme based on direct and adjoint equations arises, which has been validated on two examples, the one-dimensional Burgers equation and the two-dimensional compressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations. In both cases, the iterative scheme has proven effective and efficient in targeting and removing specified frequency bands in the acoustic spectrum. It is expected that this technique will find use in acoustic and other applications where the elimination or suppression of distinct frequency components is desirable.

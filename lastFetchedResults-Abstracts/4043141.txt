Mobile phones of the future will be the access terminals to many different types of service. This will mean that they must be able to reconfigure themselves to support the differing service requirements placed upon them. At the root of this ability to reconfigure must be components and architectures that allow such flexibility, and so the key objective of the work programme on terminals within the Virtual Centre of Excellence in Mobile and Personal Communications (Mobile VCE) has been the design, definition and performance evaluation of key components and architectures for future generation reconfigurable terminals

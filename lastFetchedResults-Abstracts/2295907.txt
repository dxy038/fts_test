This article is an overview of the literature called “Conspiracy Hallucination” or “Theory of Conspiracy Hallucination” and tries to understand and clarify the as-sumptions, concepts and predicates of this theory and offer the examples, evi-dences and samples of its application in the analysis of political phenomena in a multidisciplinary study. The survey on the application has been done with the emphasis on the analysis of contemporary phenomena and events in Iran. 
This article, conceptually tries to criticize and evaluate this theory through con-siderations given to it in terms of internal criticism of the theory components, criticism by evaluation of the nature of human sciences phenomena, criticism by evaluation of the policy objective facts, criticism by evaluation of Iran objective facts and criticism by evaluation of Islamic teachings.           
Finally, as a normative advisor, the article offers an alternative style of political analysis. The research findings show that, while we should not exaggerate the role of the enemy, it is the most important vulnerability and thought for the security function of the state to suppose the real threats of the country’s enemies and rivals as a mere hallucination.

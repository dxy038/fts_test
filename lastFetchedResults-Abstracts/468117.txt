Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the fetal-pelvic index in our patient population and to determine whether it would be predictive of route of delivery. Study Design: One hundred seventy-six patients with a previous history or clinical findings in the current pregnancy suggestive of fetal-pelvic disproportion participated in this Human Investigation Committee–approved study. All underwent fetal ultrasonographic examinations and modified digital radiography before labor. Fetal head and abdominal circumferences and maternal inlet and midpelvic circumferences were determined, and the fetal-pelvic index was calculated. Results: Ninety-one patients fulfilled all aspects of the study, including rigorous criteria pertaining to labor management. Thirty of these patients underwent cesarean delivery and 61 were delivered vaginally. The fetal-pelvic index value for the vaginal delivery group was –5.4 ± 5.3, as opposed to –2.4 ± 5.8 in the cesarean delivery group (P< .02). Notwithstanding this difference, the fetal-pelvic index had a low overall ability to predict fetal-pelvic disproportion (0.65) and had associated sensitivity and specificity of 0.27 and 0.84, respectively. Predictive thresholds other than zero were tested, but optimal predictive ability, at a fetal-pelvic index cutoff of 2, was only 70% (sensitivity 0.20, specificity 0.95). Conclusion: In our patient population the fetal-pelvic index was only moderately predictive of fetal-pelvic disproportion. Factors other than those assessed by the fetal-pelvic index are probably important in determining the route of delivery. Further studies are indicated. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:1186-92.)

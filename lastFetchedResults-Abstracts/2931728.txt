We discuss a syllogistic reasoning problem of the type Q<sub>1 </sub>(A&#8594;B), Q<sub>2</sub>(B&#8594;C)&#8658;Q<sub>3</sub>(A&#8594;C) where Q<sub>i</sub>, i=1, 2, 3, are imprecise quantifiers such as &#8220;most&#8221; and &#8220;usually&#8221;, and A, B, and C are fuzzy sets such as &#8220;big cars&#8221;. We propose a new approach that integrates reasoning with evaluation of knowledge based on the framework of multi-objective decision-making. The reasoning process is formulated as a maximization of the compatibility degree of knowledge with observed data

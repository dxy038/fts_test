Electronic commerce (EC) is one of the most important strategic information systems (SIS) in the global digital economy. The EC database system plays a vital role in the development of the EC information infrastructure for enterprises. Benchmark is an important tool to measure the performance of the EC database system and to evaluate different Web and database connectivity structures. TPC-W and Web EC represent current widely used EC benchmarks. Each has its own workload and test design. In this paper we prepare an analytic study. The study is based on the composition of a workload. We propose an analysis model to examine the data, transaction, control, and implementation aspects for each benchmark. The objective is to provide managers and developers with analysis results and a structured and systematic framework to select EC benchmarks. It helps users interpret and apply their benchmark results.

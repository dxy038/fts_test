A new control parameter is proposed to achieve output regulation and bidirectional power flow of a parallel-resonant converter which employs a controlled output rectifier. The control parameter, &#194;&#191; angle, is defined as the displacement angle between the firing of the inverter switches and their corresponding rectifier switches. Employing &#194;&#191; angle control, the control-to-output characteristics of the converter are shown to be load independent. Closed-form expressions for the steady-state operation are derived. Desired operating regions are analytically defined such that all inverter switches are naturally commutated and output rectifier switches are line commutated.

Based on the analysis of the quantized error, which occurs in the digitally controlled PWM converter, this paper presents a digitally controlled strategy - digital increment mode PI control algorithm, which can be easily implemented in the digitally controlled high switching frequency DC/DC converters, moreover the steady oscillation of output voltage can be effectively suppressed by the optimized control algorithm. The validity of the presented control algorithm is verified by the bidirectional DC/DC prototype, increment mode digital PI modulation for both voltage feedback during the discharging course and current feedback during the charging course is realized

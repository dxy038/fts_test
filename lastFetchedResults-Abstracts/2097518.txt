:    The present study aimed to investigate the value of Iranian papers in chemistry in 2010 from the viewpoint of their citation quality. The citation value was calculated based on text citation frequency and text citation potential. The latter is defined based on the text citation frequency of the cited papers, divided by text citation potential of the citing papers. 
The research was carried out using a citation analysis method. The data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics, including Spearman correlation test.
955 papers referring to 517 Iranian papers were examined. These papers gave 1434 text citations to Iranian papers, of which 213 (22 percent) were self citations. Only a minority (17.02 percent) of the Iranian papers performed higher than the expected level and the rest (82.97 percent) performed below the expected level, regarding their text citation portions. The results also indicated that citations can properly predict text citation frequencies but have no significant correlation with text citation portions. 
Despite the recent growth in Iranâ€™s scientific outputs in chemistry, the citation value of the papers was revealed to be considerably low. This implies that in order to have a more objective evaluation, Iranian science system requires more qualitative indicators instead of the crude count of citations.

The objective of this article is the implementation of an effective control system for a heliostat field. Each heliostat is based on a mirror and a routing system. Such a field of mirrors must be guided in order to focus the rays to a central captor device (usually placed on a tower). The efficiency of the system depends on the orientation control of mirrors on two axes (North-South and East-West). In this article we propose a solution of control based on bio-inspired algorithm (genetic algorithm) with certain special features given by the proposed implementation.

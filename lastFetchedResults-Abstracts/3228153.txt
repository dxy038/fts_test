This paper presents a methodology that facilitates a new QFD application for quality improvement in the field of Engineering Education. The focus is on the initial accreditation process of engineering programs. Namely, QFD is utilized to illustrate the translation of program requirements into learning outcomes, curriculum, and assessment tools. Program requirements are set by local accreditation agencies, program stakeholders, and the strategic plan of the hosting college/university. QFD is used to design program curriculum (courses and learning units) so that program learning outcomes are achieved. A subsequent QFD is also used to design the assessment tools of each course so that course learning outcomes are achieved. An assessment plan is to be then designed and deployed after the engineering program is approved by the accreditation body. That is a key step to assure the quality of proposed engineering programs by addressing the needs of different program constituents (accreditation bodies, employers, prospective students, market, educational standards, professional associations, and qualification frameworks). The objective is to improve the quality of proposed engineering program as well as the performance of running programs and programs under review. An example of QFD application to the initial accreditation of a Master of Project Management is used to illustrate the proposed methodology.

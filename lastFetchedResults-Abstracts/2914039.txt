The objective is to show how a computer spreadsheet can be used to solve the wave equation with dependence on one spatial coordinate (1-D) and time. The technique is applied to TEM transmission lines. Familiarity with the basics of an electronic spreadsheet is assumed. The spreadsheet solution of a TEM transmission line relies on the discretization of both space and time to model the propagation on a line. In addition to this, the model must properly account for the line terminations (boundary conditions), junctions of different lines, lumped element line loading, etc. The model allows one to observe a `snapshotÂ´ of the entire transmission line at a specific instant in time, or to observe time-varying voltages at several different points on a line much like with a multi-channel oscilloscope. Implementation of these features on an electronic spreadsheet requires: discretized line equations, equations or line terminations, and equations for line interfaces. Arguably, the most effective way of presenting the above within the available space is to show a spreadsheet implementation of a sample transmission line that incorporates many types of equations

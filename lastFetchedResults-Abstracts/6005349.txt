The primary control objectives for intelligent and green buildings focus on maintaining occupants´ comfort while minimizing energy consumption in building operations. This paper describes a multi-agent control system which is designed for building energy management. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized to optimize the control system to improve users´ comfort and save energy. In order to maximize the economic benefits in green buildings, an economic optimizer is implemented to minimize building operation cost. To develop such an economic optimizer, the objective functions and the constraints are formulated, which take the pollutant emission into consideration. The simulation results in several case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of PSO and the economic optimizer.

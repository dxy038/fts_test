Background and Objective: Pregnancy termination and recurrent abortion are one of the
common complications during pregnancy and in patients with a bad obstetric history.
Materials and Methods: In this study, a total of 154 individuals including 75 couples and
four single women from different communities and with various incomes were investigated for
chromosomal abnormalities using blood culture and chromosomal banding technique.
Results: Chromosomal analysis of these patients revealed three abnormal karyotypes
(3.8%) in three women and two abnormal karyotypes in conceptions. Two of these couples had
consanguineous marriage and the remaining women included one isochromosome for X [46, x,I
(xq)], two translocations [45, xx, t (15:21)] and [46, xx, t (7:14)], one trisomy ‘21’ (47, xx, +21), and a
ring chromosome (46, xx, r(X). In addition, 27 conceptions had been reported for these five couples.
These included 23 abortions with 18 of them within first trimester (78.26%) and four of them had
abortions within second trimester (21.74%), one had a normal child, three had abnormal children,
and one with stillbirth.
Conclusion: It was found out that abnormal karyotype is present in 3.8% of patients with a bad
obstetric history. There was also a close relationship between number of deliveries and abortions
and this relation was statistically significant (p < 0.01). In addition, consanguinity was also related
with number of abnormal children (p < 0.05). There was also a significant relationship between
consanguinity and first trimester abortions (p < 0.05). Therefore, in couples with more than three
abortions, especially within first trimester, chromosomal evaluation can have a diagnostic value.

Evidence abounds showing the deterioration of the U.S. economy, but causes are not fully understood. Consequently, fully effective remedies have not yet been discovered, but at least part of the solution lies in restoring the vigor and vitality of small businesses in the United States. Acceleration of the transfer of underutilized technology from the huge knowledge reservoirs in laboratories of universities, government, and large business firms to the small business sector should be a key feature of a restorative program. It will not occur, however, unless more financial incentives are provided by our system than at present. Carefully targeted tax credits, and other tax incentives can be designed to achieve this objective while assuring an equitable social quid pro quo.

The objective of the IMS learning design (IMS-LD) specification is to provide a containment framework of elements that can describe any design of a teaching-learning in a formal way. It does not impose any learning approach and is pedagogical independent. In this way, learning designers can precisely prescribe the instructional and teaching strategies. The problem is how common teachers can develop appropriate IMS-LD contents. This paper presents an adequate design approach based on design patterns. Design patterns are being proposed in learning to facilitate the design activities from non expert users. We find these proposals valuable, but consider that additional efforts are required. We propose a language of design patterns for learning, hierarchical structured in several aggregation layers. In addition, we consider generative design issues to obtain IMS-LD materials.

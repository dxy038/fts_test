Distributed renewable electricity generators, such as solar cells and wind turbines introduce bidirectional energy flows in the low-voltage power grid, possibly causing voltage violations and grid instabilities. The current solution to this problem comprises automatically switching off some of the local generators, resulting in a loss of green energy. In this paper we study the impact of different solar panel penetration levels in an residential area and the corresponding effects on the distribution feeder line. To mitigate these problems, we assess how effective it is to locally store excess energy in batteries. A case study on a residential feeder serving 63 houses shows that if 80% of them have photo-voltaic (PV) panels, 45% of them would be switched off, resulting in 482 kWh of PV-generated energy being lost. We show that providing a 9 kWh battery at each house can mitigate some voltage violations, and therefor allowing for more renewable energy to be used.

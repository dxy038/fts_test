Energy harvesting with a photovoltaic cell
requires efficient elements for better use of the sun's
irradiance, due to the randomness inherent in this type of
energy. One of the important elements that exist in PV
systems is the DC/DC converters. These items, mainly,
they convert a certain voltage to another dc voltage (of
greater or lesser value) with less ripple voltage. The three
basic configurations are Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost.
The first two types of converters are most commonly
used in photovoltaic energy conversion. The objective of
this paper is the analysis and modeling of these types of
converters in Matlab-Simulink with two of their toolbox,
SimPower System and Simscape. The two type of
converters will be analyzed mathematically, calculating
their elements and then will be showed the models used
in these calculations with these simulation tools.

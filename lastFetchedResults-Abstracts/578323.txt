Objective: The main purpose of this research is to investigate the process of using databases and electronic journal services including Alert services by faculty members among libraries which delivered these services in Shahid Beheshti medical university (SBMU).
Methodology: The research method was survey, and the data were gathered using a self- administered questionnaire. Study participants were 92 faculty members who were selected by a purposive sampling method among SBMU faculty members which declared they used Alert services. 
Findings: Our findings indicated that 52.2% of study participants started their searches for journal articles via PubMed. Using search engines and accessible databases in the university were second and third priority, respectively. 46/7% of faculty members review 2 to 3 pages of search results. The lack of article's full- text links in the search results were reported as a main problem and 92.2 percent of users preferred PDF format to study the articles. The most important reason for the use of Alert services was to become aware of updated articles published in their field, and their 1st step in following up articles was reading the abstracts. Faculty members had access to full- text articles through SBMU's subscription. 
Conclusion: Considering that the majority of faculty members searched for journal articles using PubMed and in the first place, and use subscribed SBMU's databases as their third priority, it is highly recommended to better introduce these database to faculty members which may lead to better utility of costs. In addition, introducing the advantages of the Alert services to faculty members by the libraries can be useful in becoming aware of updated and needed articles published in their field.

Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) is a new kind of network, which is constructed by simulating the activities of the mammalÂ´s visual cortex neurons. PCNN is suitable for image processing, including segmentation, image fusion, edge extraction. In this paper, a new method is proposed which is the use of Bidirectional search Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (BPCNN) in the color image segmentation. The validity of this method is well verified by the analysis and experiments.

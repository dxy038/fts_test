Human errors are responsible for about 70% of incidents and accidents in transportation systems. This paper proposes to take into account human stability whose main objective is to improve system risk assessment. Some definitions about concepts of robustness, resilience ... are provided to position the human stability in relation to these definitions. Then, a definition of human stability is proposed and a formalism based on a set of states and transitions is presented. A first mono-criterion assessment method is proposed and applied to a transportation system: the air traffic control.

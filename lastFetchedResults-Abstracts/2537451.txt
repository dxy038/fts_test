In this paper, Model Predictive Controller has been used for controlling the hybrid power system, which contains grid connected photovoltaic and energy storage systems (battery) considering the economic issues like optimization of profit from selling energy to grid by way of selling energy to grid during the high cost of energy and with regard to technical issues like improved dynamic response and smoothing power output of photovoltaic system and also maximization the batteries life by way of minimization the cycle of the change and discharge is used and such for optimization the results of model Predictive Control, PSO algorithm is used to obtain the coefficient of the objective function suggested controller. In addition, the suggested controller adapts itself. Dynamically and automatically and yet is able to respond external requests like price signals or satisfy the constraints of the power system or request of operator. Finally the simulation results of system with the proposed controller and result of PID controller is presented and compared.

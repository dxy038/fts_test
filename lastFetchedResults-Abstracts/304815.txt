Objectives. The Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen (ISAR) trial is  randomized comparison of combined antiplatelet with anticoagulant therapy after coronary Palmaz-Schatz stent placement. The objective of this study was to compare early and late clinical and angiographic outcome in  subgroup of patients with stent placement for acute myocardial infarction.

Background. Stenting has become  treatment option for acute myocardial infarction, but it is not known which antithrombotic regimen is more adequate after stent implantation.

Methods. One hundred twenty-three patients with successful stenting after acute myocardial infarction were randomized to receive aspirin plus ticlopidine (n = 61) or intense anticoagulant therapy (n = 62). Six-month repeat angiography was performed in 101 (86.3%) eligible patients.

Results. During the first 30 days after stenting, patients with antiplatelet therapy had  significantly lower clinical event rate (3.3% vs. 21.0%, p = 0.005) and stent vessel occlusion rate (0% vs. 9.7%, p = 0.03) and  trend to fewer cardiac events (1.6% vs. 9.7%, p = 0.12). After 6 months, the survival rate free of recurrent myocardial infarction was higher in patients with antiplatelet therapy (100% vs. 90.3%, p = 0.03), and the rate of stent vessel occlusion was lower (1.6% vs. 14.5%, p = 0.02). Both groups had comparable restenosis rates (26.5% vs. 26.9%, p = 0.87).

Conclusions. This study demonstrates that combined antiplatelet therapy after stent placement in patients with acute myocardial infarction is associated with an overall better clinical and angiographic outcome than anticoagulant therapy.

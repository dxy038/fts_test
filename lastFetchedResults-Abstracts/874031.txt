In this paper we present a budget-constrained optimal control model aimed at
finding the optimal enforcement profile for a street-level, illicit drug crackdown
operation. The objective is defined as minimizing the number of dealers dealing at
the end of the crackdown operation, using this as a surrogate measure of residual

criminal activity. Analytical results show that optimal enforcement policy will
invariably use the budget resources completely. Numerical analysis using realistic
estimates of parameters shows that crackdowns normally lead to significant results
within a matter of a week, and if they do not, it is likely that they will be offering
very limited success even if pursued for a much longer duration. We also show that
a ramp-up enforcement policy will be most effective in collapsing a drug market if
the drug dealers are risk-seeking, and the policy of using maximum enforcement as
early as possible is usually optimal in the case when the dealers are risk averse or
risk neutral. The work then goes on to argue that the underlying model has some
general characteristics that are both reasonable and intuitive, allowing possible
applications in focused, local enforcement operations on other similar illegal
activities.

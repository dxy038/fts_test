In this paper, we demonstrate a silicon-based packaging platform for a package component of light emitting diode (LED) by silicon bulk micromachining technologies and using a silicon substrate with embedded solder interconnections to dissipate heat and match thermal expansion coefficient (CTE). The objective is to develop an LED package that can overcome LED life, high operating voltage, package degradation and the ability to drive the devices at higher power and higher brightness. To numerically predict the performance of packaging design, the optical and thermal characterization of the novel package structure was simulated by TracePro and ANSYS software, respectively. Research results have shown that silicon substrate can enhance heat removal for safe junction temperature operation and minimize thermal stress caused by mismatch of CTE. Moreover, silicon-based packaging platform with embedded solder interconnections has been fabricated and can be used for packaging MEMS and conventional optoelectronic semiconductor devices

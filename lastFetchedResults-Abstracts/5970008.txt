A wireless Ad Hoc network is an infrastructureless self-organizing network. Access control problem of strangers may happen because of its strong openness. Trust management based on policy can dealt with such problem, which can deliver access control policies to strangers through credential-delegation to give them permissions. But the delegation frameworks are somewhat coarse-grained and subjective. This paper proposes a trust evaluation based authorization model for ad hoc networks (TEAMA), which extends the basic model TBM with trust degree, which is generated by trust evaluation and helps the decisions of credential-grants in trust management based on policy, gives a more objective fine-grained evaluation than usual subjective methods.

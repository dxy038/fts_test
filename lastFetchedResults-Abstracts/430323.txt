We report a case of chronic empyema and bronchopleural fistula after lobectomy for tuberculosis. The patient had undergone four different surgical procedures to correct his bronchopleural fistula during an interval of seven years. Finally, he had a successful closure of the fistula using the transsternal transpericardial approach.

Text retrieval systems which store extremely large amounts of text while providing a multiuser retrieval service for a large customer base are discussed. Due to the severe I/O demands of such a system, it is usually beneficial, if not necessary to utilize a multiprocessor system with multiple I/O facilities in an effort to increase the parallel I/O activity, the objective being to lower search response times. The problem is defined, a solution is modeled and it is shown that the application can be handled in a very effective fashion by a multiprocessor system with a simple LAN-based topology. A type of functional splitting which, if done in a careful manner, helps improve search response time is described

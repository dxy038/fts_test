The multi-objective degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem (MST) is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, a model of the problem is formulated and an improved genetic algorithm for the problem is proposed. We employ partheno-genetic operations to improve the efficiency of genetic algorithm, and design a niche count with adaptive niche radius to keep the population diversity. The experiments show that the method is able to find Pareto optimal solutions.

The main objective of this study is to give a numerical solution of three-dimensional analysis of thick rectangular plates. The analysis uses discrete singular convolution (DSC) method. Free vibration, bending and buckling of rectangular plates have been studied in this paper. Regularized Shannon's delta (RSD) kernel is selected as singular convolution to illustrate the present algorithm. In the proposed approach, the derivatives in both the governing equations and the boundary conditions are discretized by the method of DSC. The obtanied results are compared with those of other numerical methods. It is found that the convergence of the DSC approach is very good and the results agree well with those obtained by other researchers.

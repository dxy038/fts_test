In this paper, we focus on the problem with the objective to maximize the system performance, while guaranteeing specified QoS constraints for multiple user classes in wireless data networks. First, we propose two opportunistic scheduling algorithms that exploit time-varying channel conditions for the special two-constraint case, and then propose an opportunistic scheduling algorithm for the general case. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheduling algorithms guarantee the different constraints, and achieve high system performance that is close to the true optimal value using a known general-purpose optimization package, lingo

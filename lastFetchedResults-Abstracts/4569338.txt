Multifocus fusion is an important technique to integrate focal information from a set of input registered images. In this effort, a novel image fusion algorithm based on adaptive features matching is presented. Given an over-complete Gabor dictionary, through orthogonal matching pursuit signal decomposition algorithm, each source image can be described by sparse combinations of these atoms which capture the main features in the images. Then the fused image can be reconstructed by merging the atoms information in source images together. The last experiment results show that our algorithm can achieve better fusion effect than traditional wavelet image fusion method and spatial frequency fusion method, whatever from subjective visual effect or objective metric.

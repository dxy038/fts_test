Objective
To investigate the development of frontally recorded sleep spindles from infancy to adolescence to provide normative data for pediatric sleep medicine.
Methods
Sleep spindle activity was investigated in 120 healthy subjects aged 3 months to 16 years in 12 age groups. At 2 a.m. (min 1:17 a.m., max 3:18 a.m.) 10 min of NREM 2 was checked. Spindles were visually scored in the electroencephalogram from F4/A1.
Results
The age dependency of interspindle interval, length of spindle, and spindle density, was statistically significant (Kruskalâ€“Wallis p < 0.0001). There were U-shaped curves for spindle length, spindle density, and an inverted U-shaped curve for the interspindle interval. Results of the post hoc U-test p < 0.05 (Bonferroni corrected, m = 66): Spindle length was minimal at 1.7 up to 3.0 years. Spindle density (number of spindles) was minimal between the ages of 1.7 and 2.3 years, thereafter there was a high increase that reached a plateau at age 5 years and remained up to 16 years. Interspindle interval was maximal at 1.7 and 2.3 years.
Conclusions
Sleep spindle activity changes with maturation in terms of length and density.
Significance
The establishment of age-related normative data of sleep spindle activity can improve identification of NREM 2 in infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and enable detection of delayed neural maturation and/or sleep instability.

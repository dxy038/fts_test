Objective
udy objective was to assess the effect of music on the physiologic and psychologic parameters in patients undergoing application of a C-clamp after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).

ated-measures randomized controlled trial was used.
g
udy took place in three intensive care units in Hong Kong.
ts
six patients undergoing application of a C-clamp after PCI were recruited.
e Measures
logic parameters were blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Psychologic parameters were measured using the University of California at Los Angeles universal pain score.
ention
ts were randomized to receive 45 minutes of music therapy or 45 minutes of an uninterrupted rest period. Three types of music were used, including Chinese classical music, religious music, and Western classical music that had slow beats and was relaxing. The data were collected from September 2004 to December 2005.
s
 experimental group there were statistically significant reductions in heart rate (P &lt; .001), respiratory rate (P &lt; .001), and oxygen saturation (P &lt; .001), and a lower pain score (P &lt; .001) than in the control group.
sion
is a simple, safe, and effective method of reducing potentially harmful physiologic and psychologic responses arising from pain in patients post-PCI undergoing a C-clamp procedure.

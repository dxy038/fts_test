We present the preliminary results of a project developed in the scope of the EC Leonardo da Vinci program. The objective of this project is to develop a CD-ROM for education and training in the domain of signal processing for the acoustic and vibration diagnosis of rotating machines. The project will cover basic methods of signal processing which apply in the relevant domain. The CD-ROM is organised in three modules: basic methods of signal processing; mechanics of rotating machines; and a guide for the choice of appropriate methods according to real problems. It contains interactive consultation modes with several levels of input, complexity, and purpose. In addition to ease of use, the multimedia support offers access to interactive simulations and training, which shows the comparative performances and limits of certain methods. There is an intensive use of real signals taken from a database of real industrial installations

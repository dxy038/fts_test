Conventional microscopes do not capture the 3D information of thick specimens. In order to avoid this limitation Integral Microscopy was proposed. An integral microscope is implemented by inserting a microlens array between the microscope objective and the camera sensor. Although this device captures multiperspective information of the specimen, the small number of microlenses limits the lateral resolution. In this paper we propose to improve the resolution by time multiplexing. Specifically, we propose an electrically addressable device that permits to obtain three sheared versions of the microscopic plenoptic map. Digital processing algorithm applied to the maps provides images with resolution similar to the one provided by the host microscope.

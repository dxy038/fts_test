The problems that are involved in cloning the IBM PS/2 are examined. It is pointed out that IBM has intentionally designed the PS/2-series hardware with the objective of making it expensive and time-consuming to clone. This strategy is discussed, as are the legal defenses set up by IBM. The legal concepts on which IBM is relying are considered. The engineering aspects of cloning are described. It is concluded that cloning the IBM PS/2 is not a trivial task and should under no circumstances be undertaken without an advance appreciation of the difficulties involved.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

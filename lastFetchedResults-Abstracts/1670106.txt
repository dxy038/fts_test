Pollution created by the increased number of people and by industrial and domestic activities put pressure in the planet's climate that can result in a catastrophe which may end the humans' life on the planet [6. p. 18, 7. p. 52]. Hydrogen is an endless source of energy, clean and efficient, which exist in the Universe in a high proportion, over 88% [1. p.18, 2. p. 11, 3. p.68, 4. p. 177, 5. p. 7].

t problems that stop the development of an efficient Hydrogen Economy are the high production costs, storage problems, and transport and supply problems, due to the high cost of operational structure needed for supply to the end user. To all these objective reasons may be added the high rate of international terrorism that may use storage of liquid hydrogen as a target for its activity [1. p. 197, 2. p. 315, 3. p. 76, 4. p. 200, 5. p. 10].

g in the right direction, Marin Radu solved the above problems by producing hydrogen in situ, via an electro-catalytic membrane, which decomposes the water molecules efficiently, with low input of electric current (9 Vâ€“24 V) and produces hydrogen on demand [8. unpublished].

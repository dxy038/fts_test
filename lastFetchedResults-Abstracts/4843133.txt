Summary form only given. The structure of our lasers consisted of a single Ga/sub 0.82/In/sub 0.18/As quantum well embedded in a GaAs/Ga/sub 0.5/In/sub 0.49/P waveguide grown on GaAs substrate by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The primary objective of the present work is the study of this fundamental phenomenon and, specifically, its manifestations in the lasing spectra.

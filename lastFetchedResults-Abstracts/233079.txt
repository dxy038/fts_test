Building design is a decision making process. in Il'hich decisions are made on rhe selecrion of certain
design /"ariahles in order to achiae cerrain objeuires (i.e. economv. thermal comforr, t'isual comfort.
aesthetics. etc.). In/ormation on rhe relationships between the /"ariables and the desired objectives
is necessarvfor proper decision making. Architects have traditionally reached their design decisions
based on past experience. HowelÂ·er. total reliance upon indil'idual experience may lead to incomplete
and inaccurate results. Therefore. giren todar's complexities in building design, as well as advances
in computer rechnology. systematic approaches can be used as an aid ro. not a replacement for,
building designers in the decision making process.
This paper presents the results of implementing an optimization model to the design of energy
consening air-conditioned residential buildings in different climatic regions. Optimum sets of
building design /"ariahles for llpica! ['.S. and Saudi residences are presented. with the objective
of minimi=ing annual energr consumption Ii" those buildings. Optimization results showed that
significant energy .wrings can be achiel'ed by using optimization in the thermal design of buildings.
Valuable design information on the selection and arrangement olvarious building components can
he obtained in the ear/r stages of the huilding des(qn process hy the implementation of optimization
techniques. as in the model implemented in this paper.

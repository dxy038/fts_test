The fusion of object and scene plays an important role in image editing field, especially in the film production process. Poisson image editing technique is widely used in the object-scene fusion and a new method based on IHS transform has also been offered recently. Unfortunately, both of these two means might cause color distortion. Through introducing the SFIM technique and combining with IHS transform, this paper proposes a new algorithm based on IHS transform and SFIM for the fusion of object and scene. It utilizes the SFIM technique to fuse the intensity under the IHS color space. Subjective quality evaluation and objective quality assessment data of comparative fusion experiment results show that the new algorithm not only can reduce the color distortion well and achieve better fusion result than the Poisson fusion scheme and the standard IHS transform fusion scheme in the application of object-scene fusion, but also performs fast and is more robust.

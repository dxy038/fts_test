This paper investigates alternative global constraints that can be introduced in a constraint solver over discrete crystal lattices. The objective is to enhance the efficiency of lattice solvers in dealing with the construction of approximate solutions of the protein structure determination problem. The paper discusses various alternatives and provides preliminary results concerning the computational properties of the different global constraints.

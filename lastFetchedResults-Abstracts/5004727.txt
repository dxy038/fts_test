This paper addresses the impact of load dynamics, and in particular induction motor loads, on voltage recovery after disturbances. The paper proposes a methodology that is based on load flow techniques with advanced modeling capabilities, augmented by a simplified induction motor dynamic model. The objective is to realistically capture the dynamic characteristics of voltage recovery phenomena, avoiding, however, the full scale transient simulation. The approach uses the quadratized power flow model with explicit induction motor representation. The paper describes the modeling approach and the overall methodology for evaluating the load dynamics on voltage recovery. Preliminary results of the application of the method on a simple power system with load dynamics are also included in the paper

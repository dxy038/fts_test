In recent years, warm mix asphalt (WMA) is widely used for reducing energy requirements and emissions in hot mix asphalt (HMA) industry. In addition, the use of rubberized asphalt in the past has proven to be economical, environmentally sound and effective in improving the performance of pavements across the US and the world. The objective of this research was to investigate the mixture performance characteristics of rubberized warm asphalt mixtures, and their correlation with binder properties, through a series of laboratory tests (e.g., viscosity, dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and bending beam rheometer (BBR)) conducted on the binders, and obtaining the indirect tensile strength, rutting resistance, and resilient modulus of various mixtures. The results of the experiments indicated that the use of crumb rubber and WMA additive in HMA can effectively improve the engineering properties of these mixes at lower mixing and compacting temperatures and some statistical correlations between rheological and/or engineering properties were developed successfully.

Time-reversal mirror (TRM) was recently developed for underwater communication system application. This technique has been introduced as an approach to compensate for signal distortion due to multiple path effect in ocean waveguide. TRM is used in this paper for sending a message signal in ocean waveguide, received at time-reversal-array (TRA), and retransmitted to the dynamic ocean environment with an internal solitary wave. The focal structures obtained from different simulating cases are used for bidirectional transmission expediency, and the TRA is used as the relay-line or trunked radio. Ocean waveguide characteristic effects on acoustical properties are also shown in this paper, and focal structure in different ocean environments is analyzed to provide an optimal approach to underwater communication systems and for physical insightÂ´s interests.

Through empirical comparison of classical job shop problems (JSP) with multi-machine consideration, we find that the objective to minimize the sum of weighted tardiness has a better wait property compared with the objective to minimize the makespan. Further, we test the proposed Iterative Minimization Micro-model (IMM) heuristic method with the mixed integer programming (MIP) solution by CPLEX. For multi-machine problems, the IMM heuristic method is faster and achieves a better solution. Finally, for a large problem instance with 409 jobs and 30 types of machines, IMM-heuristic method is compared with ProModel and we find that the heuristic method is slightly better.

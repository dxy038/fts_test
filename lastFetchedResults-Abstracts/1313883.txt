health promotion behaviors category included responsibility
for health, physical activity, dietary habits subscales and the
psychological health category including stress management,
interpersonal relationships and spiritual growth subscales.
Data were analyzed through SPSS17 by using measures of
central tendency and t, ANOVA and Tukey’s tests.

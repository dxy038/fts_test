The aim of this field study was to determine the concentrations and emissions of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide in different types of pig buildings in Korea to allow objective comparison between pig housing types in Korea and other countries. Concentrations of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide in the pig buildings averaged 7.5 ppm and 286.5 ppb and ranged from 0.8 to 21.4 ppm and from 45.8 to 1235 ppb, respectively. The mean emissions of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide per pig (normalized to 75 kg liveweight) and area ( m 2 ) from pig buildings were 250.2 and 37.8 mg/h/pig and 336.3 and 50.9 mg / h / m 2 , respectively. Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide concentrations and emissions were higher in the pig buildings managed with deep-pit manure systems with slats and mechanical ventilation than in other housing types.

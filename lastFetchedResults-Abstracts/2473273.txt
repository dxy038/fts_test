Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the level of "knowledge management system" and its regression equation with the "Quality of work life" in employees of Ministry of Sport and Youth.
Methodology: 245 employees of the ministry were randomly selected as sample of this study. Two questionnaires of Walton quality of work life, and Salys and Jones Knowledge Management were used for collecting data. Based on Cronbach's alpha, the validity of Knowledge Management (0.88) and quality of work life (0.91) questionnaires were calculated. Data analysis was done using single-sample t-test, Pearson correlation, multiple linear regression and ANOVA.
Results: level of "knowledge management" and "quality of work life" in the Ministry of Sport and Youth was assessed as "poor to average" and "average", respectively. The results also indicate a significant and positive relationship (0.766) between the knowledge management system and the quality of work life in Ministry of Sport and Youth (p=0.001). In addition, the variables of "knowledge utilization", "knowledge management", “knowledge creation” and "Storing and Organizing Knowledge" have had the highest regression effect on quality of work life, respectively. This result proves that the dimensions of knowledge management system are significant predictors of work life’ quality (p < 0.01).
Conclusion: Promoting the knowledge level of employees of Ministry of Sport, can not only impart them from new knowledge and thus improve their job performance, but also improve their quality of work life, more than before.

A major objective of this work is to show the ability of FDTD to produce accurate designs of MM wave/subMM wave devices in a general way, including the modelling of nonlinear devices. In order to achieve this objective a complete FDTD code has been developed under the scope of this work, including all necessary extension and improvements. The method is then used to study subMM wave coplanar integrated receivers.

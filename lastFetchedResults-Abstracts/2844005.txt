Wireless radio links are generally half-duplex, i.e., they can either transmit or receive in a single channel but not both simultaneously. To achieve single band simultaneous bidirectional communication, full-duplex radio links are recently utilized in wireless networks. Adoption of OFDMA scheme in the full-duplex radio links has also stimulated new research interest to improve the wireless networksÂ´ transmission rate even further [1]. Typically, a full-duplex OFDMA network consists of a common base station (BS), and multiple users as transmitters (TXs) and receivers (RXs). To achieve a satisfying sum-rate in the network, the TXs and RXs need to be properly paired into separate transceiver units, and a suitable subcarrier should be assigned to each transceiver unit. The BS also allocates proper power level to each transceiver unit such that the rate performance of the whole network is maximized. Due to the combinatorial nature of pairing multiple TXs, RXs, and subcarriers, and also the complexity of optimal power allocation to each subcarrier-transceiver pair, resource allocation in such a full-duplex OFDMA network can be very challenging.

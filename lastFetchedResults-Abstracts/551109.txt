The main objective of this descriptive- survey research was to study the social capital's impact on citizen's participation in the affairs of Tehran forest parks. The statistical population of the study consisted of the most common and popular Tehran forest parks i.e. Chitgar, Lavizan, Taleghani and Sorkhehesar, out of which a sample of 205 visitors was selected using Cochran Formula and simple random sampling method. A questionnaire was used as the main tool of study. The validity of the questionnaire was approved by the judgment of a panel of experts. In order to measure the reliability of the questionnaire, Cronbach Alpha coefficients were computed for the main scales of the questionnaire (0/86 to 0/94). The data were analyzed by SPSS-win software. Correlation analysis revealed that there were significant and positive relationships between citizen's willingness for participation in Tehran Forest parks and social capital at 0/001 level. Results of ANOVA showed that willingness for participation in the executive affairs and managerial activities of forest parks were significantly different among citizens with different levels of social capital (at 0/005 level). Also seven variables were respectively interned in stepwise regression analysis and explained 66.2 percent of variances of citizen's willingness for participation in Tehran Forest parks. So participation and social capital have a bilateral relationship and as social capital increases, inclination to the participation in citizen also increases. Moreover focusing on social capital criteria and its indicators has an undeniable role in urban communities and their development purposes.

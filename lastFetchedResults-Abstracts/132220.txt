Objective(s): To assess the effectiveness of using visual esthetic elements in health education to prevent HIV exposure.
Methods: In the first phase of the study, we administered two questionnaires to students in Shiraz, International Imam Khomeini and Soureh Universities. The, first questionnaire (containing 16 items) assessed AIDS knowledge and the second contained questions accompanied by 3 pictures with real, abstract and symbolic designs. The second questionnaire was used as a tool to determine the impact of different graphic designs on subjects' perception of the health message. Dimensions covered by this assessment were "better comprehension", "greater effect" and "more rapid communication". The second phase of the study involved a reassessment of knowledge using the same 16-item questionnaire as in phase 1.
Results: Before-after tests in all three universities showed a significant effect of the visual message in promoting knowledge of AIDS and its transmission mechanisms (P<0.01). Real pictures produced higher scores on all the three dimension covered by the assessment process.
Conclusion: The nature of the message may be a more important factor than the reception process. The scarcity of resources for AIDS prevention in Iran highlights the importance of individual-level education for effective AIDS control.

We study the performance of bidirectional multi-relay cooperative networks in the presence of imperfect channel state information by means of the correlation coefficient of the estimated channel gains and their actual values, where the max-min relay selection is used. We show that the performance is determined by the average performance of the two links and neither of them dominates it individually. We also present a power allocation scheme that minimizes the outage probability.

Objective(s): To assess the burden of suicidal behaviors in Ilam, Iran.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. 606 cases of attempted completed suicide were reviewed. Burden calculation was done using the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) index.
Results: There was a total loss of 4891 DALY's lost in the Ilam population, equivalent to the crude rate of 9.7 per 1000. Women bore 64 percent of the total burden. The 20-29y and 10-19y age groups accounted for most of the total disease load (41 and 33 percent respectively). Unfortunately, suicidal burns represent 73 percent of total burden of suicidal behaviors.
Conclusion: We found a higher disease load in women while in the other studies such as WHO's Global Burden of Disease study (2000) it is the men who bear the greatest burden of suicidal behavior.

This paper presents an educational software package, FYPREL.EXE, that was developed for conducting sub-transmission system adequacy studies. The fundamental objective of the developed software is to simulate the basic system failure modes and assess the impact that fluctuating weather conditions have on a systemÂ´s overall reliability. Due to obvious advantages, the failure modes and effects analysis was implemented as the key evaluation technique. Two sets of indices, the basic load point and system performance indices, are used to assess the reliability. A series of studies were conducted using the developed software on a test system designated RBTS. Selected results from these studies are presented in the paper

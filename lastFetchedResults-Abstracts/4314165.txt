A new error resilient method based on data partitioning and unequal error protection for H.264 video transmission over wireless network is proposed in this paper. By introducing the Impact factor of Inter MB and &#961;-curve, the method further divides the C type partition into several subtypes according to their effects to error propagation, then unequal error protection are applied to each partition including that of A, B and C partition. The theoretical model of rate allocation and a fast bidirectional local search algorithm based on iteratively improvement are also presented. The simulation results show that our proposed approach can achieve better results than conventional H.264 coding method (about 0.2-0.6 dBÂ´s gain in PSNR) when transmitting over wireless channel and can obtain more graceful degradation with the increasing of packet loss rate.

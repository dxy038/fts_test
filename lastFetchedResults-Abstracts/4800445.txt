Video Stabilization is now considered an old problem which is almost solved but there are still some connecting problems which needs research attention. One of such issues arises due to multiple unstable videos streams coming from multiple sensors which often contain complementary information. To enhance system performance, instability should be removed in a single go rather than stabilizing each sensor individually. This paper proposes a cooperative video stabilization framework, VSAMS for multisensory aerial data based on robust boosting curves which encapsulate stability of high spatial frequency information as used by flying parakeets (budgerigars). For reducing shake and jitter and preservation of actual camera path, a multistage smoothing approach is visualized. Experiments are performed on multisensory UAV data which contains infrared and electro-optical video streams. Subjective and objective quality evaluation proves effectiveness of the proposed cooperative stabilization framework.

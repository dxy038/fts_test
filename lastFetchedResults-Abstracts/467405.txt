Objective: We compared the clinical outcome of cervical adenocarcinoma in Hispanic and white women to determine whether race was an independent predictor of survival. Study Design: All women who were diagnosed with cervical adenocarcinoma at three institutions between 1982 and 2000 were identified. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Hispanic and white cohorts were matched 1:2 for age, stage of disease, date of diagnosis, tumor size, histologic subtype, grade, and invasive depth. Results: The 65 Hispanic patients were more likely to be treated at the public hospital (71% vs 14%; P< .001) than the 122 matched white patients. Most Hispanic patients (72%) and white patients (76%) presented with early (stage IA-IIA), not advanced (IIB-IVB), disease. Early (81% vs 81%, P = .65), advanced (37% vs 26%, P = .21), and overall 5-year survival rates (67% vs 68%, P = .57) were similar among Hispanic and white patients, respectively. The relative risk of race on recurrence was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.56-2.42) and on survival was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.36-1.44). Conclusion: Hispanic race is not an independent predictor of survival in cervical adenocarcinoma. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:640-4.)

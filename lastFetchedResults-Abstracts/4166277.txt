A technique for spatially resolved chromatic dispersion measurement of installed optical fiber links is presented. The method is based on the analysis of bidirectional optical time-division reflectometer (OTDR) traces at different wavelengths obtained by a specifically designed tunable external source. Measurement accuracy is improved through a particular algorithm that corrects the OTDR nonlinearity error. Experimental data on spatially resolved chromatic dispersion of installed dispersion-shifted and nonzero-dispersion fibers are reported

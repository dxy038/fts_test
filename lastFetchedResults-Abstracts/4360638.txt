We propose a new architecture called Statistical Lambda Multiplexing Network (SLAMNet) for a future photonic network multiplexing hundreds wavelengths. The major objective of the SLAMNet is efficient use of network resources such as wavelengths and facilities. In the SLAMNet, optical channel (OCh) paths are managed in two logical layered networks in order to adapt to wide-range time-scale variations of offered traffic load. Based on the architecture, we also suggest an adaptive OCh path assignment mechanism that works without signaling processes. In this paper, we describe the proposed architecture and path assignment mechanism and furthermore, numerically evaluate their effectiveness

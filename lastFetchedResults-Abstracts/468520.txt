Objective: The technetium Tc 99mâ€“labeled monoclonal antibody MAb-170 was designed for diagnostic use in patients with gynecologic adenocarcinoma. Our investigation was initiated to verify its usefulness for radioimmunoscintigraphy of ovarian tumors. Study Design: Most of the 82 patients participating in this study underwent immunoscintigraphy before first-look surgery. Results: Radioimmunoscintigraphy recognized 36 of 41 patients with adenocarcinoma of the ovaries, corresponding to an overall sensitivity of 88%. Specificity was 90% (38/42). The calculation of accuracy gave a result of 89% (74/83). Of 110 known lesions, 92 were visualized successfully; thus the local-regional sensitivity was 84%. Of 160 benign tumor sites, 154 showed no evidence of tracer accumulation, corresponding to a local-regional specificity of 96%. The smallest lesion visualized was an adenocarcinoma of the corpus uteri with a diameter of 1.5 cm. Conclusion: The monoclonal antibody MAb-170 is a promising radiopharmaceutical for immunoscintigraphy of ovarian adenocarcinoma. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:513-7.)

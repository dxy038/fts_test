The objective of this paper is to provide an analysis of the amplitude statistics of Ku-Band SAR ground clutter data using Weibull, Gamma, K and lognormal distribution. Their goodness-of-fit have been carried out by Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test after the estimation of the distribution parameters. The results show that Gamma distribution approximates much better the value of the empirical probability density function(PDF) for the agricultural terrain;K distribution approximates much better the value of the empirical PDF for the grass terrains; Lognormal distribution approximates much better the value of the empirical PDF for the building and hurst blocks.

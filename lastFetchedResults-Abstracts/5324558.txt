The researches of evolvable hardware (EHW) have obtained much attention during the past decade. An effective evaluation-function is a crucial problem while searching a correct circuit. The emphasis of majority researchers´ experiments, however, was only circuit´s function, and little attention had been paid to circuit´s validity and practicality such as its complexity and stability. In this paper, an evaluation strategy based on multi-objective is proposed during the progress of evolvable analog circuit, in which many factors have been taken into account during the experiments besides the function. The results of experiments in the paper and practical lessons have indicated that only a circumspect circuit could meet the practical needs.

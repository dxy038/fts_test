Objective: NPQ scale and soft tissue tension were used as the main evaluations to observe the clinical efficacy of acupuncture treatment based on the concept of heart and gall bladder from TCM aspect for Neck Type of Cervical Spondylosis (NTCS). Methods: 73 cases meeting the inclusion criteria of NTCS were divided into the treatment group and control group by using the randomized controlled clinical trial design. 37 cases of the treatment group were treated with acupuncture treatment based on the concept of heart and gall bladder from TCM aspect, while 36 cases of the control group were treated with conventional acupuncture. Result: At the end of treatment, there was no significant difference (P&gt; 0.05) between two groups. In follow-up of 1 month, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P&lt;;0.05). In follow-up of 3 months, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P&lt;;0.05). Conclusion: The short-term effects of the acupuncture treatment based on the concept of heart and gall bladder from TCM aspect was equivalent with the control group, while the long-term efficacy was superior to the control group. Soft tissue tension can objectively evaluate the clinical efficacy of acupuncture treatment based on the concept of heart and gall bladder from TCM aspect for NTCS.

This work proposes a user-oriented approach as a basis for proper information visualization in the production automation area. A total consideration of the user consists of analyzing his tasks, context and profile. In order to implement this in the visualization process, an intelligent framework that is based on a multi agent system is developed. The advantage is that the tasks can be distributed to several small and manageable agents. The long term objective is to develop a working platform for the user-oriented information visualization.

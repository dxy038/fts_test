SNAP 10A, the first space nuclear reactor power system, was launched and brought to full power on April 3, 1965. The unit consists of a compact reactor, cooled by a liquid metal and coupled to a thermoelectric conversion system. The reactor uses a fully enriched uranium-zirconium hydride material as the combined fuelmoderator and beryllium as the reflector. The demonstration of one primary SNAPSHOT objective - verifying the safe and routine, transport, test and launch of a nuclear system, culminated in the launch at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Launch preparations began with the establishment of generalized procedures for the factory-to-flight sequence. A safety analysis followed, resulting in development of safety devices, administrative controls and emergency procedures. Training of the crew and the validation of the support equipment was accomplished by handling and testing usage in the operations at Atomics International. Further training, procedure verification and equipment validation was obtained by a trial shipment and by sending a test system through the operations sequence. SNAP 10A arrived at VAFB on February 16. After a brief reassembly and checkout period, it was transported to the launch pad. A double pad cycle was instigated to ensure safe and complete checkout. In the first cycle, the system mated to the Agena was subjected to a SNAP 10A-Agenalaunch complex compatibility test. A simulated flight test followed, wherein a complete launch through orbital startup sequence using the backup systems was checked. A second simulated flight test exercised the primary systems.

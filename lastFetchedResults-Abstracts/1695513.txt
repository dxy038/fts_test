The objective of this paper is to make the field of flame retardancy of polymeric materials more accessible. Herein, after presenting the fundamentals of polymer combustion, the main properties of flame retardants are pointed. Then common types of flame retardants are introduced in detail and the synergistic effects that can be achieved by combining different flame retardants will be referred. This phenomenon has tendency to optimize systems contained flame retardant additives and thus, improve the efficiency and mechanism of action. Generally speaking, polymer nanocomposites which are synthesized by carbon nanotubes and metallic oxide nanoparticles are highly recommended in literature. Such materials undoubtedly are the next generation of non-halogenated flame retardants. Based on the observations for polymer nanocomposites, it is quite clear that the nanoadditives can exert a definite flame retardant effect, appearing in the form of an increase in the time of ignition and a reduction in the peak heat release rate in cone calorimeter test and burning processes. Nowadays, as a method of fire protection for civil structures, chemical plants and other facilities, intumescing flame retardant coatings have had an increasing usage and their mechanism can be improved by synergistic agents, i.e. nanoparticles. Production of an effective char residue is critical in achieving a significant enhancement of the thermal and fire performance of the matrix. This is true whether a carbonaceous char forms or if only nanoadditive makes up the residue.

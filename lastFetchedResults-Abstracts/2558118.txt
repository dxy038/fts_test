Background: Indian tea industry workers are exposed to various exposures at their workplace.
Objective: To investigate the respiratory health of Indian tea industry workers.
Methods: We administered a respiratory questionnaire to and measured lung function in
workers of 34 tea gardens and 46 tea factories. We used correlation matrices to test the association
between their respiratory symptoms and lung functions.
Results: The garden workers complained of shortness of breath 3 times higher than the factory
workers. However, nasal allergy was more predominant among the factory workers compared
to garden workers (69.6% vs 41.2%, p=0.02). The factory workers had higher total
(median 107.3% vs 92.9%, p=0.05, as measured by R at 5 Hz) and peripheral airway resistance
(143.8% vs 61.1%, p=0.005, as measured by R at 5â€“20 Hz) than the garden workers.
Respiratory symptoms were inversely associated with airway obstruction as measured by the
ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) and
positively correlated with increased overall airway reactance among the workers.
Conclusion: Respiratory symptoms and increased allergen susceptibility of Indian tea industry
workers due to occupational exposures warrant routine systematic surveillance of their
workplace air quality and health monitoring.

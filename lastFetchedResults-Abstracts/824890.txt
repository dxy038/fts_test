As an extension of the disjoint paths problem, we introduce a new problem which we call the induced disjoint paths problem. In this problem we are given a graph image and a collection of vertex pairs image. The objective is to find image paths image such that image is a path from image to image and image and image have neither common vertices nor adjacent vertices for any distinct image.

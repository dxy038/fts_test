This paper will establish a comprehensive coordination model with the cost, quality and time limit for project, taking quality objective into consideration, using multi-attribute utility function theory and guiding by the highest benefit which is creative of the three objective of project. Besides, it will achieve objective weight as far as possible of every goal with AHM, which will respond to the degree of importance of every goal at maximum. Finally, the most satisfactory combination scheme is achieved by solving the model, which is as the control standard of the goal of project.

Background The accuracy of dobutamine echocardiography (DE) early after reperfused acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess whether in reperfused AMI DE can predict early as well as late regional and global spontaneous functional recovery. Methods  DE was performed in 157 patients (61 ± 11 years; 33 women) 3 days after AMI treated with successful direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3, residual stenosis <30%). All patients underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography and coronary angiography at 1 month and 145 (92%) at 6 months. Results Patency and restenosis rate were similar between those who did and did not respond to DE. DE showed a high accuracy in predicting both early and late regional functional recovery (86% and 81%, respectively). DE accuracy in predicting early and late reversible dysfunction was also high on a patient-by-patient analysis (89% and 87%). In DE responders left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 44% ± 9% at baseline to 57% ± 9% at 6 months (P < .00005), whereas only a slight, although significant improvement was found in nonresponders (from 40% ± 10% to 44% ± 12%; P  = .03). A significant correlation was found between the number of dobutamine-responder segments and the magnitude of their functional improvement at peak dobutamine and changes in ejection fraction (r = .72; P < .000001; r = .68, P < .000001, respectively). Conclusions  These data indicate that in patients with AMI in whom anterograde flow is fully restored without residual stenosis, DE can predict the recovery of regional function and whether a relevant change in ejection fraction will occur at early and late follow-up.

Ultrasonic evaluation of bone fracture healing has been recognized as an important assessment method which reflects material, mechanical and structural properties. The objective of the present study is to examine the monitoring role of quantitative ultrasound by conducting axial transmission measurements of the propagation velocity of the first arriving signal (FAS) for two dimensional numerical models and various excitation frequencies (0.1-1 MHz). The models were derived from scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). Although this is a preliminary study, the observed interaction between the FAS and the change in the material properties was quantified and the results give rise to the investigation of guided wave propagation, as well.

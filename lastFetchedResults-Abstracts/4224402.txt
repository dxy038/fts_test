This paper deals with multi-objective behavior coordination of multiple robots interacting with a quasi-ecosystem which is composed of insects and plants. In this ecosystem, there co-exist plants and insects according to specific reproduction rules. In general, the inhabiting area of each species is localized owing to geographical, climatic, and ecological factors. This indicates the population density of each species in one area is different from another according to local environmental conditions. In this study. multiple robots are introduced in order to maintain the ecosystem. Each robot takes actions based on multi-objective behavior coordination integrating several action outputs. However, the robot must select its suitable area in order to adapt to the current state of the quasi-ecosystem that might change dynamically. In this paper, we discuss target selection for insect removing and plant reaping behaviors through several computer simulations in a dynamically changing environment.

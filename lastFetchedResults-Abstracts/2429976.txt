The objective of this paper is the study of the inter-fibre/matrix failure under biaxial loading. In particular the influence at micromechanical scale of the presence of a secondary transverse load (tension or compression) perpendicular to the transverse tension nominally responsible for the failure is studied for all phases of the mechanism of damage. The Boundary Element Method is employed and Interfacial Fracture Mechanics concepts are used for the analysis of the results. The results lead to the conclusion that the presence of a compressive secondary load would promote failure whereas a tensile one would inhibit the mechanism of damage only slightly.

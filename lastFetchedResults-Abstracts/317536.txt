There are still no objective diagnostic criteria for macroglossia. The aims of this study were to examine the effect of reduction of the tongue on its position, and to suggest a standard measurement point for the objective diagnosis of macroglossia. Twenty-four patients were studied. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken with the tongue in the rest position, and preoperative and postoperative measurements were made on cephalometric lateral roentgenograms from all 14 patients with macroglossia and the 10 control subjects. The results suggested that measurement of length of the tongue, and the tongue area: oral cavity ratio on lateral cephalometric radiographs are useful in the more accurate diagnosis of macroglossia.

Bradyrhizobium strains TAL 169 and TAL 1371 (introduced) and strains ENRRI 16A and ENRRI 16C (local) were used to inoculate five guar cultivars, namely, HFG-75, HFG-182, HFG-363, HFG-408 and WB-195 in a factorial field experiment. The objective of the experiment was to study the effect of inoculation on yield, proximate analysis and mineral composition. Most of the Bradyrhizobium strains significantly increased yield, protein, crude fibre, and mineral content. The locally-isolated strains affected these parameters more than the introduced ones. This study revealed that inoculation with Bradyrhizobium strains improved yield and seed quality of guar.

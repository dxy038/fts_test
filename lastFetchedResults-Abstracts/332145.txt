Functional diversity and biopsychosocial state is a significant issue, which greatly influences elderly oral health and state of fixed and removable prostheses.

Objectives. The goal of the investigation was to evaluate the quality of fixed and removable prostheses in a group of elderly home residents in relation to the ADL index.

Methods. The group consisted of 175 institutionalised elderly, mean age 76.8 years. Special care need was assessed on ADL scale. To evaluate the quality and need for replacement of fixed and removable prostheses Karlsson's and modified Nevalainen et al. indices were used.

Results. Spearman's correlation analysis showed significant correlation of ADL index scores and both Karlsson's index values (ρ=−0.468, p<0.01) as well as for modified Nevalainen's indices (ρ=−0.572, p<0.01). Lower ADL score was correlated with poorer oral hygiene and condition of fixed or removable dentures. It was determined that 87% of the examined patients were in objective need of fixed, removable or combined prosthodontic treatment.

Conclusions. The study showed that lower ADL index scores of functionally dependent elderly patients correlate with poorer condition of fixed and removable prostheses and greater need of fixed, removable or combined prosthodontic treatment.

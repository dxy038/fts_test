Introduction: Spinal cord injury (SCI) stimulates an immune response that causes substantial secondary damage inside the injured spinal tissue.

Objective: To determine the immunomodulatory effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on traumatized spinal cord of rats.

Materials and Methods: Rats were randomly divided into three groups of 7 rats each as follows: negative control group, positive control group, and experimental group (50mg/kg EGCG, i.p., immediately after SCI). Spinal cord samples were collected 24 hours after injury and studied for immunoihstochemistry of CD4, TNF-alfa, IL-1Beta, iNOS and COX-2.

Results: Epigallocatechin gallate attenuated immunohistochemical expression of immune-related response criteria. Conclusion: On the basis of these findings, we propose that EGCG may be effective in protecting the rat spinal cord from secondary damage by modulating of immune responses.

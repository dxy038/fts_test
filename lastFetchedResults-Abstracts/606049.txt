Objective(s): Considering the increasing number of scientific associations in the past decade and potential role of them in public health, it was needed to design a new model of effective management by reviewing their functions to be close to the following objectives: 
- Create a common view for SAs  
- Create a common view for the members of a SA
- Change the view of community and government to the role of SAs.
- Use the model for planning and performance evaluation of association by the board.
Methods: This is a descriptive study; after review of scientific literatures and focus group discussion with presidents of several SAs, selected by the consultative council of SAS commission 5 functional domains and 48 critical success factors were listed in a conceptual framework. An open and closed questionnaire with likerts scores were defined and sent to the 115 SAs. 83 SAs (74%) replied on time. All the responses of open questions were categorized and analyzed in main domains and the result of closed questions were analyzed by the SPSS (V18).
Results: The six important factors in order are: continuous professional development plan (workshops, continuous education, congress and scientific meetings, short term courses), independent equipped facility, strategic and annual plan, and good member participation in SA elections, plans and monthly board meeting, membership of SA in national councils and committees, participation in setting related medical tariff, membership in international societies. All the SAs have considerable experiences in 5 functional areas and the "specialist's domain" were the first one. 
No significant relations were found for the other paternal exposure categories neither for the all maternal exposures categories with the risk of ALL in their offspring.
Conclusion: In this regard SAs constitution should be revised. 100% agreement of selected SAs with success factors showed that the capacity of SAs could be improved by advertising the designed model. Introducing the potential functions of SAs to policy makers and managers will change the governmental views for engaging them in governance issues as a prominent role.

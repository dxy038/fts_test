Battlefield situation assessment plays an important role in tactical decision making. An algorithm of battlefield situation assessment based on Bayesian network and rough set theory is presented in this paper. The model of battlefield situation assessment was constructed. Subjective assessment can be achieved by Bayesian network in uncertain circumstances according to the expertspsila knowledge and experience; Objective assessment can be achieved according to the evaluation rules derived from historical data by rough set theory. The method is designed to synthesize the results achieved by the two algorithms. Simulation result shows that the algorithm is effective and is able to reflect the real battlefield situation.

The objective of this work was to optimise different parameters (solvent concentration, time and temperature) for antioxidant extraction from kinema, demonstrated by total phenol content (TPC) and DPPH-scavenging activity (DSA), using response surface methodology. A central composite design was performed to determine the effect of solvent concentration (methanol, 30–100%), temperature (30–60 °C) and time (30–150 min) on the TPC and DSA of the extract. The solvent concentration and temperature had the most significant (p &lt; 0.05) effect. The optimum conditions for the TPC extraction and DSA were 100% methanol, 50 °C and 30 min, in which 140 mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) g−1 lyophilised extract and 52% DSA were predicted, while 135 mg GAE g−1 lyophilised extract and 56% DSA were experimentally obtained. No significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) was found between the experimental and predicted values of the response variables.

One of the biggest advantages introduced by the Smart Grid is the ability to efficiently and simply integrate renewable energy sources that appear to be intermittent because of their dependence on phenomena that are not constant but that are an important energy supply if properly exploited. The realization of a smart grid, however, requires an infrastructure able to handle almost instantaneous bidirectional communication between each node of the network. All this involves the management of huge data flows in terms of analysis and control, requiring a structure capable of handling responses in a very short time and an high level of global analysis to prevent or minimize problems. Successful negotiation and brokering on the Energy Market is an important prerequisite for achieving the advantages of Smart Grid. In this paper we present a Market for the sale of energy using a completely distributed approach based on P2P protocols and server-less technology, providing a greater level of security by exploiting the properties of this type of networks. We propose a scenario animated by three actors: Consumer, Producer and Market Manager.

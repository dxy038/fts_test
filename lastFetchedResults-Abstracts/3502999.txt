Given their broadcast nature, satellite communications are one natural engineering choice for multicast service deployment. In this paper, the throughput performance of transmission control protocol (TCP)-like multicast congestion control is analyzed in hybrid terrestrial/satellite networks. With this objective, an analytical framework based on Markov chains is introduced. The major advantage of the proposed analytical model is its scalability in that the number of states of the Markov chain modeling the system is independent of the number of receivers in the multicast session. This is a very important feature as simulation is unfeasible for large numbers of receivers. The framework is used to evaluate the impact of the long propagation delays, high bit-error rates, and channel asymmetry characterizing hybrid terrestrial/satellite communications. The performance results show that in certain cases, it is more convenient to divide the receivers in an appropriate number of groups and establish a different multicast session toward each of the above groups. Also, the convenience of an acknowledgment (ACK) flow reconstructor is shown.

Objective
This study was undertaken to compare the use of 2 different lecture evaluation forms developed for obstetrics and gynecology residents to evaluate core curriculum lectures given by faculty.
Study design
Content and delivery of faculty lectures were evaluated by residents using (1) a 10-question evaluation form that used a 5-point rating scale and (2) a checklist evaluation form that offered multiple options to improve lectures but provided no numerical score. Each form was used exclusively for 4 months. Faculty received feedback from both forms; then faculty and residents were surveyed regarding their preferences.
Results
A total of 384 rating scale and 398 checklist evaluation forms were completed during the study period. Residents preferred to complete the rating scale evaluation forms (67%), whereas faculty preferred feedback from the checklist evaluation forms (62%). Faculty were more likely to plan changes to their lecture format with feedback from the checklist evaluation forms (75% vs 25%, P = .031).
Conclusion
Although devoid of structured positive feedback, the checklist lecture evaluation form was preferred by faculty.

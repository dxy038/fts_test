Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in developing objective image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms that can measure the image quality consistently with subjective evaluations. For the full reference (FR) IQA problem, great progress has been made in the past decade. On the other hand, several new large scale image datasets have been released for evaluating FR IQA methods in recent years. Meanwhile, no work has been reported to evaluate and compare the performance of state-of-the-art and representative FR IQA methods on all the available datasets. In this paper, we aim to fulfill this task by reporting the performance of eleven selected FR IQA algorithms on all the seven public IQA image datasets. Our evaluation results and the associated discussions will be very helpful for relevant researchers to have a clearer understanding about the status of modern FR IQA indices. Evaluation results presented in this paper are also online available at http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/linzhang/IQA/IQA.htm.

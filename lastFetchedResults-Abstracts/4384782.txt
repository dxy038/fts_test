Changing the cross-sectional shape of superconducting field coils can reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the air gap magnetic flux density (AGMFD) for superconducting wind turbine generators (SWTG). This paper proposes an approach to optimize the cross-sectional shape of the superconducting field windings for SWTG to minimize the THD of the AGMFD. This approach is based on the response surface methodology (RSM) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO). The RSM is used to construct the objective function and the PSO is used to calculate the optimal value of objective function swiftly. The optimized results would be compared with the initial results and thus prove the validity and accuracy of this approach.

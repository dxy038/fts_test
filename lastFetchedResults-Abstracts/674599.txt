This paper introduces the research design matrix as a method of planning research projects. The research design matrix is a system of rows and columns into which the components of a research project fit, including the goal, objectives, definitions, hypotheses, variables, methods of analysis and anticipated conclusions. Thus, the matrix encapsulates the research design, or what the researcher intends to do in the investigation. Given the arrangement of the various concepts involved, a logic is imposed on the project from the beginning of the planning process.
The paper has three objectives. The first is to sketch out the background to the thinking underlying the research design matrix. The second is to develop a schematic framework for the research design matrix, defining terms and highlighting the flexibility that can be achieved in its use. The final objective is to present fully developed research design matrices for two research projects that have been successfully completed to give some idea in practice of the approach's viability and robustness.

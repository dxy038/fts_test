An online method for adapting the scaling factors of the fuzzy logic controller is presented. Since tuning these controllers is often not an easy task and very time consuming, the solution is to design an adaptive fuzzy controller. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to adapt the scaling factors according to a performance measure in order to fine tune the controller and improve the performance of the control system. An application example is presented for the temperature control of a heated air stream, the process trainer PT326

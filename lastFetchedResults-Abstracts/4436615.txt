The development of electric vehicles cannot be separated from charging infrastructures. At present, the construction of electric vehicle charging stations faces the problems on siting and sizing. This paper introduces the optimization process of the sizing and siting of electric vehicle charging stations, defines variables to represent the charging demand; abstracts the structure of road network to model and simulate with graph theory; solves the problem with Cplex. The objective of the model is to minimize the integrated cost of charging stations and consumers. The calculation results, using the data of Stockholm, Sweden, show that the method can effectively reduce the construction and operation costs, and facilitate user charging.

Background: According to age, history and physical examination findings, there are
different diagnoses including anatomic lesions for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). In
these conditions, hysteroscopy can be performed as a diagnostic and therapeutic
procedure.
Objective: The aim of this study was defining the diagnostic value of hysteroscopy in
evaluating uterine cavity in patients with AUB compared to pathologic findings.
Materials and Methods: This was a prospective descriptive-analytic study in which
hysteroscopy was performed for 105 patients with AUB .The patients were in
reproductive and perimenopausal (86.7%) or postmenopausal ages (13.3%).
Hysteroscopy was done and biopsy was taken from any pathology. After removing of
hysteroscope, dilatation and curettage were done. Both samples were sent for
pathologist. At the end, reports of hysteroscopic findings were compared with
pathologic results.
Results: Diagnostic value of hysteroscopy in evaluation of uterine cavity showed 100%
sensitivity, 80.5% specificity, 88.9% positive predictive value (PPV) and 100%
negative predictive value (NPV). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the
procedure for endometrial polyp were 93%, 100%, 100%, and 95.4%, respectively.
These results were respectively 100%, 96.4%, 88% and 100% for submucosal myoma,
and 25%, 89.7%, 12.5% and 93.3% for endometrial hyperplasia.
Conclusion: The results of this study show that hysteroscopy is a reliable method for
evaluation of AUB, especially in benign lesions such as endometrial polyp and
submucosal myoma and it can be used as the first line diagnostic method for these
abnormalities. However hysteroscopy without directed biopsy has insufficient value for
diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia.

A reliability study has been performed at Hydro One in 2009 to rank the different sections of a distribution feeder. The main objective of the study was to identify the most critical sections of the feeder so that investment decisions can be made effectively to improve their performance. The study assessment approach accounts for a number of factors that affect the ranking of the feeder sections. The factors include the feeder configuration, reliability performance of each section of the feeder, number of load points of the feeder and the number of customers at each load points. The purpose of this paper is to describe the study assessment approach and its application to the Hydro OneÂ´s distribution feeders.

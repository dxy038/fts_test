The design of the optimal fuzzy fractional-order PID controller is addressed in this work. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to design rule base and membership functions of the fuzzy logic systems optimally. Three conflicting objective functions in both time and frequency domains have been used in Pareto design of the fuzzy fractional-order PID controller. The obtained results reveal the supremacy of the proposed method in comparison with the fractional-order PID controllers.

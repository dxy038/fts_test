Objective
An investigation was conducted on 105 subjects to assess the existence of an association between mood psychopathology and bruxism.
Methods

Validated clinical criteria were used to diagnose bruxism and a self-report validated questionnaire (MOODS-SR) was filled out by each patient for an evaluation of depression and mania symptoms of mood spectrum.
Results

Prevalence of mood psychopathology, as identified by MOODS-SR scoreâ‰¥60, was significantly higher in bruxers (11/38, 28.9% vs. 6/67, 8.9%; P=0.007). Significant differences between bruxers and non-bruxers also emerged in total MOODS-SR (P=0.001) scores and in total scores of domains evaluating manic (P=0.001) and depressive symptoms (P=0.007).
Conclusions

Support to the existence of an association between bruxism and mood disorders has been provided. Further studies are strongly needed to clarify mechanisms underlying the described association.

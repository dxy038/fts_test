The present paper deals with the modelling and optimization of small bio-probes that can be used for
biological sensing; the bio-probes can be classified as MicroElectroMechnical Systems (MEMS). The
objective is to optimize the structure of the bio-probes in order to maximize the sensing sensitivity.
A biological coating results in a prestress on the sensing cantilever when certain molecules are present
in the surrounding medium. The mechanical deformation due to the biological material is modelled by
applying a prestress in the top layer of the bio-probes. Topology optimization is used to improve the
design. In the present work it is necessary to use an interpolation scheme different from the SIMP
(power law) approach which is usually used in topology optimization. In calculating the sensitivities,
needed for the optimization, complications due to the prestress occur, but also due to the coupling
between the elastic field and the electric field which both must be used in an integrated model. These
complications are dealt with and analytically obtained sensitivities are presented

This paper presents needle insertion forces for haptic feedback device in soft tissue. The force information from needle insertions is being measured by the sensor. The force feedback produced by the device can be used in robot-assisted percutaneous therapies. The objective of the work reported here is to design a device for reality-based data. Insertion force data was collected on chicken skin and meat. The needle insertion force is modeled in three parts; force due to capsule stiffness, friction and cutting. The data from model is compared with real time force data. From the simulation and experimental results, it is found out that the error between measured and modeled force converges.

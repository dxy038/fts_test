Objective: Human pluripotent stem cells are self-renewing cells with the ability to differentiate
into a variety of cells and are viewed to have great potential in the field of
regenerative medicine. Research in pluripotent stem cells holds great promise for patient
specific therapy in various diseases. In this study, pluripotent stem cell articles published
from 1991 to 2012 were screened and retrieved from Science Citation Index Expanded
(SCI-EXPANDED).
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, the publication trend, citation trends
for top articles, distributions of journals and Web of Science categories were analyzed.
Five bibliometric indicators including total articles, independent articles, collaborative articles,
first author articles, and corresponding author articles were applied to compare
publications between countries and institutions.
Results: The impact of top articles changed from year to year. Top cited articles in previous
publication years were not the same as recent years. "Induced pluripotent stem cell
(s)" and "embryonic stem cell (s)" were the most used author keywords in pluripotent stem
cell research. In addition, the winner of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2012,
Prof. Shinya Yamanaka, published four of the top ten most frequently cited articles.
Conclusion: The comprehensive analysis of highly cited articles in the stem cell field
could identify milestones and important contributors, giving a historic perspective on scientific
progress.

The application of fuzzy logic to the unit commitment problem is demonstrated. This method allows a qualitative description of the behavior of a power system, the systemÂ´s characteristics, and response without the need for exact mathematical formulations. It is demonstrated, through a numerical example, that a fuzzy-logic-based approach achieves a logical and feasible economical cost of operation of the power system, which is the major objective of unit commitment

Objective
To assess changes in knowledge and attitudes of adult groups before and after attending an educational presentation on adolescent sexual health.
Study design
A diverse group of adults attended the presentations and completed a presurvey and postsurvey containing 10 knowledge questions, 3 opinion questions, and demographics.
Results
Survey forms were completed by 3661 participants before and 3605 participants after 62 educational programs during the 2002 to 2003 school year. Adult participants consisted of school employees, adults attending parent presentations, health care professionals, adults at community presentations, and teachers. Presurveys revealed a significant lack of information by all groups, with health care professionals answering 37.9% and other adults answering 30.2% correct. All groups demonstrated significant (P = .0005) improvements in knowledge and a shift in attitude, favoring the delay of sexual activity until at least after high school from 94% before the survey to 98% after the survey (P< .0001) and the delay until marriage from 77% to 91.5% (P< .0001).
Conclusion
Educating adults on the ramifications of adolescent sexual activity results in significant increases in knowledge and the proportion who think teens should delay sexual activity.

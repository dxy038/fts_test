This article presents a simulation program in computer for the control of the voltage generated by a three-phase induction generator self-excited by capacitors and inductors controlled by thyristors, denominated reactive power controlled supply. The switching of the current that circulates for the inductor, in intervals of larger or smaller times, according to the reactive power need, it is made using control techniques. The control technique to be used is fuzzy logical or diffuse logic. The efficiency of the control system will be observed starting from the self-excitation of the generator, where settles down the permanent regime of voltage in emptiness. In this point the load will be varied in the terminals of the generator, being observed the control of the voltage in its terminals. The whole control system is made keeping constant the speed of the generator. For the control system simulation a mathematical model is used, developed in variables "abc", that includes the magnetic saturation in induction machines with specific application for the self-excited induction generator [Resende, JT, 1999], [Bispo, D., et al., November-December 2001]. It will also be made simulations with the control technique P(I)D for performance comparison techniques, with the objective of checking so the efficiency of the control fuzzy technique as its similarity with controller PD.

Nowadays, researchers make a choice of certain research method to investigate the surrounding phenomena. The quantitative approach has been dominant in inquiries of human sciences in recent decades. However, since all phenomena of human sciences, particularly those related to human behavior, cannot be observed through a completely objective method, the researchers have considered and examined quantitative inquiries and have proposed a method called "synthesis method" which is the combination of these two methods. The present paper tries to investigate two research approaches discussed in the methodology of human sciences. In this regard, it discusses and studies some of the problems and difficulties of quantitative inquiries which lead to their failure in researches conducted in human sciences.

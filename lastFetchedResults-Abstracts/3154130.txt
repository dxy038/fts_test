This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization algorithm of vector data compression in the basis of the traditional Douglas-Peucker algorithm and multi-objective optimization algorithm, which gets the optimal matching program of multi-objective optimization through the Pareto optimal set. This algorithm also solves the deficiencies of traditional Douglas-Peucker algorithm and makes a good compression effect.

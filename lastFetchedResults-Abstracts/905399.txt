Mangrove forests in many parts of the world are declining at an alarming ratedpossibly even more rapidly than inland tropical forests. The
rate and causes of such changes are not known. The forests themselves are dynamic in nature and are undergoing constant changes due to both
natural and anthropogenic forces. Our research objective was to monitor deforestation and degradation arising from both natural and anthropogenic
forces. We analyzed multi-temporal satellite data from 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s using supervised classification approach. Our spatiotemporal
analysis shows that despite having the highest population density in the world in its periphery, areal extent of the mangrove forest
of the Sundarbans has not changed significantly (approximately 1.2%) in the last w25 years. The forest is however constantly changing due
to erosion, aggradation, deforestation and mangrove rehabilitation programs. The net forest area increased by 1.4% from the 1970s to 1990
and decreased by 2.5% from 1990 to 2000. The change is insignificant in the context of classification errors and the dynamic nature of mangrove
forests. This is an excellent example of the co-existence of humans with terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal life. The strong commitment of
governments under various protection measures such as forest reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, and international designations, is
believed to be responsible for keeping this forest relatively intact (at least in terms of area). While the measured net loss of mangrove forest
is not that high, the change matrix shows that turnover due to erosion, aggradation, reforestation and deforestation was much greater than
net change. The forest is under threat from natural and anthropogenic forces leading to forest degradation, primarily due to top-dying disease
and over-exploitation of forest resources.

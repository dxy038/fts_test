This paper presents a dispersed-pulse codebook for CELP coder. This codebook generates an excitation vector by convoluting dispersion vectors with signed pulses in an algebraic codevector. The dispersion vectors are obtained through training so the coding distortion to be reduced. An objective evaluation result shows that the coding distortion with this codebook is smaller than that with an algebraic codebook. The dispersed-pulse codebook is applied to a 4 kb/s CELP coder. Subjective evaluation results show that: (1) the fundamental performance of the 4 kb/s coder is equivalent to that of G.726 32 kb/s coder, and (2) the performances of the 4k b/s coder under some error and background noise conditions are equivalent to those of G.729 8 kb/s coder

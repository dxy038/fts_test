Automotive embedded electronic systems have been increasing in power and complexity and, therefore, more advanced power electronic converters are necessary in these vehicles. Several dual-voltage (42 V/14 V) bidirectional converter architectures have been proposed for automotive systems in recent years. However, most of them have low efficiency or are based in series and parallel configurations with large number of semiconductors and magnetics devices. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a bidirectional high-efficiency converter with lower number of components. This converter was created by merging a switched-capacitor converter and a conventional bidirectional converter, resulting in a hybrid topology. The voltage across the semiconductors of the proposed converter is equal to half of the highest voltage source value. Furthermore, the topology is composed of only one inductor to control the power flow between the two voltage sources. To verify all the mentioned features, a prototype was implemented experimentally, reaching a maximum efficiency of 97.5%.

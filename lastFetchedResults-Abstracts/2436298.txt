In supply chain management, to build strategic and strong relationships, firms should select best suppliers by applying appropriate method and selection criteria. In this paper, to handle ambiguity and fuzziness in supplier selection problem effectively, a new weighted additive fuzzy programming approach is developed. Firstly, linguistic values expressed as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to assess the weights of the factors. By applying the distances of each factor between Fuzzy Positive Ideal Rating and Fuzzy Negative Ideal Rating, weights are obtained. Then applying suppliersâ€™ constraints, goals and weights of the factors, a fuzzy multi-objective linear model is developed to overcome the selection problem and assign optimum order quantities to each supplier. The proposed model is explained by a numerical example.

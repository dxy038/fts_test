This paper focuses on the research of the mapping between heterogeneous data models. And using ETL framework as references, it designs a bidirectional mapping strategy combining heterogeneous data model data mapping, conversion and loading. It analyzes and defines the mapping relations and mapping rules among the data models. Based on the metadata driven theory method, it designs the data mapping element model, and classifies the mapping relations to simple mapping and compound mapping according to the different complexities, with clearly giving the classification principle. This article also describes the bidirectional mapping relations, and analyzes the problems occurring in the bidirectional mapping.

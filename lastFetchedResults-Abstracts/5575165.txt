Summary form only. This tutorial will discuss in a simple way the underlying device physics, design principles and performance of our state-of-the-art top-of-line quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) used in spectroscopic, scientific, commercial and military application as well as exciting recent results such as multi-wavelength and bidirectional QCLs.

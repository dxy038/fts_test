Objective This study estimated the
incidence of suicide mortality among suicide attempters
in Taiwan and assessed the extent of means
substitution among subjects with a non-fatal attempt
and a subsequent fatal attempt during the study
period. Methods A total of 5,261 suicide attempters
registered in a surveillance system of a metropolitan
catchment area from 2004 to 2005 were followed
through 2005. Linkage to the death certification system
revealed that 72 died by suicide. The association
of completed suicide with the suicide method used at
index attempt was examined using Cox proportional
hazards regression. Incidence rate for the subsequent
lethal suicide was estimated based on life tables. Results
The 1-year incidence rate of suicide mortality
was 0.017: 0.026 in males and 0.013 in females. There
was a strong association between burning charcoal as
the method used at the index attempt (relative hazard
= 4.1, P < 0.001) and completed suicides. Those
who used the method of burning charcoal at the index
attempt frequently used the same means in a subsequent
attempt leading to suicide mortality. However,
a majority of suicide completers (59.1%) who
died by burning charcoal had used a different method
at their index attempt. Conclusions Persons who attempt
suicide by charcoal burning are a high-risk
group for completed suicide. Those who burned
charcoal in a suicide attempt were likely to use the
same method in a later lethal attempt, and charcoal
burning was a frequent cause of death among those
who used different methods in earlier attempts.
Charcoal burning should be a target for suicide prevention
efforts.

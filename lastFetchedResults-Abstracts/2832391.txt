The satellite range scheduling problem between small satellites and academic ground station network is researched in this paper, by analysing the feature of the network scenario, model the SRS problem and countering the low-cost, non-profit and increased conflict contact windows characteristics of academic ground network, define the fair function and give proof that the theory is reasonable, using genetic algorithm to find an optimal solution. By analysing the relay satellite and its possibility to support the assistant communication, extract the redundant fraction time due to the contact windows confliction to augment the final optimization objective value. Computational examples show the validity of the approach.

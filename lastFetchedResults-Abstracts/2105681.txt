The humoral immune response induced by ISCOM-matrix (Immuno Stimulating COMplex-Matrix)-adjuvanted equine influenza virus (EIV) vaccine is well documented in horses. ISCOM-matrix adjuvanted vaccines against human influenza are strong inducers of cell-mediated immunity (CMI), including T cell proliferation and virus-specific cytotoxic T cell. In the horse, the CMI response to equine influenza vaccination is less well characterised. An ISCOM-based vaccine has been shown to induce interferon gamma (IFN-γ) synthesis, a CMI marker, in the horse, but this has not been shown for the ISCOM-matrix vaccine, which is a different formulation. The objective of this study was to measure EIV-specific IFN-γ synthesis after vaccination with an ISCOM-matrix-adjuvanted EIV vaccine. Equilis Prequenza is a commercialised inactivated EIV vaccine containing purified haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subunits adjuvanted with ISCOM-matrix. Six influenza-naïve Welsh mountain ponies were vaccinated twice with Equilis Prequenza at an interval of four weeks. Six control ponies received a placebo of physiological water. EIV-specific IFN-γ synthesis by peripheral blood lymphocytes and the antibody response to a panel of representative EIV isolates were measured prior to and after both injections. Immunisation with the ISCOM-matrix-based EIV vaccine stimulated significant EIV-specific IFN-γ synthesis and EIV-specific single radial haemolysis (SRH) antibody. In conclusion, EIV vaccine adjuvanted with ISCOM-matrix stimulates both antibody and a cellular immune response in the horse.

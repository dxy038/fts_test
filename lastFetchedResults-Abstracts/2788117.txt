This study describes and analyzes social networks and perception of social support of a group of young mothers affected by winter 2010. The objective was to determine the relationship between the structural and functional characteristics of social networks measured by the questionnaire of Analysis of Personal Networks and social support of Maya Jariego, I. &amp; Holgado, D. (2005). In the analysis of the results correlations of the R of Pearson were done in order to prove the relations between variables. The results of this study show a strong and statistically significant correlation between network measures and social support resources: High levels of support were correlated with moderate indicators of centrality of networks. Families are the most important sources of support for young mothers to recover from the disaster.

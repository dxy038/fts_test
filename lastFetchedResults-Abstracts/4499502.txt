Current plans call for two separate missions to deploy Medipix2-Technology-based detectors in space for the first time. NASA is planning to deploy 5 or more Radiation Environment Monitor (REM) units, each of which will contain a Medipix2 TimePix-based detector assembly, on the International Space Station (ISS) during the spring of 2012 as part of a Station Detailed Test Objective (SDTO). These units will be mounted on a single 8-layer printed circuit board containing a USB-based interface. The entire unit will have the form of a typical USB flash-memory device, and the USB interface will provide interactive control and data readout as well as the operating power. Each of the units will be separately plugged into one of the 21 Lenovo&#174; T-61B laptops that are currently onboard the ISS. The purpose of this test is to acquire initial on-orbit data to allow feedback into the design of the next generation of Medipix device, which is intended to support the development of a portable, standalone, wireless and battery-powered personal space radiation dosimeter. The second mission, LUCID (Langton Ultimate Cosmic ray Intensity Detector) is part of a UK outreach project being conducted by the Simon Langton School for Boys in Canterbury, UK. A small instrument containing 5 detector assemblies, also containing the TimePix versions of the Medipix2 technology will be deployed on the upcoming UK TechDemoSat 1 mission, also planned for launch in 2012. These deployments have many similar embedded control software and ground-based analysis software requirements.

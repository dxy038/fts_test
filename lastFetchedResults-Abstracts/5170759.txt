This paper presents the implementation of the event-driven Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), which is used for environmental monitoring using soil moisture sensors. The problem faced is that the current Wireless Soil Sensor Networks are not reactive to the weather conditions around it. Which means it takes reading samples at constant rate throughout its operation. So, the aim is to design a system that takes soil samples only when it is triggered by an outside event, which in this case study involves the event of rain. The objective of this paper is to develop a wireless sensor network by modifying the programs that run the sensor networks and interfacing the motes with external sensor. The wireless sensor network system that was developed has variable sampling rates with interfaces to Soil Sensors and Rain Gauge. The developed system would provide an applicable system that can be used in the agriculture industry for monitoring large estates, landslide detection and flood warning systems.

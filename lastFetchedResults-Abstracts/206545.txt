Game theory , for the first time at least in Iran , is considered in modeling the conflicting objectives of competitors in crude oil exporting. Competitors, in this research are Iran , Saudi Arabia , and all of others as one player . Iran and Saudi Arabia are considered to be the major competitors because of their similarity in marketing and crude oil quality.
In addition to objective functions , there are general and specific constraints for the players. Objectives' achievements also depend on oil market conditions , economic growth , pricing strategies, the competitors and the consumer strategies.
In the meantime the .future forecasting for Iran 's crude oil market is crucial in relation to what Saudi Arabia will do. To analyze the above conflicting strategies , regression analysis is used to determine the relation of variables and then a proposed method in game theory is applied.
The proposed method merges continuous N-persons and Sum constant games in modeling and solving.
The results shore that the share of crude oil market for Iran will decrease in the future. So we propose to increase the oil production because of Iran's economically dependence on selling of crude oil and increasing of OPEC power in beyond the years of 2010 .

Objective: The aim of this survey was to assess the evaluation, management, and future recommendations of patients with the diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy and to evaluate the interest in the creation of a prospective database regarding this rare disorder. Study Design: A total of 116 surveys were sent to major teaching institutions in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Crete, and South Korea after a national conference held at the National Institutes of Health regarding peripartum cardiomyopathy. This was an open-ended survey containing 17 specific questions regarding this disorder and its management. Results: A total of 78 (67%) maternal-fetal specialists responded to the survey. Diuretics and digoxin were used as first-line treatment for this disorder. Only 6% used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy. Fifty-eight percent of the perinatologists (58%) recommended either intrauterine contraceptive devices or foam and condoms, whereas oral contraceptives (progesterone-only pill or estrogen-progesterone mix) were recommended in 23% and 41%, respectively. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the respondents would recommend future pregnancy if ventricular function returned to normal. Conclusions: Fundamental clinical and basic research is lacking regarding this rare but potentially devastating disorder. Major teaching institutions do not have significant numbers of patients with this disorder to provide concrete recommendations, and starting a database will be useful in the gathering of important epidemiologic information. A secondary aim of such a registry would be to establish a repository for tissue and blood samples to answer basic mechanistic questions about this disorder. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:315-9.)

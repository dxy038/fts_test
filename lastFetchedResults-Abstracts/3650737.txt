Network survivability is a key concern in todayÂ´s network, and will become increasingly important in future optical networks as they carry ever more traffic. Networks are also becoming more complex, with the requirement for increased functionality. Currently, there is a lack of understanding in the industry as to the exact relationship between the choice of network architecture and the meeting of a set availability objective. This paper analyses a number of long-haul network architectures from an unavailability point of view. The long-haul networks analyzed include: networks with diversity, networks with restoration capability, and networks with survivability. Derivations are given for each architecture; formulas for 2 and 4-fiber rings, and dual fed routing are new. A hypothetical reference connection (HRX) and its unavailability objectives are used as references. Networks with restoration capability and networks with survivability meet the proposed objective. Self-healing rings (both 2 and 4-fiber bidirectional line switched rings) and dual fed systems offer the highest level of survivability, by eliminating service impacts caused by cable cuts and equipment failures

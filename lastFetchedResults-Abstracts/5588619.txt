Chloride Ions seriously corrodes steel surfaces and damages concrete - it results in inferior quality reinforced concrete and extremely affects the safety of entire structures. Consequently, the examination of Chloride Ions within reinforced concrete is an important test item in a complete quality control procedure. To effectively check the concentration of Chloride Ions in concrete, the evaluation process must be able to present high accuracy and precision. However, the existing evaluation modules generated by laboratory data for Chloride Ion experiments are not objective enough to attain reliable results with accuracy and consistency for each sample. Thus, an evaluation algorithm with capability and the concept of six sigma to define indices of precision degree (&#948;), accuracy degree (&#947;) and the objective evaluation method, proposed by Sung and Vannman are quoted in this paper. Herein, the principle of statistics is substituted by an index of unbiased estimators and equations and an inspection capability analysis chart, proposed in this paper, to analyze examination tools as to whether they hold precision, accuracy degrees and application functionality or not to measure Chloride Ion concentration in reinforced concrete.

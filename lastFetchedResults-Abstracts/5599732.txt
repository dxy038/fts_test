For a class of uncertain linear systems with uncertainties which do not matching conditions, the conservatism for satisfactory fault-tolerant control with multi-objective constraints is produced. Firstly, by exploiting the Projection Lemma, the extend LMI constraint conditions of the circular pole index, H<sub>&#8734;</sub> index and H<sub>2</sub> index are presented. Secondly, under a continuous fault model of the actuator, the design method of satisfactory fault-tolerant controller with extend multi-objective constraints is presented. This method leads to the use of different Lyapunov variables to deal with the multi-objective constrained control problem, and then reduces the design conservatism. Finally, the simulations indicate the validity of the proposed methods.

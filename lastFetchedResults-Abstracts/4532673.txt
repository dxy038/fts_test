The main purpose of this work is to analyze the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methodologies used in noninvasive clinical investigation, with the aim of reducing the time of acquisition by assuring a good quality of the images. This objective is of fundamental importance to both increase the number of clinical tests produced with this equipments and to reduce the radiation doses in the patients. For this purpose the parameters influencing the time acquisition and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were investigated and a software platform to optimize the imaging time acquisition was developed. This work was carried out in collaboration with Martina Franca (Italy) Hospital. Tanks to the staff of this sanitary structure it has been possible to get the necessary material for the correct development of the simulation algorithm and the sample images on which the algorithm has been applied and verified.

The role of the WorldÂ´s forests in climate regulation is now widely recognised and mechanisms are in place to use forests in influencing the carbon cycle. The scale of the phenomenon has made the estimation and mapping of forest parameters a global/national level priority. Remote sensing is the only effective means available to provide the needed information at the relevant scales. The objective of this research is to explore the potential of CHRIS/Proba imagery directional resolution in improving tree biomass mapping accuracy in savannas. The study preliminary results presented here focus on evidence of correlation between tree biomass and Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) fields computed from CHRIS data.

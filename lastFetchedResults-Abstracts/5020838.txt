Tactical antenna installations contain a multitude of collocated antennae, installed on a common mast. It is not uncommon to have installations containing dozens of VHF and UHF antenna operating simultaneously, with the need for minimal coupling and the consequent interference between them. The objective of this paper is to address the issue of the preferred configuration for the installation of collocated Tactical VHF (30 to 88 MHz) dipole antenna installed on a common mast. Method of moments analysis is used for determining the decoupling between antennae in the different configurations, and practical recommendations for tactical antennae installations are thus derived

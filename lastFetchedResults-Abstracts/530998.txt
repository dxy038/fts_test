Background: Herbal medicines have been used since ancient times for treatment of a range of diseases and have represented stimulatory effects on the function of innate immunity. Objective: To evaluate the effects of Zataria multiflora (Z. multiflora) on the function of innate immunity including phagocytic activity and TNF-α secretion in animal model. Methods: Eight BALB/c mice were divided into two equal groups. In group A, Z. multiflora essence was injected intraperitoneally to the mice, in group B, distilled water was injected. Blood was obtained from 4 mice in each group, 4 and 7 days following injection. The amounts of  phagocytosis (respiratory burst) and TNF-α secretion were assessed by chemiluminescence and ELISA method, respectively. Results: Significant increase in phagocytosis and TNF-α secretion was observed in group A compared with the control group at days 4 and 7. Conclusion: Z. multiflora essence can remarkably stimulate innate immunity function and it may be used to immunize individuals alone or in combination with other immunostimulatory agents

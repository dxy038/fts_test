The increased uncertainty of the electric grid due to the penetration of renewable energy sources and deregulation of the electric market is aimed to be alleviated by demand response (DR) in the future smart grid. The demand-side resources can be incentivized to alter their consumption patterns by varying their electricity price over time. A major residential energy demand contribution is from electric heating, which, when combined with smart energy storage using water heaters, could be utilized to defer consumption to more inexpensive periods without affecting the customerÂ´s thermal quality of service. The objective is to optimize the consumer electricity price of electric storage space heating customers, in order to maximize the profit of the retailer. This approach of varying the customer electricity prices leads to a game-theoretic scenario, where the procurement and consumption profiles of the retailer and consumer agents are based on the set electricity price. The optimization of the consumer electricity price is shown to offer lesser expense for the retailer. In addition, hourly load-following can be improved by offering further discounts for the consumers.

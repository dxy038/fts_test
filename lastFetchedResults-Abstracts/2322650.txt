Inroduction & Objective: Physiological aspects of marine gastropod Peronia peronii as a true slug, guide us to study on its antifreeze peptides. 
Materials and Methods: Sampling was carried out during spring of 1391 in southern coast of the Qeshm Island. As we need a minimum natural changes for peptides extraction , samples moved to the lab alive. All body homogenized in liquid nitrogen after pull out the viscera. The extract passes through 10KD falcon filters then used for further purifications with RP-HPLC. 
Results: The results shown one of the HPLC fraction has antifreeze properties; freezing point is -41.2°c (average), melting point is -23.5°c (average) and 84.4 °c belong to boiling point. BSA with same concentration used as a control. 
Conclusion: The most probably aspect for existing these kinds of peptides may refer to adaptation of these gastropods for cold season. 

Key word: Peronia peronii, Marine Gastropod, Antifreeze Peptides, RP-HPLC, Persian Gulf.

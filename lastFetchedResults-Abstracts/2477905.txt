Background and objectives: Perchloroethylene (PCE) is categorized as contaminant of concern because of its adverse health effects and persistence in drinking water resources. Permeable reactive barrier with zero valent iron (ZVI-PRB) is a passive zone in which chlorinated ethenes are degraded in situ through the chemical reduction mechanism. The objective of the present investigation was optimization and modelling of ZVI-PRB technology for the elimination of PCE from the aqueous environment using response surface methodology. Materials and methods: In order to simulate ZVI-PRB, a column filled with silica sand and ZVI was used. effects of three variables including pH, column height or barrier thickness and flow on reductive dechlorination efficiency were assessed. Design of experiment, modelling, and data analysis were carried out using response surface method. Results: The dechlorination efficiency was about 93% under optimum conditions (pH=5, 26 cm column height and 2 mL/min flow rate). The ascending trend of pH along the column revealed that the reductive condition was dominant within the column. The R2 value of 0.98 also indicated good fitness of the experimental results and model predictions. Conclusion: Based on the results, ZVI-PRB technology has high efficiency in dechlorination of PCE. Likewise, regarding to no need of energy consumption, abundance of iron, no production of harmful by-products and cost-effectiveness, ZVI-PRB is propounded as a stable, green, and environmental friendly technology in groundwater remediation.

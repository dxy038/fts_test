Although the technology has only reached the proof-of-concept stage, new 3DTV sets have already introduced the concept of converting 2D video and image content for 3D viewing. Given that the key differentiator and ultimate success factor is visual quality, it requires advancing from the objective of generating an acceptable stereo pair from a monoscopic source to generating a robust conversion of a multiplicity of 2D contents using a seamless combination of depth analysis and stereo view generation algorithms. In this paper we discuss the interlocked technical and visual quality requirements of a general conversion method and the key R&amp;D issues that we believe need to be solved in order to succeed in the CE market.

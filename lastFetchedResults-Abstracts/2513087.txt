Objective: In this study, we sought to better understand the immunoregulatory function
of stem cells derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED). We studied the role
of the interferon gamma (IFN-?)-indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-axis in immunoregulation
of SHED compared to bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs)
under the same conditions.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, recently isolated human T cells
were stimulated either by mitogen or inactivated allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs). These T cells were subsequently co-cultured with, either SHED or
BMMSCs in the presence or absence of 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-MT) or neutralizing antihuman-
IFN-? antibodies. In all co-cultures we evaluated lymphocyte activation as well as
IDO activity.
Results: SHED, similar to conventional BMMSCs, had anti-proliferative effects on stimulated
T cells and reduced their cytokine production. This property of SHED and BMMSCs
was changed by IFN-? neutralization. We detected IDO in the immunosuppressive supernatant
of all co-cultures. Removal of IDO decreased the immunosuppression of BMMSCs.
Conclusion: SHED, like BMMSCs, produced the IDO enzyme. Although IFN-? is one of
inducer of IDO production in SHED, these cells were not affected by IFN-? in the same
manner as BMMSCs. Unlike BMMSCs, the IDO enzyme did not contribute to their immunosuppression
and might have other cell-type specific roles.

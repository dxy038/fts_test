In 1990’s  we witnessed the  revision of almost  all scientific, philosophical, and artistic areas in human knowledge, for this reason, the view of urban renovation and restoration was changed compared with that of previous decades when a minor attention was paid to urban regeneration issues. Considering the past of historical identity of different period, it has a new identity consistent with conditions of today’s life on its agenda. Accordingly, urban regeneration becomes a comprehensive concept, a concept that considers improvement and rehabilitation of old textures in all economic, physical, social, and cultural dimensions. This research is a comparative study of regeneration of Khayam texture of Tehran, and Liverpool 1 in  the UK, because both samples are located in central texture of the city, and their surrounding textures has identity-related values. Regeneration plan for Liverpool 1 project (2008) was recognized as the Europe’s best regeneration project, and Khayam block redevelopment project (Tehran) is also the largest recreation plan conducted by Tehran municipality after Islamic Revolution. This comparison aims to study objectives and measures in the two plan, the reasons behind the success of Liverpool 1, non-realization of predetermined objectives in regeneration of Khayam, and finally, provision of solutions for realization of predetermined objective of Khayam texture. The result is that adoption of short term and temporal policies, with consistent and prearranged planning, and lack of public participation from the beginning to the end, and failure to consider historical identity and position of Khayam texture resulted in failure of Khayam regeneration. Descriptive-analytical and comparative research method was used. Data collection was conducted by documentary, library and field observation method.

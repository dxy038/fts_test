The paper summarises several modelling applications of distributed energy resources (DERs) for various purposes, and describes the related operational issues regarding the complexity of the future distribution grid. Furthermore, a multi-level functioning interface framework is proposed for DER modelling. This framework clarifies the levels of details, and provides a service/control-objective oriented guideline on mapping modelling details. Meanwhile, it enables interfacing cross-domain mechanism inside DERs (e.g., thermal dynamics, chemical process, etc.) into the electrical world. The information mapping for photovoltaic panel (PV) modelling is also provided as an example.

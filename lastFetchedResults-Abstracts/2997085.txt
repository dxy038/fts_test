Presents a translation procedure from time Petri nets (TPN) to linear logic with the objective of enhancing the presentation and reasoning ability of TPN. TPN are described by defining the translations in Petri nets using the connectives in linear logic, and firing rules in TPN are defined using linear logic. The behavior of TPN can be constructed and temporal reasoning can be achieved using the rules we defined. The behavior of TPN can be analyzed clearly using the method in the paper

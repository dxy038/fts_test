Evaluation has become a more significant component of planning and delivering extension programs, as federal partners and granting agencies are requesting information on program and integrated grant outcomes, including participant learning gains, behavior change, and program-generated impacts. Effective evaluation of equine extension programs involves a balance between asking enough well-designed questions to obtain desired information and keeping the evaluation tool brief enough to encourage participant completion. For most faculties, the difficulty with evaluation lies in developing appropriate and useful questions. The objective of this article was to share examples of questions successfully used to evaluate six key equine extension program areas: participant demographics, program logistics, participant behavior change, participant knowledge gain, teaching effectiveness, and program impact. Data generated by postprogram evaluations can be a source of statistically sound information that can be shared with administration, stakeholders, and granting agencies. Extension personnel can use evaluation data to improve planning and delivery of extension programs and to demonstrate teaching ability and program impacts.

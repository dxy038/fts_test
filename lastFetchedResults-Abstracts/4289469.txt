In this paper, the design and neural implementation of a vision based multi-lane highway lane recognition system are presented. The design objective of the system is to recognize the lane which a test vehicle is currently driving through by determining its left and right lane boundaries. When the proposed lane recognition system was tested it showed very high percentage of correct results in very difficult circumstances which suggests that it provides the basis for a reliable road following system

On September 5, 1985, the NRSC adopted a resolution to study proposals to standardize AM transmission preemphasis and AM receiver deemphasis with the objective of establishing an industrywide AM preemphasis/deemphasis voluntary standard. After twelve months of study, on September 10, 1986 the NRSC released a draft voluntary standard that proposed a specific AM preemphasis/deemphasis curve as well as a 10 kHz standard AM bandwidth. The bandwidth specification evolved from NRSC deliberation on the causes and cures of AM interference, and ways to technically encourage the production of higher fidelity AM receivers. After a three month public comment period, the NRSC, on January 10, 1987, formally adopted this standard and authorized its publication by the National Association of Broadcasters and the Electronics Industries Association.

The objective of this paper is to improve the knowledge on directional channel characteristics at the base station, particularly concerning elevation. For this purpose a channel measurement campaign has been performed. A powerful new method for super-resolution channel estimation has been used to get a detailed picture of the directional characteristics of the channel. This has further led to improved knowledge of when processes like diffraction over rooftops and/or specular reflections are important. The findings herein have been incorporated into a model for the elevation angle dispersion which is proposed as an extension to some commonly used directional channel models such as the ITU-IMT-Advanced model.

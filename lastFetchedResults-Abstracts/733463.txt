Objective
This study aimed to assess whether changes in leisure-time physical activity over 3 years are associated with changes in health-related quality of life.
Method

Among the adults enrolled in the Supplementation en VItamines et Min√©raux Antioxidants study in France, 3891 completed the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire to assess leisure-time physical activity and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form to assess health-related quality of life in 1998 and 2001. Multivariate analyses involving logistic and linear regressions determined the association between changes in leisure-time physical activity and changes in health-related quality of life.
Results

Over 3 years, increased leisure-time physical activity was associated with high scores in health-related quality of life dimensions: physical functioning, mental health, vitality for both sexes as well as social functioning for women only. An increase of 1 h per week of leisure-time physical activity was associated with a 0.17- and 0.39-point increase in the vitality dimension in men and women, respectively. The mental component score was also increased in women increasing their leisure-time physical activity.
Conclusion

The long-term association between leisure-time physical activity and health-related quality of life changes is limited and has little clinical significance, especially for men and for the physical health-related quality of life dimensions. The long-term association needs to be further explored before formulating public health recommendations.

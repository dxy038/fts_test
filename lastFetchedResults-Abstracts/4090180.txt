This paper presents a positive approach in an optimized design of a combinatory unified power-quality conditioner (UPQC) and superconducting fault current limiters (SFCLs). This is based on a normalized simulated annealing algorithm compared with analytic hierarchy process objective optimization. The optimization algorithm for simultaneous optimization computes and produces three-dimensional alignments in Pareto front at the end of the optimization run. The results show that the SFCL can reduce the volt-ampere rating of the UPQC by limiting the fault current, thereby reducing the cost of UPQC installation. The aforementioned algorithm requires advanced numerical techniques for simulation studies by PSCAD/EMTDC on a sample distribution system for determining a global optimal combination of UPQC and SFCL by considering individual parameters and accounting for the constraints, which is the main motivation of this paper. This will result in a more thorough knowledge of &#8220;scaling factors&#8221; and the system quality mechanism which will enable the most efficient systems from the viewpoints of cost cutting, energy savings, and downsizing.

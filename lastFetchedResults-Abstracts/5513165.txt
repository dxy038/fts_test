DG technology is penetrating the distribution networks continuously and changing the patterns of distribution load flows and system operations. In the paper, the planning of DG in distribution systems would be investigated from both the perspectives of independent DG investors and the distribution company or network operator, considering the characteristics and operation constraints of distribution systems, the benefits from deferring the expansion of distribution system, and the savings from the reduction of distribution losses. The Particle Swarm Optimization and Compromise Programming techniques are utilized to resolve the bi-objective planning of DG in distribution systems. An 8-bus radial distribution network is used for simulation and verification of the proposed method.

The main objective of this paper is to minimize the 120 Hz output ripple component and improve the dynamic response of an AC-DC single-stage power factor correction (PFC) buck-boost converter by using a new control scheme. In the paper, the operation of the single-stage converter is briefly reviewed and the proposed control method is introduced and explained in detail. Key design considerations for the design of the converter controller are discussed and the converterÂ´s ability to operate with fixed DC bus voltage, low output ripple and fast dynamic response is confirmed with experimental results obtained from a prototype converter.

The objective of the paper is to explore the use of the World-Wide Web as an adjunct to normal traditional course delivery. The Web site will involve laboratory safety and will impact students in chemistry, physics, biology, integrated circuit technology and, in general, any lab based course. The Web site was developed through a team approach. The team employed two faculty members, one graduate student and one undergraduate student. The team also employed the most recent creation platform (COSMIC CREATE) technology developed by our partner in the project Silicon Graphics Inc. During the test phase of the project the Web site was used as an Internet site and involved only students at Howard. Once developed in its beta form, it will be available to the entire academic community some time in the fall semester of 1996

Objective: Vasectomy, though in some cases are being confronted with irreversibility, has been accepted as an effective contraceptive method. It is estimated that near 2-6% of vasectomised men ultimately show a tendency to restore their fertility.  In some cases, vasectomy
has been considered as
an
irreversible procedure
due to many
post-vasectomy complications
causing
this debate. The
aim of present study was to investigate the
pattern of
expression
of
galectin-3,
an
inflammatory
factor
secreted
by
macrophages
and
immune

cells,
following the vasectomy in mice testis tissue.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, twenty mature male Balb/c mice, aged two months, were divided into two equal groups: sham and vasectomised groups (n=10). They were sacrificed four months after vasectomy, while the pattern of galectin-3 expression was investigated using a standard immunohistochemistry technique on testicular
tissues. Stereological analyses
of testes parameters in vasectomised and
shamoperated
groups were compared by mixed model analysis.
Results: Based on observations, although galectin-3 was not expressed in sham-operated
group, it was expressed in 40% of testicular tissues of vasectomised mice, like: seminiferous
tubules,
interstitial
tissues
and
tunica
albugina.
Also,
our
result
showed
a
significant

alteration
in
number of
germ and
sertoli
cells
of
testicular tissue
in vasectomised group
in

comparison
to
sham-operated group.
In addition, the
result of mixed model
method
confirmed
a significant reduction in germ and sertoli cells of vasectomised group.
Conclusion: The expression of galectin-3 at different parts of testicular tissue in vasectomised
group
is
higher than
sham group.
This
express illustrates
the
increase of
degenerative
changes
and
inflammation
reactions
in
testicular
tissue,
leading
to
chronic
complications
and infertility,
after the vasovasostomy.

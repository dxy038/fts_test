One method for achieving high-speed waveform digitizing uses time-interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC´s). Time interleaving with two or more ADC´s enables waveform digitizing at sampling rates proportionately faster than when using just one ADC. A well-known drawback of this method is that the misalignment of sampling instances degrades the achievable dynamic range. This paper proposes a solution that removes distortion caused by the alignment error with digital signal processing. Since the algorithm is realized as an extension to the ordinary FFT, the objective is achieved without significant loss of throughput

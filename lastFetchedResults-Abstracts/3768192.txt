In this work, we propose the use of the AHP (analytical hierarchy process) as a mathematical tool to structure a multiple criteria problem like a visual pattern. The main objective pursued is to determine what is the optimal placing to build a urban construction to locate a university library. In this case, it has been applied for the Campus of Montegancedo of the Polytechnic University of Madrid (Spain), where the Faculty of Computer science is placed. The data come from a Geographical Information System (GIS). Three different profiles of standard users have been considered and they determine the management of the final decision to take, in order to carry out the study. The use of the commercial software Expert Choice facilitates efficiently this management.

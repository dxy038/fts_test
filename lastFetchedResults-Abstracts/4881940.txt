A novel approach which combines directional spatial interpolation at the receiver and block-based coding is proposed for low bit rate coding. The directional spatial interpolation at the receiver can reconstruct faithfully a large percentage of the blocks that are intentionally not sent. Experimental results show that the new proposed coding system can provide significant subjective and objective gains over conventional approaches for still image compression, and has the potential to be extended for video coding

This working paper discusses the optimal policy for a periodic review inventory system with two-component products under non-renewable warranty agreement. Customer demands for products are independent and identically distributed with a common general distribution. Components are subjected to failure with exponential distributions once products are sold. The objective of this work is to decide the optimal inventory level of the product and components so that the total operational cost is minimized.

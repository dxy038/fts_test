A continuous and reliable electrical energy supply is the objective of any power system operation. A transmission line is the part of the power system where faults are most likely to happen. This paper describes the use of the wavelet transform for analyzing power system fault transients in order to determine the fault location. Synchronized sampling was made possible by precise time receivers based on GPS time reference, and the sampled data were analyzed using wavelet transform. This paper describes a fault location monitoring system and fault locating algorithm with GPS, DSP processor, and data acquisition board, and presents some experimental results and error analysis

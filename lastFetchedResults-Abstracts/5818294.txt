With the advantage of the scientific and the objective, many educational psychology-based learning methods, such as SQ3R learning method, meaningful reception learning method, SQ4R method, etc. are widely used in school education and individual study. At the same time, recently the WWW based education systems have flourished. But there are still few learning methods standing up for the WWW based learning, so the learning quality and efficiency cannot be ensured. We pose a method to design and implement educational psychology-based learning-support tools for individual learning in Web-based distance learning systems. This method is based on an effective study method SQ3R, which is a very popular learning method in school education in America and Europe. However the effective study method SQ3R cannot be directly applied into the Web-based distance learning system, so we design a method and a group of tools to support the learners using SQ3R in the Web-based distance learning system. Supported by this learning method, learnersÂ´ learning effectiveness can be greatly improved.

Objective: Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) causes a potentially lethal disease named cholera. The cholera enterotoxin (CT) is a major virulence factor of V. cholerae. In addition
to CT,
V.
cholerae
produces other putative toxins, such as the zonula occludens

toxin
(Zot)
and
accessory
cholera
enterotoxin
(Ace).
The
ace
gene
is
the
third
gene

of
the
V.
cholerae
virulence
cassette.

The
Ace
toxin
alters
ion
transport,
causes
fluid

accumulation
in
ligated
rabbit
ileal
loops,
and
is
a
cause
of
mild
diarrhea.
The
aim
of

this
study is the cloning and overexpression of the ace
gene into Escherichia
coli (E.

coli)
and determination of some characteristics of the recombinant Ace
protein.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the ace gene was amplified from V. cholerae strain 62013, then cloned in a pET28a expression vector and transformed into an  E. coli (DH5 ?) host strain. Subsequently, the recombinant vector was retransformed into E. coli BL21 for expression, induced by isopropythio-B-D-galctoside (IPTG) at a different

concentration, and examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. A rabbit ileal loop experiment was conducted. Antibacterial activity of the Ace protein was assessed for E. coli, Stapylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). 
Results: The recombinant Ace protein with a molecular weight of 18 kDa (dimeric form) was expressed in E. coli BL21. The Ace protein showed poor staining with Coomassie blue stain, but stained efficiently with silver stain. Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant Ace protein reacted with rabbit anti-V. cholerae polyclonal
antibody.
The
Ace
protein
had
antibacterial
activity
at
a
concentration
of
?200

Âµg/ml
and caused significant  fluid accumulation in the ligated rabbit ileal loop test.

Conclusion: This study described an E. coli cloning and expression system (E. coli BL21- pET-28a-ace) for the Ace protein of V. cholerae. We confirmed the antibacterial properties and enterotoxin activity of the resultant recombinant Ace protein.

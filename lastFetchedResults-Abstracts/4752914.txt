This article presents the influence of the onboard processing (OBP) and Linearization Units on the performance enhancement of a high data rate satellite. The constraints of the space environment and the nonlinearity of the high power amplifier create often conflicting requirements for the implementation of high data rate data transfer via satellite. These requirements must be considered when designing onboard equipment. The details of simulation of onboard processing effects in a Ku band satellite system such as noise effect and nonlinearity of amplifier are presented. The applications of onboard processing are described, with particular emphasis on broadband satellites. The objective and the main features of an experimental satellite with OBP are highlighted. Simulation results will show the usefulness of this method under the long propagation environment and other technical constraints such as noise and nonlinearity. For simulation the Gen*Star Satellite Network program was used. This satellite provides a generic Ka-band system design and technology base.

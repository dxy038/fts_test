Traffic data collection of regional highway net-work is basilic for traffic management and control, as well as traffic planning. While present collection methods provide traffic data with low accuracy and continuity. Therefor a traffic data collection method is proposed based on regional high-way network charging system. This study puts forward the methods of data collection, processing and storage as well as their implementation based on a double B/S architecture. As the infrastructure of the method, it enables with such functions as data uploading, data processing, data inquiring and outputting. Then generated traffic generation are distributed to the Hubei province highway network at random in which the traffic collection system is well verified. The proposed collection method could provide more objective, accurate and systematic traffic data.

Chilled meat exportation comprises chilling within 48 h post-mortem to temperatures &lt; 0 °C without freezing and holding under these conditions for several weeks. The effects of this ageing on sensory quality of pork are unknown and hence the objective of this study was to compare the sensory quality of Canadian pork as found in an export (Japan) market and locally. Regardless that the Japanese market's quality criteria were met, pork sorted on-line differed (P &lt; 0.05) from that for the domestic market only for lightness, exudate and cooking loss; no differences in intramuscular fat content were observed. Overall, a trained panel scored weaker pork and meat flavours and odours in the export than the domestic pork as a result of either the quality by selection if roasted or the ageing (− 1.7 °C, 43 days exported chilled or 3.1 °C, 5 days domestic) if grilled or shabu shabu. Grilled pork was also more tender, sweeter and had stronger caramel flavour with the chilled ageing.

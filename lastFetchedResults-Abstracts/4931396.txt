This paper focuses on the interconnection network used as a part of the Data Acquisition System of the Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Darmstadt. This experiment will have special demands on the Data Acquisition System like limited space for hardware, radiation tolerance, flexible enough for all required operation modes of the detectors and support for synchronization mechanisms. The specials of the CBM networks are using only a single bidirectional fiber link for all network abilities and providing a deterministic latency message for precise time synchronisation. This led to the development of a new network and protocol.

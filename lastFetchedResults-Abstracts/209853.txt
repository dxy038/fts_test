Objective: Angiogenesis is a key process in the promotion of cancer and its metastasis.
Many natural health products inhibit angiogenesis. Because of the lack of molecular studies
on anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects of shallot (Allium ascaJonicum); except a few clinical
studies on other shallot properties , such as the anti-proliferative effect of shallot chloroformic
extract on two tumor cell lines , the present study focuses on the anti-angiogenic effect of
aqueous shallot extract using an aorta ring model.
Materials and Methods: Aortic rings were obtained by cross-sectioning, at 1-2 mm intervals
, the thoracic aorta of 4-B weeks old Wistar male rats and cultured them in a thin drop of
type I collagen gel. After 3 days of CUlturing and first sprouting , the extract of A. ascaJonicum
(from 25 to 800 ~g/ml ) was added to cultures . The results of anti-angiogenic activity were
investigated by microscope. The cytotoxicity of extract at different doses on HUVECs was
measured by trypan blue assay.
Results: The results showed that the shallot extract has suitable anti-angiogenic effect in a
range of 50 to BOO ~g lmt, but in 25 ~g/ml . the extract has no considerable effect. In addition ,
a tangible cytotoxic effect on endothelial cells at the above mentioned doses was observed .
Conclusion: Our study showed that aqueous extract of A. escelonicum bulbs has noticeable
anti-angiogenic activity without toxic effect on the cells in doses that ranged from 50-800 ~g l
ml. Therefore, A. ascaJonicum can be a potential candidate for further investigations used in
angiogenesis-related pathologic conditions.

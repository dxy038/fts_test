The general requirement in the automotive radar application is to measure the target range R and radial velocity v<sub>r</sub> simultaneously and unambiguously with high accuracy and resolution even in multitarget situations, which is a matter of the appropriate waveform design. Based on a single continuous wave chirp transmit signal, target range R and radial velocity v<sub>r</sub> cannot be measured in an unambiguous way. Therefore a so-called multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK) transmit signal was developed, which is applied to measure target range and radial velocity separately and simultaneously. In this case the radar measurement is based on a frequency and additionally on a phase measurement, which suffers from a lower estimation accuracy compared with a pure frequency measurement. This MFSK waveform can therefore be improved and outperformed by a chirp sequences waveform. Each chirp signal has in this case very short time duration T<sub>chirp</sub>. Therefore the measured beat frequency f<sub>B</sub> is dominated by target range R and is less influenced by the radial velocity v<sub>r</sub>. The range and radial velocity estimation is based on two separate frequency measurements with high accuracy in both cases. Classical chirp sequence waveforms suffer from possible ambiguities in the velocity measurement. It is the objective of this paper to modify the classical chirp sequence to get an unambiguous velocity measurement even in multitarget situations.

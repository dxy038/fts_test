Background & Objective: Respiratory tract infections causes 4.5 million children death in the world annually that occur mostly in developing countries like Iran. Bacterial and viral pathogens are responsible for this event and Adenovirus is one of the major responsible agents. According to multiple survey, incidence of viral pathogens in different world region is different so local survey is needed to describe regional incidence of different viral pathogens. Rapid test for detection of respiratory pathogens help us to select appropriate treatment and avoidence of antibiotic overusage. So abuse the aim of this study was to evaluate incidence and clinical presentation of Adenovirus infection in children in Tehran with rapid test. Methods: This study is a descriptive-cross sectional analysis. All 3 month to 15 year old children with upper respiratory tract infection that come to OPD of Rasol-e-Acram Hospital in one year(1385) are included.
Direct smear of patient's throat was evaluated by rapid chromatography test for adenovirus infection. SPSS software was used to analyse the data.
Results: 160 children with upper respiratory tract infection with a mean age of 61.5 months were evaluated. 57.5% were boys and 42.5% were girls. 77.4% had fever, 66% had sore throat, 37.4% had cough, 27% pharyngeal exudate, 16.4% had abdominal pain, 15.7% had vomiting, 13.8% had cervical lymphadenopathy, 10% had diarrhea, 5.7% had petechea in palate and 1.9% had conjectivitis. They admitted 24% in spring, 14.1% in summer, 23.1% in fall and 38.5% in winter.
Adenovirus infection was detected in 10(6.3%) cases, 4(40%) boys and 6(60%) girls with mean age of 83.7(SD=58.5). they were detcted 20% in spring, 30% in summer, 30% in fall and 20% in winter.
Conclusion: Adenoviruses are responsible in 6.3% of upper respiratory infections in children. They become less prevalent with increasing age. Its prevalence did not obey seasonal pattern. Fever and sore throat are most common clinical signs and cervical lymphadenopathy is more prevalent in adenovirus infection than others.

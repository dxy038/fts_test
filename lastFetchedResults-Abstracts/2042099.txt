The present work deals with the removal of Brilliant Green dye from wastewater using a poly(acrylic acid) hydrogel composite (PAA-K hydrogel) prepared by incorporation of kaoline clay. The composite has been synthesized using ultrasound assisted polymerization process as well as the conventional process, with an objective of showing the better effectiveness of ultrasound assisted synthesis. It has been observed that the hydrogel prepared by ultrasound assisted polymerization process showed better results. The optimum conditions for the removal of dye are pH of 7, temperature of 35 Â°C, initial dye concentration of 30 mg/L and hydrogel loading of 1 g. The extent of removal of dye increased with an increase in the contact time and initial dye concentration. A pseudo-second-order kinetic model has been developed to explain the adsorption kinetics of dye on the PAA-K hydrogel. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous in nature and the PAA-K hydrogel prepared by ultrasound process is a promising adsorbent compared to conventional process. The obtained adsorption data has also been fitted into commonly used adsorption isotherms and it has been found that Freundlich as well as Langmuir adsorption isotherm models fits well to the experimental results.

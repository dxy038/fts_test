Objective: Curcumin, is the active component in turmeric (Curcuma long). This agent induces apoptosis via inhibiting various signaling pathways. However, its poor aqueous solubility prevents its widespread application. In this study, dendrosomes with water-solubility, nano-sized dimensions and nontoxic properties, was used for curcumin delivery to cells.
Materials & Methods: In the present study, the potential of dendrosomes for use as a drug delivery system was assessed in AGS, HT3, 5637, hBMSC and U87 cell lines. In order to achieve optimal concentration of drug and the most suitable cell line, the effects of different concentrations of free and dendrosomal curcumin was examined on the cell lines. Propidium iodide staining was used for determining apoptosis induction and the expression of Bax gene was investigated by semi-Q RT-PCR.
Results: Dendrosomal formulation significantly improved water solubility of highly hydrophobic curcumin in AGS cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated 48 percent of cells treated with dendrosomal curcumin and 20 percent of cells treated with free curcumin (at the optimal concentration of drug) underwent apoptosis after 18h. Semi-Q RT-PCR results exhibited the increase of expression of Bax pro-apoptotic gene in cells treated with dendrosomal curcumin. 
Conclusion: Dendrosomal formulation, compared to free curcumin, enhanced curcumin solubility and increased apoptosis induction in treated cells. These data, together with the observation of a 50 % increase of Bax gene expression confirmed the apoptotic effects of dendrosomal formulation of curcumin.

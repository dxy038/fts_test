“Religious experience”, in its broadest sense, is either an inner experience or an objective event that has religious meaning for the subject. In philosophy of religion, however, a narrower meaning of the term is at issue: an experience taken by the subject as experiential awareness of God; in which one directly perceives the presence of God (or a divine being). Religious empiricism is an approach which tries to justify or reconstruct religious beliefs on the ground of “religious experience”. In this paper, after a short review on the historical background of this attitude, I will propose two different meanings for religious empiricism. Then, considering Schleiermacher's and James's views, I will discuss religious empiricism in its contemporary and perhaps most important formulation developed by Swinburne and Alston. Religious empiricism could be understood as a religious reaction to the criticism of religion in the modern time. It tries to stay and act within the framework of modern philosophy that emphasizes on the significance of experience. In their intellectual efforts, the advocates of this stream have expanded the boundaries of the notion of experience. On the other hand, “religious experience” has a different meaning and function for each of aforementioned philosophers. So, to evaluate this approach we need to understand these differences in depth.

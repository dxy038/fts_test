From the fungus Stereum hirsutum have been isolated and identified two new epidioxysterols 1, 4, together with two known ones 2 and 3. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and chemical reactions. Epidioxysterols 1â€“4 have been shown to possess a significant activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Objective (s): This study aimed to assess the relationship between type of delivery and changing in quality of life scores after delivery.
Method: A sample of 150 mothers with caesarian section and 150 mothers with vaginal delivery attending a health center in Kashan, Iran were entered into the study. Mothers completed a specific life quality questionnaire 2 to 4 months after delivery. Mean changes in scores compared in each group and between two groups. Data were analyzed using chi square, independent t- test, pair t test and Mann-Whitney U test. 
Results: Findings showed that the mean score for feeling for sexual intercourse (p=0.005), economic status due to delivery (p=0.02) and willingness to choose method of delivery for future pregnancy (p=0.007) improved significantly in 2-4 months interval in normal delivery group and decreased for feeling (p=0.001) in caesarean section group. In comparing mean score differences between two groups in 2-4 months interval, there were significant differences in feeling for sexual intercourse and feeling toward oneâ€™s husband (p=0.007, p=0.04) respectively.
Conclusion: There were no significant differences in quality of life scores in each group and between two groups but the mean score for some aspects improved in two months interval in normal delivery group.

In this study, a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system for a kind of short life cycle product with
stochastic demand and stochastic returned products was investigated. The objective is to minimize the
total cost of the hybrid system. The impacts of the amount of products manufactured and the proportion
of the remanufactured part to the returned products on the total cost of the system were analyzed.
Through theoretic analyses and numerical experiments, the relationship between the total cost of the system
and the two influential factors were identified. The total cost of the hybrid system could be reduced
significantly by setting optimum values of the amount of products manufactured and the proportion of the
remanufactured part to the returned products. The sensitivity of the optimum values of the decision variables
and the minimum cost with respect to the system parameters were also investigated.

Objective: Identification of a detailed topography of the receptive area for each of the thoracic dermatomes in humans using somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEF).
Methods: We analyzed the location of the equivalent current dipole (ECD) of SEF following electrical stimulation of the skin at Th4, Th6, Th8, Th10 and Th12 dermatomes in 14 normal subjects.
Results: Three deflections, M18, M25 and M40, were obtained within 60 ms of stimulation of Th6, Th8 and Th10 dermatomes. No consistent deflection could be identified following Th4 and Th12 dermatomal stimulation, probably due to a poor signal-to-noise ratio and difficulty in fixing the stimulation electrodes. M18 was absent or small in amplitude. The latency of M25 ranged from short to long in the order Th6, Th8 and Th10 (P<0.05). ECDs of all components for each site stimulation were located in the truncal area of the primary somatosensory cortex. Although the locations of the ECDs tend to be arranged from lateral to medial in the sequence Th6, Th8 and Th10, the difference was not significant.
Conclusion: The representation area of the trunk is small, and the receptive areas for the stimulation of Th6, Th8 and Th10 dermatomes are considered to be very close or to overlap.

The authors present a simple and precise approach for implementing parts control activities in accordance with (IAW) MIL-STD-965A parts control program. The present work is intended to be useful to any contractor either currently doing business or planning to do business with the US Government. The objective of this work is to define key players and organizations involved in selecting parts used in hardware contracts. This approach explains where parts control begins as well as procedures that apply to different types of contracts, what to do after a contract has been awarded, and how to select part candidates for the proposed program parts selection list (PPSL). Diagrams of the PPSL selection and approval cycles are presented which illustrate the relationships among the key players/organizations. The core activities that must be a part of an efficient and compliant parts control program are highlighted

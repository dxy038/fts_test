Aim at the simplified vehicle vertical two-wheeled model, a improved fuzzy PID controller was devoted to the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS). This controller was obtained based on inosculating with fuzzy PID controller and the algorithm of objective function Automatic optimization. A simulation result was gotten through simulation of MatLab Simulink environment. This result shows that the control system had better stability, adaptive, control precision and shortened the braking distance, braking time, reduced the slip angle through using this improved fuzzy PID controller. Comparing with the conventional PID controller, the fuzzy controller and the fuzzy PID controller, the better control effect and the control system stability could be acquired by this improved fuzzy PID controller.

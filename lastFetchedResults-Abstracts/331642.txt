Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of light irradiation of dentine primers that contain camphoroquinone (CQ) on the shear bond strength to dentine and their contact angle.

Method: Three dentine bonding systems which contain CQ, Imperva Bond, OptiBond and XR-Bond; and Light Bond, which does not contain CQ, were employed. Labial surfaces of freshly extracted lower bovine incisors were ground with no. 600 grit SiC paper. Dentine primers were applied to the dentine surfaces in two groups, irradiated and non-irradiated. A shear bond strength test was performed and the direct contact angle was measured.

Results: Statistical analysis (Newman-Keuls multiple comparison P < 0.05) of the data indicated that light irradiation of the dentine primer for systems containing CQ resulted in increased bond strength and decreased contact angle.

Conclusion: This study indicates that for these dentine bonding systems containing CQ in their primers, light irradiation of the dentine primer is effective in improving wettability and increasing the bond strength to dentine.

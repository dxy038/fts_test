The main objective of this study was to evaluate laparoscopic ovariectomy and to develop an optimal surgical technique for this procedure in standing cattle.

cows underwent laparoscopic ovariectomy. In two cows, a bilateral flank approach was used and in six cows, both ovaries were removed via a left flank approach.

ortant prerequisite for ensuring sufficient intrabdominal space for instrumentation, optimal endoscopic orientation and easy access to the ovaries and uterus was withholding feed for at least 36 h prior to surgery. The cows were sedated with xylazine and the portal sites infiltrated with lidocaine. The portal for the laparoscope was at the ventral angle of the left paralumbar fossa, approximately 10 cm cranioventral to the tuber coxae. The instruments were inserted through two portals approximately 20 cm and 30 cm ventral to the tuber coxae. After abdominal insufflation with carbon dioxide, the left ovary was grasped and local anesthetic was injected into the mesovarium and mesosalpinx. The mesovarium was transected using bipolar cauterization and the ovary removed through an extended instrument portal. The right ovary was removed in the same way. The incisions were closed with single interrupted absorbable sutures in the musculature and single interrupted non-absorbable sutures in the skin. The procedure lasted 120â€“150 min.

ral laparoscopic ovariectomy via left flank approach in standing cows is feasible. This procedure involves special instrumentation, but is minimally invasive and allows optimal visualization of the ovaries and uterus.

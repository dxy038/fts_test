An improved evolutionary algorithm - Non-dominated sorting differential evolution (NSDE) is introduced to solve the multi-objective optimization problem of a redundant robot. The proposed algorithm not only makes the end effector follow the desired trajectory, but also simultaneously meets three optimization indexes, namely singularity avoidance, obstacle avoidance, and joint limit avoidance. A simulation is implemented to verify the feasibility of the method, and the results show that it is sound and effective.

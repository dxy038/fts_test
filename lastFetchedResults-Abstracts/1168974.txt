A calorimetric method for solubility determination is reported. A mathematical model is proposed to describe experimentally observed dissolution processes. The new technique allows the determination of the solubility curve in a wide temperature range by means of a single calorimetric run. The objective of the approach is not the high accuracy of the classical methods, but the minimization of experimental efforts. It is of particular interest for high-priced industrial products, e.g. pharmaceuticals or specialty chemicals. The method provides information about the dissolution kinetics and the dissolution heat as well. Based on solubility measurements carried out for various organic systems of fine chemicals, the experimental conditions affecting the solubility results are discussed in detail.

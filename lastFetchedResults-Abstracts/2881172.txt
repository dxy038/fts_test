Patients with ParkinsonÂ´s disease (PD) need to be frequently monitored in order to assess their individual symptoms and treatment-related complications. Advances in technology have introduced telemedicine for patients in remote locations. However, data produced in such settings lack much information and are not easy to analyze or interpret compared to traditional, direct contact between the patient and clinician. Therefore, there is a need to present the data using visualization techniques in order to communicate in an understandable and objective manner to the clinician. This paper presents interaction and visualization approaches used to aid clinicians in the analysis of repeated measures of spirography of PD patients gathered by means of a telemetry touch screen device. The proposed approach enables clinicians to observe fine motor impairments and identify motor fluctuations of their patients while they perform the tests from their homes using the telemetry device.

Encapsulation of olive oil is an effective method to protect it against environmental deteriorative factors. In this research, olive oil microcapsules were produced by complex coacervation method. The objective was to examine the effect of gelatin and Arabic gum as shell materials, lactose as cryprotectant, and different acidification times on microencapsulation efficiency of olive oil. Arabic gum 2-5% (w/w), gelatin 2-5% (w/w), lactose 1-5% (w/w), and different acidification times (0-60 min( were given to Design-Expert software using the Response Surface Method. The surface appearance and morphology of the microcapsules were characterized by an optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. Microencapsulation efficiency ranged from 43.9 ± 0.98% to 90.5 ± 2%. The highest efficiency was obtained in gelatin 2% (w/w), Arabic gum 2% (w/w), lactose 3% (w/w) and acidification time of 60 min. The best model for describing the microencapsulation efficiency was quadratic model. The highest effect in microencapsulation efficiency was related to interaction of gelatin-Arabic gum and lactose-acidification time because they had higher coefficient estimate.

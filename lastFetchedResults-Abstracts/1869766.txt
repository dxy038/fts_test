The objective of this study was to evaluate the degree of immunosenescence in patients with autoimmune disease. T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and the percentage of CD4+CD28null T cells were studied as markers of immunosenescence in 175 patients with chronic autoimmune arthritis, other connective tissue autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis and 60 healthy controls. In both the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis patient group, TREC numbers were age-inappropriately declined which points to an accelerated thymic output. Furthermore, enhanced percentages of CD4+CD28null T cells could be detected in a significant proportion of patients included in this study. These immunosenescent phenomena seemed to be present already early in the disease process. High percentages of CD4+CD28null T cells were associated with the presence of RA linked HLA DR4 alleles and with plasma reactivity to cytomegalovirus. Further analysis of CD4+CD28null T cells provided indications for a restricted T cell receptor (TCR) BV gene expression and cytoplasmic stores of various cytotoxic molecules. This study indicates that the immune system of patients with autoimmune diseases shows signs of an accelerated aging. Both genetic factors, such as HLA DR4, and environmental factors, like CMV infection, might speed up this immunosenescence and contribute in this way to disease pathogenesis.

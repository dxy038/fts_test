In the public transport scheduling, the problem of transferring buses in stations becomes more and more important. Therefore, many people begin to research the number of the encountered buses. This work elaborates that how to ensure more encountered buses in a station, which can make it convenient to transfer buses. In this paper we build a model to optimize the buses transferring in one area. The model considers the changing of the time that one bus remains in a station, which can affect the encounter of two buses. And the model has a variable number which describes the resident time of one bus in a station and two objective functions that one is the number of the encountered buses and the other is the number of stations in which buses encounter. It calculates the maximum of the number of the encountered buses and the min of the number of encountered stations. In this way, it ensures the best departure time of all routes. So that it makes the cost and the time to transfer buses become less. In addition, it calculates the value by using the algorithm optimization. Through the experiment result, we can see that this algorithm can improve the efficiency of riding buses and the level of the services in the field of public transport.

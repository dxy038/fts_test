Objective

The advent of computed tomography (CT) scan revolutionized the diagnosticevaluation of neurologic patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate brain CTresults of epileptic children.

Materials & Methods

In a descriptive cross-sectional study, noncontrast brain CT scan of 150 consecutive1-18 year old epileptic children whom were referred to pediatric neurology clinic ofShahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, from May 2008 to October 2010 inYazd-Iran, evaluated.

Results

Sixty two girls and 88 boys with mean age of 6.6 ± 4.3 years were evaluated.In 38 (25.3 %) children, seizure onset age was under one year and 38 others hadabnormal mental / developmental status. Fifty three children (35.3 %) and 97 (64.7%)had partial and generalized seizures, respectively. Partial seizures were more prevalentin children with seizure onset in  <  1 year [41.5% (22/53) vs. 16.5% (16/97)] Result of CT was normal in 74 % (n=111). Among the patients with abnormalresults, 18(46%) had brain atrophy, 10 (25.6%) structural CNS dysgenesia, six (15.4%)intracranial calcification, three (7.8%) hydrocephaly and two had (5.2%) brain tumor.Abnormal brain CT was more prevalent in patients with seizure onset in less than oneyear of age [60.5% (23 of 38) vs. 14.3% (16 of 112), p = 0.003], partial epilepsy [51% (27of 53) vs. 12% (12/97)], and abnormal developmental status [ 81.5% (31 of 38) vs.7% (8of 112]. Mean age of seizure onset in epileptic children with abnormal brain CT scanwas less (M ± SD:1/17 ± 0.6 years versus 4.02±1.9 years).

Conclusion

Brain CT scan might be considered in evaluation of epileptic children with partialseizures, seizure onset in less than one year of age or neurodevelopmental delay.

The objective of this work is to give an outline on qualitative and quantitative analyses of publish-subscribe model deployed over wireless networks. Examining performance of wireless networks transporting publish-subscribe based traffic gives us better understanding of potential impact of publish-subscribe networking to existing architecture. Our evaluation work focuses on studying the behavior of multicast publish-subscribe oriented traffic models in one of the currently attractive wireless technologies, namely WiMAX. Through a set of simulation scenarios main advantages and disadvantages of applying publish-subscribe mechanisms under wireless and dynamic conditions are shown. Based on obtained simulation results, benefits of publish-subscribe model compared to traditional point-to-point approach are presented, followed by remarks about potential architectural challenges for wide scale deployment of publish-subscribe based systems.

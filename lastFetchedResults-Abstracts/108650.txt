The intrinsic kinetics of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) hydrogenation into endo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene (endo-THDCPD) over Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated using stirred semibatch reactors in the absence of transport limitations over ranges of temperature (358.15-438.15 K) and hydrogen pressure (0.5-3 MPa). A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type model was proposed to fit the experimental data. The kinetic parameters were regressed by numerically integrating the differential mass balance equations for the stirred semibatch reactors with fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and then minimizing the objective function describing the deviations between the model-predicted values and the experimental data with the Levernberg-Marquardt algorithm. The activation energy for the first and second step reaction is 7.8945 and 12.2068 kJ/mol, respectively. It was found that the developed model was accurate to predict the experimental results with the average relative error (ARE) less than 12.7%.

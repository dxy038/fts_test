The objective of this paper is exploration of the process of electromagnetic wave multiple interactions with moving turbulent inhomogeneities in the flow of slightly ionized plasma. Here is investigated the transformation of angular and frequency spectra of electromagnetic waves propagating through turbulent flow with resonance harmonic generation.

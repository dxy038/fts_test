Cooperation among heterogeneous wireless networks is currently widely investigated to overcome the throughput and power limitations of state-of-the-art wireless technologies. The target objective of this work is to exploit mobile-to-mobile cooperation in order to lower energy consumption and increase system throughput in hybrid WLAN/Bluetooth wireless networks while guaranteeing quality of service. We model the problem of video distribution in wireless networks with mobile-to-mobile cooperation as an integer optimization problem that minimizes a given cost function. Cost is presented as a function of the energy consumption at mobile terminals, quality of service, and fairness. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the proposed problem and results demonstrate the potential gains of the proposed approach.

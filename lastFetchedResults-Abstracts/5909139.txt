Aiming at the difficulty in evaluating the falt risk of the power plant equipment with quantitative method, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed with the help of the theory of fuzzy mathematics. With this method the mathematical model is constructed, and the weight coefficient of each factor is suggested as well as the calculation process. The fuzziness and hierarchy within the model are both considered in this method, what is more, the subjective factors are quantified with the grade of membership and the quantitative risk value. So makes the evaluation more objective. The calculating result of applying the proposed method to the example demonstrates that the method is so valid and feasible that it is capable of evaluating the risk degree objectively and in further supplying some reasoning for condition decision.

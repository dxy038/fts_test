In order to calculate and measure the influence of the internal-power-dependent thermally effected feedback in power amplifiers with bipolar transistors, a calculation method and measurement techniques are proposed, and results are presented. The aim was to describe a transistor including thermal power feedback and the surrounding network in a theoretical model, i.e. to find a mathematical description. A further objective was to clarify which distortion results from the pure electrical transistor properties and which additional distortion is caused by thermal feedback

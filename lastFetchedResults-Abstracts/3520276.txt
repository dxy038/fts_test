The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a key research instrument for the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. It was successfully launched onboard the Terra satellite in December 1999 and Aqua satellite in May 2002. Both MODIS instruments have been working well except that 15 of the 20 detectors in Aqua MODIS band 6 (1.628-1.652 &#956;m) are either nonfunctional or noisy. The striping in Aqua MODIS band 6 caused by its nonfunctional or noisy detectors has been a serious problem for MODIS snow products, which use band 6 primarily for snow detection. MODIS scientists have been using Aqua MODIS band 7 (2.105-2.155 &#956;m) instead of band 6 for computing the normalized difference snow index to continue detecting global snow coverage. The main objective of this letter is to retrieve Aqua MODIS band 6 using other bands based on their relationships in Terra MODIS. The band retrieval approach proposed in this letter is also very useful for the next generation of MODIS sensor-the Visible/Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) band M10 proxy data generation. Such proxy data can support the VIIRS prelaunch end-to-end testing, postlaunch calibration/validation, and data quality checking.

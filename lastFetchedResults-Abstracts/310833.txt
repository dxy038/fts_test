Objective. Identification and quantification of strain in shoulder capsular-ligamentous structures during clinical exams and validation of this testing on cadavers.

Methods. Mercury strain gauges were sutured in seven locations on shoulders from cadavers. An electromagnetic tracker quantified humeral head translations during laxity exams. Strain and humeral position were acquired during performance of Sulcus, Feagin, Apprehension, Load and Shift, Drawer, and Hawkins tests.

Results. Anterior humeral head translation in neutral position was primarily constrained by the coracohumeral ligament. With the arm abducted, anterior middle and inferior ligaments also became active. External rotation and abduction activated inferior and middle capsules. Posterior capsule constrained motion for posterior tests in neutral and abduction. Superior and inferior capsular ligaments were active during inferior tests in neutral position. With abduction, inferior ligaments provided primary translation constraint.

Conclusion. Study of kinematics and strain evaluation on cadavers can yield useful information on mechanisms of glenohumeral instability.

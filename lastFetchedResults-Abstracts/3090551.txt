In this paper, a new approach for a solution of a invex nonsmooth programming problem is introduced. An equivalent eta-approximated vector optimization problem is constructed by a modification of the objective and the constraint functions in the original multiobjective programming problem and its equivalent etamiddotapproximated vector optimization problem is proved. In this way, optimally conditions for nonsmooth constrained multi-objective programming problems having generalized invex objective and constraint functions (with respect to the same function etamiddot)are obtained.

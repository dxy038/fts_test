Based on the analysis of the campus network system risk and its impact factors of a university, we evaluated seven major risk factors of campus network systems with the risk matrix method. Furthermore, a risk matrix applied to a campus network risk assessment is built and the basic procedure of the risk assessment with the risk matrix is well designed, in order to provide a scientific, reasonable and effective evaluation method for the campus network system risk assessment. Through the practical application, it demonstrates that the evaluation results of this method are more reasonable and objective than those of traditional ones.

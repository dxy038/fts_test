Objective
rpose of the present study was to characterize the collagenolytic activity in a sonicated extract of Tannerella forsythia and to investigate the activation of proMMMP-2 and -9 by the T. forsythia extract.
s
 forsythia extract was incubated with type I collagen. The cleaved products were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the method of Laemmli. We studied the effects of cysteine, DTT, CaCl2, and various proteinase inhibitors on collagenolytic activity. A HT1080 cell culture supernatant containing proMMP-2 and -9 was incubated with the T. forsythia extract and analyzed for the activation of proMMP-2 and -9 by gelatin zymography.
s
 forsythia extract degraded type I collagen. Cysteine increased the collagenolytic activity of the extract, and 5 mM CaCl2 was required for this activity. The collagenolytic activity of T. forsythia was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide, iodoacetic acid, EDTA, and leupeptin, but not by PMSF, E-64, TLCK, or TPCK. When proMMP-2 and -9 were incubated with the T. forsythia extract, gelatinases with the relative molecular masses of MMP-2 and -9 were produced.
sion
esent study suggests that T. forsythia extract is able to degrade type I collagen and activate proMMP-2 and -9.

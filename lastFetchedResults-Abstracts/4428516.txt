We address a problem of local variable storage for embedded DSP processors. The objective is to optimally assign local variables on the program stack. We adapt a powerful combinatorial search technique, called scatter search, to this optimization problem. We couple that with a hierarchical search approach that explores the flexibility of the address generation unit and yet focus on a small search space. Empirical results show promising performance compared with previous approaches.

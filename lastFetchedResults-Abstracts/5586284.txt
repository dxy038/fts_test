23 healthy subjects and 23 patients with isolated diastolic dysfunction were examined with cine magnetic resonance imaging to find new markers for the diastolic heart function. A single mid-ventricular short axis slice in the true cardiac axis was used and endo- and epicardial borders were hand drawn. Five features were applied to characterize isolated diastolic function: Irregularity marker of contraction calculated as the sum of the standard deviations of corresponding points across all frames (IRREG); slope of a linear fit to the diastolic area change (SLOPE); slope of the minimal and mean wall thickness (MINWTH/MEANWTH); shift parameter of the least-squares fit of the sigmoid Fermi-Junction (SHIFT). The parameters were corrected for through-plane motion. MINWTH, MEANWTH, and SHIFT differed significantly in both groups. These features represent promising objective parameters to discriminate patients with diastolic dysfunction from healthy subjects.

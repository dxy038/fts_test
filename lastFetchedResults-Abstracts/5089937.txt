Matrix converters are capable of managing bidirectional power flows while fully controlling the source and load currents. The topology is characterized by its reduced size and weight because the dc-link stage is not necessary unlike most power converters. A novel control strategy applied to a direct matrix converter is presented in this work. The proposed method allows the control of load and source current in the power converter. The method selects the commutation state of the converter according to an optimization algorithm given by a simple cost functional and the discrete system model. The control goals are regulation of the load current and to force the input current to be sinusoidal with unity displacement power factor. A simulation study is presented to validate the proposed control scheme.

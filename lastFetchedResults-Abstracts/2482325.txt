Objective: The purpose of the present preliminary study was to explore the prevalence of nonmedical abuse
of benzodiazepines in a group of opiate-dependent patients who were on methadone maintenance treatment
(MMT) program in outpatient clinics in the south-west of Tehran, Iran.
Methods: 114 male and female opiate-dependent clients who met DSM.IV-TR criteria for opiate dependence
with mean age 36.5 years participated in the study from 16 clinics and completed a self-report questionnaire on
demographics and substance use details. Then the participants were interviewed on the details of nonmedical
abuse of benzodiazepines.
Results: The study findings indicated that the current nonmedical abuse of benzodiazepines was commonly
prevalent among participants. The most common current benzodiazepines abused were alprazolam (100%)
followed by chlordiazepoxide (96.5%), clonazepam (94.7%), diazepam (86.8%), lorazepam (79.8%) and
oxazepam (73.7%) respectively. Depression (77%) and anxiety (72.8%) were frequently reported as the most
important reasons associated with consuming benzodiazepines followed by problem in anger control (44.7%),
suicide thought (12.3%), self-injury (7.9%), and suicide commitment (5.3%) respectively.
Conclusion: Nonmedical abuse of benzodiazepines is an important problem among opiate addicts which
should be considered in treatment interventions during MMT program.

In a study proposed by CNES, EADS ASTRIUM has analysed the feasibility and the design of Synthetic Aperture Radars within the stringent envelope of micro satellites. The primary mission objective is high resolution (2 metres for -17 dB.m2/m2 sensitivity) for a 5 km swath width, in X band. Two options have been analysed for this study. The first one was based on a passive reflector. Platform agility is required to achieve steering of the SAR beams in elevation. The second option was based on an active reflector antenna designed by THALES which detailed performances are currently studied under a Research and Technology study with CNES. This paper presents the definition and performances of a micro-satellite based on passive reflector antenna. This satellite design is compatible of a launch of up to three satellites at a time on low earth orbit, and offers Stripmap and ScanSAR modes capabilities. Finally, this short overview identifies the technological developments required to achieve the SAR on a micro satellite concept in the mid term

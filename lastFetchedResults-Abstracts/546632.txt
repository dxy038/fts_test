Background: It has been reported that curcumin has anti inflammatory, antibacterial, anti tumor and analgesic properties.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of curcumin in the treatment of minor aphthous stomatitis.
Methods: The study was a two week, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled of patients with minor aphthous. Patients between 18 and 65 years old were included if they presented with 1â€“5 aphthous ulcers of less than 24 h duration. Twenty-eight patients were randomly allocated to curcumin gel containing (2% curcumin) and 29 patients were allocated to placebo gel for a two week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The patients used the medication using a swap twice per day. After enrolment, the size of ulcers were measured by the investigator, and pain was evaluated by the patients based on Perceived Pain Rating Scale before drug application (day 0) and at days 4, 7, and 14. Patients overall satisfaction were assessed at the end of treatment. 
Results: Curcimin gel significantly reduced pain intensity and size of aphthous ulcer compare to placebo. Significant group differences appeared at the end of the trial regarding overall satisfaction of the patients.
Conclusion: The results of present study provide evidence that curcumin gel is a well tolerated effective treatment modality for minor aphthous stomatitis.

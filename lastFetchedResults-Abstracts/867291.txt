This paper deals with the optimization of hole-making operations in conditions where a hole may need several tools to get completed. The objective of interest in the considered problem is to minimize the summation of tool airtime and tool switch time. This objective is affected by the sequence through which each operation of each hole is done. The problem is formulated as a 0â€“1 non-linear mathematical model. An ant algorithm is developed to solve the proposed mathematical model. The paper includes an illustrative example which shows the application of the proposed algorithm to optimizing the sequence of hole-making operations in a typical industrial part. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested through solving six benchmark problems. The computational experience conducted in this research indicates that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.

In view of the difficulty to evaluate urban public transport in an objective, comprehensive and accurate manner, an index system and its hierarchical structure for urban public transport evaluation are developed and a mathematical model established by way of the multi-factor hierarchical fuzzy evaluation to engage in comprehensive evaluation of urban public transport. A case study is conducted over public transport in Baoding city with the application of the said evaluation model and the result indicates that the method is scientific, reasonable and easy for application.

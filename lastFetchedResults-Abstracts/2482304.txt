Objective: This research was conducted to study the relationship between attribution and academic
procrastination in University Students.
Methods: The subjects were 203 undergraduate students, 55 males and 148 females, selected from English
and French language and literature students of Tabriz University. Data were gathered through Procrastination
Assessment Scale-student (PASS) and Causal Dimension Scale (CDA) and were analyzed by multiple
regression analysis (stepwise).
Results: The results showed that there was a meaningful and negative relation between the locus of control
and controllability in success context and academic procrastination. Besides, a meaningful and positive relation
was observed between the locus of control and stability in failure context and procrastination. It was also found
that 17% of the variance of procrastination was accounted by linear combination of attributions.
Conclusion: We believe that causal attribution is a key in understanding procrastination in academic settings
and is used by those who have the knowledge of Causal Attribution styles to organize their learning.

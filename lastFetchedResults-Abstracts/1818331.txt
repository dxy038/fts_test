The effect of altered occlusion on the mandibular condylar cartilage remains unclear. Objective: This study investigated the effect of unilateral incisor disocclusion on cartilage thickness, on mitotic activity and on chondrocytes maturation and differentiation in the mandibular condylar cartilage of rats. Design: The upper and lower left incisors were trimmed 2 mm every second day in five rats. In other five rats, the incisor occlusion was not altered. Condylar tissues from both sides of each mandible were processed and stained for Herovici’s stain and immunohistochemistry for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN). Measurements of cartilage thickness and the numbers of immunopositive cells for each antibody were analysed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: No significant differences were observed in cartilage thickness after 7 days of unilateral incisor disocclusion. However, the numbers of immunopositive cells for BrdU as a marker of DNA synthesising cells, TGF-β1 as a marker of chondrocytes differentiation, and ALP and OCN as markers of chondrocytes maturation, were significant higher in the cartilage cells on both sides when incisor occlusion was unilaterally altered. Interestingly, alkaline phosphatase was highly expressed on the condylar side of incisor disocclusion, whereas osteocalcin was highly expressed on the side opposite to the incisor disocclusion. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that after 7 days, unilateral incisor disocclusion affects the mandibular condylar cartilage at the cellular level by increasing the mitotic activity and by accelerating chondrocytes maturation. Chondrocytes maturation appears more accelerated on the side opposite to incisor disocclusion.

Objective: In Iran few studies have investigated the association among the dimensions of perfectionism with
the academic achievement and other psychopathologies, such as depression and anxiety. This study has
investigated these relationships in an Iranian school-age sample.
Methods: Using multistage cluster random sampling, 793 students completed the questionnaire anonymously
in the classroom in 2007. The positive and negative perfectionism scale, the Revised Children’s Manifest
Anxiety Scale, the Children’s Depression Inventory, and term point average (academic achievement) were
assessed. Data was analyzed with descriptive statistics and multiple linear regressions, using SPSS.
Results: Negative and positive perfectionisms were found to be positive and negative predictors,
respectively, for depression (p < 0.001) and anxiety (p < 0.001) and conversely, negative and positive predictors for
academic achievement, respectively (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Distinguishing positive and negative aspects of perfectionism is important in understanding the
implications of perfectionism on academic achievement. Our findings indicate that although we must take care
of unhealthy and neurotic consequences of negative perfectionism, such as depression and anxiety, which may
have negative effects on academic achievement, but positive striving for perfection can help the students to
improve their academic achievement.

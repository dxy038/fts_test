This work studies the effects of the prefilter bandwidth in the sequential symbol synchronizers based on pulse comparation at half rate.We consider three different prefilter bandwidth namely B1=&#8226;, B2=2.tx and B3=1.tx, where tx is the bit rate.We consider also four synchronizers, where two operate at the rate with versions manual (b-m) and automatic (b-a) and two operate at half rate with versions manual (b-m/2) and automatic (b-a/2).The objective is to study the synchronizers and evaluate the output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus the input SNR (Signal Noise Ratio).

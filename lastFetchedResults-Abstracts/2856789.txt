Consistent and imitable subjective measurement 3D video quality assessment is investigated for evaluating 3D service parameters and as an essential criterion towards the development of objective models. This paper analyzes the results obtained from three test laboratories to evaluate the performance of the MVC+D and 3D-AVC 3D video coding standards using identical video content and following similar methodologies and instructions. The correlation between laboratories was investigated using similar analysis to benchmarking of objective metrics. Analyses show that test laboratories employing different displays and different subjects could still produce highly correlated results, as they follow similar guidelines to carry out assessments.

The objective is to adjust procedures such as the immersion in cold water, cutting, turning and centrifugation to obtain shaped cassava named ‘minicassavas’. For this purpose, roots of Recife and Rosinha cultivars were harvested when 8 and 12 months old, weighed, washed and cooled during 24 hours. Subsequently, these roots were cut in pieces; immerged during 0.5 and 30 minutes; peeled; and cut to obtain ‘half piece’ and cube shapes. Both shapes were turned during 1, 2 and 3 minutes, obtaining the ‘rubiene’ and ‘cateto’ shapes, respectively.  After that, ‘minitolete’, rubiene’ and ‘cateto’ were sanitized; centrifuged at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 seconds; packed and stored at 9 ± 2 °C (‘minitolete’) and 5 ± 2 °C (‘rubiene’ and ‘cateto’). Results indicate that the immersion in cold water for 5 or 30 minutes accelerated the peeling of cv. Rosinha and minimized browning symptoms in both cultivars when maintained at 8 ± 2 °C. The ideal lathing time observed to 1.5 Kg of cassava pieces was 2 minutes, regardless of the shape because it reduced the losses and improved the appearance.  In addition, the centrifugation of 800 g of ‘minitolete’ was 30 second, while to ‘cateto’ and ‘rubine’ was 60 seconds. In these times, both shapes showed desirable features for a longer period of time. Thus, was verified that one way to add value to cassava is the development of alternative shapes, because this root can suit innovative formats. Thus, procedures used in minimal processing are specific for each shape and it can influence the quality and conservation.

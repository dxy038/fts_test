The paper presents a discussion on the accuracy of various models for high frequency grounding studies. We study differences between transmission line model and quasi-dynamic image model looking for possibilities to improve their consistency with respect to rigorous electromagnetic model. The main objective of this study is to indicate the cases of applicability of above models in practical studies.

Inroduction & Objective: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a severe liver injury accompanied by sustained liver damage. It is imperative that new approaches for repairing the liver are developed. Cell-based therapy has been implicated in the treatment of liver diseases. Mesenchymal stemcells (MSCs) from various sources such as bone marrow are available. These cells are one of them ajorcandidates incell therapy. The production of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) increases in the regenerating liver. The IGF-I in liver regeneration is effective after binding to insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR). We hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor-? stimulate MSCs to cause IGF-IR expression.
Materials and Methods: Bone marrow was aspirated from human normal donor after informing consent. Cells were isolated and cultured. Identification of cells with flow cytometric analysis was performed. Fourth  passage cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?)at 1 ng/mL dose and incubated at different times (2, 10, 24 and 48 hours). The IGF-IR gene expression was investigated using real time-polymerase chain reaction technique.
Results: Flow cytometric analysis showed that the human bone marrow MSCs were positive for CD90 and negative for CD45 and CD80. The IGF-IR gene expression was increased in TNF-? treated in comparison with untreated cells.
Conclusion:Increase gene expression pattern of IGF-IR in human bone marrow derived MSCs may be used for clinical stem cell therapy in ALF.

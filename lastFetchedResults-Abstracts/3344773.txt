The objective of this paper is to give an overview and comparison of control techniques for a three-level voltage source inverter based on dual connection of two-level converters supplied by two independent voltage sources. The compared modulation techniques are based on carrier based PWM, six step and space vector PWM with changeover of the inverters roles from clamping to switching inverter and vice versa. A simulation model of the converter has been designed for comparison of mentioned control algorithms including phase disposition PWM with selected criteria as switching losses, balanced load of switching elements, spectral analysis and THD of the output voltage waveform.

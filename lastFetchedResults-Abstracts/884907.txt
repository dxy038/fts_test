on elderly women anxiety related to Death and Dying of Self, Death and Dying of others. The
research population was the elderlies who came to the Iranian Alzheimer Association. 18 elderlies
were selected through purpose-focus, available, and voluntary sampling method, and randomly
assigned to control and experimental groups. Callet-Lester Death Anxiety Questionnaire was used
for data collection. The experimental group participated in 12 group therapy sessions while the
control group received no treatment. SPSS has been used for Data analysis. Results of Analysis of
covariance, in this article, showed that existential group therapy did not decrease elderly women
anxiety related to Death and Dying of Self, Death and Dying of others. Existential Therapy is a
depth approach in psychology that is related to peopleâ€™s worldview; so it needs more time for being

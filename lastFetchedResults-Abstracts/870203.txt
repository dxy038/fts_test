This paper presents a coordinated reverse logistics (CRL) management system for the treatment of multi-source hazardous wastes in a given region, in this case, a specific high-technology manufacturing zone. A linear multi-objective analytical model is formulated that systematically minimizes both the total reverse logistics operating costs and corresponding risks. In addition to inter-organizational logistics operating factors, environmental concerns are considered and formulated as corresponding risk-related constraints. Using the proposed model, results of numerical studies indicate that when the aspect of risk-induced penalties is not considered, the operational costs of regional hazardous-waste management can be efficiently reduced by 58%, compared to the existing operational costs at the study site. In addition, it is also observed that the corresponding weight associated with the risk-induced objective function embedded in the proposed model seems to have a significant effect on the CRL costs.

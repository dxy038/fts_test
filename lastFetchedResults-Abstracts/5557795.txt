During the solder reflow process moisture will diffuse out of plastic IC packages especially at the higher temperatures. This will tend to reduce the hygrostress and hence lower the tendency to popcorn cracking. However, the extent of this reduction is still unclear. The main objective of this paper is to determine the impact of this moisture diffusion during solder reflow on package reliability. In this paper the entire thermal and moisture history of a plastic IC package is simulated from the start of level 1 moisture preconditioning (85&#176;C/85%RH for 168 hours) to subsequent exposure to a solder reflow process lasting about 5 minutes. The transient development of the strain energy release rate due to thermal stress only, hygrostress only and combined hygrothermal stresses are computed and studied. Two numerical methods of computing stress intensity factors will be used and compared as to their merits

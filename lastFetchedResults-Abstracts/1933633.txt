The objective of this study was to enhance procedures for producing piglets derived from in vitro-produced (IVP) pig embryos by non-surgical embryo transfer (ET). The effects of insertion length for the catheter, asynchrony between the age of donor IVP blastocysts and the recipient estrous cycle, and volume of transfer medium were investigated. The IVP blastocysts at 5 days after in vitro fertilization were placed into porcine zygote medium (PZM)-5 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (PZM + FBS) in a 0.25 mL plastic straw (21–40 blastocysts per straw) and then transferred into one uterine horn of recipients using the Takumi® catheter for deep intrauterine insertion. Successful production of piglets derived from IVP embryos was achieved following non-surgical ET when the catheter was inserted at more than 30 cm anterior to the spiral guide spirette. The efficiency of piglet production (percentage number of piglet(s) born based on the number of embryos transferred) was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in recipients whose estrous cycle was asynchronous to that of donors with a 1-day delay (8.3%) than in those with a 2-day (1.5%) or 3-day (0.9%) delay, while pregnancy and farrowing rates (10–40%) did not differ among treatments. When blastocysts were transferred into recipients with 1.0 or 2.5 mL PZM + FBS, there were no significant differences in farrowing rate (30–40%) or average litter size (4.5–6.7) between treatments. The results of the present study indicate that the insertion length of the deep intrauterine catheter and the degree of asynchrony between donor embryos and recipient estrous cycle influenced on pregnancy and birth outcome following non-surgical transfer of IVP blastocysts.

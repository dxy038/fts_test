BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: One of the main aims of root canal therapy is to seal the canal. The aim of the retrograde filling in apical resection operation is to obtain an effective apical sealing. Various materials have been recommended for retrograde fillings. For evaluation these materials the most important characteristics is their sealing ability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the amount of dye penetration in two common retrofill materials (amalgam and MTA) and compare them with hydroxy apatite in root end surgeries. METHODS: In this invitro study 69 single root extracted human teeth were used and after instrumentation, they were obturated with lateral condensation. 3 mm of the apical root was resected, and root-end cavities were prepared. Then the teeth were randomly divided into three groups of 20 specimens (white MTA, amalgam and hydroxy apatite). The amount of micro leakage in each group was evaluated by using dye penetration technique. Dye penetration at the rate of 0-0.99mm was considered little, 1-1.99mm moderate, 2-2.99mm severe and 3mm or more extensive. Groups were evaluated and compared. FINDINGS: Mean microleakage in the moderate, severe and extensive group for amalgam were 0%, 35% and 65%, MTA 10%, 15% and 75% and hydroxy apatite were 5%, 35% and 50% respectively. There was not significant relationship between the three materials (MTA, hydroxy apatite and amalgam) and the amount of dye penetration. CONCLUSION: The results showed that hydroxy apatite can be used as a retrofill material and it has no significant difference with amalgam and MTA.

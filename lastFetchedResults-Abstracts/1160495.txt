A procedure building block, called an objective in this paper, is developed by integrating decisions, actions, and responses to the actions. The objective is characterized as a success logic tree, which consists of 5 logic operators, Boolean checks, and actions. Operational rules of the objective are simple. Perform all available actions and checks until the success logic tree becomes true, if not specified differently. The objective has formality and the characteristics of the state-function, which make verification and validation, situation awareness, and the controls of a plant enhanced. The specification of the objective is described by a top–down approach and illustrated with examples. The goal of a procedure is achieved through executions of successive objectives. Translation from paper procedures, printout, and maintenance are also improved. A sample man–machine interface and interaction based on this model is suggested.

A decision-making system, which consists of input, design, evaluation and selection, and output stages, is proposed to solve dynamic, multi-objective and unequal-area construction site layout planning (CSLP) problem. In the input stage, the multiple objectives, schedule planning and site condition are determined. In the design stage, two mathematical optimization models maxâ€“min ant system (MMAS) and modified Pareto-based ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm are employed to solve single objective optimization (SOO) and multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem respectively. In the evaluation and selection stage, the intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method is used to evaluate and select the best layout plan among the generated layout alternatives from the design stage. The performance of the proposed decision-making system, which was verified by a residential building project, shall assist the practitioners in the construction industry to deliver construction projects in a more efficient and effective manner, and thus construction costs could be reduced significantly.

The paper presents telecommunication services quality evaluation issues. It discusses the general European Union attitude and mentions the main documents of the European Council regarding the quality of service. The author presents two different, user´s and operator´s, points of view on the matter. Hence, two approaches to the service quality evaluation are discussed: an objective and subjective one. The author makes an effort to find a relationship between the quality of service and quality of experience for the WWW service. A proposal of new quality evaluation metric, based on the Median Opinion Score, is presented. Based on this approach, author proposed three zones, laid on the time scale, indicated by users´ evaluation grades of web opening times which correspond with the service quality experienced by them.

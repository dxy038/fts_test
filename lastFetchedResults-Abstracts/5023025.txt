The objective of this paper is to develop a computer-aided design methodology for linear variable reluctance motors based on Monte Carlo synthesis, rapid performance analysis, and design optimization using multi-attribute dominance. The random synthesis aspect of this approach has the advantage of not relying on expert rules or past experience that may limit design creativity. The multi-attribute dominance feature of this approach allows evaluation of design trade-offs along performance frontiers. With manufacturing automation as the target application, the design goal is to search for motors characterized by maximum acceleration subject to constraints on current density, flux density, speed and voltage

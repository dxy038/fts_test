Variable speed operation of wind turbines is conducted by torque control below rated wind speed. Variable speed wind turbines could lead to extract maximum power, which is the main objective of torque control, from the potential aerodynamic power of the wind. And nonlinearity of aerodynamic torque is very important in wind turbine in the aspect of control. In this paper, a torque control method considering a nonlinear parameter for rotor speed of aerodynamic torque below rated wind speed is investigated and simulation results for a 2MW wind turbine are presented.

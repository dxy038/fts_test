The objective of this paper is to study the validity of the hypothesis of the rationality of the
decisions of granting micro-credits to the micro-borrowers in MFIs through a behavioral
approach as long as the latter attempts to provide new behavioral assumptions of
microfinance by introducing behavioral and psychological biases of the micro-borrowers. We
tried to explore the main theoretical studies dealing with the hypothesis of rationality of the
micro-borrowers within the MFIs and the factors that affect it. At the empirical level, and
using a survey, we are interested in studying the psychological variables which affect the
micro-borrowersâ€™ rationality of the Tunisian AMCs. This study is based on an analysis of a
survey, as well as a logistic regression of an econometric model containing the behavioral
and psychological variables. In fact, these techniques enabled us to support the limited
decision rationality of granting micro-credits to the micro-borrowers within the AMCs.

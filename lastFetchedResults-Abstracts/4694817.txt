This research focused on the adjustment of the heating distribution by controlling the energy supplied to the induction coil at the frequency of 2.45 GHz. The objective is to determine the area which the heat is uniformly distributed. The result from this research was believed to be effectively applied to the cancer treatment. The main equipment in the experiment was the induction coils which were sets of two coils and four coils, and each coil has its own power-supply unit. The result showed that the activation of supply units one at a time generated more heating area than the one when all units were activated at the same time. Moreover, the heating area depended on the number of coils and the temperature, so the understanding of these factors on the heat generation would significantly benefit the cancer treatment in the future.

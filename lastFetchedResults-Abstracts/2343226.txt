Today, a new role for maintenance exists to enhance the eco-efficiency of the product life cycle. The concept of “life cycle maintenance” emerged to stress this role leading to push, at the manufacturing stage, an innovative culture wherein maintenance activities become of equal importance to actual production activities. This equivalence requires mainly considering the integration of the maintenance and production strategy planning for developing opportunistic maintenance task keeping conjointly the product - production - equipment performances. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for integrating maintenance and production planning. The approach uses the “odds algorithm” and is based upon the theory of optimal stopping. The objective is to select, among all the production stops already planned, those which will be optimal to develop maintenance tasks keeping the expected product conditions. It combines criteria such as functional performance and component reliability. Approach feasibility is shown on a practical example.

Background: Recent studies have shown that the prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising at an alarming rate but there is little agreement among researchers about obesity management and treatment. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of nutrition training and exercise training alone and together on body weight of overweight women referred to the health centers in Qazvin. 
Methods: This interventional study was carried out on 192 overweight women (Body Mass Index: 25-30) referred to the health centers in Qazvin during 2010. Participants were randomly allocated to four groups (control, nutrition training, exercise training and nutrition and exercise training). Data were collected using interview, observation, and questionnaires in three stages (before the intervention, immediately after the intervention and two months after the intervention). The intervention consisted of training for changing dietary habits, the food guide pyramid and physical activity. Data were analyzed by Chi-square test, Fisher exact test and ANOVA with repeated measurements.
Findings: Two months after intervention, body mass index was significantly decreased in exercise training group and nutrition and exercise training group. The mean knowledge score was increased in all groups but the differences were statistically significant in the intervention groups compared to the control group. 
Conclusion: With regards to the results, exercise training is better than nutrition training alone to control the body weight.

A multi-stage, multi-product, multi-constraint, and mixed continuous/batch plants planning problem is abstracted from production of diaphragm caustic soda, and the problem is formulated as a mathematic optimization model based on the objective to maximize the total profit with constraints involved resources, work manufacture processes and production capacity etc. An approach based on particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) with proportion-coding and dynamic-bounds coding scheme (PDCS) is proposed for the model. The validity and flexibility of the model and algorithm are verified by calculating the data from a real-world application.

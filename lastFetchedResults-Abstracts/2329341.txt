Background & Objective: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by synovium inflammation and articular destruction. mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could be effective in the treatment and prevention of several autoimmune diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of molecules secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for the prevention of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. 
Method & Materials: Supernatant of MSCs obtained from rat bone marrow derived MSCs culture. In prevention group, rats treated with collagen-adjuvant emulsion and MSC supernatant on days 0 and 7. In control group, we used from clutter medium instead of MSC supernatant for rats treatment and other cases were similar with prevention group. We also used from rats without any treatment as health control group. From day 7 through day 35after immunization, we investigated onset of CIA, paw swelling and clinical score in rats. We also determined histopathological features of joints and bones.
Results: We have found that supernatant of MSCs significantly delayed the onset of CIA and decreased paw swelling, bone destruction, inflammation of synovial and clinical score in prevention group compared with rats treated with culture medium in control group. 
Conclusion: Taken together, we conclude that molecules secreted by MSCs cells aren't able to prevent CIA in rats, but they can delay time of CIA induction and also decrease severity of arthritis and local and systemic tissue lesions.

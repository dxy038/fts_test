<p><strong>Objective: </strong>A significant increase in violence in the world and its impact on public health and ‎society can be an important reason to offer solutions to reduce or control anger. Studies ‎have shown that specific food groups may be effective in controlling mental disorders ‎such as depression, anxiety and anger. The purpose of this study was to determine the ‎relationship between food intake and Body Mass Index on state-trait anger expression ‎in female students of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences.<br /><strong>Method:</strong> In this cross-sectional study, 114 female students were randomly selected from ‎dormitories of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. Body height and ‎weight were measured using the scale and stadiometer, respectively. The required data ‎for evaluating the relationship between state-trait anger expression and food ‎consumption groups were collected using State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 ‎‎ (STAXI-2) and Food Frequency questionnaires.‎<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The results revealed a significant negative correlation between consumption of dairy ‎product and trait anger (angry reaction), (P = 0.015). This association remained ‎significant after adjustment of confounding factors. No significant correlations were ‎found between other food groups as well as BMI and state-trait anger expression.‎<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The higher intake of dairy products reduced state-trait anger expression. This result is ‎consistent with the findings of many studies on the effect of dairy consumption on ‎mental disorders. Therefore, consumption of dairy products can be a solution for ‎reducing anger.‎</p>

Pollutants can be introduced to soil through the application of organic and inorganic fertilizers and pesticides and through atmospheric depositions. The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of long-term (9–17 years) tillage systems on the behavior of pollutants in soils. Bioavailability and enrichment of heavy metals, arsenic, and organics, i.e. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB’s) and a chlorinated phenol (2,4-DCP) were measured in a Eutric Cambisol and a Luvisol under conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-tillage (NT). Soil samples were collected from 0 to 3, 3 to 10, and 10 to 25 cm depths.

per layer of NT soils was enriched in pollutants, but concentrations decreased with increasing soil depth. Atmospheric deposition of pollutants and input via organic fertilizers was noticeable in soils under long-term NT. Total amount of zinc (59 mg kg−1) was significantly enriched in the 0–3 cm depth of the Luvisol under NT and this was attributed to higher sorption capacity for heavy metal input via liquid manure. In the Eutric Cambisol, NT resulted in significant increase of cadmium extracted by aqua regia in the arable layer of 0–25 cm. As a result of higher soil organic C, long-term accumulation of PCB’s in NT soils was more pronounced than in plowed soils. In plowed soils the mixing effect resulted in homogeneous distribution of pollutants within a soil depth of 0–25 cm.

richment of organic C in RT and NT soils emphasizes the role of soils as a sink for pollutants, buffering the contaminants against leaching and transfer into crops.

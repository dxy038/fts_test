In this paper, a new half-bridge zeta converter employing a center-tapped rectifier is proposed. The proposed converter provides a bidirectional powering path in the rectifier. As a result, its improved rectifier voltage waveform reduces the output filter size. Also, it has a wide ZVS range due to the characteristic of the conventional single-ended half-bridge zeta converter. The operational principles, the characteristics, and the design considerations of the proposed converter are analyzed. To verify the performance of the proposed converter, experimental results from a 180W prototype are presented.

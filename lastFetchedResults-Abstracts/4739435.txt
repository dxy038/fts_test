By human and machine and environment are the interactions among interdisciplinary, it is an important branch of industrial engineering. Based on the characteristics and development trend of subject proposed for metallurgy industry, the necessity of human engineering analysis on the possibility of behavior has errors, and good man-machine-environment system helps to reduce operator errors, and the objective factors conducive to prevent and reduce subjective factors or social factors. Study metallurgical industry, electric machine and environment steel making human interaction in order to achieve the purposes of safe, comfortable and efficient production.

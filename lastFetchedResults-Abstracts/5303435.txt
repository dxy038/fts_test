The objective of this work is to find the best metric to ignore the variations of soil reflectance induced by the solar-view angles geometry. Differences between spectra measured for the same soil under different observation and illumination configurations can leads to misclassifications. Using ninety two soils of different composition measured under twenty eight solar- view angles geometries, we tested 3 metrics : RMSE, SAM, R<sup>2</sup> (the coefficient of determination) and we compared their performances. The best metric seems to be the coefficient of determination with 93 % of good classifications.

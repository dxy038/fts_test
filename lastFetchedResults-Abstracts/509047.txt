Background and Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of aerobic and anaerobic exercise on reproductive hormones in male. 
Subjects and Methods: 45 subjects performed three randomized trials on separate groups, (1) aerobic group, (2) anaerobic group, (3) control group. Aerobic group performed continuous exercise with 65% (VO2max) and anaerobic group performed interval exercise with 100% (VO2max). Pre and post of the exercise blood samples were collected and analyzed for testosterone, luteinizing (LH), follicle-stimulating (FSH), prolactin and cortisol hormones. Diet, physical activity and circadian influences were all controlled. 
Results: Compared with the control, the aerobic and anaerobic groups significantly (P <  0/05) elevated testosterone, prolactin and cortisol. Neither exercise produced significant (P  <  0/05) changes of FSH. LH in the aerobic group did not change but in anaerobic group was significantly elevated in comparison with the control group. 
Conclusion: This study has shown that there are not any correlations between testosterone and LH in the aerobic group which is a normal function of hypothalamus-hypophysis- axis and this is due to the low level of testosterone endurance  athletes doing stamina sports. Also significant increase was found between testosterone and prolactin of both experimental groups which is similar to other reports and aims of present study as well.

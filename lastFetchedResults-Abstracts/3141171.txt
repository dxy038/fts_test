Decision support systems (DSS) are computerized information systems used for decision making activities and management support. The importance of DSS is increasing with the advent of computerized systems. DSS has been remained one of the most important and widely researched area in disaster management. In any type of disaster either the source of these disasters is natural or human, the primary objective is always to minimize the causalities. To get this goal an efficient evacuation plan is required. Agent based technology has been remained a preferred field of research for last few decades in disaster management. There has been a problem of congestion while evacuating from large buildings with few exit points. In this article we have proposed a multi agent-based decision support system for prioritized evacuation during fire disaster. The proposed model can be implemented to validate proposed idea in evacuation to ensure the safety and quick evacuation of evacuees. The disaster points can be relocated and changed to assess the effect on the model.

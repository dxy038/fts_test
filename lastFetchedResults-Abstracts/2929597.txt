Environmental conditions influence the thermal energy level of forest canopies. The objective of this paper is to determine if airborne MSS emittance values could be used to evaluate the discrimination of surface temperature caused by different micro-environmental and ecological conditions. In this work surface temperatures were calculated from approximately 2000 m altitude airborne MSS data of swamp forest in Mooswald in the Rhine Valley

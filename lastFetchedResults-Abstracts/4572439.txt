In this paper, an objective perceptual quality metric for haptic signals is introduced. A haptic perceptually weighted peak signal-to-noise ratio (HPWNPSNR) is derived, that enhances the standard PSNR measure while incorporating haptic perceptual knowledge acquired from existing psychophysical models. Two techniques are introduced that define the haptic perceptual weighting strategy. The first relies on a basic mathematical formulation, whereas the alternative technique makes use of fuzzy logic principles. Preliminary results are demonstrated to validate the proposed metricÂ´s utility and performance.

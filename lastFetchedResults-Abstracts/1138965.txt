A novel non-contact computer vision method was employed to analyse the functional properties of cheddar Cheese including melting and browning during cooking. The Cheese melted significantly during the first 4 min of cooking at 70–200°C and the melting effect changed slightly afterwards. Meltability reached a peak at 130°C. Browning occurred slightly at 70°C and became more rapid and notable as cooking temperature increased. The results indicate that the new method is objective, accurate and efficient. Furthermore, the melting and browning property of Cheese can be measured simultaneously with this novel method.

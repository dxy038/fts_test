Bioremediation is a process technology that uses microorganisms to degrade specific organic chemicals. In recent years, bioremediation has proven to be successful for the remediation of soils contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Even though bioremediation has had a high success rate, the associated kinetics are still not fully understood. The kinetics become even more complicated when fungi are used for the remediation. The primary objective of this research was to determine the specific degradation rates for the bioremediation of PAH contaminated soils. Specifically, the kinetics associated with the fungi Cunninghamella echinulata var. elegans in conjunction with three supplemental nutrient solutions were investigated.

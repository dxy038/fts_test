Measurement of light flicker according to current standard EN ISO 61000-4-15 is performed through measurement of voltage variations filtered by a model of a 60 W/230 V incandescent lamp. Hence, differences in current illumination systems technology can determine discrepancies between light flicker measurements performed under the same voltage flicker. In the paper, a method to measure light flicker with a low cost digital device, based on light intensity measurements, is proposed, thus including the lamp itself in the measurement process. In this way an objective measurement of light flicker is obtained. The metrological characterization of the device has been implemented by means of an automatic testing station which includes a standard IEC flickermeter (Norma D6000) as reference instrument. Thanks to its portability, the instrument can be used to measure light flicker no matter the illumination system used, over a wide range of environments spanning from home/office to industrial locations, and including the environmental condition (i.e., ambient light and reflection by walls and objects) in the measurement process

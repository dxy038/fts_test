In electromagnetic design, uncertainties in design variables are inevitable, thus in addition to pursuing the theoretical optimum of the objective function the evaluation of robustness of the optimum solution is also critical. Several methodologies exist to tackle robust optimization, such as worst case optimization and gradient index; this paper investigates the use of standard deviation and mean value of objective function under uncertainty of variables. A modified Kriging model with the ability of balancing exploration and exploitation is employed to facilitate the objective function prediction. Two TEAM benchmark problems are solved using different methodologies to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different robust optimization approaches.

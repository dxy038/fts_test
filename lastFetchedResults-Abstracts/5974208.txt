The main objective of this study is the application of body-seat interface shape and pressure measurements for the prediction of seating posture, such as trunk flexion angle and pelvic rotation angle. To investigate the relationship between pressure and interface shape and seating posture, 16 wheelchair users were recruited to sit in a wheelchair simulator. During seating, body pressure distribution and interface shape as well as their posture were measured. Using linear regression model, trunk, pelvic and thigh seating postures can be predicted with considerable accuracy based on interface shape and pressure information. Since pressure distribution and interface shape data provided quantitative and objective indices in measuring seating posture, the proposed method can be used for more effective wheelchair or automobile seating design and evaluation

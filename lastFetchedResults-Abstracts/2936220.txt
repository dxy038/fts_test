The ER-2 Doppler radar (EDOP) is an X-band (9.60 GHz) Doppler radar flown on the high-altitude (nom. 20 km) NASA ER-2 aircraft. A major objective of EDOP is the study of air motions within convective precipitating regions from the strong updraft regions to the cirrus anvil regions. It is common for EDOP to fly with a complement of passive and active precipitation and water vapor instruments on the ER-2. The purpose of this paper is to describe the EDOP instrument specifications and capabilities and to very briefly describe recent data and research activity

Using a hybrid analysis method consisting of the method of moments and geometrical theory of diffraction, calculations on a circularly polarized dual-beam antenna with a circular reflector are carried out, and the directivities conforming to the design objective are obtained. The directivity of a monopole antenna positioned on a finite planar reflecting plate is calculated. Assuming the direction and number of elements of the monopole antenna to be arbitrary values, the effects of diffractions due to the reflectorÂ´s edges are considered on the basis of the geometrical theory of diffraction. The antenna considered here is intended for communication between a stationary satellite and mobile stations.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The objective of this paper is to present novel detection principles based on all active multispectral polarimetric subtraction imaging principles of targets embedded in scattering media. The novelty of this contribution consists in the formation of multispectral StokesÂ´ parameter image differences, degree of linear polarization image differences, and Mueller-matrix image differences. As a result, high-contrast high-specificity images can be obtained by removing the background from the target. Further contrast enhancement of the target with light beam steering capabilities can be obtained by doping the background surrounding the target or the target itself with high-index-of-refraction polar molecules/nanoparticles. The presented optical principles can be successfully applied to a variety of applications, such as cancer detection and treatment, molecular imaging, and development of photonics and nanophotonic devices, for a widespread group of applications, such as defense and advanced medical diagnostic and analytical devices

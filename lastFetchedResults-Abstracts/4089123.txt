One of the fundamental purposes of the Institute is the dissemination to its members of information concerning new theories, new apparatus, and new developments throughout the electrical field. Incidental to its responsibility under this objective, and pursuant to action of the board of directors (EE, June 1946, p 270) the AIEE publication committee has been developing ways and means of improving the InstituteÂ´s publications policy and procedure with the objectives of better serving the greatly enlarged and rapidly growing membership and of covering adequately the active and ever-growing electrical field.

From now on, in each issue I will present one or two &#8220;montage portraits.&#8221; These are actually the caricatures of friends, scientists, artists, cartoonists, politicians; and celebrities, made by using found objects. While producing these portraits, there is an objective: I try my best not to reshape the found objects, but to use them as they are found. Of course, sometimes this is impossible. Then this self-made rule is extended so as only to bend them, or to make them round, etc. The answer to the question of why I apply such a rule is simply because I am not a sculptor, but a cartoonist with an engineering background, who is trying to use real objects (instead of a pen) to make caricatures of real people.

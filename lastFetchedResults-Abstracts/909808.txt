The paper reports the first results of the Project WADI (Sustainability of European Irrigated Agriculture under Water Directive
and Agenda 2000), funded under the 5th Framework Programme of the European Union (EU). The objective of the project is to
evaluate the economic, social and environmental sustainability of European irrigated farming under different scenarios concerning
water policy and the Common Agricultural Policy. The methodology relies on scenario analysis combined with farm level
mathematical programming models. Two pilot case studies are presented for Italy: cereal farming and fruit farming. According to
the first results, the impact of the directive, up to reasonable prices, may be summed up in a minor reduction of water use associated
with a sharp decrease of farm income and a significant reduction of employment. Nevertheless, different farming systems may react
in very different ways. More detailed local analyses are needed in order to support the design of effective and efficient policies at
basin level.

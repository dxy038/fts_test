Fuzzy clustering is a technique which adopts the fuzzy mathematics method to build up faintness relations of the characteristic on the basis of characteristic, close degree and comparability of the objective item. In this chapter, based on a lot of correlative literature, we first adopt a fuzzy hierarchical clustering method and a fuzzy equivalent matrix method to distinguish the partial discharge signals of a transformer, in order to research into a more effective method of partial discharge pattern recognition.

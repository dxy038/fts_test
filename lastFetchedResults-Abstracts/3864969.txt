This paper proposes a bidirectional linear ultrasonic motor using longitudinal vibrating transducer. The fundamental principle of this motor has been demonstrated. A prototype linear motor was fabricated and investigated. Maximum speed of 947mm/s and maximum thrust force of 35N have been achieved. The transducer consists of two Langevin transducers that assemble together with their axes in pi/2 angle. The structure and driving circuit are simple, and the prototype motor shows high-speed and large thrust

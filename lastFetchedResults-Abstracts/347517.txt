Objective: Whole head magnetoencephalography was used to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuromagnetic brain activity associated with rhythmic auditory stimulation.
Methods: In order to characterize the evolution of the auditory responses we applied a Karhunen-Lo√®ve decomposition and k-means cluster analysis to globally compare spatial patterns of brain activity at different latencies and stimulation rates. Tones were presented binaurally at 27 different stimulation rates within a perceptually and behaviorally relevant range from 0.6 to 8.1 Hz.
Results: Over this range, we observed a linear increase of the amplitude of the main auditory response at 100 ms latency (N1m) with increasing inter-stimulus interval, and qualitative changes of the overall spatiotemporal dynamics of the auditory response. In particular, a transition occurred between a transient evoked response at low frequencies, and a continuous steady-state response at high frequencies.
Conclusions: We show the onset of temporal overlap between responses to successive tones that leads to this transition. Response overlap begins to occur near 2 Hz, marking the onset of a continuous perceptual representation.

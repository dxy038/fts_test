In this study, a robust algorithm with a fuzzy sliding model controller (FSMC) is used to synchronization of a Duffing-Holmes system. The robust algorithm is an output factor of the fuzzy sliding model controller. The control rules of FSMC are based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. The objective of synchronization is to study a master-and-slave system to be synchronized with both uncertainties and disturbances added in the slave system. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

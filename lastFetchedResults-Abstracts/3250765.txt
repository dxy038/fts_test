Nowadays, digital traces are omnipresent in Information System (IS). Companies track IS interactions to retrieve and compile information about actors. Researchers of various streams, within IT and beyond, focused on recording actor interactions with systems and the technical possibilities to identify record and store these interactions. Tracing functionality has appeared in almost all common computer applications. This PhD project will focus on the establishment of a trace-based system and propose recommendations to actors regarding to their context. The objective of this thesis is to study process traces to propose recommendations to the actors by identifying a set of generic processes adaptable to the current actorsÂ´ context. Thus, any actor, expert or novice, will be able to use this knowledge that gives contextual clues to identify the potential steps he could perform.

Background: Oxidative species produced during exercise can cause damages to some tissues such as kidney, liver and skeletal muscle. It seems that metallothionein plays a protective role against these actions. 
Objective: To assess the effect of four weeks of high intensity interval training versus aerobic exercise on metallothionein levels of myocardial tissue in healthy male rats.
Methods: This experimental study was done on 36 male Wistar rats (2 months of age with an average weight of 180Â±20) in 2015.The rats were randomly divided into three groups: control (n=12), high intensity interval training (n=12), and aerobic training (n=12) groups. The experimental groups exercised according to the training program 5 days a week for 4 weeks. During this period, the control group did not have any training programs. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data.
Findings: The results indicate no significant difference among the mean metallothionein in control, aerobic exercise and high intensity interval training groups. However, the amount of myocardial metallothionein increased as a result of high intensity interval training and decreased during aerobic exercise.
Conclusion: It seems that the duration and intensity of exercise need to be adjusted in order to obtain better results.

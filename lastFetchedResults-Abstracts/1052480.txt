Several octyl 5-O-(α-d-arabinofuranosyl)-α-d-arabinofuranoside disaccharide analogs substituted at the 5-position of the non-reducing end sugar were synthesized and tested in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.), Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) as well as in a cell free assay system for arabinosyltransferase acceptor/inhibitor activity. A few compounds showed interesting inhibitory activity in the cell free assay as well as against the whole microorganism in vitro.

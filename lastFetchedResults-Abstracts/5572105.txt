We try to simulate a new approach to constraint based path selection for dynamic routing in optical networks based on WDM. We are mainly concentrating on shared path protection because it is resource efficient due to the fact that backup paths can share wavelength links when their corresponding working paths are mutually diverse. Considering restoration, our work includes proposal of an online routing algorithm based on link potential value (LPV) to achieve better resource utilization with reduced computational complexity. The main objective is to distribute the traffic evenly across the network in order to reduce the amount of recovery requests under multiple failure scenario. We also arrived recovery time in case of link failure.

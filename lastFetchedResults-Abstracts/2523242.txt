Abstract

Background Aims: MSassociated fatigue (MSF) and poor sleep are common and treatable features of MS, which affect QOL. The objective of this study was to assess the association between fatigue, sleep quality, and quality of life in people with MS.

 Materials Methods: Crosssectional data were collected from 217 MS patients, who were referred to the outpatient MS center of Urmia, Iran, in 2013. Healthrelated quality of life (MS Quality of Life54), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, PSQI) were assessed.

Results: We included 217 patients in the analysis. The mean plusmn  SD age of patients was 32.6 plusmn  9.6 years, and 79% were female. One hundred fiftytwo (70.1%) of the patients were classified as poor sleepers based on PSQI scores. One hundred twentytwo patients (56.4%) presented significant fatigue based on FSS results. The mean physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) health composite scores of the MSQOL54 were 40.12 (SE 1.27) and 43.81 (SE 1.61), respectively. There was a strong statistically significant positive correlation between PCS scores and MCS, FSS, and PSQI scores. MCS scores were strongly correlated with FSS and PQSI scores. Age exhibited significant negative correlations with PCS and MCS scores, and it was significantly correlated with FSS and PSQI scores.

Conclusions: We observed strong correlations between QOL, fatigue, and sleep quality in a large communitybased sle of individuals with MS. These findings support routinely screening and monitoring fatigue severity and sleep quality and their effects on QOL.

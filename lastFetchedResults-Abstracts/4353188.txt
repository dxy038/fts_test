University computer science and software engineering students must build reliability and security into their software applications from the start of development. A graduate-level Software Testing and Reliability course at North Carolina State University has a learning objective of using appropriate testing techniques for the development of a reliable and secure system. Beginning in Fall 2005, the semester project has involved the development and testing of the open source and freely-available iTrust Medical Records system prototype. Our vision is to build a community of educators, students, and medical professionals that can collaborate and use the iTrust project as a development platform and testbed for secure and reliable application development

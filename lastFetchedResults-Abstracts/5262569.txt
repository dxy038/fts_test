In this work, we present a new teaching approach that we have implemented in our introductory computer science programming course. The methodology consists of team teaching, a hybrid delivery system, recorded lecture retrieval capability, readiness assessment activities, objective assessment of student progress, and cooperative learning through team work. The two new aspects of this approach are team teaching and objective assessment to provide additional feedback to students. Details of this work, including its advantages, disadvantages, and student feedback, are included in the paper.

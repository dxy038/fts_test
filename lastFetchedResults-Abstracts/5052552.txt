This paper presents an overview of a new wireless network research testbed being developed by several wireless communications and networking research groups at UCLA. Its primary objective is to provide researchers at every layer of the protocol stack, from physical devices to transport protocols, a testbed to evaluate the impact of their technology on application level performance, using scalable and realistic operational scenarios. To achieve this objective, the testbed will use a collection of physical testbeds integrated with a scalable, multitool simulation framework.

Cu and Ni are metals found in galvanic sludges; these sludges are considered hazardous due to their heavy metal content. The main objective of this work is to determine the incorporation amount of Cu and Ni in Portland clinker when a galvanic sludge containing these metals is added to the clinker raw-material. The influence of this addition on the clinkering reactions is evaluated as well as the possibility of co-incinerating galvanic sludges containing Cu and Ni in rotary cement kilns. This study also characterizes the galvanic sludge. Samples were prepared by additions from 0.25 to 5 wt.% of a galvanic sludge to an industrial clinker raw-material. The clinkering process was simulated in a laboratory device. The following techniques were applied to characterize the raw materials and the products of the tests: chemical analysis, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). Leaching tests were performed in the produced clinker samples in order to verify the incorporation of the studied metals in the clinker structure. The results led to the conclusion that additions of up to 2 wt.% of a galvanic sludge containing 2.4 wt.%Cu and 1.2 wt.% Ni to clinker raw-material do not affect the clinkering reactions and that these metals are totally incorporated into the clinker.

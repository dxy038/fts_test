Visual quality is one of the most important issues in digital cinema applications, and the most practical method to measure visual quality is using objective metrics. Several objective metrics that take into account perceived visual quality have been developed in the past few years; one of them is based on the structural similarity paradigm. To analyze the performance of these objective metrics for digital cinema applications, a subjective visual quality assessment in digital cinema environments using contents from the digital cinema initiative (DCI) standard evaluation material has been conducted in a previous study. Since in practice digital cinema utilizes only high quality imagery, in this paper we analyze further a subset of high- quality stimuli from the previous study.

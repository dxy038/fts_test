Angiotensin II and endothelin-1 (ET) are two hormones involved in cardiovascular diseases and well known for their capacity to induce free radical generation in vascular and cardiac tissues. In addition to its prooxidative effect, angiotensin II can increase the synthesis of ET-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Our objective was to determine whether the ET-1 synthesis in VSMC is involved in angiotensin II-induced superoxide anion production in rats. Our results show that treatments of isolated VSMC with angiotensin II and ET increased superoxide. However, this increase occurred in a bimodal fashion for angiotensin II with a fast transient production (10 min) and a late sustained production (6 h), while ET-1 induced superoxide formation after a delay of 6 h. LU302872 and BQ-123, a nonselective and a selective ETA receptor antagonists, respectively, prevented angiotensin II-induced superoxide anion production only during the late phase. In contrast, BQ-3020, a selective ETB receptor antagonist, had no effect. In vivo, LU302872 reduced the aortic superoxide production induced by angiotensin II administered for 12 days. In conclusion, our results suggest that the superoxide generation induced by chronic angiotensin II infusion may be mediated by ET-1 acting on ETA receptors in VSMC in vitro. Furthermore, this effect appears to contribute to the excess superoxide production during the chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system in vivo.

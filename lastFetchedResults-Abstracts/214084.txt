Objective:
Breath holding spells, very often misinterpreted as epileptic seizures,
are most common in children aged 6 months to 6 years of age. In
this investigation, we sought to prospectively document the natural
history of breath holding spells (BHS) among children with cyanotic,
pallid and mixed type BHS referred for neurological consultation.
Materials & Methods:
This was a cross-sectional study in which a total of 43 children (23
boys, 20 girls) with BHS, admitted to the out patient clinic of the
Children's Hospital Medical Center, between Sept 1998 and June
1999, were enrolled. A structured interview was under taken at the
time of initial consultation to confirm BHS and its type, associated
phenomenon, family history, sex and age at initiation of spells.
Laboratory, electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic tests
were done.
Results:
Patients were between 1.7 and 42.8 months (mean age 18.4 months).
In 76.8% of cases, BHS began during the first 12 months of age.
Anger and pain were the most common triggering factors (65.1 %).
A positive family history of BHS was identified in 51% and parental
consanguinity was found in 30% of cases. The spells were cyanotic
in 79.1% (34 children). 78% of cases were iron deficient and 53%
of cases had iron deficiency anemia.
Conclusion:
The results of this study emphasize the role of genetic factors in BHS;
measurement of hemoglobin and serum ferritin is recommended all
such cases.

Ayatollah Kashani medical centeres. Variables such as demographic information, BMI, clinical
presentations of chronic pain, and VAS were included. The data were analyzed using regression and
correlation coefficient statistical tests.

chronic pain were low back pain, knee pain, headache, and a combination of these discomforts.

This paper presents a prototype of an interactive virtual environment (VE). The objective of the system is to link 3D intelligent virtual environments to interactive planning systems. This type of system makes possible interactive solutions where the user refines a possible configuration and enables the system to generate a complete new solution enforcing all the design constraints previously programmed. In this prototype we link our constraint solver with the visualization engine so that all the solutions generated by the constraint solver are displayed in a VE

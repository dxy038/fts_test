The idea of extending mobile IP capabilities to ad hoc networks introduces fast agent discovery, increases cell coverage of access points, and extends ad hoc network size by providing connection to the Internet. We aim to show that an adaptive protocol is required since different protocols are optimum for different environments. We propose two protocols called MEWLANA-TD and MEWLANA-RD based on DSDV and a novel ad hoc routing called tree based bidirectional routing (TBBR) respectively in addition to the proposed protocols based on on-demand routing. We classify the ad hoc environment into regions and present which protocol is appropriate for which region.

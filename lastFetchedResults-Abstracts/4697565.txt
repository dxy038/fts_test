Many rehabilitation robotic systems have been developed to aid people with disabilities but few are used in practice. A new method to evaluate the performance of a rehabilitation robot that aids quadriplegics in eating is described in this paper. Seven objective indices are proposed to evaluate the performance of this rehabilitation robotic system. Each index is discussed by putting the evaluator in the position of the users, which has proved effective

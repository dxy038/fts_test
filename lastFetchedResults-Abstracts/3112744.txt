Direct adaptive controller is developed and incorporated into a missileÂ´s attitude control system (ACS) architecture to enhance its performance in the presence of system uncertainties. The adaptive control algorithm is developed based on the simplified version of model reference adaptive control concept. It possesses two practical performance features: (1) providing robust performance for the ACS system without the need of a parameter estimator, and (2) ease of implementation which is practically attractive to the enhancement of the ACS performance. Its development and implementation are intended to primarily provide a better solution to the center of gravity (CG) control problem when firing a divert thruster with the line of force offset from its center of mass. Robustness of the adaptive controller subject to Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) uncertainties is also tested in this paper as the secondary objective.

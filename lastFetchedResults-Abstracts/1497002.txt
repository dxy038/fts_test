Rainscreen wall design is still at its infancy stage even after its introduction about four decades ago. Research continues in an effort to set out appropriate design guidelines for rainscreen walls. This paper presents the key results of yearlong full-scale measurements of wind loading on rainscreen walls. The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of various design parameters on the wind loading on rainscreen. This paper also presents the current status of the available codes and standards regarding the wind loads on rainscreen walls and compares the full-scale results with some available provisions.

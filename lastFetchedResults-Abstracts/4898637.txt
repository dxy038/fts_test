The paper presents the idea of usage oriented requirements engineering, an extension of use case driven analysis. The main objective is to achieve a requirements engineering process resulting in a model which captures both functional requirements and system usage aspects in a comprehensive manner. The paper presents the basic concepts and the process of usage oriented requirements engineering, and the synthesized usage model resulting from this process. The role of this model in system development, and its potential applications are also discussed.

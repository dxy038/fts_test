The switched inductor model (SIM) is developed by considering the average voltages and currents in pulse-width-modulated (PWM) converters. The objective is to present the unified features of the SIM model and to identify its limitations. Close examination of the power stage of common switch mode topologies reveals that they all include an inductor which is switched at one end between two points. This switching action is usually carried out by a transistor and a steering diode. The net behavior is that of a switch which toggles the inductor between the two end points. The idea behind the SIM is to replace this switching part by an equivalent circuit which emulates the average behavior of the three terminals. Good agreement was found between computer simulations based on the proposed SIM and experimental results for PWM and quasi-resonant converters

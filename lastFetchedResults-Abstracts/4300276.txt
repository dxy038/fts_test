JGN2 Japan Gigabit Network 2, has been established at the end of March 2004. JGN2 is a successor of JGNI, which has been established by Telecommunication Advancement Organization (TAO) in 1999. JGNI was desgined for the nation-wide R&amp;D network for high speed network infrastructure. JGN2 has the same objective as JGN, however uses different layer 2 technologies. JGNI have developped a nation-wide IPv6 testbed, which was the largest scale of multi-vendor IPv6 network. The network transition from JGNI IPv6 to JGN IPv6 has been smoothly achieved with only total of 8 hour transition period. JGN2 IPv6 network has thefollowing features. (I) Layer 2 testbed for Layer 3 research activities (2) Consideration of IP Multicast Research (3) Global IPv6 connectivity (4) Policy control to achieve appropriate AUP (5) Advanced layer 2 technologies; optical, GMPLS and long-distanced-Ethernet

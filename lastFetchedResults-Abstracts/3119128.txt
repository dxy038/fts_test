In order to provide support for steering the future communication and education on environmental protection in Shanghai aimed at encouraging public participation in environmental protection and facilitating the realization of the strategic objective of transforming Shanghai into an eco-city, an investigation has been conducted on public environmental awareness in Shanghai focusing on public environmental concern, environmental awareness, environmental protection behavior and evaluation of Governmental efforts in environmental protection. Individual information and data has been analyzed and evaluated to draw the conclusions: the public environmental awareness is yet to be further enhanced, for which public environmental concern is the key factor. The different factors including gender, educational background, age, income and living area all have significant impact on the four aspects of environmental awareness. In the end, recommendations have been made accordingly.

Objective(s): In the current study, sunscreen and moisturizing properties of solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN)-safranal formulations were evaluated. Materials and Methods:Series of SLN were prepared using glyceryl monostearate, Tween 80 and different amounts of safranal by high shear homogenization, and ultrasound and high-pressure homogenization (HPH) methods. SLN formulations were characterized for size, zeta potential, morphology, thermal properties, and encapsulation efficacy. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of the products was determined in vitro using transpore tape. The moisturizing activity of the products was also evaluated by corneometer. Results: The SPF of SLN-safranal formulations was increased when the amount of safranal increased. Mean particle size for all formulas was approximately 106 nm by probe sonication and 233 nm using HPH method. The encapsulation efficiency of safranal was around 70% for all SLN-safranal formulations. Conclusion: The results conclude that SLN-safranal formulations were found to be effective for topical delivery of safranal and succeeded in providing appropriate sunscreen properties.

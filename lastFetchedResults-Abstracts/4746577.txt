Despite advances in telecommunication technologies, remote communication is still not as convincing as face to face communication, since haptic sense, as an important medium of expressing affection, is missing. In this paper, we describe a frameworks for reinforcing advantages of the intimate haptics sensation to exchange feelings and increase the sense of presence in a remote caring communication as well as XOXO prototype of intimate haptics interface for interpersonal communication through hugging and kissing. XOXO facilitates physical interaction in a remote communication between humans by enabling to kiss and hug one another through robotics interface and wearable hug reproducing jacket. The objective of this system is to develop a computer mediated haptics stimulation platform which can produce almost similar affective response on humans relative to a real physical intimate haptics interaction.

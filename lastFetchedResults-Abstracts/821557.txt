Background: Constructed wetlands (CWS) are Mimic Filtration Process in Natural Wetlands that effectively remove variety pollutants from wastewater. The main objective is feasibility evaluation for using of subsurface flow constructed wetland in nitrogen and phosphorus removal from synthetic based on domestic wastewater in lab scale.
Methods: In this study, a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland made in lab scale. Hydraulic retention time was 6 days and wastewater flow regime was gravity and continuous. Synthetic based feed as seem as domestic wastewater was use for influent. COD/N/P ratio considered 100/32/2. Material of media stratification made by peat, course gravel, and soils supporting growth plant and regard to this media,media slope and porosity range was 2% and 30-40% respectively. System depth selected 0.7 m regard to design depth for Phragmites. Influent flow to treatment with Darcyâ€™s equation for porosity layer estimated 50l/day. Cattail and Common reed (Phragmites) planted in the constructed wetland. Results analyzed by software Spss.12.
Findings: The results of this study indicated that the efficiency of subsurface CWs reactor with paired two tests and significance percent 95% for Ammonia and total phosphorus removal were 35.06 and 31 percents respectively (P ? 0.05). Maximum and minimum total suspended solids in effluent varied between 37 and 20 mg/l respectively.
Conclusion: It can be concluded that the efficiency of subsurface flow CWs reactor with gravel and peat media and using cattail and common reed (Phragmites) plants for Ammonia nitrogen and Phosphorous removals were appropriate and it can be an eco-friendly alternative with provides suitable operation and maintenance condition, instead of other mechanical systems for wastewater treatment.

An improved genetic algorithm on the basis of Gray encoding is presented, which is improved based on optimum maintenance of simple genetic algorithm and performs selected operator combination with fitness proportional model. The algorithm ensures the convergence property of genetic algorithm, and prevents premature phenomenon in some extent. In this paper, it is an example of the rolling shear mechanism optimal design, the minimum error of the actual trajectory and the ideal trajectory of the rolling shear is objective function. The bar length of the rolling shear mechanism is obtained by using simple genetic algorithm and improved genetic algorithm separately. The effectiveness of improved genetic algorithm has been proved through the result of examples.

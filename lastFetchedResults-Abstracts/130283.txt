Introduction & Objective: Malathion is one of the most used insecticides against orchard pests. The poison affects the nervous system of the insects and controls the cholinesterase enzyme. This study aimed at determining the effects of Malathion insecticide spray on these pests.
Materials & Methods: This study was carried out on the sprayers in the agricultural section in the city of Tonekabon in Mazandaran Province in 2000. Twenty five sprayers from agricultural section were selected as the research society. The effect of this spray on the levels of the subjects' cholinesterase enzyme was studied. In this study, the tintometric method was applied that could be done with a small amount of blood sample and outside laboratory environment. In this method, the changes in blood PH were measured.
Results: The findings of the research showed that the amount of cholinesterase activity was about 65% in 5% of the sprays, 75% in 20% of them, 87.5% in 40% of them and 100% in 35% of them. Conclusion: Results showed that malathion appeared to be a low-risk insecticide. If health and safety rules are observed, safety equipment is used, and the instructions of agricultural experts are taken into consideration, there would be a less decrease in the amount of cholinesterase activity. Therefore, sprayers should be supervised spraying crops with malathion insecticides. They should also be provided with necessary trainings and precautions as to the risks involved in working with these poisons.

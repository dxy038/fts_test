Abstract
Background and Objective:  Transtheoretical model (TTM) is one of the models applied to  assess the regular physical activity. The aim of the current study was to investigate the regular physical activity based on transtheoretical model constructs among Golestan University of Medical Sciences’ students.
Material and Methods:  In this cross-sectional study, 295 students were recruited through convenience sampling. The instruments were Marcos et al. Stages of change and Nigg et al. Decisional balance questionnaires. Their validity was approved by content and face validity andtheir reliability by test re test method.   Data analysis was conducted by Chi- square ,Logestic regression, and ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc tests.
Results:  The mean age of the participants is 21.89±3.05. Eighty nine point five percent are unmarried and 67.5% females .The results show that they are in precontemplation (60.3%) contemplation(8.8%), preparation(11.9%), action(9.5%)  and maintanenec (9.5%)stages. There is a significant relationship between stage of change with cons and pros of physicalactivity(p < 0.05.( Male gender, Bsc and lower educational levels along with cons are the best predictors of regular physical activity(p < 0.05(.
Conclusion: Since the majority of the students(81%) have a  sedentary life, It is a necessity to conduct some  planned interventions for their progress on maintenance stage. Increasing of pros and decreasing of cons could be useful.

The continuing exploitation of the Internet has witnessed the development of new working patterns including nomadic computing and the formation of extranets. These require the network infrastructure to provide not only secure transport, but also flexibility. Mobile IP version 6 goes some way to supporting this with IPSec support, auto-configuration and forwarding mechanisms. However, further functionality is required higher up the protocol stack to provide a practical secure group-working environment. The main objective of the presented architecture is to provide a new, distributed, secure working environment based on robust and efficient network mechanisms, allowing for dynamic collaboration groups without topological constraints. The security architecture is described and performance of the group management protocol analysed through simulation results.

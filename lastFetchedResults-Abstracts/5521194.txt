A neural network approach to reference governor control of systems with constraints on state and control variables is discussed. A feed-forward neural network architecture is used to define safety sets in a constrained system state-space. Results presented here include the description of a neural reference governor algorithm and its application to linear and nonlinear control systems. The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of such a design as an alternative to the Lyapunov function approach to the control of constrained systems.

Background and Objective: Because of high growth of elderly population and the role of life style in their problems, we aimed to investigate  the elders’life style in Kashmar.
Material and Methods: This descriptive study was conducted on 267 of over- 60- older people, who were covered by Kashmar health centers, selected by multi-stage sampling. We collected the data, using a valid and reliable questionnaire, via interview and analyzed them by SPSS 18 version using Chi- Square, ANOVA, independent t test, and correlation coefficient.
Results: The Mean age of the elderly was 69.03±0.38. The life style was moderate in 180 (67.4%) and desirable in 87 (32.6%) of them. There was significant relationship between life style and the variables such as age, marital status and education level (P < 0.001).  In addition, there was significant negative relationship between age and preventive behavior (p < 0.001 r=-0.453), physical activity (p < 0.001 r=-0.226), tension (p < 0.001 r= -0.252) and social relation (p < 0.001 r=-0.311).
Conclusion: A high percentage of elderly hasn't desirable life style; therefore, we recommend appropriate measures, especially educational intervention for promoting elders’ life style.

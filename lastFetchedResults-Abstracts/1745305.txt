Background and Objective: Impaired cognitive function and memory, a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, can be caused by decreased activity of the cholinergic system. Scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, may cause temporary impairment in memory and provide an Alzheimer's disease model. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of water extract of Elaeagnus Angustifolia on memory impairment caused by scopolamine.
Materials and Methods: Sixthy male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 6 groups (n=10 for each group).  Four groups received scopolamine (1mg/kg, IP) and water extract of Elaeagnus Angustifolia (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) along with a positive control group (received scopolamine) and a negative control group . Water extract of Elaeagnus Angustifolia was administered through gavage every day for 4 weeks. Using Morris water maze (MWM), spatial learning and memory were evaluated.
Results: The present study showed that scopolamine injection leads to impairment of learning and memory of rats in the Morris water test (P < 0.0001). In addition, Elaeagnus Angustifolia water extracts dose-dependently improved the learning and memory impairment induced by scopolamine in rats (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between groups that received water extract of Elaeagnus Angustifolia and negative control group (P=1).
Conclusion: Water extract of Elaeagnus Angustifolia improves spatial learning and memory induced by scopolamine in rats.

The effluents of tannery industries are the major source of chromium contamination in the
groundwater. In most of the sub-urban areas ground water is the major source of drinking water. For human
being Long term exposure to chromium is detrimental. The main objective of this study is to assess the
groundwater contamination and to adopt appropriate methods and to develop suitable techniques either to
prevent chromium contamination or to reduce it to very low levels with due consideration to cost optimization.
Bore well samples were collected from 6 location from the proximity of tannery industry at a distance of 25m
interval and at different depth during 2014 in the month of March. To remove the chromium from the
groundwater neem leaves is used as the adsorbent. The column study was conducted to determine the effect
of adsorbent to remove the chromium concentration from the ground water. To investigate the influences of bed
height on the performance of chromium adsorption on to the neem leaves in a fixed-bed column. The results
reveal that the concentration of chromium is high near the tannery industry in Chrompet so the study
concluded that usage of groundwater in Chrompet should be avoided.

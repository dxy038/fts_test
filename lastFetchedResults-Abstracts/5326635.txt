The coding method in MPEG-4 for interlaced video is introduced in this paper. Such a method is an extension of MPEG-2 interlaced coding tools to allow compression of arbitrarily shaped interlaced video. The new texture-and-shape coding tools discussed here for arbitrarily shaped interlaced video provide good compression performance. It is demonstrated here that these interlaced tools improve the coding efficiency of MPEG-4 video in both subjective and objective means

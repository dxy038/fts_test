In this paper current rising time and power spectral density in electrical discharges in overvoltaged air gaps with different electrode geometries are investigated in order to perform a preliminary study on the characteristics of the conducted electrical disturbances. The main objective of this work is to study spontaneously generated sparks, without using any UV or similar pre-ionization methods, in order to reproduce as close as possible real life electrical or electrostatic discharges. An experimental set up was implemented and highly reproducible discharge currents waveforms were obtained

Objective: Our purpose was to determine whether manipulation of the second twin increases the risk of postpartum infection. Study Design: Medical records of all twin deliveries between January 1991 and December 1994 were reviewed. The route of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean section) was examined. The vaginal group was further divided into those delivered in the vertex/vertex position (i.e., no uterine manipulation) versus those delivered vertex/breech extraction (i.e., manipulation). The Ï‡2 and Student t test were used where appropriate. Results: A total of 718 twins were identified, and maternal age, parity, gestational age at delivery (36 weeks), and birth weight (2278 gm) were similar among groups. The metritis rate was higher in the cesarean group (74/447 or 18%) than in the vaginal group (17/299 or 5.7%, p< 0.001). In comparing the vaginal group delivered without uterine manipulation with the vaginal group delivered with manipulation (i.e., breech extraction), there was no difference in the incidence of metritis (10/147 or 6.8% vs 7/152 or 4.6%, not significant). The length of time between delivery of twin A and twin B did not affect the metritis rate. Neonatal outcomes including sepsis, neonatal death, and length of hospitalization were similar among groups (not significant). Conclusion: Uterine manipulation of the second twin does not increase the risk of postpartum metritis or neonatal sepsis. In addition, the time interval between delivery of twins A and B has no effect on the rate of metritis. Although the rate of endometritis has been reported to be higher with twins delivered by cesarean section compared to singletons, the 18% rate of endometritis in twins delivered by cesarean section in this study is slightly lower than in our general population of cesarean deliveries (22%).

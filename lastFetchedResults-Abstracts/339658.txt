Objective
To study if telomere length can be used as a surrogate marker for the mitotic history in normal and affected hematopoietic cells from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).
Methods

The telomere length was measured by automated multicolor flow fluorescence in situ hybridization in glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol anchored protein (GPI)â€“negative and GPI-positive peripheral blood leukocytes. Eleven patients were studied, two with predominantly hemolytic PNH and nine with PNH associated with marrow failure.
Results

Telomere length in GPI-negative cells was significantly shorter than in GPI-positive cells of the same patient (p < 0.01, n = 11). The difference in telomere length (telomere length in GPI-positive minus telomere length in GPI-negative cells) correlated with the percentage of GPI-negative white blood cells.
Conclusion

Our results support the hypothesis that telomere length is correlated to the replicative history of GPI-positive and GPI-negative cells and warrant further studies of telomere length in relation to disease progression in PNH.

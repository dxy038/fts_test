Abstract- Economic load dispatch (ELD) is one of the
important task which provides cost effective generation in
power system. It is an optimization problem and the main
objective is to minimize the total generation cost of all
committed generating units, while satisfying various physical
and operational constraints. In the development of artificial
intelligence(AI) technique Eberhart and kennedy suggested
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) used to solve
NonConvex Economic Dispatch (NCED) problem. PSO has
performance parameters such as inertia weight, acceleration
coefficient, random numbers which can enhance the
performance of PSO. Among these parameter, inertia weight
is very important, which can approaches in fuzzy or linear
way. In this paper Exponential Decreasing Inertia Weight
(EDIW) has been proposed. The effectiveness of proposed
algorithm tested on case system & shown superior result in
terms of convergence and solution quality

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hip fractures are one the most orthopedic fractures especially among the elderly. Considering the increasing rate of geriatrics and osteoporosis as well in Iran, hip fractures are more likely to happen. Thus determining the factors associated with its prognosis is important. This study aims to evaluate the morbidity and mortality rate of patients with hip fracture during 1 year follow up.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all patients with hip fracture who referred to Rasool-Akram training hospital, Tehran from 2005 to 2010 were included. At least follow up was 2 years. After 2 years, data was extracted by the patients' files or telephone follow-up and we were informed that they are alive. Age, sex, type of fracture, type of surgery, past medical history, post-op mortality, time of mortality after fracture, and predisposing factor for mortality were evaluated and analyzed.  
FINDINGS: Overall 174 patients, 92 males (52.9%) and 82 females (47.1%) with mean age of 76Â±7.6 years consisted the study population. Postoperative death occurred in 68 patients (39.1%). Patients' gender did not relate significantly with mortality, while age significantly correlates with mortality: the older the patient, the more the mortality rate (p=0.001). There was no significant relationship between underlying diseases and type of operation with mortality rate. 
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, one year mortality rate of patients with hip fracture is relatively high. We suggest more postoperative and preventive care in this group of patients.

KEY WORDS: Hip fracture, Mortality, One year survival.

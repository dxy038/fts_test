I present the evolution of rf-SQUIDs towards modern planar thin film devices. My main objective is to describe our own planar HTS rf washer SQUIDs and their operation with coplanar resonators and multiturn flux transformers. This publication is dedicated to the memory of J.E. Zimmerman, whose ideas have guided us through the development of rf SQUID planar technology

This paper proposes a modification on the Hybrid Active Series Filter (HASF) creating a topology named Hybrid Active Var Compensator (HAVarC) suitable to manipulate, in continuous way, the displacement power factor or voltage regulation. The HAVarC is composed by a small rating Active Power Filter (APF) in series with a capacitor bank. The main objective of this topology is to control the reactive power injected by the capacitor into the system by controlling the voltage applied on its terminals. The system automatically compensates the reactive power flow in order to guarantee the desired displacement power factor (DPF) or rated voltage and no power system parameters knowledge are necessary to the correct operation of the topology. Also the system guaranties the absence of inrush current or voltage surge in the power system at all operation modes.

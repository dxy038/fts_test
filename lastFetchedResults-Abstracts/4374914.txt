The main factors are found out for planning DC links terminating at AC system locations from the point of interactions between AC and DC systems, such as Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR), Voltage Static Indicator (VSI), and the power losses of the whole system. Based on the linear weighted summation method for multi-objective decision-making problems, a new method is proposed in this paper to select the stable and economic AC bus as the locations of DC links. By normalizing the factors, and calculating the weighted value, the chosen bus will be the one which both considers the stability and economy. Numeric tests show that the method presented in this paper is effective and feasible.

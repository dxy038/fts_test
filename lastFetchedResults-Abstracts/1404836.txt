Background and Objective: Pomalidomide - a combination of Lenalidomide and Thalidomide drugs- is one of the newest anticancer drugs. Pomalidomide induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Furthermore, few studies indicating its relatively low cytotoxic effects on normal peripheral blood cells have been carried out. However, there is yet no information about the effects of Pomalidomide on bone marrow cells that contain important immune cells. In this study, the effect of Pomalidomide on normal bone marrow mononuclear cells was studied.
Materials and Methods: The samples obtained from individuals who clinically needed bone marrow examination, but finally were diagnosed with no serious pathologic conditions in their leukocytes. Remained bone marrow aspirates were obtained and mononuclear cells were isolated. Half of the mononuclear cells were cultured with Pomalidomide (final concentration 10?M) and the remaining half (control group) were cultured with media alone. After 48h incubation, vital activity (MTT) and cell apoptosis induction rates
were assessed.  
Results: The results showed that the vital activity of bone marrow mononuclear cells cultured in the presence of Pomalidomide increased significantly compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, Pomalidomide had no apoptosis induction and the rate of apoptotic cells had no significant difference with control group.
Conclusion: Pomalidomide moderately stimulates the viability (or activity) of normal bone marrow mononuclear cells to improve and maintain them. Also, unlike most anticancer drugs it has no observable toxic effect or apoptosis induction on these cells. So, it may be concluded that Pomalidomide may be more favorable in preventing the side effects of anticancer drugs on normal cells.

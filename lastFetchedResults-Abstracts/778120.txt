Determination of the optimal location and
capacity HV/MV substation in a scheduled program can
be to reducing overall costs including the fixed costs
(land cost, construction cost, equipment purchase cost,
and installation cost) and variable costs (energy losses
cost and power losses cost). This paper presents a
different approach to determining optimal location and
capacity HV/MV substation. For that reason the
multiobjective function is formulated for solving problem
so that the multiple objective functions has become a
common objective function by using weighting method
of Analytical Hierarchy Process. The solution method is
based on analyzing a non-linear optimization problem
and branch and bound algorithm is used to determine the
optimal response. In order to evaluate the performance of
the proposed algorithm, the distribution network has been
studied in Dezful city. The results of simulation using
Matlab software show effectiveness the proposed
approach to reduce costs and determine the optimal
capacity of HV/MV substation.

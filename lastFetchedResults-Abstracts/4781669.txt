Cell-based clustering method using cell data structure, so all operations are clustering on the cell. Based on the processing of the observation data clustering, algorithms about data fusion and objective tracking are discussed. Matrixes of filter formula, such as the observation transfer-matrix, observation noise covariance matrix, the initial value of estimation covariance matrix, and observation matrix have been confirmed. The simulation result indicated that, the filter track trace is good after the cell clustering, the cell clustering have the good function in the processing observed value noise aspect.

The objective of this research is to find an economically attractive alternative method for hydrodesulfurization of petroleum fractions and to select a suitable adsorbent for this process. Deep desulfurization of transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels) is being mandated by governments and is also needed for future fuel cell applications. However, it is extremely difficult and costly to achieve with current technology, which requires catalytic reactors operated at high pressure and temperature. Zeolites are a family of crystalline aluminosilicate minerals. About fifty natural zeolites are now known and more than one hundred and fifty have been synthesized. Clinoptilolite is a naturally occurring zeolite, formed by the diversification of volcanic ash in lake and marine waters millions of years ago. It is the most researched of all zeolites and is widely regarded as the most useful It is an abundant natural zeolite. We show that Hg +2 and Ag+ clinoptilolite can adsorb sulfur compounds from commercial fuels selectively and with high capacities. The desulfurization of 83.60 % by Ag+ clinoptilolite at liquid to solid ratio of 50/100 gr.ml'1, 353 K ,and flow rate of3.0ml.min'1 was obtained

Digital transmission of coded speech is becoming increasingly important in a plethora of voice over internet protocol (VOIP) applications, reaching a variety of platforms, which urges for secure, robust, flexible and platform independent software. ITU-T G.723.1 is a speech compression standard for multimedia communications. G.723.1 is a dual rate codec that compresses the speech signal to 6.3 and 5.3 kbps while maintaining the toll quality and relatively low delay. The major objective of this research is to successfully implement the ITU G.723.1 speech compression standard in Java. The need for implementing this standard in Java was to build a secure, robust, object oriented and platform independent speech coding software, however the delay (execution time) is slightly increased around 10 ms, which may slightly affect the implementation

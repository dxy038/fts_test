The regional site selection of industrial plant (RSSIP) can hardly be done unless the comprehensive ranking of the cities and towns in the region have been determined. Thus, a new method for confirming the compound weight, with the help of which the comprehensive ranking can be more exactly confirmed, is proposed in the paper. Firstly, the objective weights of different indexes are gained through the fractal dimensions representing the rank-size relations because the rank-size distribution of cities and towns given by Zipf formula is equal to the typical fractal distribution. Secondly, the subjective weights of different indexes are gained by the priority judgment method in order to reflect individual´s value judgment, especially the planners´. Thirdly, the compound weights are calculated based on both the objective weights and subjective weights discussed above. Finally, with a case study of a RSSIP task in the region of Yulin, Shaanxi province, China, it is believed that the method for confirming the compound weight in RSSIP established in the paper is not only feasible but also exercisable.

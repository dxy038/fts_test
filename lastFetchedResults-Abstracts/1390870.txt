In this paper, some issues associated with integrated optimization of structural topology and control for piezoelectric smart trusses are discussed. Based on the optimal coupled control of the modes of piezoelectric smart trusses, the integrated optimization model, including some optimized objective functions, design variables and constraint functions, is built. The design variables include member size, logic design variables of structural topology, the number and placements of actuators/the number of controlled modes as well as the control parameters. Some optimal strategies based on genetic algorithm (GA), such as individual validity examination, structural stability examination and system controllability examination, are adopted to guide the optimization process efficiently. The results of this study show: (1) the optimal topology layout varies with the optimized objective function; (2) the effective damping response time is lowest, if the control index and the damping dissipation velocity index are used as the objective functions for Conditions 1 and 2, respectively; and (3) it is impossible to optimize a objective function under five cases of Condition 1 or 2 simultaneously.

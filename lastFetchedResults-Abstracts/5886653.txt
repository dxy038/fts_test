The common methods of image magnification mainly included nearest neighbor, bilinear interpolation. However, it would appear obvious sawtooth shape in the high-frequency part of the magnified image by nearest neighbor method, and become fuzzy by bilinear interpolation method, all of above could affect the image quality. Compared with the above two methods, this paper found a new method using Newton interpolation for image magnification, and used the Matlab to implement this algorithm. The experiments showed that this algorithm could save more high frequency information of the image based on the characteristics of pixel and reduce the fuzzy degrees of the image. Meanwhile, this paper gave an objective evaluation in the imageÂ´s entropy of information and average gradient that this method better than conventional magnification method, so it could be widely used in the field of engineering practice.

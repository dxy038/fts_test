In this paper we consider a scheduling problem where a set of jobs are simultaneously available for processing in a no-wait two-machine flowshop. All jobs are processed on both machines in batches. Batching machines can process several tasks per batch so that all tasks of the same batch start and complete together. The batch processing time for the first machine is equal to the maximal processing time of the tasks in this batch, and for the second machine is equal to the sum of the processing times of the tasks in this batch. The objective is to minimize the makespan, i.e. the maximum completion time of the jobs with using genetic algorithm and finding the best scheduling jobs.

In expectation of the launch of EOS Terra, this paper demonstrates how a semi-empirical kernel-based bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model will be used with multi-date MODIS observations to provide a standard global one kilometer BRDF and albedo product. The model results and behavior have been prototyped extensively with multi-date AVHRR data and a number of results from these efforts are presented to demonstrate the expected spatial and temporal variability of the MODIS product

Abstract

Objective
Sub acute Sclerosing Pan Encephalitis (SSPE), a progressive neurological disorder characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), is the result of an inappropriate immune response to the measles virus or measles vaccination.

SSPE usually develops 2 to 10 years after the original viral attack. Some of the major signs and symptoms are mental deterioration, jerky movements, and seizures specially myoclonic type, involuntary movements, and/or behavioral changes, difficulty in walking, speech, and loss of cognition, respiratory distress and death.

Materials and Methods
During the ten years, from July 1991 to July 2001, we admitted 45 cases of (SSPE), at different stages of the disorder. Regardless of their stage of disease, for intervention, randomly, we used one of three drugs; Amantadin, Interferon alfa and Isoprinosine, administered to the patients, for between one month to one year. Fourteen cases received Amantadin, 15 Alfa interferon, and 16 were given Isoprinosine.

Results
While the results show all three drugs to be relatively effective, Isoprinosine showed four times more effectiveness than Amantadin and twice as much as Interferon.

Conclusion
The results showed Isoprinosine to be much more effective than Amantadin and Alfa interferon in treating the condition.

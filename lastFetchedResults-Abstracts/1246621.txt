In the first part of this paper, an experimental study of the influence of boom movements on ground distribution showed that a geometric static model should correctly be used for simulations. Such model was developed in Cemagref. The objective of this second part is to validate the results of this model for several kinds of excitation in laboratory and field conditions: laboratory validation used a conveyor and a shaking platform to reproduce pure vertical and horizontal movements; field validation was assessed on both concrete and field tracks to analyse combined movements. Then the model was used to define an evaluation method for sprayer boom behaviour at farm level. The concept is for the sprayer to travel over a bump, to measure boom movements and to simulate the distributions. The evenness is assessed through the coefficient of variation (CV) and the percentage of area correctly sprayed.

Objective
Using quantitative sensory testing and a validated questionnaire, we investigated the role of pudendal nerve integrity in sexual function among women.
Study design
Participants completed the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ). Vibratory and pressure thresholds were measured at the S2 dermatome reflecting pudendal nerve distribution.
Results
A total of 56 women enrolled; 29 (51.8%) were asymptomatic and 27 (48.2%) had 1 or more forms of female sexual dysfunction (total sexual dysfunction) including: desire disorder 16.1%, arousal disorder 26.8%, orgasmic disorder 25%, and pain disorder 12.5%. Age, parity, menopausal status, and body mass index were similar between groups. PISQ scores were lower in symptomatic subjects compared with controls (P< .001). Decreased tactile sensation was found at the clitoris for women with total sexual dysfunction, desire disorder, and arousal disorder. Women with arousal disorder also had decreased tactile sensation at the perineum.
Conclusion
Pudendal nerve integrity may play a role in female sexual dysfunction.

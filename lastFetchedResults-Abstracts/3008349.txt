The objective of this paper is the design of flexible data link control (DLC) protocols with the focus on scheduling policies, which combine the information of the time variant radio channel (described by the channel transfer function) and the incoming data streams from real time video applications with variable data rates. The goal is to fulfil the quality of service (QoS) requirements in terms of throughput, reliability, delay and delay jitter for all wireless terminals and to improve the average system throughput.

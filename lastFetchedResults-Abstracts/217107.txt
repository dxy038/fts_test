Background: In vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes reduces the costs and averts the  side-effects of gonadotropin stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Reliable IVM is an intellectual, scientific and clinical challenge with a number of potential applications.
Objective: The effect of hCG was evaluated on the timing and regulation of in vitro ovulation for the Syrian mice oocytes in the presence and absence of FSH. Materials and Methods: Preantral follicles, isolated from the ovaries of 6 weeks-old mice, were cultured in TCM-199 medium. The effect of 10-200 mll.l/ml FSH and 1.5 IV/m) hCG was seen on the follicle maturation, as well as the changes in ovulation
capacity of enclosed oocytes, after the incubation period of 6 days at 37Â°C, 92% humidity and 50/0 CO2 in air. Results: 100 mIV/ml FSH showed increased follicle diameter, survival, germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and oocyte maturation rates (p<O.OOO 1). Significantly
higher number of follicles showed cumulus attachment when ovulation started within 16-24 hours post hCG (97% and 80% respectively; p<O.OOOl) as compared to the cultures without hCG or when the ovulation time increased from 24 hours post hCG. Combination of FSH and hCG showed 97% (p<O.OOOl) ovulation as compared to that
seen for FSH-containing medium only (81%) or control (10%).
Conclusion: The combined administration of 1.5 IV/ml hCG and 100 mIV/ml FSH induces the in vitro follicle maturation, ovulation capacity and proper timing of mice oocytes.

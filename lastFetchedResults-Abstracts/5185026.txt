Summary form only given. A novel algorithm for precision RMS (root mean square) measurement of VLF voltage is presented. The final result of the measured signal, including RMS value and frequency, can be obtained via successive approximation by the least-squares method, an optimization technique, and other special means. The objective function is the sampled data string of the measured signal.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Background: Mullerian disorders are present in 5-25% of infertile women. Myoma,
polyp and endometrial adhesions are among other involved factors in infertility.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency distribution of
pregnancy occurrence in infertile women after the diagnostic-surgical hysteroscopy on
selected infertile cases including those with abnormal uterine.
Materials an d Methods: One hundred and fifteen women with at least 12 months
infertility who had abnormal uterine cavity and patients who had at least 4 unsuccessful
ART cycles with no confirmed diagnosis of uterine cavity problem, underwent
diagnostic hysteroscopy and if required hysteroscopic surgery. Follow up sonography
and HSG performed 2-3 months later and all subjects were followed for pregnancy
occurrence for 12 months.
Results: Mean age of subjects was 32.65 ± 6.2 years and mean of infertility duration
was 8.33 ± 5.25 years. Based on the sonography and HSG performed prior to the
hystero scopy, respectively 69.6% and 41.8% of the subjects had abnormality. In 65.2%
of the cases, hysteroscopy showed septum, myoma, endometrial adhesion and
irregularity and all of them underwent hysteroscopic operation. Among the operated
cases, in 27 cases pregnancy occurred during the first 6 postoperative months and in 2
cases during the second 6 postoperative months of whom one case was EP.
Conclusion: There was no significant difference in the rate of pregnancy occurrence
between those who had abnormal hysteroscopy and those who were normal (p= 0.63).
This can show the variation of infertility causes and the fact that infertility is not just
due to uterine problems. Therefore, the repetition of therapeutic measures and longer
follow up of infertile cases are necessary.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of an instrumental taste-sensing system to distinguish between shrimp processing by-products hydrolysates produced using different proteases and hydrolysis conditions, and the possible association of taste sensor outputs with human gustatory assessment, salt content, and bioactivity. Principal component analysis of taste sensor output data categorised samples according to the proteases used for hydrolysis. High umami sensor outputs were characteristic of bromelain- and Flavourzyme-produced hydrolysates, compared to low saltiness and high bitterness outputs of Alcalase-produced hydrolysates, and high saltiness and low umami outputs of Protamex-produced hydrolysates. Extensively hydrolysed samples showed higher sourness outputs. Saltiness sensor outputs were correlated with conductivity and sodium content, while umami sensor responses were related to gustatory sweetness, bitterness and umami, as well as angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory activity. Further research should explore the dose dependence and sensitivity of each taste sensor to specific amino acids and peptides.

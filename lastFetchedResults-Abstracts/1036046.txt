The objective of this study is to propose a method of process design that uses a feasible formability diagram, which denotes the safe region without fracture and wrinkle, for the effective and rapid design of stamping processes. To determine the feasible formability diagram, FE-analyses have been performed for combinations of process variables that correspond to the orthogonal array of design of experiments. Subsequently, the characteristic values for fracture and wrinkle have been estimated from the results of FE-analyses on the basis of the forming limit diagram. The characteristic values for all combinations within a whole range of process variables have been predicted through the training of an artificial neural network. The feasible formability diagram has been finally determined for all combinations of process variables. The stamping processes of automotive panels to support suspension module, such as the turret suspension and the wheel house, have been taken as examples to verify the effectiveness of process design through feasible formability diagram. A comparison of the FE-simulation results with the experimental results reveals that the design of stamping processes through feasible formability diagram is efficient and suitable for actual processes.

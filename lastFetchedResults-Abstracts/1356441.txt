Objective: The aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship
between obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCSs) and negative and
positive symptoms in schizophrenia.
Methods: Subjects of the study comprised of 31 schizophrenia with
obsessive-compulsive symptoms (19 men and 12 women) selected by
convenience sampling method from Iran psychiatric Hospital. The
diagnoses were established on the basis of DSM-IV-TR. The required
data were obtained using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
(PANSS) and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive scale (Y-BOC).
Results: The results of multiple regression analysis indicated that
obsessive symptoms inversely predict negative symptoms. In other
words, as the obsessive symptoms increase, the negative symptoms of
schizophrenia decrease. Nevertheless, no significant relationship was
found between OCSs and positive symptoms .
Conclusion: This study reveals that OCSs exert a protective effect on schizophrenia and do not necessarily cause poorer prognosis.

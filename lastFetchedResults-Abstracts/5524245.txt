Real-time 6D-trackers based on electromagnetic inductance sensing have previously employed 3-axis coaxial direct current coils for both transmission and reception. Here, with the objective of a low-cost, practical system, we discuss a position-calculating algorithm for an electromagnetic inductance real-time 6D-tracker that employs two 1-axis coils and one 3-axis coil and describe the construction of a prototype system. This system has the potential of realizing a real-time 6D-tracker that costs several hundred dollars. It is expected that the measurement range and accuracy will be improved by increasing the number of transmitting coils, and we think it useful making 3D virtual common space by network at low-cost. We show the experimental system of an electronic white board

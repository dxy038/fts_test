A methodology to design a flow- injection system with optimized performance characteristics for different experimental requirements is presented which requires minimal experimental effort. Departing from basic experimental knowledge of the hydrodynamic parameters and rates of the reactions involved, the coupling of a mathematical model describing the flow system with the Powell's optimization algorithm allows the automated generation of a complete set of flow- injection configurations, each of them being optimal with respect to its objective function. From this set of configurations, the performance of the flow- injection system is easily visualized, allowing the user to select the system that better suits the requirements of his particular application and exploiting the potentiality of multiple flow- injection optimal configurations.

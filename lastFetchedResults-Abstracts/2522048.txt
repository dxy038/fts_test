The ability of different soil tests in predicting soil phosphorus (P) is important in soils amended with municipal sewage sludge. The objective of the present study was to evaluate several chemical extractants to estimate available P for bean growing in 10 calcareous soils amended with municipal sewage sludge from ChaharmahalVaBakhtiari province under the greenhouse conditions. For this purpose, the soil sles were incubated with sludge at a rate of 39ton sludge handash 1. The amount of available P of the soil sles was determined by Olsen, Colwell, ammonium bicarbonateDTPA, 0.01 M calcium chloride, BrayІ, ІІ, Mehlich І and ІІ methods. A pot experiment in a completely randomized design was conducted to evaluate the bean plant indices. The results showed that the amount of extractable P with the above methods decreased in the following order: Colwell> Bray ІІ> Mehlich ІІ> Olsen> Ammonium bicarbonate DTPA> Mehlich І> Bray І> 0.01M chloride calcium. The extractable P with 0.01M chloride calcium, Mehlich І, ІІ Colwell and Olsen methods correlated significantly with plant indices (P concentration and P uptake). Thus, mentioned methods could be used to estimate plantavailable P in the soils amended with sewage sludge.

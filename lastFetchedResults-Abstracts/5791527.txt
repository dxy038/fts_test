We present the Arbitrating Value Transfer Protocol (AVTP), a deterministic binary countdown algorithm for multi-hop wireless networks. AVTP enables deterministic arbitration among contending nodes within a given hop radius, which may be chosen to reach network-wide arbitration, thereby exceeding the capabilities of existing protocols. In addition, the deterministic agreement on data values among all nodes is supported. Even taking into account the limitations of actual hardware devices, AVTP provides small and constant arbitration delays, and has low and bounded complexity. It does not require bidirectional links, and is robust against topology changes. Applications of AVTP include deterministic and robust leader election with bounded delay.Finally, we have implemented and evaluated AVTP on Imote2 sensor nodes.

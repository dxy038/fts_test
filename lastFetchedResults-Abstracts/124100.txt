Introduction & Objective: One of the main approaches for control of infections and preventing of nosocomial infection is by using antiseptics and disinfectants. There are reports regarding transmission of infection through those endoscopes which have not been properly disinfected. This study aimed to find out the effect of glutaraldehyde on those bacteria which might be transmitted by endoscope.
Materials & Methods: Samples were taken from the disinfectant in 14 days. The first days of sampling was considered as the activation day of the glutaraldehyde solution. Sampling was done on the cleaning machine every day after the end of each run for 14 days. The disinfectant have been circulated a total of 121 times in the washing machine which the endoscopes. Glutaraldehyde solution was tested for Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, E.coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Salmonella typhi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in every day.
Results: Results of this study show that after 20 min, the disinfectant had a proper complete effect on killing of the gram positive and negative bacteria. Effect of this disinfectant on Mycobacterium tuberculosis was somewhat different. At first we did not have any growth relating to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis but using the disinfectant 6 days its activation, the colonies started to grow in the culture media. We planned to study the number of times, which the disinfectant had cycled in the endoscopes washing machines. The results showed that after 74 times the disinfectant had lost its ability to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis (even before 14 days).
Conclusion: Glutaraldehyde loses its effectiveness on killing of M. tuberculosis if used in several cycles in endoscope's washing mashines.

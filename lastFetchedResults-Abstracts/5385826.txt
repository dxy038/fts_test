Organizations are increasingly interested in improving their business processes. One strategy for achieving this improvement has been to model their business processes and to automate them using workflow technology. One of the difficulties in this approach is that organizations must adapt their defined processes to each different situation and that workflow systems are yet not flexible enough to allow changes for each new process instance to be enacted. This work proposes a strategy for defining process components or building blocks already implemented in workflow systems which will assist process definition, adaptation and use in organizations. A tool called Beans Composer was implemented to achieve this objective

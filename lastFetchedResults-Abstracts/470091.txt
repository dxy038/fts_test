Objective
The study was undertaken to further define the anatomy of the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis (ATFP).
Study design
Thirty cadavers were dissected to find the average length, SD, and range of the ATFP. Comparisons were made to height and pelvis type. The average distance between the ischial spine and the attachment of the fascia of the rectovaginal septum (RVF) to the ATFP was measured.
Results
The average length, SD, and range in centimeters for the ATFP are 9.0, 0.70, and 7 to 10.5, respectively. The length of the ATFP increased with height. No associations could be made regarding pelvis type. The average distance between the ischial spine and the attachment of the RVF to the ATFP is 2.15 cm with a SD and range of 0.21 and 1.75 to 2.5, respectively.
Conclusion
In this study, an average length for the ATFP is established and the distance between the ischial spine and the attachment of the RVF to the ATFP is redefined.

Background and objective: One of the industries producing environmental pollutant is the rubber industry, which has a lot of in environmental dangers. This study was conducted in the purpose of investigation on Ozone and coagulant material's (Aluminum sulfate â€“Ferric chloride) efficiency in waste water treatment of Rubber Industry.
Methods: In this work Rubber industries with the industrial waste volume over 2500m3 per mount was studied. In order to qualitative evaluation of wastewater in this industry, the reduction of turbidity and the amount of COD were considered as the qualitative criteria.
Results: In this study, the reduction rate of COD by chemical treatment with Ferric chloride after ozonation was 34 percent and the wastewater of chemical treatment with aluminum sulfate after ozonation shown 48 percent, the reduction of COD.
Conclusion: One of the scientific and practical approaches for the treatment of wastewater  in these industries is the use of complex process like chemical coagulation and ozonation along with possible biological processes.

Heavy metals pollution has become a more serious environmental problem in the last several decades as a result
releasing toxic materials into the environment. Various techniques such as physical, chemical, biological, advanced
oxidation and electrochemical processes were used for the treatment of domestic, industrial and agricultural
effluents. The commonly used conventional biological treatments processes are not only time consuming but also
need large operational area. Accordingly, it seems that these methods are not cost-effective for effluent containing
toxic elements. Advanced oxidation techniques result in high treatment cost and are generally used to obtain high
purity grade water. The chemical coagulation technique is slow and generates large amount of sludge.
Electrocoagulation is an electrochemical technique with many applications. This process has recently attracted
attention as a potential technique for treating industrial wastewater due to its versatility and environmental
compatibility. This process has been applied for the treatment of many kinds of wastewater such as landfill
leachate, restaurant, carwash, slaughterhouse, textile, laundry, tannery, petroleum refinery wastewater and for
removal of bacteria, arsenic, fluoride, pesticides and heavy metals from aqueous environments. The objective of the
present manuscript is to review the potential of electrocoagulation process for the treatment of domestic, industrial
and agricultural effluents, especially removal of heavy metals from aqueous environments. About 100 published
studies (1977â€“2016) are reviewed in this paper. It is evident from the literature survey articles that
electrocoagulation are the most frequently studied for the treatment of heavy metal wastewater.

The objective of this work was to develop rice bran IRGA 417 phytic acid (PA) extraction and purification techniques. For the extraction of PA, a complete 24 factorial design with triplicates at the central point was used, and the effects of concentration of rice bran and HCl, time and temperature were investigated. During purification, different pH values were tested with addition of 1.5 M Na2CO3 or 4.0 M NaOH. The results obtained by the statistical analysis of the factorial design showed that temperature, time and HCl concentration influenced the PA extraction technique significantly (p â‰¤ 0.05), whereas the concentration of rice bran had no influence. The content of PA was evaluated in all the stages of purification and it was possible to establish an improved methodology of extraction and purification with high purity and yields.

But several studies have indicated a low rate of adoption of this technology by the prospective users to whom the cook stove had been given either free or at subsidized price. This unhealthy trend in the adoption of improved wood stove had to be checked for ensuring success in programme implementation. The overall objective of the study was to assess the level of adoption of the improved cook stoves in the study locale and to understand the factors promoting or precluding its adoption. An analytical survey design was followed for the study. An interview schedule with an attitude scale and a technology rating scale developed by the investigator was used for data gathering. Family size, family occupation and age of the beneficiaries were the variables associated with the level of adoption of the improved cook stoves. Majority of the adopters exhibited a neutral attitude towards the cook stoves. Very few families rated the technology as highly appropriate. This paper analyses the variables associated with the adoption of improved cook stoves in rural areas of southern India.

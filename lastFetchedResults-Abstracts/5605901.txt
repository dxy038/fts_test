For a SAR seeker, how to acquire the best azimuth resolution within a fixed time is still a problem. As well known, the trajectory and the look angle have an effect on the azimuth resolution of imaging. This paper proposes a trajectory design and optimization method based on genetic algorithms. It builds the constraints of the missile at the flight time, uses a sequence of piecewise constant command acceleration demands as the control variables, sets up the objective function about the dwell time and the desired azimuth resolution, optimizes the control variables using the genetic algorithm, and so gets the optimal trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the method.

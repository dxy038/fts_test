Objective
Oxygen intoxication plays an important role in the pathogenesis of some fetal diseases such as encephalopathy, ischemia& hypoxia. Antioxidants can reduce oxidative damage in newborns. The object of this research was measuring total value of antioxidant and vitamin C in blood sample of pregnant women before delivery, and also in umbilical cord blood of their newborn, and repeating these measurements 48 hours after birth in newborns with hypoxia and controlling group.

Materials & Methods
The sample included 32 healthy pregnant women presented for delivery & also their newborns. The total values of antioxidant & vitamin C in plasma were measured by staining methods.

Results
There was no statistical meaningful difference in total values of antioxidants & vitamin C in women's blood & their newborn's cord blood. Also total

values of antioxidant & vitamin C meaningfully increased in newborns with hypoxia after 48 hours.

Conclusion
total values of antioxidant & vitamin C in blood plasma of newborn, increase in oxidative damage as a defense mechanism.

In motor transition system, different components, such as coupling, gears, and shaft are having different stiffness; they may be high or low. The low stiffness component will cause torsional vibration in the system, this phenomenon results in defect of products. In this paper, how the affection the parameters of a shaft caused to torsional vibration was discussed, and an adaptive notch filter is utilized to suppress the torsional oscillation, and then improve the bandwidth of the speed control loop. The adaptive notch filter can auto-identify the vibration frequency and auto-tune the parameters of the notch filter, achieving the objective of auto-suppressing torsional oscillation.

Taxus is a rare and endangered species with high economic values. The taxol extracted from the barks, branches and leaves of Taxus is an important medicine for tumor prevention and treatment. Over the past 10 years, cultivation area for Taxus accumulatively reaches 1.8 million mu. I have measured and calculated 10 indicators such as height, crown height, crown diameter, height of ramp of the crown, root diameter, quantity of branches, total quantity of leaves, leaf length, leaf width, leaf area etc. of 300 Taxuss with 1 to 10 years old based on the consideration of situations such as altitude, coordinates, annual rainfall, annual average sunshine hours, solar radiation, annual average temperature, frost-free period and so on. Our research methodology is as follows: we mainly focus on the core of &#8220;vegetation volume&#8221;. The concept of vegetation penetration volume is firstly proposed in the research and calculation method of Taxus two-Dimensional vegetation volume, living vegetation volume and vegetation penetration volume are developed in this research. The objective of this research is to provide scientific evidence on evaluating growth trend of Taxus, estimating complicated living vegetation volume by simple mathematical principle, and evaluating ecologic effect scientifically.

A decentralized cooperative control strategy engaging offline and online computations for constrained multi-agent vehicle systems is presented in this paper. Intermittent data dropouts may incur concurrently to all vehicle agents in this formulation. Demands on communication links and online data are limited with a perturbed state-feedback strategy, which consists of a static cooperative-state feedback and an online-optimizing perturbation. The former compensates for the interagent communication-coupled dynamics. The latter attends to constraints and data losses, adopting only decoupled objective functions. The state feedback gain is determined in accordance with the interconnection topology of the formation, which is described by a directed graph in this paper. The ADC - asymptotically dissipative constraint, is employed in the overriding control strategy of stabilizing agents such that the inter-operability between remote manoeuvres and local autonomous commands becomes practically realizable. The equilibrium-independent supply rate and storage function are used in the stabilizability condition in this development for the final-state tracking of the cooperative formation problem.

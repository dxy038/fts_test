Background and Objective: Marginal restorations are appropriate places for plaque accumulation and bacterial reproduction causing periodontal disease or tooth loss. the present study was conducted to compare the periodontal status in patients with correct marginal restorations and their controls referred to department of Oral Medicine and Operative Dentistry of Mashhad Dental School.
Materials & Methods: Fifty patients with one or more marginal restorations as well as their controls were studied in a randomized clinical trial study. Gingival bleeding and plaque indices were evaluated in both groups for the purpose Willcaxon  test was used comparing the results in both groups.
Results: 50 percent of cases had plaque index of 0 as the rate was 60 per cent in control samples. Considering gingival index, the percentage of patients with 0 gingival index was 58 and 74 in case and control groups respectively. Bleeding index of 0 was reported to be 38 and 72 per cent in case and control groups. Probing depth was more in case group than those of control. Statistical analysis showed significant difference between the two groups considering four measured variables
 (P  <  05/0).
Conclusion: According to the results of this study, even the correct marginal restoration may have effect on periodontal status.

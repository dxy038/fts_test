This study examined the direction and etiology
underlying the relationships between parental negativity
and early childhood antisocial behavior using a bidirectional
effects model in a longitudinal genetically informative
design. We analyzed parent reports of parental
negativity and early childhood antisocial behavior in
6,230 pairs of twins at 4 and 7 years of age. Results from
a cross-lagged twin model contribute to the understanding
of the mechanisms underlying the bidirectional processes
involved in parental negativity and childhood antisocial
behavior. Specifically, the findings of this study suggest
that the association between parenting and child antisocial
behavior is best explained by both parent-driven and childdriven
effects. We found support for the notion that parentâ€™s
negative feelings towards their children environmentally
mediate the risk for child antisocial behavior. We also found
evidence of genetically mediated child effects; in which
genetically influenced antisocial behavior evoke parental
negativity towards the child.

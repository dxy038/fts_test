Objective To ascertain the presence, and
describe the pattern and extent, of restrictive care
practices in the treatment of mental health inpatients
in a rural New Zealand unit. Methods Retrospective
data was anonymously extracted from patient records
at Rotorua Hospital (Rotorua, New Zealand). Data
sets were compiled from 300 consecutive patient
admissions between January 2000 and December
2001. The demographic and diagnostic characteristics
extracted were gender, age, ethnicity (M aori or non-
M aori classification only), primary diagnosis, length
of hospital stay, seclusion, medication on discharge,
dosage of antipsychotic medication if given, referral
to psychotherapy, voluntary/involuntary status on
admission, and readmission rates. Results After
controlling for other clinical variables, ethnicity was
not associated with specific diagnoses, increased use
of seclusion, and involuntary status on admission or
higher readmission rates. M aori patients were more
likely to receive antipsychotic medication and at
higher doses than non-M aori. M aori were less likely
to be referred to psychotherapy services and had
shorter lengths of stay. Conclusion There was no
evidence of widespread restrictive care practices
against M aori, although the disparities in antipsychotic
prescription and psychotherapy referral suggest
some restrictive care practices do exist. The use
of specialist cultural teams in general mental health
services may prevent restrictive care practices.

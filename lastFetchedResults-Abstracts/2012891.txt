Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNAsmay alter its expression levels or processing and contribute to susceptibility to a wide range of diseases. Our study aimed to evaluate the possible association between miRNA-146a rs2910164 and miRNA-499 rs3746444 polymorphisms and susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in a sample of Iranian population. This case- control study was performed on 202 PTB patients and 204 healthy individuals. Genotyping was performed using tetra amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (T-ARMS-PCR). The results indicated that neither miRNA-499 rs3746444 nor miRNA-146a rs2910164 are associated with the risk of PTB in a sample of Iranian population. Larger studies with different ethnicities are required to validate our findings.

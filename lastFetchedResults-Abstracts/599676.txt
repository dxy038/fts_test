This paper presents a novel multi-objective mathematical model of a periodic vehicle
routing problem (PVRP) in a competitive situation for obtaining more sales. In such a situation, the
reaching time to customers affects the sale amount; therefore, distributors intend to service customers
earlier than other rivals for obtaining the maximum sale. Moreover, a partial driverâ€™s benefit is related
to the amount of their sale; thus, the balance of goods based on the vehicles capacity is important. Due
to its complexity, it is so difficult to optimally solve this problem in a reasonable computational time.
Hence, two algorithms are proposed based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO)
and NSGAII algorithm. A comparison of our results with three performance metrics confirms that the
proposed MOPSO is an efficient algorithm for solving the competitive PVRP with a reasonable
computational time.

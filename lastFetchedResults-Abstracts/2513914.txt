<strong>Objective:</strong> The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the metacognitive model in treating post-traumatic stress disorder.<br /><strong>Method:</strong> In a single-subject experimental trial of multiple baseline type, the treatment process was carried out on an 18-year-old male subject. The patient satisfied the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and was assessed for pre-duration and post treatment. The scales used in this study included: Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Beck anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Subjective Units Distress Scale (SUDs). In addition, all scales were again completed by the subject at 1-month, 3- month, and 6- month follow-ups. <br /><strong>Results:</strong> The treatment led to reductions in symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression and distress. Gains were maintained at follow-ups.<strong> <br />Conclusion:</strong> The treatment approach which is based on the metacognitive model, appears to be effective in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.

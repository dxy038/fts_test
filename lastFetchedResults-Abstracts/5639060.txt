This paper had been prepared as a tutorial complement to its companion paper, THE ARRAY MATRIX FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING [1], but could not be presented in the ICASSP-86 framework. Its objective was, and it is so now, to exemplify some of the adaptations and generalizations of matrix methods stemming from Tait´s ARRAY MATRIX theory [2]. That theory has since been extended and consolidated as a mathematics of polyxa [3], which can abbet, we believe, the smooth transition of vector-matrix methods into the array processing era. Through these papers we wish to encourage individual and collective adoption of what is now called ´extended´ matrix methods and notation, for communicating work on signal processing and in system theory. We exemplify this here on rederivation of the remarkable MARPLE algorithm.

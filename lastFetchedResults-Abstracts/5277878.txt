The basic objective of this paper is to apply the concept of matched feed (conjugate field matching) in a cylindrical corrugated structure and to present the design of a novel corrugated matched feed. The designed corrugated matched feed is then used as a primary feed to illuminate the offset parabolic reflector antenna and the secondary radiation pattern has been estimated. The simulated results are compared with the conventional corrugated horn fed offset parabolic reflector. In addition, the cross-pol suppression BW of the proposed corrugated matched feed has been evaluated and the results are summarized.

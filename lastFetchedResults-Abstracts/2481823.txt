This paper aims to apply a multi-objective optimization method for optimizing
a truss design problem. This method is named the Multi-Objective Bee Algorithm
(MOBA). In the rst problem, objective functions minimize stress in two members and
minimize the volume of the truss. In each of the other three problems, the objectives to
be optimized are the value of the total weight of the structure and the total displacement
of nodes, considering limits on the cross section of the elements. The bee algorithm is
developed based on the principle of multi-objective problems. A clustering algorithm is
applied for the multi-objective bee algorithm in order to manage the size of the Paretooptimal
set. The results provide good evidence of the robustness and eectiveness of the
multi-objective bee algorithm in solving the multi-objective optimal truss design.

This paper describes the design method and analysis of a new zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) bidirectional flyback dc/dc converter. The converter is based on extending a previously developed unidirectional ZVS flyback converter with a soft-switching auxiliary cell. The operating modes of the auxiliary circuit are changed in a way to provide ZVS condition in both power directions. Simulation results are presented to justify the theoretical analysis.

For the shortages of the methods for the traditional operational effectiveness evaluation, an approach based on Weapons Systems Effectiveness Industry Advisory Committee (WSEIAC) model and simulation is proposed. The operational effectiveness evaluation model for the torpedo is established with the WSEIAC model. Then the availability and reliability matrixes are given. Moreover, the torpedo trajectory simulation system is established and the capability matrix is calculated by using the multi-simulation results of the simulation system. Finally, the calculation example shows that the integrated approach is based on the uncertain factors during the combat process and reduces the adverse effect of the human factors, and the effectiveness evaluation result is objective and reasonable.

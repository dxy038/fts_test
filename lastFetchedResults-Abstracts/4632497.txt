The inclusion principle provides a mathematical framework for comparing behavior of dynamic systems having different dimensions. Our main objective is to derive a canonical form for larger systems (expansions) that are obtained by expanding smaller systems (contractions). The form offers full freedom in selecting appropriate matrices for the expansion-contraction process. We will broaden the form to include feedback and propose an explicit characterization of contractible control laws subject to overlapping information structure constraints.

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software market has experienced a significant increase in the past few years, in large companies and also in SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises). However, studies are still concentrated in bigger companies and little focused in post implementation phase. Therefore, it is important to understand how ERP implementation have influenced changes in SMEs, since they cause impacts and these companies have specificities. The objective is to identify changes in SME organizational structures after an ERP implementation, through a multiple case study with medium companies. With a script based on the literature, interviews were made in three companies. Results suggest changes in companies structures, specially linked with process standardization. As limitations, it was observed that results cannot be generalized, since it is a case study, and also because results reflect the companyÂ´s point of view, what can lead to subjectivity. Future studies must extend the research to other cases, or yet convert it to a survey.

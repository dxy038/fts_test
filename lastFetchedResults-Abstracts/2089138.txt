We experimentally found that the object wave function of an electron wave in a transmission electron microscope can depend on the diameter of the condenser aperture and on the excitation of the objective lens. This can be seen by low magnification holograms utilizing as sample electrically charged latex spheres of different diameters, the electric field at a pn-junction and the magnetic leakage field of a magnetic memory cell.

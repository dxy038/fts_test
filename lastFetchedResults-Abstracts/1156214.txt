The main objective of this work is to develop a formula for the prediction of thermal minimum film thickness at the roll/strip contact in terms of operating parameters particularly at the elevated roll speeds. The film thickness at the exit of inlet zone and at the entry of contact zone is common. Therefore, in order to compute minimum film thickness accurately at the contact, an efficient thermohydrodynamic analysis of fully flooded inlet zone has been carried out. The effects of rolling speed, reduction ratio, material parameter and slip on minimum film thicknesses (isothermal and thermal) and maximum film temperature rise (in the inlet zone only) are rigorously investigated. The performance parameters in the lubricated domain have been evaluated for rolling speeds (up to 20.0 m/s), reduction ratios (0.05â€“0.20), and slip values varying up to 20%. Significant reduction in minimum film thickness (thermal) has been observed with the increase in the rolling speed and slip. Based on this study, empirical relations are developed for the prediction of minimum film thicknesses (isothermal and thermal) at the contact. A relation for evaluation of maximum film temperature rise in the inlet zone has been also developed. Authors believe that the empirical relations presented herein may be useful for designers and practicing engineers.

Recently, self tuning fuzzy control techniques are applied to improve the performances of any system. This paper explains the design and application of a self tuning fuzzy control technique to a drilling force control process. The main objective is to design, analyse and compare the performance of self tuning fuzzy PI controller under two different conditions namely when the input scaling factor is tuned and output scaling factor is tuned. Simulation studies are carried out on both input scaling factor tuned STFPIC and output scaling factor tuned STFPIC. The simulation results reveal that input scaling factor tuned STFPIC gives improved performance than output scaling factor tuned STFPI controller. In particular input SF tuned STFPI controller reduces the force applied to dill a particular depth than output SF tuned STFPIC and makes the work easier.

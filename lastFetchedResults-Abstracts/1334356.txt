Background and Objective: Improvement in self-care and self-efficacy behaviors has proved to be a vital factor in a successful management of asthma. This study was carried out to determine the relationship of patients self-efficacy with control of asthma symptoms.
Materials and Methods: This correlation study was carried out on 257 asthmatic patients (133 men and 124 women) aged 18-35, who referred to Sheykholrayis clinic of Tabriz, Iran, during 2011. Data collection tools included a questionnaire of social-personal specifications, asthma self-efficacy scale questionnaire and asthma control questionnaire as well as patients’ spirometer parameters. Data were analyzed using SPSS-17 and Pearson Correlation Coefficient test.
Results: Among aspects of self efficacy, the regular use of medicine and patient relation with physician were demonstrated to be 4±0.6 and 2.7±0.7, respectively. Among aspects of asthma control, the level of activity restriction resulted by the disease during the past week and the number of spray puffs used during past week were 3±1.1 and 1.5±1.2, respectively. There was a significant relation between self-efficacy and asthma control (P < 0.001, r= -0.378).
Conclusion: This study showed that in asthmatic patients, self confidence is an effective factor in the control of asthmatic symptoms.

Multi-objective Optimization Evolutionary Algorithm can be applied to problems in Economies, Management and Engineering; actually, most of design problem in real world can be reduced to multi-objective optimization problem. This paper proposed a new Evolutionary Algorithm based on Differential Evolution. The experimental results as the test-bed show that this algorithm can obtain quite fine approximated Pareto fronts and the fronts cover the theoretical Pareto front; these results imply that the proposed algorithm performs well.

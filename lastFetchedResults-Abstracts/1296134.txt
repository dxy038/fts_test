In this research, Zeolite NaY was synthesized by hydrothermal method and then, by using ion-exchange method, silver ions were capsulated in the pores of Zeolite NaY. The morphology and the structure of samples have been identified and characterized via SEM/EDAX, XRD, FTIR and AAS techniques. The decontamination reaction of 2-chloroethyl phenyl sulfide (2-CEPS) has been investigated by zeolite Ag-NaY catalyst using the GC method. The analytical results of GC show that this zeolite can absorb about %76 2-CEPS after 24 hours (with a ratio of 1:20) at ambient temperature. The rate constant and half life reaction were calculated 4.125×10+4 s, 1.68 ×10-5 s-1 respectively. It is evident that pseudo- active mustard decontamination as an important objective in passive defense has been studied.

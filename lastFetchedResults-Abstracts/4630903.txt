Assumes an integrated fast-packet environment that recognizes two kinds of transport services: low delay tolerant isochronous transport and bursty variable-bandwidth transport with some delay tolerance. To deal with both but in particular the latter, the authors present an algorithm to implement a burst reservation discipline. The algorithm also addresses the problem of overload occurring when the instantaneous traffic from several sources is targeted for a single destination, thus exceeding its output buffer capacity and resulting in packet loss. The authors propose a centralized scheme of burst communications reservations which gives the receivers at each destination the capability to control the incoming traffic mix with the objective of avoiding packet losses and maximizing the received load. The proposed new algorithm can also be used end-to-end in a network between cooperating subscribers or within a switch transparently to the subscribers

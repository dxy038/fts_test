In the modern radar target recognition, the model-based approach offers a flexible and computationally efficient way to characterize targets, since establishing an adequate target signature collection especially with bistatic measurements is impractical. Simulating such an extensive collection is arduous as well. This paper proposes a new method for the bistatic characterization of radar targets and radar response simulation: ESPRESS (Electromagnetic Signature Production from Renders Exploiting Scatterer Sets). We have implemented it entirely with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. Our objective is to give the target a compact description, from which radar response-with arbitrary radar frequency and bandwidth, as well as transmitter and receiver positions-can be simulated efficiently. In this paper, we demonstrate that ESPRESS has the computational speed and adequate accuracy required in model-based radar target recognition.

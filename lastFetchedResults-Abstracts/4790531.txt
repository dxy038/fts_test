The reasonable allocation schemes of water resources have the character of multiple objective and incompatibilities. In order to evaluate the reasonable allocation schemes scientifically, a synthetic evaluation model is proposed based on grey relational degree model. In this model, the method of variation coefficient is used to determine the evaluated index weight and decreases the subjectivity of weight decision. The model is used in comprehensive evaluation of rational allocation schemes in South-to-North Water Transfer District of Hebei province and the study shows that the model applied in evaluating the schemes of water resources reasonable allocation is rational and feasible. It validates the evaluation model is simple and feasible in evaluating water resources planning schemes.

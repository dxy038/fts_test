The objective of this work was to determine experimentally the flexural behavior of composite sandwich beams and compare the results with predictions of theoretical models. Sandwich beams were fabricated by bonding unidirectional carbon/epoxy face sheets (laminates) to aluminum honeycomb cores with an adhesive film. All constituent materials (composite laminates, adhesive and core) were characterized independently. Special techniques were developed to prevent premature failures under the loading pins and to ensure failure in the test section. Sandwich beams were tested under four-point and three-point bending. Strains to failure in the face sheets were recorded with strain gages, and beam deflections, and strains in the honeycomb core were recorded by using moir√© techniques. The beam face sheets exhibited a softening non-linearity on the compression side and a stiffening non-linearity on the tension side. Experimental results were in good agreement with predictions from simple models which assume the face sheets to behave like membranes, neglecting the contribution of the honeycomb core, and accounting for the non-linear behavior of the face sheets.

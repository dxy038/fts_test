Abstract:
Women have always played a great role in the realization of insurrections in the course of history besides heroic men. The great Iranian revolution could be mentioned as one of the most objective cases of women's cooperation. Furthermore, everyone admits with certainty that it is the Great Zeinab's admirable patience, perseverance, and strife that immortalizes Imam Hossein's mobility. Women's mission in this strife commences right after he is martyred; but among the women present in Karbala, Hazrat Zeinab's sublime character beams on the horizon of history, and attracts the attention of men of letters and arts, particularly poets. Here, the researcher tries to do a close scrutiny of the distinguished contemporary Arabic and Persian poems on the Great Zeinab; thus, this essay will elucidate her reflection in the poetry of both languages, and underline the distinctions between the poets of the two cultures and nations in the representation of her character. Furthermore, the notion of slavery has been examined in the poetry of both languages due to its close affinity with Ashuraee women. 
   This study evinces that Persian Ashuraee poems have put more emphasis on Hazrat Zeinab's bravery and valor, lucidity and rhetoric than her other features while the most prominent virtue identified in Arabic poetry is her forlornness. Another distinctive feature between the two poetry is that Persian poems render a much more precise and detailed portrait of her.

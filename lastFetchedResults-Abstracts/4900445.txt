This paper proposes a new design for the coordination control of power system stabilizer (PSS) and flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) devices to enhance the damping of power oscillations. The controller gains of a linearized power system are optimized instantaneously using genetic algorithm (GA) to achieve an objective function, which maximizes the function, so that the total damping ratios of the system are optimized. Here the power system employed with PSS and a SVC as well as TCSC based controllers. Finally, the proposed coordinated controller performance is tested with both eigen value analysis and time domain simulations. Four different control schemes for power oscillations damping of test power system are employed and the results are compared.

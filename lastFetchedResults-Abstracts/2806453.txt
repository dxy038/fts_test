This paper proposes improved bat algorithm along with point estimate method to optimize the operation of microgrid. The objective function and constraints related to the operation of microgrid are formulated and mathematical model is established. The point estimate method is used to deal with the uncertainty in load demand and output power of solar and wind units. Numerical examples analyze the performance of proposed method on solving the optimal problem. Besides, the probability distribution of total operating cost, and the effects of random variables on operating cost are presented. The proposed model and method are validated with the numerical results.

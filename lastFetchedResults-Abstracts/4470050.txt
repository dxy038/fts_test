Networks Operators unanimously agree on the need to reduce power consumption of their networks. Motivation behind is surely related to the need to minimize the operating costs, gaining competitiveness. However this is also in line with the growing attention to the CO<sub>2</sub> emission. At the same time they want to keep or even improve the high availability and the delivered QoS of the networks. The use of redundant network resources to reach this target is clearly in contrast with power reduction objective. Cost and power optimization of core networks is sensitive to selected resiliency strategy. A tradeoff between the use of optics and electronics can be found to preserve functionalities while minimizing overall costs. This paper presents simulation results of different resiliency strategies. These results are based on accurate modeling of real equipment and allow identifying optimal solutions for the core networks.

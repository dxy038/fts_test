A novel and improved iterative speech enhancement approach is presented to suppress the undesired speech or noise in cocktail party environments. The key idea in the proposed approach is that a difference phase-correlation-based criterion function (PCF) is introduced to work as the convergence controller for a modified iterative Wiener filter (MIWF). The interference component is attenuated continually until convergence occurs. Evaluation results of objective quality measurement and informal listening test show the proposed system provides speech with good quality and good intelligibility

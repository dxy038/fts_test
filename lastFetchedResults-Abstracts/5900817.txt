The worldÂ´s first robotic insect capable of vertical takeoff was developed and demonstrated by the Harvard Microrobotics Lab. This vehicle consisted of a single power actuator that drove both wings symmetrically. In this case, there was no method to generate body torques, only lift could be modulated. The Harvard Microrobotics Lab has modified this configuration to include not only a single power actuator, but also control actuators for each wing, with the ultimate goal of being able to generate body torques. The objective of this work is to analyze the controllability of a flapping-wing micro air vehicle equipped with a power actuator to provide the mechanical power for flapping as well as left and right control actuators. The control actuators cause a small displacement of the wing root which causes a change to the wing kinematics, such that pitch and yaw torques can be generated.

Aircraft nowadays carry various loads imposing a very dynamic load profile on the electrical distribution bus. The proposed bidirectional converter topology and its controller successfully stabilise the power bus in any combination of distribution impedance and constant - power/pulsed loads. The power topology permits the use of a storage capacitor with lower rating, as all of the stored energy can be used. A simple adaptive controller was developed, requiring only voltage measurements, thus dispensing with expensive sensors. Extensive SABER simulation results are presented which verify the control principles and demonstrate the practicality of the approach.

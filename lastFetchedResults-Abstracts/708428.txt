Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of short-term outpatient peripheral intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy for selected emergency department (ED) patients.
Methods
Retrospective analysis of pediatric ED patients presenting with infections of presumed bacterial etiology who received IV ceftriaxone and were discharged with a “capped” IV catheter and instructions to return in 24 hours for reevaluation. Outcome measures included clinical outcome at 24 hours and catheter-related complications.
Results
Twenty-nine patients met study criteria. All returned for reevaluation. In one case, a parent removed the catheter when their child reported “numbness/soreness” at the catheter site. The other 28 patients were judged to be improved, received a second dose of ceftriaxone through the original catheter, and were discharged on oral antibiotic. No adverse events related to the catheter were identified.
Conclusion
Outpatient peripheral IV catheter use appears to be a feasible method for providing serial doses of parenteral antibiotic for the treatment of selected pediatric patients with infectious conditions.

Anticipated widespread usage of new power electronics technologies in electrical energy generation and consumption is expected to provide major efficiency improvements, while the deployment of smart grid technologies should improve the utilization and availability of electricity. This paper explores possible relationships between these two trends. Starting from an analysis of current and expected trends in the generation, transport, and consumption of electrical energy, this paper contemplates possible future ac and dc electronic power distribution system architectures, especially in the presence of renewable energy sources. The proposed nanogrid-microgrid-E&#780;-grid structure achieves hierarchical dynamic decoupling of generation, distribution, and consumption by using bidirectional electronic power converters as energy control centers. Several possible directions for modeling, analysis, and system-level design of such systems, including power flow control, protection, stability, and subsystem interactions, are briefly discussed.

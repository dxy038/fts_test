Objective: Polytope DNA vaccines , capable of focusing the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)
response on critical epitopes, represent a promising approa ch in HCV immunotherapy. Nevertheless,
due to controversial rules governing epitope processing and the low level expression/
immunogenicily of recombinant polytope peptides, design ing and primary expressionl
immunogenicity analysis of these vaccine types should be the first consideration prior to
costly transgenic animal studies.
Materials and Methods: Four HLA-A2 and H-2d restricted CTL epitopes were selected and
designed in three appropriate sequential tandems based on epitope and proteasomal cleavage
predictions . The related nucleotide sequences were synthesized using SOEing PCR
method and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector, either alone or fused to the small hepatiti s B surface
antigen (HBsAg-S) gene. Follow ing the preparation of polyclonal anti-sera , expression!
secretion of polytopes was evaluated in Coso? cells by using immunofluorescence, Western blot,
dot blot, ELISA and RT-PCR techniques . The immunogenicity of the plasmids was also
assessed through the delayed -type hypersensitivity (DTH) assay in BALB!c mice.
Results: Due to in silico designs and optimizations, the polytope products of constructed
plasmids were efficiently detected in vitro through common techniques and HBsAg-S-based
particles were shown to be secreted into the culture media (up to 30%). Moreover, all plasmids
were able to efficiently indu ce a positive DTH response while HBsAg-S fusion constructs
indicated a significant immunopotential effect towards the incorporated mouse epitopes.
Conclusion: Designed polytope constructs of this study are efficiently expressed and processed.
They have the required initial potency for further immunogenicity analysis in trans qeruc
mice.

The detection performance of X-ray security inspection systems can be reflected from the image quality generated by the system. The image quality assessment method proposed in the paper combines human visual system (HVS) with objective method to evaluation the image quality of X-ray system. The assessment process and method simulate the human vision characteristics to separate and analyze regions of interest which correspondent to the technical specification under the Chinese national standard from the entire image. The technical specifications of detection performance of X-ray system include two aspects: image resolution and material differentiation ability which correspondent to different technical specifications. The existence and integrality, the hue and saturation are achieved respectively according to different specification requirements using objective method. The assessment results are achieved compared with the corresponding threshold values obtained by a series of special designed experiments implemented by experienced operators. Simulations and experiments verified the method.

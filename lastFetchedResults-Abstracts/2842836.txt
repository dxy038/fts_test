Orthopedic implants fail due to various reasons such as extensive bacterial colonization, poor osseointegration, extensive inflammation and osteolysis due to wear debris. In order to reduce orthopedic implant failures, the main objective of this study was to create a biomimetic bone tissue engineering material based on the osteoconductive properties of nanophase hydroxyapatite (HA), the bacterial inhibition properties of the MAM7 peptide<sup>1</sup>, the quorum sensing inhibitor RNAIII peptide<sup>2</sup>, and the anticancer properties of the PCK3145 peptide<sup>3</sup> as well as curcumin<sup>4</sup>. Results showed promise for these materials to combat common failure modes of orthopedic implants.

In the disk drive industry, head gimbal assemblies (HGAs) may be individually tested prior installation in a disk drive. While performing a test, a false negative result may be created because of external air turbulence caused by the rotation of the test disk. The objective of this paper is to find a model of the servo system in HGA testing system so that we know how to adjust the command to get rid of the effect of disturbance. The technique so called Transfer Function Determination Code (TFDC) is proposed to model the system in the frequency domain. In addition, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to adjust the weights in TFDC algorithm in each frequency. The simulation results show a comparison of different inertia weight adjustments for the models.

For pt.1 see ibid., p.Z000240-5 (2006). In this paper, the edge-set encoding technique is tested on multi-objective power distribution network planning problems. The edge-set encoding technique and its genetic operators are described. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was developed, based on the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2, in order to test this encoding technique on several case studies with a real power distribution system with two objective functions: economical cost and energy non-supplied. From the results, it can be said that the edge-set encoding technique is suitable to resolve the multi-objective optimization problem of power distribution system expansion planning

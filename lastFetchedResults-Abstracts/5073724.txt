A multiagent methodological approach, for integrating a rules base system (RBS) in a multiagent environment is retailed in "a mutiagent methodology approach for modelling a rule production system" by Ramdane and Boufriche (2003). The objective of this work consists of increasing performances of rule production systems. Therefore a multiagent modelling of the system seems appropriate. In this paper, we propose a generic platform to integrate a system with large knowledge base in a multiagent system (MAS). The construction of a MAS in which, the agents make that for what they have been conceived, gives some questions. In particular, about the interaction that allows the agent to find its balance between its autonomy and its coordination with the other agents to reach a common objective. To avoid the conflicts, we added a set of tools associated to every agent: the graph of dependences of data, the anti-interference graph, and lists of common data used to model the activated agents. To assure the consistency of the global system we enrich the inference cycle by two steps

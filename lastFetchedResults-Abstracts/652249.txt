The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of age and dosage on percutaneous absorption and disposition of [14C]chlordecone (Kepone) and to describe results using a physiological based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. Female Fischer 344 rats 33 and 82 days old were used as the young and adult animal models, respectively, and were studied over a 10-fold dose range. [14C]Chlordecone (0.286 μmol/cm2) was applied to dorsal skin (2.3% BSA) and radioactivity was quantified in selected tissues and excreta up to 120 h. Absorption and disposition were also determined at three dose levels up to 2.68 μmol/cm2; fraction absorbed decreased as dose increased.In vitropercutaneous absorption was measured by static and flow-through methods; these yielded similar penetration rates, which were lower than those obtainedin vivo.In vivopercutaneous absorption over 120 h was 14.4±0.99 and 14.2±1.5% dose in young and adults, respectively. Organ and tissue content increased over time (carcass>liver>kidney), indicating prolonged absorption. Statistical differences between young and old were found for liver, skin, and urine, but not for absorption. Excretion occurred primarily in feces, but also in urine. A biophysically based percutaneous model was fitted to both young and adultin vivoabsorption data. This was embedded in a whole body PBPK model which, upon optimization with SAAM II, estimated apparent tissue partition coefficients, urinary and fecal excretion rates, and parameters characterizing hepatic nonlinear uptake of bound chlordecone. The model reasonably predicted tissue chlordecone content at higher doses, when decreased absorption was accounted for.

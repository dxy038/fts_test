This paper presents the results of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency-funded Affordable Moving Surface Target Engagement program. The overall objective was to develop affordable technologies to engage moving surface targets such as tanks, tactical ballistic missile transporters and small boats. The Northrop Grumman team used moving target indicator sensors on multiple aircraft to individually track moving ground targets. Report data were shared between sensor platforms to form an accurate multi-laterated track. These highly accurate track data were transmitted to a Lockheed Martin Precision Direct Attack Munition, which was released from an F-16 aircraft and guided by an inertial navigation system with updates from a differentially-corrected carrier-phase Global Positioning System receiver. The sensor platforms provided continuous target location updates to the weapon during flight. The final demonstration flight was completely successful. The Northrop Grumman high update rate, multilaterated moving target indicator concept scored a direct hit on a remote controlled van moving at 25 miles per hour.

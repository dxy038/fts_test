Computer programs to simulate traffic flow offer an opportunity to evaluate new strategies for reducing delays, congestion, fuel
consumption and pollution. This paper describes a Statistical Traffic Model or STM, which is based on accepted macro-modelling
concepts, such as the conservation of vehicles and the fundamental traffic diagram. In this case, the model is constructed
using the well known Matlab/Simulink2 software package, so providing an integrated approach for data processing, graphical
presentation of data, control system design and macroscopic simulation in one straightforward to use, widely available environment.
To illustrate the methodology, the STM is applied to a section of the M3/M27 Ramp Metering Pilot Scheme in the UK. This
Highways Agency sponsored project, based in the Southampton area, utilises traffic lights at the on-ramp entrances to regulate
access to the main carriageway of the motorway, in an attempt to maintain flow close to the capacity. The paper utilises the
model to help design a locally-coordinated ramp metering algorithm, based on proportional-integral-plus (PIP) control methods.
In this manner, the STM proves particularly valuable for the application of multi-objective optimisation techniques in the design
of new trafficmanagement systems.

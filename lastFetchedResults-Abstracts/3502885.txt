Several statistical design methods that have been developed to minimize the effects of IC manufacturing process disturbances on circuit performance are reviewed. It is shown that statistical design problems can be expressed as optimization problems in which either the objective function or the constraint functions depend on expectations of random variables. The effectiveness of the most recent such method, the boundary integral method is illustrated with several circuit design examples

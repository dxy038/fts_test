This paper presents an alternative for standalone PV systems that performs a decentralized input energy processing with maximum power point tracking and a bidirectional converter to manage the power flux control of the battery bank. Previous works demonstrate that the gain in efficiency can reach up to 16% in situations where one or more photovoltaic panels are shaded, damaged or aged. Simulation analyses and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the prospects of the proposed system.

We study the periodic motion of passive open-loop-controlled walking robots that are modelled as nonlinear oscillatory systems including discontinuities in the state variables. A numerically efficient method for finding periodic orbits and analysing their stability is presented. The effects of model parameter variations and different objective functions on the stability and other properties of the trajectories are discussed

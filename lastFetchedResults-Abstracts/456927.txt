Objective
Genetic variation in CC-chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) and -5 (CCR5), and their common haplotypes, acting through inflammatory responses, may affect atherosclerosis and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).
Method and results
We examined seven common variants in the CCR2 and CCR5 loci and risk of CHD among women in the Nurses’ Health Study. During 8 years of follow-up, we documented 248 incident cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD, and matched controls 2:1 based on age and smoking. The distribution of alleles was similar between cases and controls. The haplotype-specific odds ratios (ORs) were not statistically significant nor was the globally-adjusted p-value (p = 0.61). However, there was a statistically significant association for CCR5-Δ32 and A58755G (rs2856758) between cases and controls comparing age of onset <55 and ≥55 years. For Δ32, the OR for having the variant was 0.12 (0.02–0.76) for age <55, and 1.14 (0.69–1.88) for age ≥55 years (p, interaction = 0.04). The CCR5-Δ32 was in linkage disequilibrium with 58755G, and a similar association was observed for having the 58755G.
Conclusions
In this population, CCR2–CCR5 haplotypes were not associated with risk of CHD. However, our data suggest a strong inverse association for certain CCR5 variants and early age of CHD onset.

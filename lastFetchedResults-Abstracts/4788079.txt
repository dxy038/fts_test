A major issue in structural program testing is how to select a minimal set of test paths to meet certain test requirements. The zero-one integer programming model, a generalized optimal path selection method for node (or statement) testing and branch testing criteria, is extended in such a way that it can be used for DD-path testing, TER<sub>n</sub> measurement, and all types of local coverage test criteria. With slight modification, it can also be applied to all types of data-flow-oriented test criteria. The model can be used for program testing based on any coverage criterion of the structural testing approach. If a mixture of multiple test criteria is needed, the model is still workable. The model can be applied to program testing with various objective functions and can be extended to multiple goal objective function problems. Since the objective functions are independent from the constraints of test criteria, it is possible to have various combinations of optimization criteria and coverage requirements according to the specified test strategy. Characteristics of the zero-one integer programming model are discussed

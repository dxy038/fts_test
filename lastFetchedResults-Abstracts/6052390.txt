Summary form only given. Traditional salient point based approaches fail in coding calligraphic characters as noisy boundaries make the extraction of the salient points a difficult task. We propose an alternative solution based on genetic algorithm which searches through the space of possible parameter values until a global optimal solution is found. The objective function we employed is a modified version of the total energy function found in the active contour literature

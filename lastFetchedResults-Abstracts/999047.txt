The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a simple miniaturized approach to gas chromatography termed supported capillary membrane sampling-gas chromatography on a valve (SCMS-GCOV). The prototype instrument uses a pulsed discharge photoionization detector (PDPID) as the GC detector. Two different analyzers were constructed. The first used a bench scale SCMS-GC. The second was a miniaturized SCMS-GCOV analyzer. The SCMS-GCOV analyzer was used to monitor the concentrations of trihalomethanes (THM4) in drinking water. Details are given for the construction of the SCMS-GC-PDPID and the SCMS-GCOV-PDPID analyzers. The results of method detection limit, accuracy and precision studies are reported for analysis of THM4 and are compared to other methods of THM4 analysis. Side-by-side comparison studies are conducted between the SCMS-GCOV and USEPA 502.2 with promising results.

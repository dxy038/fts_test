The process of modernization, development and migration have much impacted the family size, functions and structure which consequently changing the ways of family communication. Therefore, communication technologies such as Social Network Sites (SNSs) are increasingly being used within family settings to support and extend the family relationships. Thus, the objective of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework in order to understand the SNS appropriation process towards family life. The proposed theoretical framework named Family Appropriation of Social Network Site (FASNS) could be used as a guideline for relevant agencies and scholars such as Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), SNS designers, family therapists, family scholars and Information System (IS) scholars in developing a healthy family communication.

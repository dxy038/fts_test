The interpretation of remote sensing images challenges the image processing community not only by a variety of difficulties which are to be solved during the creation of an application but also by the computational effort required to run it. The solution to overcome the latter restriction is the use of parallel computers. However, programming such machines is another challenge. The present paper aims towards the design and implementation of powerful tools allowing the user to generate a remote sensing application even on images obtained from a variety of sensors, by icon manipulation. A graph of icons is parsed and a source code free of errors is produced in Objective C for an AIS-3500 massively parallel computer. The environment was used to generate an &#8220;Automated Road Detection&#8221; system running on the above parallel computer. The system was tested on images from Ottawa area

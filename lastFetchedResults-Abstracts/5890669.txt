In the paper, we provide a timing-driven rectilinear routing tree algorithm which applies top-down partitioning followed by the bottom-up routing tree construction in the presence of the obstacles. The objective is to simultaneously minimize the source-to-terminal delay and the total wirelength. First, a top-down partitioning method is used to divide the chip into four sub-regions according to the position of the source. Then, the terminals in each sub-region are connected by a fast sequential routing tree algorithm. The major steps of the routing algorithm include minimal spanning tree constructing, invalid edges pushing and routing. It shows experimentally that the maximum source-to-terminal delay of the routing tree is improved by 74%. Compared to previous results, total wirelength is significantly reduced by 34.7%.

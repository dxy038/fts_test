Tobin and colleagues show that both inhibition and excessive production of the inflammatory mediator TNFα impact the pathogenesis of tuberculosis (TB) and the response to therapy. Identifying a critical role for the genetically determined balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids in regulating TNFα levels provides a roadmap to tailored TB treatment based on host genotype.

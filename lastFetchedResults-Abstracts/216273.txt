Background/Objective: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is a common worldwide lung infection. It remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Radiographic manifestations of pulmonary tuberculosis are diverse and varied. This study was performed to define the various
radiographic manifestations of this infection in the pediatric age group in children who were referred to Mofid Children’s Hospital. Patients and Methods: We reviewed chest x-rays of 30 pulmonary TB patients admitted to our hospital to ascertain the extent of parenchymal and mediastinal involvements on chest xray. Results: Male to female ratio was 1.7:1. The patients’ age ranged from 2-163 months with a mean age of 36.9 months. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was detected in 90% of the cases and pulmonary involvement, especially alveolar shadowing was seen in 83.3% of the cases (of which 43.3% had an air-space pattern and 40% had an interstitial pattern). 19 of the 30 patients
(66.3%) were under 36 months, in which 17 of the 19 patients (89.5%) revealed lymphadenopathy. Therefore 63% of all detected lymphadenopathies were seen in this age group. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was more common on the right side (73.3%). Furthermore, 60% of all alveolar infiltrations were seen on the right side.
Conclusion: Pulmonary tuberculosis most commonly represents as a mediastinal and thereafter as a parenchymal involvement. Hilo-mediastinal lymphadenopathy is the most common presentation in infants and young children.

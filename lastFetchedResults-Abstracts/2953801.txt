This paper introduces a design method using fuzzy logic to find the best stochastic design by maximizing Hasofer-Lind´s (H-L´s) reliability and simultaneously optimizing design goals. The H-L´s reliability of the system is represented by the shortest distance from the origin to the failure surface. The formulation of the problem involves random parameters and fuzzy probabilistic constraints. The objective weighting strategy in multiobjective fuzzy formulation is adopted to represent the importance among, the design goals. The paper presents the computation of H-L´s reliability index, the formulation of multiobjective fuzzy probabilistic constraints and the optimization process by an engineering design problem that has random loads and random parameters

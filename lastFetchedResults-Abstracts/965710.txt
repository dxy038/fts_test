Objective: This study aims to compare executive function (EF) in students with and without mathematical learning disorder. Method: In order to compare the executive function in students with and without mathematical learning disorder, ten female students with mathematical learning disorder, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria and the standard diagnostic test with Key Math were compared with ten ordinary students with consistent performance using the Tower of London (PC version) and the Stroop test. Result: Tower of London test showed significant differences between students with mathematical learning disorder and normal students; this was significant at levels 2 and 3 of the Tower of London task. In the continuous performance test, the  commission errors in math disorder students were significantly more than that in normal students(P < 0/05). The  omission errors in math disorder students were higher  significantly too.  In the Stroop test his distinction in terms of indicators, namely the time difference and time difference of colors, was significant between the two groups . In addition, the time for naming colors in students with mathematical learning disorder was longer. Conclusion: This study revealed that students with mathematical learning disorder have deficits in executive functions when compared with normal students.

The primary aim of the paper is the multi objective optimization of a cylindrical fin heat sink using Taguchi based &#949;-constraint method. The various responses that have been focussed upon are electromagnetic emitted radiations, thermal resistance and mass of the heat sink. The modelling of the heat sink was done by An soft High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) for finding the emitted radiations. The thermal resistance was found by modelling the same heat sink using Flotherm V7.2 software. The L9 Taguchi Design of Experiments (four factors, three levels) is used to derive the linear regression equations for the responses studied, which are taken as the multiple objective functions to be optimized. Results obtained shows that the solution obtained using Taguchi based &#949; constraint method is competitive in terms of diversity of the solutions obtained.

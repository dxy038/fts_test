Background: Normal salivary function is considered to be critical
for the maintenance of healthy oral mucosa. Oral fluids provide
an easily available, non?invasive medium for the diagnosis of wide
range of diseases and clinical situations. The objective of this
study was to estimate and compare salivary nitric oxide levels in
patients with oral lichen planus and healthy individuals.
Methods: Saliva was collected by spitting method. Unstimulated
whole saliva thus collected was refrigerated at 4°C, and processed
within 24 h for the estimation of nitric oxide levels which was done
using Griess reaction. The results were analyzed using Student’s
“t” test.
Results: There was statistically significant difference in the levels
of salivary nitric oxide between the study and control groups.
Conclusions: The present study clearly indicates a significant
increase in salivary nitric oxide levels in oral lichen planus patients
as compared to controls.

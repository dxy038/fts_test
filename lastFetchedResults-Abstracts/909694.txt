A spatial decision support system (SDSS) based on multi-criteria and multi-objective decision analysis is applied in a case study
in Ethiopia to reduce soil erosion on the basis of reallocation of crops according to their capacity to protect the soil. The case study
is carried out in the Adwa district. The SDSS has been implemented using the widespread GIS software IDRISI 32 (release 2) and
with the direct involvement of local stakeholders in defining factors and constraints. These are based on land cover-land use, altitude,
potential erosion, proximity to roads, water and the relative soil protective capacity of each crop species. A reduction of soil loss
from an average of 4.5 t ha 1 yr 1 to values below the risk threshold of soil degradation (1 t ha 1 yr 1) would be achieved through
the application of the SDSS results. The biggest impediment to the reallocation exercise, however, is the shortage of cultivable
land suitable for cultivation.

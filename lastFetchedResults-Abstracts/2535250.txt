Aims: Theory of mind as a social cognitive ability and alexithymia as an inability to identify emotions of self and others are important components of social cognition that seem to be related to each other because of their common neural correlations and functional overlaps. The current study was a descriptive correlational research whic aimed to investigate the relationship between alexithymia and theory of mind in a nonclinical group. Method: The sample consisted of 233 students from Bonab universities selected by multistagecluster sampling. They responded to tests of Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), and Alexithymia Questionnaire TAS20.

Among the components of alexithymia, objective thinking had a high predictive contribution to the theory of mind (P

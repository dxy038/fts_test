This paper formulates a novel fuzzy multi-level multi-objective production planning (FMLMOPP) model for a supply chain under a fuzzy environment. An efficient two-phase interactive solution procedure is developed to obtain a good solution that maximizes the total supply chain profit and the satisfactory degree. The proposed solution procedure, modified from Sakawa et al.´s interactive fuzzy programming approach, can be easily adopted by practitioners. Through a negotiation case study, a well-known network product manufacturing supply chain in Taiwan is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the solution procedure, as compared with Sakawa et al.´s method with only one objective at the manufacturer level. Finally, several important findings and managerial implications are drawn from this study.

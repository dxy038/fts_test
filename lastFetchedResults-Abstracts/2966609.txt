Given the number of additional neurons, the author has estimated a lower bound of memory capacity of a bidirectional associative memory (BAM) with dummy augmentation encoding (DAE). The lower bound is min (L<sub>A</sub>(1+r<sub>ca</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/4 log L<sub>A</sub>, L<sub>B</sub>(1+r<sub>db</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/4 log L<sub>B</sub>), where (L<sub>A</sub>, L<sub>B</sub>) are the original dimensions of the library pairs (A&amp;oarr;<sub>k</sub> B&amp;oarr;<sub>k</sub>), and the numbers of additional neurons are denoted as r<sub>ca</sub>L<sub>A</sub> and r<sub>db</sub>L<sub>B</sub> (r<sub>ca</sub> and r<sub>db</sub> are positive constants). The extension of the authorÂ´s result on a Hopfield network with DAE is also discussed. Finally, on the basis of the lower bound, the author has evaluated the efficiency of DAE.

An identified challenge in using sow loins as a raw material for value added enhanced whole muscle products is to eliminate or minimize objectionable atypical aromas and flavors (“sow taint,” ST) that may occur in some sow carcasses. The objective of this study was to determine consumer acceptance of sow loins exhibiting atypical aromas and flavors marinated with a solution of salt, sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium bicarbonate. Sow loins (N=34) with atypical aromas and flavors and commodity loins (N=6) were fabricated into anterior and posterior loin sections and marinated with one of four ST marinade treatment combinations (15% pump, 0.5% PO4, 0.70 M NaHCO3; 15% pump, 0.25% PO4, 0.70 M NaHCO3; 15% pump, 0.25% PO4, 0.35 M NaHCO3; and 15% pump, 0.25% PO4, 0.35 M NaHCO3), or a control marinade (0.25% sodium tripolyphosphate, 15% injection level) and evaluated by a consumer sensory panel. Sensory ratings determined that ST loin chops injected with a 15% solution of sodium tripolyphosphate (0.50%) and sodium bicarbonate (0.35 M) were not different (P&gt;0.05) than loin chops from marinated commodity control loin sections (N=12) for flavor, texture, juiciness, and overall acceptability. These results indicate that a solution containing sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium bicarbonate minimized the detection of atypical aromas and flavors in sow loins.

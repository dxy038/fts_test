An adaptive handover algorithm for wireless communication systems is addressed in this paper. Moving from the Generalized Extended Least Square handover algorithm proposed in, we model the handover mechanism as a hybrid system, and we include it in a dynamic optimization problem which is solved through the use of a trellis diagram. It´s the key segment in moving Least-Square Approximation that computing the radius of node´s support field and fixing the neighborhood of node. The most of papers finished it by sorting nodes according to distance and it takes a lot of computation. This paper analyses the complexity and develop a new method to compute the radius based on the iterative process. It can dynamical control the radius and decreases the complexity. Finally, it is applied to solve partial differential equations. The numerical example shows that the method has less computation and higher accuracy. The objective function takes into account the parameters that influence the handover mechanism. The optimal solution of the program allows to evaluate performance of the handover in terms of the probability of handover and probability of outage.

In this paper, we consider the learning effect to optimize the assignment of the front-line staffs. Taking the lead time as the objective function, we propose a global optimization model based on workersÂ´ previous experience, learningability, technology difficulty and batch size. Based on the analysis of an instance, the paper draws a conclusion that the model, to some extent, has instructive significance for the Manual Operating System to optimize the staff assignment.

With an increasing market share of electric vehicles (EVs) the question of additional electricity demand and its effects arises. In this context, smart charging of EVs is discussed. This paper investigates the optimization of charging strategies with cost as objective function. Thereby, battery constraints regarding the charging process are taken into account. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. The model accesses detailed information on battery charging profiles, predefining charging energy amount as well as charging current and voltage. Beside the battery constraints, limitations by the EV driversÂ´ mobility demand as well as maximum power limitations of the investigated system are considered. Within the framework of a case study for Singapore, the model is applied to a sample of EVs and to the corresponding car parks, resulting in charging power profiles for different car park types.

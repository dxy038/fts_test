Summary
gh the anatomy and histology of the coracohumeral ligament (CHL) play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of frozen shoulder, they remain unclear. Our objective was to study the anatomic features of the CHL and analyze its histology. Twenty-six fresh-frozen, normal cadaveric shoulders were used to examine the position and morphology of the CHL and their relationship with the superior glenohumeral ligament and to determine the CHL's histologic features in comparison with the joint capsule and coracoacromial ligament. The CHLs were all located in the rotator interval, with an irregular trapezoidal structure. The subacromial bursa was above the CHL, and the subcoracoid bursa was below the it. The CHLs in all shoulders originated from the lateral aspect of the base of the coracoid process. In 11 shoulders, it inserted into the supraspinatus tendon, whereas in 11 other shoulders, it inserted into the rotator interval. In 3 shoulders, the CHLs were split and inserted into both the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons, respectively. Finally, the CHL in 1 shoulder only inserted into the subscapularis tendon. We also observed that the pectoralis minor tendons in 4 shoulders passed over the coracoid process top and inserted into the CHLs. In 11 shoulders, a complex of the CHL and the superior glenohumeral ligament was formed. Histologically, the CHL was found to be similar to the joint capsule without any ligament features. The position, morphology, and origin of the CHL did not change much, but its insertion varied greatly. In addition, the CHL had the histologic feature of a capsule, not a ligament.

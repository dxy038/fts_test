Background/Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in Iranian candidates of coronary artery bypass graft and its associated factors. Patients and Methods: 1,647 consecutive candidates of coronary artery bypass graft underwent abdominal aorta sonography. The relation of AAA with gender, age, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, carotid and coronary stenosis was evaluated. Results: The prevalence of AAA was 3.7% in men and 1% in women. The prevalence was 5.2% in men older than 65 years. The largest diameter f AAA was 51 mm. Gender, age, smoking and carotid stenosis were associated factors of AAA. Conclusion: The prevalence of AAA is lower in Iran comparing with western studies (p<0.0001). The mean diameter of aneurysm was lesser in our study too (p<0.0001). The associated factors of AAA in our study were similar with previous reports. Screening of AAA is not recommended in Iranian candidates of coronary artery bypass graft.

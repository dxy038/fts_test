Most existing efficiency or productivity literature assumes homogeneity in human capital when measuring the efficiency/productivity of firms. The empirical objective of this study is to investigate how the measures of productivity and efficiency are affected when human capital is heterogeneous but assumed homogeneous. The input-oriented radial Malmquist index is employed to measure total factor productivity growth of Taiwanese commercial banks by means of three-stage data envelopment analysis. Results show that efficiencies are underestimated and low efficiency scores in many banking efficiency studies could have been caused by measurement errors in labor.

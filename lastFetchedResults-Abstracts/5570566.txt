We propose a resource allocation algorithm for OFDM system to provide QoS guarantee for unicast and multicast service concurrently. The optimization objective is to maximize the sum rate of the unicast service under the constraint of both the total power and the minimal rate provision of the multicast service, which can be solved by traditional two-step approach. To decrease the complexity, a greedy-based algorithm is proposed. According to the theoretical analysis and the simulation results, the performance of the proposed algorithm is close to the two-step approach meanwhile the complexity is effectively decreased. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm can balance the performance and the complexity well and so is suitable to be applied to practical scenario.

This paper presents and discusses the Defense Information Service Network (DISN) global mobile wireless networking architecture to extend the range of broadband services to mobile users available to fixed users. The roaming and mobile users will have to operate across a wide range of network performance, and choosing among alternative media and overlays for best performance. Diverse wireless and wired networks are integrated through software that mediates between the mobile terminal and the networks it could possibly connect to, supporting the mobile users as it roams among the multiple networks. The overall objective of the paper is to introduce and resolve technical issues and problems in the development of a mobile and wireless DISN network services, and answer some of the questions on the implementation of the new services and systems.

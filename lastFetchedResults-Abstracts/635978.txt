Monthly average sunspot numbers follow irregular cycles with complex nonlinear
dynamics. Statistical linear models constructed to forecast them are therefore inappropriate,
while nonlinear models produce solutions sensitive to initial conditions. Two computational
techniques – neural networks and genetic programming – that have their advantages are applied
instead to the monthly numbers and their wavelet-transformed and wavelet-denoised series. The
objective is to determine if modeling wavelet-conversions produces better forecasts than those
from modeling series’ observed values. Because sunspot numbers are indicators of geomagnetic
activity their forecast is important. Geomagnetic storms endanger satellites and disrupt
communications and power systems on Earth.

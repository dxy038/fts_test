Continuous ambulatory monitoring is a promising technique for objective evaluation of movement disorders in man. Although technological progress make such devices currently available, no validated measurements exist. We propose an original approach to validate instrumental measurements in central neurological diseases, based upon the use of computer modeling of movement disorders. In such an approach, computer simulations of altered movement were used to validate accelerometric-derived measurements in spasticity and ParkinsonÂ´s disease. We found that some measurements, derived from the frequency power spectrum of distal acceleration at the upper limb, may be suitable for evaluation of some motor disorders, as spasticity, parkinsonian rigidity and related motor disability. Direct applications are expected in ambulatory monitoring of neurological diseases

In this paper, a data warehouse-enabled community healthcare management system that would help to integrate residents, hospitals, pharmacies and governments in healthcare was put forward through a common technical architecture. According to the characteristics of different roles, a subject-oriented information share model is also discussed. Hence, the objective of this research is to present and describe the community healthcare service system in China, the technical infrastructure of data warehouse, and the decision support architecture for such a healthcare management system. The research findings would immensely help the development of healthcare community in China, and improve the healthcare service quality from the point of view of residents.

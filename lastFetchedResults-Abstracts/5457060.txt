This paper describes a mathematical model for tuberculosis (TB) and discusses its dynamic behavior. The model is novel in that it combines multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) with undetected TB cases. The basic reproduction number, R<sub>0</sub>, is calculated. The result shows that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R<sub>0</sub> &#8804; 1, and is unstable if R<sub>0</sub> &gt; 1. When R<sub>0</sub> &gt; 1, there also exists a locally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium. Simulations confirm the analysis, and exhibit that undetected TB cases play an important role.

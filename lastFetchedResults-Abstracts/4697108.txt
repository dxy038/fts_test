This work presents the microwave educational methodology which was implemented at the Departement of Electrical Engineering of the University of Brasilia - UnB - Brasil in the last two years. The main objective of this methodology is to introduce modern concepts of circuit design and measurements to the students as well as to help them develop the "feeling" which is required to microwave designers. In this approach, analysis and synthesis tools for several different devices were developed from the theoretical fndamentals using modern CAD techniques and thus forming a microwave designer\Â´s kit. Afterwards, the software performance is evaluated through realization of various prototypes, in a closed-loop learning fashion.

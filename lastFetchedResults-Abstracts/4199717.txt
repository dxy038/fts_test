Ultrasonic signals are well suited for characterizing of liquids, slurries, and multiphase flows. Ultrasound sensor systems provide real-time insitu measurements or visualizations, and the sensing systems are compact, rugged, and relatively inexpensive. The objective is to develop ultrasonic sensors that 1) can be attached permanently to a pipeline wall, possibly as a spool piece inserted into the line, and 2) can clamp onto an existing pipeline wall and be movable to another location. Two examples of systems based on pulse-echo and transmission signal analysis are used to illustrate some of the capabilities of ultrasonic online measurements with technologies that have applications in the nuclear, petrochemical, and food processing industries.

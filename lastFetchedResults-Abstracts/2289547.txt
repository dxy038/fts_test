Context and objective: basically, societies have norms and values which are
compiled in the form of a collection called “topical law” and naturally these
values are known as crimes and the perpetrator of the crimes is punishable
because if the breach of the act. Based on a simple reflection, each action
violating these values should be punished only once. This reflection is
explained in the form of banning trial and repeated punishment. This rule as
a basic right of the accused seeks to prevent trial and punishment of someone
for repeated commitment of a crime.
Methodology: the study has an applied objective. Its materials have been
written in library method using target language (Arabic), compiled and
translated books and article, internet sites, codified rules and jurisprudence
books.
Findings: Criminal law review suggests that the rule banning repeated
punishment (regarding previous punishments) has been full of ups and
downs in different periods and one approach is not used for this rule.
Iran’s legislator has not recognized this rule before revolution. But in afterrevolution
law, we have seen that this evident principle has been omitted out
of Iran’s law and has been revived in 1392.
Conclusion: as regards the revolution of Iran’s criminal codes covering
the rule banning the repeated punishment, after the revolution of omitted
rules, there came the dought that legislator’s action to omit this rule along
the process of Islamicization of these rules is consistent with religious
edicts. But concerning the revival of this rule criminal punishment rule
1392 showed that omitting this rule out of previous rules have resulted
from indifference to religious valid sources as this rule has been explicitly
mentioned in some of the sources

The living lab demonstration project PowerMatching City is a clear example of how distribution networks can take advantage of the increasing number of Distributed Energy Resources (DER). Due to the applied decentralized market model in this project, DER become active players on the local market. Battery energy storage systems are DER that can provide flexibility and grid support. This paper presents the design, analysis and implementation of In-Home Electricity Storage (IHES) systems in PowerMatching City. First, a bid strategy is developed that applies to the system constraints and the objective of profit maximization. Second, the effect of the integration of IHES systems in the local market on grid support services is analyzed. It is shown that integrating IHES systems in the distribution network reduces both the peak load and energy losses. Third, a field test is conducted, and the test results show that using the designed strategy the IHES systems are able to operate in a dynamic price market.

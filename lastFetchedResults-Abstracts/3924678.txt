Source localization for wideband signals using acoustic sensor networks has drawn much research interest recently. The maximum-likelihood is the predominant objective for a wide variety of source localization approaches, and we have previously proposed an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to solve the source localization problem. In this paper, we tackle the source localization problem based on the realistic assumption that the sources are corrupted by spatially-non-white noise. We explore the respective limitations of our recently proposed algorithm, namely EM source localization algorithm, and design a new direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation based (DEB) source localization algorithm. We also derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis and the computational complexity study for the aforementioned source localization schemes. Through Monte Carlo simulations and our derived CRLB analysis, it is demonstrated that our proposed DEB algorithm significantly outperforms the previous EM method in terms of both source localization accuracy and computational complexity.

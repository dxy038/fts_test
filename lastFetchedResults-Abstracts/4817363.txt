Summary form only given. To improve system reliability for radial distribution systems with distributed generation (DG) under fault conditions, switch placement schemes are proposed to form self-supported areas after fault isolation. Customer priority is also considered in this problem. The switch placement problem is formulated as a non-differentiable, multi-objective optimization problem. Graph-based algorithms, which incorporate direct load control, are developed to locate switches. Their results enable DG to support customers continuously in the event of fault. The proposed algorithms can be applied to unbalanced distribution networks with single or multiple distributed generators. Simulation results on a 394-bus distribution system, including priority customers, single or multiple distributed generators, were also provided.

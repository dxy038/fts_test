SkyMed/COSMO (COnstellation of Small satellites for the Mediterranean basin Observation) is a space program originally conceived by Alenia Aerospazio in order to provide products, services and logistics to both institutional and commercial remote sensing users. It was initially configured for specific observation of the Mediterranean basin, however, given the intrinsic characteristics of the system, it is also able to provide service on global scale. A preliminary user needs analysis, has shown that existing and/or planned systems do not completely satisfy the risk management, coastal zone monitoring and sea pollution user needs. To fulfil the identified gap, the Italian Space Agency (ASI) decided to promote the SkyMed/COSMO system by financing the initial phase of the program. However a broad spectrum of other important applications, in the field of the resource management, land use and law enforcement, may be also satisfied once the primary objective is fulfilled

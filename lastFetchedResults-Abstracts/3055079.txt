This article deals with the joint detection of bits for a spread-spectrum system based on random permutations, in the case of a transmission over frequency-selective channels. A linear minimum mean-squares error approach is studied, whose objective consists of mitigating both the multi-access interference and the intersymbol interference. The proposed system is compared with the DS-CDMA system. The theoretical study is confirmed by simulation results.

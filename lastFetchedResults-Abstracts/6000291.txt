This work proposes light weight video encryption algorithms suitable for real time applications. The objective of these encryption algorithms is to reduce the total amount of time taken for encryption while encrypting the entire video which is necessary in certain applications like video conferencing. Two proposals are suggested in this work. In the first proposal, Intra frames and motion vectors are encrypted using Galois field polynomials. The second proposal consists of avoiding the computationally demanding motion compensation process, and the temporal redundancy is converted into spatial redundancy, and the converted frames are scrambled. This reduces the time taken for encryption, making it suitable for real time applications.

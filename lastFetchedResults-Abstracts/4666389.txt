Power quality (PQ) is one of the most important issues of modern electrical distribution. Power electronics can play a very significant role in the correction of PQ problems. This paper deals with the evaluation of different control strategies applied to a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) for the mitigation of voltage sags. The objective is to analyse the influence of the chosen strategies on subjects such as the energy storage capacity or the inverter rating. First Matlab-Simulink/PSB has been used to test the characteristics of the different chosen compensation techniques. Then the simulation results and conclusions have been experimentally validated in a 10 kVA rated DVR. The paper shows the most important aspects that should be taken into account for the choice of a compensation algorithm for a specific application

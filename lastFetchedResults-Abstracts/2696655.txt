By integrating the concept of effective capacity, the quality-of-service (QoS)-driven power and bandwidth allocation for heterogeneous wireless networks are investigated. The objective is to improve the power efficiency while providing delay QoS guarantees for the multi-mode mobile terminal users. First, the joint power and bandwidth allocation problem is formulated as a convex problem. Then, by solving the problem in the dual domain, an iterative algorithm to achieve the jointly optimal power and bandwidth allocation is proposed. The analytical results show that the optimal power and bandwidth allocation depends not only on the channel quality, but also on the delay QoS constraints. The numerical results verify that the proposed scheme can achieve the best power efficiency compared to the existing schemes.

Therefore, the current study adopting the descriptive-analytical and comparative approaches and based on the library study, distributed 760 questionnaires among family caretakers in the studied district (citizens in districts 2 and 4 as the emigrants and native residents of the city) in order to  deal with different objective and subjective indices of the life quality between these two big groups of citizens in Qom city. Regarding this, to analyze the obtained data the SPSS software is used to analyze the relation between variables of the T-test.

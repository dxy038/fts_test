Introduction The geographical distribution
of mental health disorders is useful information
for epidemiological research and health
services planning. Objective To determine the existence
of geographical hotspots with a high prevalence
of schizophrenia in a mental health area in
Spain. Method The study included 774 patients with
schizophrenia who were users of the community
mental health care service in the area of South
Granada. Spatial analysis (Kernel estimation) and
Bayesian relative risks were used to locate potential
hotspots. Availability and accessibility were both
rated in each zone and spatial algebra was applied to
identify hotspots in a particular zone. Results The
age-corrected prevalence rate of schizophrenia was
2.86 per 1,000 population in the South Granada area.
Bayesian analysis showed a relative risk varying
from 0.43 to 2.33. The area analysed had a nonuniform
spatial distribution of schizophrenia, with
one main hotspot (zone S2). This zone had poor
accessibility to and availability of mental health
services. Conclusion A municipality-based variation
exists in the prevalence of schizophrenia and related
disorders in the study area. Spatial analysis techniques
are useful tools to analyse the heterogeneous
distribution of a variable and to explain genetic/
environmental factors in hotspots related with a lack
of easy availability of and accessibility to adequate
health care services

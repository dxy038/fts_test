Analog envelope constrained filtering problem with uncertain input (ECUI), we require the response of the filter to each signal in the input mask to lie within a prescribed output mask. The objective is to design the filter so as to minimize the noise enhancement whilst satisfying these constraints. The continuous-time ECUI problem was previously solved using filter structures which in practice were not physically realisable. This paper presents a new sub-optimal method which allows the use of more realistic filters, and which can converge to the optimal result provided a certain parameter is made small.

Ensuring a smooth electrical energy to the consumer has been identified as the main role of electric supply utility. In doing so, the power utility needs to ensure that the electrical power is generated with minimum cost. Hence, for economic operation of the system, the total demand must be appropriately shared among the generating units with an objective to minimize the total generation cost for the system with the voltage level maintained at the secure operating limit. Dynamic economic dispatch (DED) is one of the main functions of power generation, operation and control. DED is an improvement of the conventional economic dispatch. This paper proposes an optimization technique to solve dynamic economic dispatch (DED) in the electric power system using ant colony optimization (ACO) technique. Prior to the DED scheme, static economic dispatch (SED) was conducted for the purpose of comparison. Implementation on an IEEE test system highlighted the merit of the proposed EP technique for the DED implementation.

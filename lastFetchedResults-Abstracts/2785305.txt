Over the years, many designs for biobandage were introduced for different types of burns but in most cases these designs are introduced as a protection means to cover and protect the burned tissue from the bacterial infection not as a treatment means. In this paper a new model for a burns biobandage is introduced not only as a protective mean but also as a treatment technique by helping the tissue to rebuild itself as fast as possible. The main objective of this research is to develop a simple cryotherapeutic system to absorb the large amount of heat produced by the burned tissue and reducing its temperature in order to facilitate the tissue healing and regeneration process. A biobandage is proposed to include an iced layer as a cooling source, a cotton layer and a water gel layer for comfort and temperature control, and a plastic layer to seal the ice layer. The combination of these four layers physically work together to reduce inflammation, which in turn make the heeling or recovery time shorter and reduce pain as a result of decreasing the nerve conductivity. The COMSOL Multiphysics was used to model the cooling process on burned tissue using the proposed iced-biobandage. The calculated temperature profiles along the depth biobandage and burned skin provide a clear visualizing of the heat flow within each layer. The history of temperature and heat transfer rate at the burned skin surface are monitored for an effective cooling and healing process. A modeling analysis was performed to examine the changes of temperature over a predetermined time and to help in identifying the optimal period for ice cooling process, the analysis shows that the ice layer is effective within a certain period of time and after this period it doesnÂ´t add any beneficial effect.

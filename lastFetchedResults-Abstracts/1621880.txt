Multiple sclerosis (MS) is clinically heterogeneous and has an uncertain natural history. A high priority for more effective treatment of MS is an objective and feasible laboratory test for predicting the disease's course and response to treatments. Urinary myelin basic protein (MBP)-like material (MBPLM), so designated because it is immunoreactive as a cryptic epitope in peptide 83–89 of the human MBP molecule of 170 amino acids, is present in normal adults, remains normal in relapsing-remitting, but increases in progressive MS. In the present investigation, MBPLM was purified from urine and characterized. p-Cresol sulfate is the major component of urinary MBPLM. This conclusion is based on the following: (1) MBPLM and p-cresol sulfate both have a mass of 187 on negative scans by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, the same fragments on tandem mass spectrometry of 80 (SO−3) and 107 (methylphenol), and similar profiles on multiple reaction monitoring; (2) 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed identical spectra for MBPLM and p-cresol sulfate; (3) purified p-cresol sulfate reacted in parallel with MBP peptide 83–89 in the same radioimmunoassay for MBPLM; and (4) p-cresol sulfate has the same behavior on preparative HPLC columns as urinary MBPLM. The unexpected immunochemical degeneracy permitting a cross-reaction between p-cresol sulfate and a peptide of an encephalitogenic myelin protein is postulated to be based on shared conformational features. The mechanisms by which urinary p-cresol sulfate, possibly derived from tyrosine-SO4, reflects progressive worsening that is disabling in MS are unknown.

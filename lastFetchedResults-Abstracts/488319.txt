Background and Objective: Effects of electeromagnetic exposure on different parts of neruous system and memory of humans and animals has been established. In spite of important human studies, animal studies have been more precise and comprehensive. Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF, <300Hz), have been reported to induce a variaty of behavioral and physiological function changes in animals. The object of present study was to determine the delay and durartion time of convulsions induced by co- exposure of ELF and strychnine.
Materials and Methods: The effects of ELF on convulsions induced by strychnine (lmg/Kg) were investigated in 60 albino mice. Animals were devided into 6 groups (n^lO), including control (I), 100Hz and 20Volt (II), 25Hz and 20Volt (III), 25Hz and 260Volt (IV), 100Hz and 260Volt (V), and 100Hz and 260Volt (VI). Delay time (Det) and duration time (Dut) of convulsions were measured respectively. Increase and decrease in Det and Dut were determined and were compared in control and five ELF exposed groups. Results: There was no significant difference in Det and Dut parameters between control (I) and III, IV and VI groups. In all these groups the convulsions terminated in animal death after a low Dut. In contrast there was a significant difference (P<0.001) in Det parameters between control (I) and the other groups (II and V). No deaths happened in groups (II and V).

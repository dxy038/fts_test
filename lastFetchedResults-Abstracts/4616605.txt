Auditory brainstem response potentials (ABR) are signals calculated from the EEG signals registered as responses to an acoustic activation of the auditory system. The ABR signals provide an objective, diagnostic method, widely applied in examinations of hearing organs. The shape of the time-dependent signal, and its possible distortion, and particularly the presence or absence of characteristic waves are of great diagnostic importance. In the present work methods of automated identification of wave V are presented, using multilayer perceptron type networks. Classification methods are also proposed, based on cascade architecture of the neural networks used for recognition of the context information.

The data collection instruments included a researcher-made questionnaire and a 24-hour F&V recall. The reliability of the questionnaire with ?=0.82 was confirmed. Data were collected after verification of the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. The data gathered were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and statistical analysis of correlation, regression and descriptive data.

According to regression analysis, subjective norms, amount of pocket money, and behavioral intention, 39% of the predicted changes of fruit and vegetable consumption ( =0/39, F=10/72, p < 0.001). As well as based on this model, attitude predicts 20% changes of intention the consumption of fruit and vegetables ( =0/20, F=6/68, p=0.01).

Conclusion: Fruit consumption in students is less than the amount recommended by the World Health Organization.

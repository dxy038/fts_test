BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pyrus boissieriana Buhse leaves extract has many of biological activities such as antioxidant, antilarva, antibacterial and antifungal in vitro. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of Pyrus boissieriana Buhse leaves extract on antihyperglycemic, antioxidant and antilipidproxidative in normal rats. METHOD: In this experimental study 56 adult male rats of Wistar strain, weighing 150 to 200 g, were randomized into blank, control and experimental groups (8 rats in each group). At the starting day, sampling from blank group was performed. Experimental group rats were treated with Pyrus boissieriana Buhse leaves extract (500 mg/kg) for 7, 14, 21 days (one day between). Control group rats were treated with water (1.5 ml) orally. Antihyperglycemic effect was evaluated in serum by glucose oxidase method whereas antioxidant and antilipidproxidative were evaluated in serum and tissues. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) method and lipid peroxidation was evaluated by TBARS method (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances). FINDINGS After 14 days of starting study, serum glucose concentrations in experimental group (55.61±8.73 mg/dl) than blank group (99.51± 14.36) decreased significantly (p=0.032). Glucose changes between control and experimental groups were not significant in other days. Antioxidant activity in tissues and serum after 21 days in the experimental group (liver: 1178±43.2, kidney: 1031.9±53.4, pancreas: 164.6±7.6, serum: 1986±182.2 jiM) than the control group (liver: 33.1±4.5, kidney: 544.63±35.2 pancreas: 89.8±8.8, serum: 1505±89 ^M) increased. But lipid peroxidation did not affected after consumption of Pyrus boissieriana Buhse leaves extract in tissues. CONCLl SION This study demonstrated the Pyrus boissieriana Buhse leaves extract has antioxidant activity in vivo in serum, liver, kidney and pancreas in normal rats.

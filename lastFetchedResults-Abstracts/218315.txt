Shahdadroud River is one of the most important rivers in Kerman province that during previous years has been threatened by drought and anthropogenic pollution. This river supplies some parts of drinking water of Kerman city and some vicinity villages. The main objective of the present study is consideration of pollution situation of the river;
for this purpose, limnological and biological studies of the river were carried out seasonally in 2007. Four sampling stations including Vameghabad (station 1), Bamoghavemat (station 2), Sharifabad (station 3) and Mehrechenar (station 4) were determined based on limnological standard method along the river; afterwards sampling of invertebrates (biological index) and water quality (BOD) were performed seasonally during study period. The results showed that station 1 is free of pollution while the station 2 is the most polluted region at the river; because the
station 1 has no pollutant resource but the station 2 receives  astewater of rainbow trout fish culture center directly. Based on findings of biomonitoring and water BOD measurement, Shahdadroud River has relatively high-polluted situation and is classified in u-mezosaprobe class.

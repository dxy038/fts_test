Discrete transition simulators usually do not apply full physical models of devices and as a result, they are incapable of showing parasitic processes such as diode reverse recovery. The main objective of this study was to develop a behavioral model of diode reverse recovery that can be implemented in these simulators. The proposed model is based on the lumped charge control concept. It can be easily extracted from a simple measurement and it does not require heavy computational resources. The model was tested within the PSIM platform and was verified experimentally for various turn-off conditions. Model application is exemplified by investigating a lossless snubber of a three-phase buck-type rectifier.

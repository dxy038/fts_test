The objective of this study was to determine the sedation, analgesia, and clinical reactions induced by an intravenous combination of romifidine and butorphanol in horses. The study was conducted on six saddle horses weighing 382 to 513 kg (mean ± SD; 449 ± 54 kg) and aged 6 to 14 years. The horses each underwent three treatments: intravenous romifidine 0.1 mg/kg body weight (RM; mean dose, 4.5 mL); intravenous butorphanol 0.05 mg/kg body weight (BT; mean dose, 2.4 mL); and intravenous romifidine 0.1 mg/kg body weight plus butorphanol 0.05 mg/kg body weight (RMBT; mean dose, 7.0 mL). The order of treatments was randomized. Heart rate, arterial pressure, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, sedation, and analgesia were measured at two times before treatments, 15 minutes apart (times –15 and 0) and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after drug administration. The onset of sedation was approximately 5 minutes after intravenous injection of RM and RMBT, whereas BT did not present this effect. The duration of complete sedation was approximately 60 minutes for RMBT and approximately 35 minutes for RM. The RMBT treatment provided 30 minutes and the RM treatment 20 minutes of complete analgesia. Heart rate decreased significantly (P < .05) from basal values in the RM and RMBT treatments. Only RM caused significant decreases (P < .05) in the respiratory rate. Arterial pressure did not change significantly (P > .05) in any treatment. Intravenous administration of a romifidine−butorphanol combination to horses resulted in longer duration of sedation and analgesia than administration of romifidine or butorphanol alone. These effects probably resulted from a synergistic effect of the two drugs.

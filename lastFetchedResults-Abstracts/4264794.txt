An investigation on control mechanism using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to suppress the vibration of flexible plate has been carried out. Active vibration control (AVC) is implemented for the case of single-input single output (SISO), and the controller is realized in linear parametric form where all parameters are arbitrarily chosen by applying the working mechanism of PSO. The objective function is the mean-squared error of the observed vibration signal. The performance of the controller is assessed in terms of level of attenuation achieved in the power spectral density (PSD) of the observed signal.

An objective measure for the perceived effect of reverberation is an essential tool for research into dereverberation algorithms. There are two different effects that contribute to the total perceived reverberation: colouration and reverberation decay tail effect. In this paper we aim to investigate an objective measurement of colouration of the speech signal in the presence of room reverberation. This measurement only requires the original reference signal and output signal and does not require an estimate of the room impulse response. The colouration measurement is performed only at onsets of speech activity in each bin of a short time FFT analysis.

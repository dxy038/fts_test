In this paper, we work with the virtual remote sensing laboratory (VRSL) developed in the CINVESTAV Telecommunication area, to do the simulation study of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, which is the principal objective of this work. Also, we modified the so-called Mv parameter matrix, which is a degree of freedom implied in some reconstruction methods as the weighted constrained least squares (WCLS) and the proposed method called modified WCLS method (MWCLS) described in this paper. We include this proposed method and other characteristics in the first version of the VRSL.

The objective of the present study was to analyze the differences
in rugby game statistics between winning and losing teams. The
data from 58 games of round robin play from the Six Nations
tournament from the 2003-2006 seasons were analyzed. The
groups of variables studied were: number of points scored, way
in which the points were scored; way teams obtained the ball
and how the team used it; and technical and tactical aspects of
the game. A univariate (t-test) and multivariate (discriminant)
analysis of data was done. Winning teams had average values
that were significantly higher in points scored, conversions,
successful drops, mauls won, line breaks, possessions kicked,
tackles completed, and turnovers won. Losing teams had significantly
higher averages for the variables scrums lost and line-outs
lost. The results showed that: a) in the phases of obtaining the
ball and more specifically in scrummage and line-out, winning
teams lose fewer balls than losing teams (winning teams have an
efficacy of 90% in both actions); b) the winning team tends to
play more with their feet when they obtain the ball, to utilize the
maul as a way of attacking, and to break the defensive line more
often than the losing team does; and c) On defence, winning
teams recovered more balls and completed more tackles than
losing teams, and the percentage of tackles completed by winning
teams was 94%. The value presented could be used as a
reference for practice and competition in peak performance
teams.

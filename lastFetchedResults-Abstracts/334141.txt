The objective of this study was to describe the mammographic and sonographic appearances of primary lymphoma of the breast. We retrospectively reviewed the mammographic and ultrasonographic images of 12 patients with primary lymphoma of the breast. Descriptions of imaging findings were made according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon by two radiologists. Mammography was performed on 11 patients. Most of the lesions were shown to be oval-shaped (72.7%) and high-density (90.9%) masses on mammography. Ultrasound examination was performed on 8 patients. The lymphomas were commonly single (75%), circumscribed (50%) or microlobulated (37.5%), and oval (50%) masses on sonography. The echo pattern of the mass was hypoechoic in 7 patients (87.5%) but hyperechoic in 1 patient (12.5%). No mass had spiculated margins or calcifications. Ipsilateral axillary lymph node involvement was noted in 1 patient. In conclusion, most primary lymphomas of the breast present as oval-shaped and high-density masses on mammography and as single and hypoechoic masses with circumscribed or microlobulated margins on sonography.

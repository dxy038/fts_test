The authors show an integrated circuit implementation of a higher-order vision function, that of determining the orientation of line segments and edges across an image projected onto the chip. The IC includes an array of photoreceptors and analog processing elements consisting of weights arranged in a network. A primary objective of the implementation was a compact and simple design, as it would be a prelude to including even higher levels of visual processing on the chip in the kerf areas between many such arrays

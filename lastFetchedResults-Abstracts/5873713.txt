In this paper we describe the development of the software module for an embedded system, which realizes Fast Frequency Hopping for a radio device. The module is designed using the SDL modelling language, then implemented in C++ language, targeting a custom board equipped with Vx Works operating system. The main focus of the paper is on a new object oriented library, called "SDL Framework" (SDL-F), that has been developed with the main objective of allowing fast mapping of SDL elements into native C++ objects. The paper describes the reasons which have lead to the development of SDL-F framework and presents its main features and performances.

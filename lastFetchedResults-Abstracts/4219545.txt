Summary form only given. The Materials Testing Facility (MTF) at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is developing a battery-powered, rep-rate charger for a 60-kJ capacitor bank. The objective is to charge a 4800-&#956;F capacitor to 5-kV in four seconds for a fifty shot burst. A bank of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> batteries is used with a full H-bridge converter, a transformer, and a rectifier to transform the 500V battery voltage to 5-kV secondary voltage.

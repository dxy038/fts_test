Nigella sativa belong to Ranunculaceae family has various pharmacological effects such as, anti oxidant, anti inflammatory, anti tumor and anti apoptosis effects. This study was investigiated the neuroprotective Comparison affects Nigella sativa seed aquatic and alcolic extracts on sciatic degeneration in rats.
Material and Methods: 36 wistar male rats with average body weight of 300 to 350 gr were divided randomly to six groups (N=6), control, compression, A,B: compression + treatment with 75,50 mg/kg extract, C,D: compression + treatment with 75, 50 mg/kg aquatic. In compression group, the sciatic nerve of right leg was compressed (60sec), in treated groups. In addition to compression extract was injected (2time, every week, I.P). Four weeks of post â€“ operations in which lumbar segments of spinal cord L2-L4 were sampled, processed, serially sectioned and stained with toluidine blue. The number of alpha motoneurons was counted using dissector method. Data were analyzed with using Minitab-14 software, ANOVA an d T- tests.
Results: According to result, the neuronal density show a significant decrease in the group compression compared with control and treatments group (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Treatment with alcoholic extract in compare with aqueous extract has more noropotective effect and cause increases the density of alpha motoneurons in spinal cord after sciatic nerve compression in Rats

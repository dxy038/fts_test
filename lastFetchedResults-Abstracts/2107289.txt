Objective(s):To clarify the protective effects of Cichorium glandulosum (CG) extracts on thioacetamide (TAA)-induced rat hepatic fibrosis. Materials and Methods: The dry roots of CG were smashed and percolated with 95% ethanol, and the residual was prepared into petroleum ether extract (CG-V), ethyl acetate extract (CG-VI) and n-butyl alcohol extract (CG-VII). Thirty-six Wistar rats were randomly divided into a normal group, a model group, a CG-V group (15 mg/kg), a CG-VI group (3 mg/kg), a CG-VII group (6 mg/kg) and a positive drug group (silibinin capsule, 8 mg/kg). Organ indices and serum levels of glutamic-oxaloacetic and glutamic-pyruvic transaminases of intragastrically administered rats were obtained. Expressions of FN, Smad3, IGFBPrP1 and TGF-β1 genes were detected by Western Blot and immunohistochemical assays. Apoptosis was examined by TUNEL assay. Results: Hepatic fibrosis of treatment groups was evidently mitigated. Expressions of FN, Smad3 and TGF-β1 in administration groups were higher than those in normal group, and moreover were significantly higher in CG-V and CG-VII groups than those of model group. Apoptotic index of model group was significantly higher than that of normal group, but indices of CG-V and CG-VII groups were significantly lower than that of model group. Significantly more FN, Smad3 and IGFBPrP1 were expressed in treatment groups than those in normal group. Conclusion: CG extracts may function by altering TGF-β/Smads signal transduction pathway.

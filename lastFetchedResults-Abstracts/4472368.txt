In the hospital MIS (management information system) where it uses the Internet infrastructure, the implementation is possible with the various methods. Such Applications are developed in the multi-tiered architecture. A lot of applications make the distributed process possible and are made as the multi-tiered architecture to develop the reusability of the existing software module. In this case, there are many cases for the server to be separated from the hardware or software for the architecture of the server. Especially, it is mostly general to separate for the case of a database server to a new tier. One of the important points of multi-tiered server side applications is security and because of this, it is difficult to share the related data about the design skill. In this paper, through the analysis of the general hospital MIS currently servicing in the Internet, we discuss how to implement a business logic tier using database system among the server side architectures. The main objective of this article is to show an efficient APIs (application programming interfaces) design method which can be used to manage the data that must be saved to the database system among the packets that client/server have to be exchange.

The primary objective of a grid information service is to discover resources out of large number of grid nodes. While deploying a grid, it is a challenging task for the grid administrator to opt for the GIS which discovers resources within acceptable time period. This work aims at analyzing the behavior and performance of two most widely deployed GIS viz. Monitoring and discovery services (MDS) and distributed Hash tables (DHT). A quantitative comparative analysis of the two schemes has been performed. Experiments have been designed and performed with GridSim, to understand the behavior of the two services in presence of large number of users and resources. Four experiments are conducted, scalability of the two schemes has been studied, and the parameters that form bottlenecks in the behavior of these two schemes, have been identified. Limiting bounds have been established over various parameters identified. These parameters are number of users an index server can support, number of information providers, response time and throughput of the index server .Finally the results obtained establish that DHT index server scales better and provide higher throughput as compared to MDS index server. The results provide an aid in deploying information services in a grid and help in future development work.

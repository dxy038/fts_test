Trench lateral power MOSFETs (TLPMs) are suitable for one chip power ICs due to its low specific on- resistance and ease of fabrication with CDMOS devices. In our smart power IC process we integrated both the high side n- channel and bidirectional TLPMs in one chip. In addition, better device characteristics of both devices were obtained with the process integration technology. The high side MOSFET shows 20 mOmegamm<sup>2</sup> specific on-resistance with 25 V breakdown voltage and excellent reliability. The bidirectional MOSFET shows 7.0 mOmegamm<sup>2</sup> specific on-resistance, which represents 67% of the current mass production value, with a breakdown voltage of 25 V.

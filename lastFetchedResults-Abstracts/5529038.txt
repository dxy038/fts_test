INTA is developing a new picosatellite, OPTOS, based on standard CubeSat. The key objective of this project is to build up a reliable platform for future applications: R &amp; D, telecommunications, space qualification of components, etc. The communication subsystem plays a key role in system reliability. The vast majority of picosatellite-based communication subsystems use amateur radio technology, without any space qualification. OPTOS incorporates a customized subsystem that is being thoroughly tested and will try to ensure the quality of the radio link. This subsystem operates in the frequency band of 402 MHz, dedicated to Space Operations and Earth Exploration Satellite, protected from amateur radio interference. It consists of a transceiver and 4 monopoles onboard the satellite, and a directional antenna together with diverse ground equipment.

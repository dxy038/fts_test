Background and Objective: Pulpectomy is one of the most common treatments for preserving infected primary teeth. Intracanal medicaments have been used to decrease the amount of microorganism. The purpose of present study was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of some medicaments (formocresol, CMCP and 0.2% chlorhexidine) against some common bacteria isolated from infected primary teeth.
Subjects and Methods: In this experimental study fifty primary canine teeth were prepared and were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 10). After sterilization, suspension of bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were inoculated into each canal. Cotton soaked in normal saline as a positive control; and cotton soaked in Formocresol; CMCP and 0.2% chlorhexidine were placed in canal groups(2 to 4). The antibacterial effect of each medicament was evaluated by determining the percentage reduction in colony counts (RCC %) and CFU (colony-forming units) on day 3 after exposure. Kruskal-Wallis test, Dunn's test and SPSS 22 were used to analyze the data.
Results: All experimental groups showed a significant decrease in bacterial counts in compassion with control group (P  <  0.05). 0.2% chlorhexidine showed significantly lower efficacy compared to formocresol and CMCP group (P  <  0.05).
Conclusion: According to the present study formocresol and CMCP have good antimicrobial effect.

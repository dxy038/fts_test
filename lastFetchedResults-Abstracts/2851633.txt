This paper proposes an optical flow algorithm by adapting Approximate Nearest Neighbor Fields (ANNF) to obtain a pixel level optical flow between image sequence. Patch similarity based coherency is performed to refine the ANNF maps. Further improvement in mapping between the two images are obtained by fusing bidirectional ANNF maps between pair of images. Thus a highly accurate pixel level flow is obtained between the pair of images. Using pyramidal cost optimization, the pixel level optical flow is further optimized to a sub-pixel level. The proposed approach is evaluated on the mid-dlebury dataset and the performance obtained is comparable with the state of the art approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be used to compute large displacement optical flow as evaluated using MPI Sintel dataset.

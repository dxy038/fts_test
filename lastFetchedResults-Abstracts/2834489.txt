This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization in conjunction with a minimal spanning tree (MST) to solve the reconfiguration problem in parallel with the optimal capacitor allocation. The proposed method is based on a combination of genetic algorithm and the Kruskal Algorithm. The reconfiguration problem is solved through the MST, embedded into a NSGA-II for solving the total problem. An appropriate selection of the fitness functions provides a solution that is able to reduce power loss and improve the voltage profile in the distribution network. To solve the problems, a multi-objective formulation based maximization of the annual savings, minimization of total power loss, and minimization of total voltage deviation on the buses is proposed. The comparative test performed on test systems has demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

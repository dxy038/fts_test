This paper presents the Bee optimization method for harmonic elimination in a cascaded multilevel inverter. The main objective in selective harmonic elimination pulsewidth modulation strategy is eliminating low-order harmonics by solving nonlinear equations, while the fundamental component is satisfied. In this paper, the Bee algorithm (BA) is applied to a 7-level inverter for solving the equations. The algorithm is based on the food foraging behavior of a swarm of a honeybees and it performs a neighborhood search combined with a random search. This method has higher precision and probability of convergence than the genetic algorithm (GA). MATLAB software is used for optimization and comparison of GA and BA. Simulation results show superiority of BA over GA in attaining accurate global minima and higher convergence rate. Also, its performance in 10 times run is the same as in 1 time run. Finally, for verifying purposes, an experimental study is performed.

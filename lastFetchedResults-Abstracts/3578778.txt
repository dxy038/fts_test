Based on the B. KoskoÂ´s bidirectional associative memories (BAM) strategy, a modified bidirectional decoding strategy (MBDS) is introduced. The MBDS structure provides sufficient recalling capabilities by adding some association fascicles to the BAM structure. These association fascicles are established with a relating parameter that controls the recalling performances. Pattern recognition examples are presented to shown that the MBDS requires considerably fewer weighting connections than the dummy augmentation method does. Moreover, in the problem of pattern recognition, if there are large number of trained pairs, the MBDS is still applicable, but the dummy augmentation method seems to be obstructed

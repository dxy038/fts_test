IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is a very important field in the network development. Comparing to the traditional television, the IPTV combines the digital contents like media. The communication and the advertisement with the interaction serve into the emerging business model to provide the users to watch television service. Because the IPTV contains many merits; therefore, the world holds the high interest to develop of the IPTV. IPTV application scope is quite big, not only include wired and wireless, but also unify the telecommunication entrepreneur to provide the handset service, mobile device service and so on. It will be possible to affect the traditional television in the future, and even to displace it. If the user can use the IPTV effectively, it could be an enormous market. Generally, because the usersÂ´ identities are easily exposed when Internet Protocol Television authenticate them, the best way to secure information security is to hide the identities of users. This paper will design the internet authentication system which is anonymous and secured. It can apply to solve the smart card duplication and the data resending attack problems. Session key and time-stamp of cryptography are used in the technique to achieve security and anonymous of the authentication process. Simultaneously, how to authenticate more efficiently by encryption in smart card authentication process is also our research objective. Further, this paper will contribute to how to build a security mechanism to prevent from the attacks. Based on those researches, this project plans to propose a new efficient and safe Internet Protocol Television. This new mechanism improves the security, efficiency and usability in the authentication process. More complete studies on Internet Protocol Television will be needed.

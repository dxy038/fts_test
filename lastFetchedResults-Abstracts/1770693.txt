Objective: To study the effect of Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) in reducing the oxidative stress induced by amitriptyline (AP) toxicity.  Methods: 100 patients of both sex & age group 25 to 60 years were selected from IMCU and toxicology wards of Government General Hospital, who were suspected to have amitriptyline toxicity.  I- Group of 25 healthy volunteers of age and sex matched formed the control. II – Group of 25 patients received routine treatment (RT). III Group - RT + Vitamin C. IV Group - RT+ ALA. V Group-RT+ Vitamin C + ALA. Parameters studied were plasma cholinesterase (PchE,) Malondialdehyde (MDA), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), Glutathione peroxidase (GPX), Glutathione reductase. Results: The levels of the above enzymes and MDA showed marked alterations on treatment with ALA and Vitamin C along with routine treatment when compared with routine treatment alone. Statistical analysis of the results were carried out using Student’s‘t’ test. Conclusion: It may be concluded that the oxidative stress induced by amitriptyline toxicity is ameliorated by supplementing with ALA and Vitamin C along with routine treatment.

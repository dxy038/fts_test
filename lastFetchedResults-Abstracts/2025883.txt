In this paper we introduce approach for
implementation of robust watermarking for images.It is to
be expected that digital photographs, videos, and sound
tracks will gradually replace their analog counterparts in
the near future. Digital representation of signals brings
many advantages when compared to analog
representations, such as lossless recording and copying,
convenient distribution over networks, easy editing and
modification, and durable, cheaper, easily reachable
archival. Unfortunately, these advantages also present
serious problems including wide spread copyright
violation, illegal copying and distribution, problematic
authentication, and easy forging. Piracy of digital
photographs is already a common phenomenon on the
Internet. Information hiding in digital documents provides
a means for overcoming those problems. Depending on
what information in which form is hidden in the image,
one can distinguish at least two types of data hiding
schemes: non-robust, undetectable data hiding, and robust
image watermarking.
The objective is to implement robust image
watermarking by embedding 32 bits of information into a
single image in such a way that it is robust to JPEG
compression and cropping

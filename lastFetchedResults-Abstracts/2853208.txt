This paper presents a driving simulator experiment in which manual and automated driving of a prospective long vehicle combination has been studied. Based on post analysis of manual and automated driving trajectories, characteristic measures reflecting the manual drivers behavior have been proposed. It was observed that the drivers had a round shape of the utilized accelerations while negotiating the curves. A similar shape was found when using an objective function which included minimizing the resultant jerk vector.

In a recent article (Bonny et al., 1994), we have established the problem formulation of optimal slop cut recycling in
multicomponent batch distillation and solved it by a non-linear programming (NLP) procedure. In this paper, this type of
approach is adapted to optimize the batch distillation campaign for a number of multicomponent mixtures with different
compositions, with or without slop cut recycling. Results are presented with three objective functions and comparisons are made
between optimal strategies with and without recycling.

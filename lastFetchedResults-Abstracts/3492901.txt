A software environment for optimizing electromagnetic devices is described. The designer can interactively construct a computer model for the device to be optimized, select the variables with their constraints and create a suitable objective function for minimization. The software is designed to exploit the capabilities of a powerful command decoder with an algebraic interpreter. Some preliminary tests using both classical optimization methods involving linear searches and a stochastic method based on the simulated annealing algorithm are described.

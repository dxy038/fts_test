Universiti Kuala Lumpur adopts the Objective Based Education as part of the accreditation requirements by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency. One of the requirements is to measure the attainment of the learning outcomes associated with the academic programmes and courses. There was no integrated information system for the measurement and a system model taking into consideration the university academic information system environment was non-existent. This study describes the system model developed to measure the attainment of learning outcome. The development involved various stakeholders using action research and encompasses both the education and technological aspects of the system model. The system model proposed by this study has been accepted as the basis of the information system development in the university. As a result, an information system has been developed and deployed in selected campuses of Universiti Kuala Lumpur.

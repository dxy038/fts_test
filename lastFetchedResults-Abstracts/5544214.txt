ANDECS belongs to the new generation of open CAE systems for computational experimenting in controlled dynamics systems simulation, analysis, and multi-objective optimization. Strict databased function modularization with neutral object-oriented data- and model interfaces allows a flexible configuration of computational chains and loops. Function modules are available for basic mathematical methods, control methods, simulation, parameter- and trajectory optimization and interactive visualisation for result- and algorithm animation. ANDECS supports interoperability by exchanging both commands and data via interprocess communication with: MATLAB and Xmath for system dynamics analysis and synthesis; KHOROS and Data Explorer for versatile result visualisation; KISMET as robot animation package; and the like

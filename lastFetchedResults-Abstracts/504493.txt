This paper presents the modeling and simulation of gas turbine aeroengine for fuel control system design in steady state and transient modes. In this study, for the generation of the compressor map, two different methods including generalized and designed methods are used. In addition, the effects of the climatic and flight conditions on the engine performance parameters including engine thrust, fuel consumption and inlet turbine temperature are modeled. The objective of the engine performance analysis is to investigate the critical parameters for engine control during different climatic and flight conditions. For this purpose, a computer simulation is developed using Matlab Simulink, and the engine steady state and transient performance are obtained. The results are then compared with the experimental data for a turbojet engine at standard condition where a good agreement are seen. Moreover, the results show how some of the engine parameters exceed their allowable limits as the climatic and flight conditions change. These results confirm the need for a control system to avoid such malfunctions. Finally, the fuel control system functions are classified based on the climatic and flight conditions.

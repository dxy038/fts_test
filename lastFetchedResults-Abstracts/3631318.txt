Adaptive array research at The Ohio State University is presented in a summary form. The main objective of the research was to assess the capabilities of adaptive arrays for communication systems in real environments. Consequently the theoretical work was often corroborated by experimental implementation and testing of proposed techniques. Specifically, three systems in which adaptive arrays were successfully incorporated are described, a single channel spread spectrum communication system, a TDMA satellite communication system, and a remote sensor communication system. Numerous other adaptive array studies are briefly summarized.

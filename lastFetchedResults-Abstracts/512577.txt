The objective of this study was to measure the physical activity and physiological fitness (cardiovascular fitness, body composition, flexibility, muscle strength and endurance) of 10th grade male students in the Al-Dhahirah region, Sultanate of Oman. The study sample consisted of 330 male students from rural and urban areas. The study used a physical activity survey to measure the physical activity and a test battery to measure the physiological fitness components (1 mile w alk/run test; a skinfold of chest, abdominal, and thigh; sit and reach test; hand grip test; and one minute sit-ups). The results showed that body fat percentage (6.82±4.91) and muscle strength (38.15±7.60) of urban students were higher than rural students (body fat percentage 5.79±4.29, muscle strength 37.81±6.93). Rural respondents scored higher in flexibility (39.36±6.95), muscle endurance (40.03±7.64) and cardiovascular endurance (7.63±1.30) compared to urban students (flexibility 37.96±6.97, muscle endurance 39.78±7.67, cardiovascular endurance 8.03±1.77). The results showed significant difference in body fat percentage (p = 0.04), muscle endurance (p = 0.00), and cardiovascular endurance (p = 0.01) between participation in sports activities and physiological fitness components for the overall sample. The study recommends that a concerted effort be made by all parents, teachers, school administrators and the community to improve the general physical fitness of students on the whole.

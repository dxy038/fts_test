Objective
Body dissatisfaction and medical issues arising at both ends of the weight continuum are discussed from a cultural perspective. More specifically, a possible aesthetic preference and physical tolerance for increased adiposity among African-American females is discussed, as contrasted with that of Caucasian females.
Conclusions
This mini-review of the existing literature suggests many avenues for future research in the cross-cultural aspects of body dissatisfaction, overweight, and obesity. Among these suggestions are (1) educating children and adolescents about excessive weight, (2) assessing cultural perceptions of overweight and obesity among African-Americans, (3) understanding the developmental trajectory of body dissatisfaction in females, and (4) placing more emphasis on the cross-cultural representation and psychological influence of the female body image in the media.

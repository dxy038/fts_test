This paper presents a XML-based specification of the fuzzy system (FS) with objective to facilitate FS development by separation of the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) implementation and a problem domain description. Generic FIS application is implemented in Java, and XML schema for domain knowledge specification is developed. Study case supporting the experimental evaluation of the proposed solution is software quality evaluation.

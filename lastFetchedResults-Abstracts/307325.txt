Objective
To evaluate the biomarkers of pancreatitis Colorimetric Lipase, Total Amylase and Pancreatic Amylase (immunoinhibition) assays on the Roche COBAS INTEGRA 700.
Results
Pancreatic and Total Amylase assays and Colorimetric Lipase showed excellent imprecision of 1.6 to 2.3% and linearity (slope = 0.94–0.99, y-intercepts–1 to +3 U/L, R = 0.999) over the range of 17 to 900, 35 to 880, and 21 to 150 U/L, respectively. There was an excellent correlation between Pancreatic and Total Amylase: Pancreatic Amylase = 0.99 (± 0.02) × Total Amylase–36(± 8) (n = 106, R = 0.97, p< 1 × 10−5, y intercept p< 1 × 10−5). Colorimetric Lipase showed some correlation to Total and Pancreatic Amylase results: Colorimetric Lipase = 1.54 (± 0.16) × Total Amylase–81(± 37) (n = 100, R = 0.70, p< 1 × 10−6, y intercept p = 0.03), and Colorimetric Lipase = 1.78 (± 0.15) × Pancreatic Amylase–50(± 29) (n = 99, R = 0.78, p< 1 × 10−6, y intercept p = 0.09).
Conclusion
We recommend running the more specific Pancreatic Amylase as biomarker of pancreatitis on the Roche COBAS INTEGRA.

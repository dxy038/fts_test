We deal here, with a real-world problem, called ANTENNAS PREASSIGNMENT problem. We first show how it can be modeled as a particular kind of circular cutting problem. Next, we develop a simulated annealing heuristic solving it with good performance. Our method is based upon the definition of an energy function reflecting the objective to be optimized; small values of this function correspond to local optima of good quality for our problem.

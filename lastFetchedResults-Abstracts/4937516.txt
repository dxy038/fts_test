An experimental project using computer display terminals to provide real-time traffic information for pre-trip planning purposes is being implemented and evaluated. Ten terminals will be installed at Greenway Plaza, and one additional computer display terminal in the Public Information Office. The objective of the motorist information project is to provide accurate and timely information on freeway construction, accidents, and disabled vehicles. The information on the computer display terminals will be obtained from several commercial traffic advisory services, the Motorist Assistance Program, courtesy patrol radio, and transit authority, law enforcement, and other emergency vehicles. Additional roadway condition reports and incident management information that relate to traffic operations will be provided to these terminals by the Interim Traffic Control Center.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

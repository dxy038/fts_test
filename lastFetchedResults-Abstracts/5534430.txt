A. novel multiple-input DC-DC converter is proposed in this paper. Compared to other multiple-input DC-DC converters, the new topology has achieved bidirectional power flow between individual inputs and output, soft switching implementation without additional devices, high efficiency, high reliability and simple control. The Delta and Y type model of multi-winding transformer is developed to assist the circuit analysis. The operating principle, soft-switching conditions and steady state analysis are presented in this paper. Circuit simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis

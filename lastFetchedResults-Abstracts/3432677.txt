A new technique based on adaptive code-to-user allocation for interference management on the downlink of BPSK based TDD DS-CDMA systems is presented. The principle of the proposed technique is to exploit the dependency of multiple access interference on the instantaneous symbol values of the active users. The objective is to adaptively allocate the available spreading sequences to users on a symbol-by-symbol basis to optimize the decision variables at the downlink receivers. The presented simulations show an overall system BER performance improvement of more than an order of a magnitude with the proposed technique while the adaptation overhead is kept less than 10% of the available bandwidth.

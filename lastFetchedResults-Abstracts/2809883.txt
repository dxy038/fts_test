This paper presents modelling, simulation and optimization results for a novel SThm probe. The model takes into account thermo-electro-mechanical equations. Moreover, a tip-surface contact model derived by taking into account microscopic multi-asperity contact is proposed and discussed. Results of multi-objective optimization are reported, and finally a multi-scale model that should reduce the simulation time is stated.

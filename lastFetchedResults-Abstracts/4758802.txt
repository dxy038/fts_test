Modelling the effects of the surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) on AVHRR data improves the consistency of time series of land surface measurements produced from AVHRR and is necessary to retrieve surface albedo from AVHRR. An approach based on fitting a BRDF model to AVHRR measurements within a sliding window has been tested. Several BRDF models have been compared for their performance in normalising the measurements to a standard view-illumination geometry, and the choice of window length investigated, at Australian sites spanning a wide range of land cover. This paper highlights the suitability of POLDER measurements for the evaluation of the performance of BRDF modelling of AVHRR data at the top of the atmosphere

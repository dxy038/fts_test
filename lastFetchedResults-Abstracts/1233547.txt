Novel (non-quadratic) plasticity criteria based on Kelvin modes are formulated here for anisotropic materials. As an example, such a macroscopic criterion is applied with success to the case of FCC nickel-base single crystals. Indeed, relying on the cubic symmetry of the material, the Kelvin decomposition of elasticity tensor easily allows for the definition of an objective and loading independent criterion. The criterion identification is performed from different loading cases for CMSX2 single crystal superalloy. Tension–torsion yield surfaces at room temperature and yield stress dependence on crystal orientation are modeled. The Kelvin modes based criterion is compared to experimental data, to Hill and Barlat and coworkers macroscopic criteria and to Schmid law predictions. The results show that a simple three-parameter yield function built thanks to von Mises equivalent Kelvin stresses accounts for a satisfying plasticity criterion for such alloys.

Non-quadratic norm ∥·∥a plasticity framework is addressed. Intrinsic generalizations of Hershey–Hosford criterion are proposed for cubic material symmetry.

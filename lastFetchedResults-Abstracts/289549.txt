Objective
Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to explore the use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa NovoSeven® Novo Nordisk, A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) for the management of ICH in the operating theater and intensive care unit.
Patients and methods
We reviewed all the records of nonhaemophilic patients entered into the haemostasis.com database who received rFVIIa for ICH.
Results
Sixteen suitable patients were identified (mean age: 23.3 years; range: 1–58 years). The total dose of rFVIIa administered ranged from 31 to 270 μg/kg. Indications were stabilization of ICH (n = 6), control of peri- or post-operative haemorrhage associated with neurosurgical procedures (n = 8), or correction of coagulopathy prior to neurosurgical intervention (n = 2). The majority (13/16 [81.25%]) required one dose of rFVIIa. A clinical effect (stabilization of bleed, reduction of peri- or post-operative haemorrhage, or prevention of excessive blood loss during neurosurgery) was seen in 14/16 (87.5%) patients. Some improvement in coagulation status was noted. No thromboembolic events were reported. One patient experienced massive elevation of D-dimer levels—an effect possibly due to rFVIIa. Two patients suffered adverse events unrelated to rFVIIa. Six deaths occurred, all attributable to underlying brain injury.
Conclusion
This observational study suggests that rFVIIa is of value for the management of ICH in nonhaemophilic patients secondary to a range of aetiologies. These findings justify further investigation.

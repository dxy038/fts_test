Inverse scattering of two dimensional dielectric objects buried under stratified media based on nonradiating (NR) current reconstruction is presented. For this we use electric field integral equation (EFIE) to formulate the direct scattering problem in transverse magnetic (TM) case, then we solve inverse scattering problem by subspace optimization method (SOM) based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm as optimization procedure. Also the effect of NR current is determined by defining radiating and NR objective functions and comparing the imaging results from radiating and NR induced currents.

This study examines perceptions and objective attribute measures in discrete choice models of recreation site choice behavior. These forms of attribute measurement are examined in individual and combined revealed preference/stated preference models. Our results suggest that the model based on perceptions slightly outperforms the models based on objective attribute measures. However, issues such as the definition of the choice set and the measurement of welfare present significant challenges when using perceptions data.

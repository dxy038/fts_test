Accompanying development of a new organic polymers, there has been a revival of interest in design of broadband radar absorbers. The new materials can be used as very thin sheets forming Jaumann transformers, or in multilayer Dallenbach transformers. Genetic algorithms (GA) have been previously shown to offer advantages in design of multilayer absorbers. Pareto GA permit us to obtain a family of designs with two or more design objectives, e.g., reflection coefficient and absorber thickness. However efficient optimization of absorbers for a range of angles of incidence still poses challenges. In this work, we explore how selection of the GA objective function can increase the absorber bandwidth without increasing the thickness for a range of angles of incidence.

This paper presents a practical approach to the systematic synthesis of thermoeconomically optimum, resilient heat exchanger networks and their optimizing control configurations subjected to multiple objective criteria and variations in stream inlet conditions. These networks are able to maintain the specified stream outlet temperatures both with and without changes in stream flow rates and inlet temperatures. They also approach a maximum thermodynamic efficiency for heat exchange, have the least number of exchangers, heaters and coolers, and minimize both the network investment and utility operating cost. The proposed control configurations are relatively simple, requiring only inexpensive stream bypass lines around exchangers and manipulable flow rates to heaters and coolers.

The performance of HVDC system depends on the parameters of control system, and usually PI controllers have been used to adjust system to fulfill desired objectives. However, the optimization methods for PI controllersÂ´ parameters of HVDC system are very few up to now. And when the optimization task comes to RTDS, it becomes more complex. This paper introduces the Simplex Algorithm and its application in real time simulation (RTDS). The system objective functions are adopted to optimize the PI parameters of constant current (CC) control at the rectifier and the extinction-angle control at the inverter for Three Gorges-Shanghai &#177;500 kV DC Transmission Project on the basis of the control strategy. After the optimization process was finished, the performance of the PI controller with the optimized parameters was compared with that of the PI controller with the initial parameters. The step responses of those two PI controllers were presented by figures. And it shows that the controller with the optimized parameters has strong robustness.

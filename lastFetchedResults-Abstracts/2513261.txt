Appropriate management of supply chain is one of the issues facing economic firms that affect all the organizational activities in order to produce the goods and provide the services. Consequently supplier selection due to involvement of various qualitative and quantitative criteria such as quality, price, flexibility and delivery times is very difficult and complex and requires accurate and appropriate tools. On the other hand today's competitive environment due to its variable nature, has added the uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. The problem of supplier selection is not an exception as well and it seems suitable to use the robust optimization methods in such circumstances. The mentioned method is used in this research with the goal of supplier selecting and determining the amount order of products considering all restrictions in order to minimize the costs and maximize the utility of purchase in the condition of uncertainty. In this paper, a multi-objective deterministic model is presented to solve the problem, and then the deterministic model is converted to the robust model using the scenario-based robust method and then is solved using the lp metric method so optimal amount of order is obtained from each of suppliers at any period. To determine the weight of each of suppliers, analytical hierarchy process (ahp) is used as well.

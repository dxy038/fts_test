Previous research has shown that pedagogical patterns can inspire and support practitioners in the design of learning activities, including non-trivial Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) activities. This potential has led to a number of LD tooling initiatives supporting patterns: from pattern repositories to authoring tools that present the patterns as editable templates. However, these repositories and authoring tools are isolated and the patterns available in one tool are not easily transferable to another tool. In this paper, we propose a software architecture based on a pattern ontology focused on the specific case of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). Its objective is to support the dynamic management of patterns and enable its interoperable provision between tools. As proofs of concept, the paper demonstrates by means of use scenarios the relevance or the problem and the first implementations of the architecture.

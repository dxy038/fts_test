Cognitive radio is an effective way to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity, current interest in CRN (cognitive radio networks) has grown considerable because they can make full use of spectrum resources and provide extra communication capacity in the case that spectrum is relatively scarce. However there is still not a special simulation platform for CRN which is of great help to the research of it. Focusing on this situation, this paper presents a simulation platform for cognitive radio based on windows operating system and developed using c/c++ language special for CRN according to the principle of modularity and customization. The direct objective of the platform is to set up a 3rd party open network-level software that can be used to simulate these algorithms for CRN. This paper describes the simulation methodology together whit the architecture and then details of the simulation platform.

The traditional data envelopment analysis model so called CCR model proposed by Charnes et al.(1978), which model evaluates the relative efficiency of each decision making unit with multiple input and multiple output variables. However, there are two reasons make the CCR model weak discriminative power. One is impractical weights of decision variables; the other is the insufficient number of decision making units. Chiang and Tzeng (2000) introduced fuzzy multiple objective programming (FMOP) to improve the discriminative power of evaluating model This FMOP model derived the common weights for all decision making units and improved the problem of discrimination in CCR model. In this study, we applied these evaluation models to derive the efficiency score of the Accounting &amp; Statistics Departments of Air Force in Taiwan. We also compared the results of these models and then summarized some research findings in the end of this paper, it might provides some useful implications for improving the competition of decision making units, which is one of the most important factors of modern war.

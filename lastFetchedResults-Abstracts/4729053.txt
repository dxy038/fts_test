This paper addresses the survivability in existing ATM mesh networks with the goal to (1) compare the network survivability for link and path restorations, (2) to determine the effect of spare capacity distribution schemes on the restoration ratio, and (3) to determine the effect of the choice of candidate paths per node pair on the restoration ratio. It is observed that our results can contribute to enhance the design decisions when dealing with survivable ATM mesh-based network designs, for the predefined restoration objective.

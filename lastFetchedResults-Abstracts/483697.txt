Current collapses of big companies and the worse fluctuations of the financial
markets have evoked the awareness of the stakeholders and managers to utilize
suitable tools to predict the financial distress of companies. One of such tools is the
application of financial ratios as independent variables and developing models to
predict bankruptcy issue. The objective of this study is first to test the prediction
power of original Altman (1983) and Ohlson (1980) models on the dataset ofIranian
listed companies and secondly by applying MUltiple Discriminant Analysis (i.e.
MDA) and Logit Analysis statistical techniques on the same dataset, develop a
suitable prediction model for bankruptcy of listed companies in the economic
environment of Iran

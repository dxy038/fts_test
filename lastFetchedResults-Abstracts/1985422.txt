Perilla frutescens is an annual herbaceous plant native to Asia, where its leaves are used in Asian gourmet food. Our previous study showed that the inhibition of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) activity was remarkably recovered by pretreatment with perilla leaf extract (PLE). The objective was to fractionise PLE, and to identify the active component that is responsible for the enhancement of γ-GCS activity and glutathione (GSH) concentration. Among the five fractions from PLE, PLE-III of the ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest γ-GCS activity in a HepG2 cell experiment, and was further chromatographed. The purified compound, which enhanced γ-GCS activity, was finally identified as caffeic acid. We first report the enhancement of γ-GCS activity and GSH level in HepG2 cells by caffeic acid obtained from PLE. Our results suggest that caffeic acid may be a key factor in the chemopreventive potential of perilla leaf components by increasing de novo synthesis of GSH.

The objective of the paper is to present some results of experiments for structural health monitoring by utilizing a wireless sensor network technology based on GPS. Sensor nodes equipped with GPS are installed on the top of the roof of a building and allow to detect the position of this sensor nodes during several instants of time. This information is collected through wireless communication. At first, the description of the system is presented. Then, an application of the wireless sensor network technology based on GPS to one building is discussed.

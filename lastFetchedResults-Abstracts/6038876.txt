The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the interest and the need to rely on modeling and simulation of mechatronic systems in case of testing application and to contribute to the &#8220;democratization&#8221; of the use of models and &#8220;virtual testing&#8221;. Indeed, the systems are becoming increasingly complex: more dynamic, more optimized. Add for that the development schedules are more and more restricted with reduced budgets. These constraints which are antagonistic tend to emerge a new generation of designing and testing: the &#8220;virtual test platform&#8221;. We propose industrial methods and appropriate tools to develop this virtual test platform. It is with this objective that CERTIA (Provider of test benches and studies) and the company AIRCELLE (designer and integrator of nacelles), with significant experience in their respective fields, have developed the platform &#8220;PRESAGE&#8221; for virtual testing.

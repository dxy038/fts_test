We have been making various trials of voice recognition applications with the objective to improve the human interface for telephone services as well as to reduce operation costs. This paper, after reviewing the current level in maturity of the voice recognition technology, identifies its application areas in terms of telecommunications services. Various trials of voice recognition applications of an original nature made by us are then disclosed. The issues and their solutions experienced through the trials are also discussed. Finally, the design of the IP (intelligent peripheral) for voice recognition, based on these experiences, in the framework of the IN (intelligent network) is discussed

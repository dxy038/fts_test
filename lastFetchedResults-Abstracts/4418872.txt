Nowadays, there is a large interest towards multimedia audio systems as a consequence of the development of advanced digital signal processing techniques. In particular, immersive speech communication system has gaining increasing attention since they allow to reproduce realistic acoustic image, and thus achieving good performance in terms of sound quality and accuracy. In this scenario a fundamental role is played by intelligent acoustic interfaces which aim at acquiring audio information, processing it, and returning the processed information to the audio rendering system. In this paper, an effective intelligent acoustic interface composed of a microphone array and a signal processing system capable to enhance the intelligibility of the desired information of the transmitting room is proposed, combined with an advanced reproduction system based on an efficient application of a wave field synthesis technique capable to reproduce an immersive scenario in the receiving room. The whole system has been assessed within a speech communication application involving a moving desired source in a real scenario: objective and subjective evaluation has been reported in order to show the overall system performance.

Experimental results on error-free bidirectional transmission of 8times10 Gigabit Ethernet channels over 210 km of standard single mode fibre are presented here. Inexpensive XENPAKs transceivers, conventional unidirectional 1530-1560 nm (C-band) erbium-doped fibre amplifiers and fibre Bragg grating dispersion compensating modules have been used. The results are very promising, especially for operators of national research and educational networks

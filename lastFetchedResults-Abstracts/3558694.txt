Advances in information technology and the great proliferation of the Internet have changed nearly every aspect of the work and life of human beings. Despite progress in networked entertainment, many music professionals and enthusiasts are still sticking to the traditional way of carrying out rehearsals and concerts. Music performance in this way requires physical presence of the participants and has a number of inherent limitations. We introduce a novel system called network-centric music performance (NMP) that enables multiparty music performance through cyberspace. Our target is to support real-time multichannel natural audio streaming over the network, using audio compression schemes that can provide acceptable audio quality. A system like this is bandwidth-demanding and highly delay-sensitive, and requires synchronization of the audio streams. Hence, support from the underlying end systems and networks is critical. However, the current source coding mechanisms and the best effort nature of the internet pose many challenges to achieve the desired quality of service. We have implemented a prototype of NMP, and exploited end system and network influences on NMP. The work was done in a LAN environment using Linux PCs. The system enables two different application scenarios: real-time rehearsal and rehearsal on demand. Real-time multichannel audio transport and different audio compression schemes are supported. Our evaluation results based on both subjective and objective measurements show that the system provides sufficient audio quality level for the target application in such an environment. The scalability test also revealed that the system scales well with increase of clientele. In the future, we extend our system for networks spanning larger distances and experiment with more realistic network conditions in the Internet.

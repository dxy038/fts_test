The paper presents the improved algorithm in robust constrained model predictive control for piece-wise affine systems using saturated linear feedback controller. Polytopic uncertain piece-wise affine systems is considered, and polytopic description for saturated function is used in the formulation. An infinite horizon worst-case performance function is used as online optimization objective. The optimization objective is cast as a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) optimization problem. The feasibility of piece-wise affine control law design at the initial sampling time implies the robust stability of the closed-loop uncertain piece-wise affine systems. The simulation example illustrates that the improved algorithm is suitable and effective.

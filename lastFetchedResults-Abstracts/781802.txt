Background and Objective: The aim of this research is to investigate the possible use of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles in parietal bone regeneration. 
Subjects and Methods: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel combustion method using citric acid as combustion agent. The calcium nitrate tetrahydrate, citric acid and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and deionized water with the proper stoichiometry were used. The  nanoparticles were studied by the TG/DTA, XRD, FT-IR, SEM and TEM techniques. XRD. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to identify different bond groups in the structure of the samples. The hydroxyapatite nanopowders were used on of adult male Sprague Dawley rats for parietal bone regeneration. 
Results: The product had a hexagonal structure. SEM images showed morphology and mean nanoparticles size. 
Conclusion: The results showed that the bone repairing with HA nanoparticles occur similar to typical repairing by commercially available (Bio Oss) and even it takes place with minimal tissue inflammation.

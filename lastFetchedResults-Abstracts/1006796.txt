One of the vital components of projectile weapons is Infra-Red Camera (IRC) which detects target by virtue of Infra-Red imaging. The lenses of IRC are designed to operate at a temperature of (+)30 °C ± 1 °C. When these weapons were fired from Siachen glacier region, where temperature is around (−)20 °C, they posed the problem of missing their targets. Similar problem was encountered while firing from Thar desert region, where temperature is around (+)60 °C. Hence, the optical lens of IRC is required to be brought from the prevailing ambient temperature of (+)60 °C or (−)20 °C to (+)30 °C ± 1 °C within a very short span, say 60 s to render it suitable for military applications.
The objective of this paper is to outline novel mechanism by which uniform temperature of (+)30 °C ± 1 °C from the ambient temperature of (−)20 °C or (+)60 °C can be achieved within 60 s using thermoelectric heating/cooling devices acting as heat pumps. It was found that two of the lenses made of germanium attained the temperature of (+)30 °C ± 1 °C much before 60 s, while the third lens made of AMTIR-I did not attain the required temperature in stipulated time.

This paper describes an ultracompact GaN 3 &#215; 3 matrix power converter with drive-by-microwave (DBM) technology, which comprises a radio frequency (RF)-triggered GaN-gate injection transistor (GIT) bidirectional power switches integration chip with co-integrated RF rectifiers, novel isolated dividing couplers in a printed circuit board to reduce complicated gate lines, and low-consumption GaN/Si DBM gate driver on a chip that controls nine bi-directional power switches. The proposed 4.0-kW GaN 3 &#215; 3 matrix power converter is extremely compact, measuring only 18 &#215; 25 mm due to the use of GaN-GIT power device integration technology and DBM technology that provides isolated gate signals by microwave wireless power transmission and eliminates the need for photo-couplers and isolated power supplies. The GaN/Si DBM driver realizes low power consumption of only 2.0 W as a result of gate power sharing with three RF oscillators. The sequential switching operation by the fabricated GaN 3 &#215; 3 matrix converter was successfully achieved.

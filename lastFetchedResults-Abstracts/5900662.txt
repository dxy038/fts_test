This paper presents the results of BER improvements in a chaotic phase shift keying (CPSK) CDMA system when turbo iterative decoding techniques are applied. The decoding technique investigated in this system is called the list bidirectional soft output (LBSO) algorithm. In particular, the method of iterative LBSO decoding based on the normalization of extrinsic information is investigated. The results achieved that CPSK-DS-CDMA system with turbo iterative LBSO decoding has much better error performance than the original CPSK system without coding. The error performance of the improved iterative LBSO decoding outperforms the improved soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) decoding method.

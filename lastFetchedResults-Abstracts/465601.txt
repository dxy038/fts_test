Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the outcomes of selective termination for fetal anomalies at 8 centers with the largest known experiences worldwide. Study Design: Outcomes in 402 cases of selective termination in pregnancies with dizygotic twins from 8 centers in 4 countries were analyzed by year, gestational age at procedure, and indication. Reductions of fetuses were as follows: 2 to 1, n = 345; 3 to 2, 39; ≥4 to 2 or 3, n = 18. Potassium chloride was used in all procedures. Results: Selective termination resulted in delivery of a viable infant or infants in >90% of cases. Loss up to 24 weeks occurred in 7.1% of cases in which the final result was a singleton fetus and in 13.0% of cases in which the final result was twins. Loss was 6.6% as a result of structural abnormalities, 7.0% for chromosomal abnormalities, and 10% for mendelian abnormalities (difference not statistically significant). Loss rates for procedures were as follows: 9-12 weeks, 5.4%; 13-18 weeks, 8.7%; 19-24 weeks, 6.8%; and ≥25 weeks, 9.1% (difference not statistically significant). Mean gestational age at delivery was 35.7 weeks. No differences were seen in outcomes by maternal age. The rate of very early premature deliveries has fallen in recent years. There were no known cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation or serious maternal complications. Conclusion: (1) Selective termination, in the most experienced hands, can be technically performed in all 3 trimesters with good outcomes in >90% of cases. (2) The previously observed increase in second- versus first-trimester losses has diminished. (3) Third-trimester procedures, where legal, can be performed with a good outcome for the surviving fetus. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:893-7.)

Background: Gastric ulcer includes benign mucosal and sub-mucosal lesions in the stomach wall. Gastrointestinal ulcers particularly stomach ulcer can be due to increased acid secretion.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of aqueous extract of Satureja hortensis on gastric ulcer induced by acetic acid in rats.
Methods: This experimental study was conducted on 60 female wistar rats weighing 200-250 g in the Biology Research Center of Zanjan, 2014. The rats were randomly divided into four groups (control, sham, 50mg/kg Satureja extract, and 80 mg/kg Satureja extract). Rats were operated after 24 hours fasting and gastric ulcers were induced by luminal application of 0.12 ml acetic acid solution (60%). On the first, fourth, seventh, tenth, and fourteenth days after oral administration of the Satureja hortensis extract, the stomach was excised (the rats related to any special day had received the extract separately) and the ulcer size was measured. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. 
Findings: Using the aqueous extract of Satureja hortensis resulted in significant ulcer healing in both intervention groups. Mean neutrophil, macrophage, and fibroblast count on the seventh, tenth and 14th day of intervention was significantly decreased in the intervention groups compared to the fourth day and compared to the control and sham groups.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, it seems that the aqueous extract of Satureja hortensisis has significant healing effect on gastric ulcer induced by acetic acid.

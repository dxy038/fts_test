Objective
We investigated the effects of vitamin E supplementation on the fatty acid composition of red blood cell membrane phospholipids and on the clinical observations in patients with hepatitis C virus.
Method

Eight patients and control subjects were administered 500 mg/d of image-α-tocopherol for 12 wk. The α-tocopherol and fatty acid composition of phospholipids in red blood cells were analyzed before, at 4, 8, and 12 wk, and after 4 wk of washout of vitamin E administration.
Results

The α-tocopherol concentration in red blood cells increased 2.37-fold of the basal level during vitamin E supplementation. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels increased in five of eight patients with vitamin E supplementation. The arachidonic acid level, docosahexaenoic acid level, and ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid in red blood cell membrane phospholipids, which were significantly lower in the patients than in the control subjects, were elevated at 8 and 12 wk after vitamin E supplementation. The improvement in fatty acid composition was observed particularly in the patients who responded to the vitamin E therapy.
Conclusions

Vitamin E therapy for the prevention of disease progression in patients with hepatitis C virus may be effective.

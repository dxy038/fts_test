Today, developing a strong brand is an objective for many organizations including service organizations. Therefore building a brand in hotel industry is important in this area; however, little research has been carried out in this field with experimental approach. This study examines experimentally the relationship among the components of customer-based brand equity based on Askerâ€™s assumption in order to determine the most important brand equity components in hotel industry. This study is an applied research in terms of objective, and is a descriptive research in terms of data collection method. The required data was gathered by a questionnaire from customers of five star hotels in Mashhad. Furthermore, data analysis was conducted using structural equations. The results indicate that perceived quality is the strongest predictor when determining brand equity and has significant impact on other brand equity components. It is one of the strongest determinants of brand equity.

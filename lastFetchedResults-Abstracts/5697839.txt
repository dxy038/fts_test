The objective of this paper is to present a roadmap that has been used for guiding the development of Smart Grid architecture in electricity distribution companies, considering KEMAÂ´s experiences around the world and, in particular, Brazil. Initially, we review technologies typically involved in a smart grid with a special focus on smart meters and electrical network automation, as well as the necessary infrastructure to facilitate this implementation, including telecommunications systems, information technology, and cyber security. Then, we present projected costs and benefits, with a broad overview of each of these areas. The feasibility study for the deployment of a smart grid system will typically identify and quantify the benefits for all stakeholders, namely industry, regulators, shareholders, customers, government, society and technology providers. Using this information, and based on real projects led by KEMA, the paper outlines and identifies major benefits, with an objective analysis of the results achieved to date, as well as the challenges and barriers faced in each project. Finally, the paper emphasizes that in order to ensure a reliable energy supply to fast growing areas like Brazil-areas in need of energy from renewable sources, more efficient use of equipment, and assimilation of healthier habits of consumption-the use of smart meters and smart grid is a desirable path to follow. However, the big challenge lies in proving achievable benefits, and one of the best ways to demonstrate these benefits is through the test of the technologies in pilot projects.

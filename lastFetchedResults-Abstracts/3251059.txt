Smart Grid is a network of transmission and distribution of electricity enjoying a complete integrated control and new capabilities of information technology and telecommunications. It provides bidirectional energy flow and informational in real time between all actors in the network. The Smart Grid is now the state of experimental design and there is no industrial sector itself. It reigns including greater uncertainty about the standard technology of tomorrow and it is difficult to have a universal model of Smart Grid frozen in time. The evolution of smart device and the news protocols open more research in this field in order to achieve a standard architecture of telecommunication in a smart grid. In addition to the currently wired standards and protocols used, new wireless approaches should be study. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes Network Architecture of Smart Grid Communication by deploying wireless protocols consisting of 802.15.4 ZigBee, 802.11, and the WiMAX standards. These are applied at different levels of the architecture as the Wide Area Network (WAN), Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) and the Home Area Network (HAN). For this architecture to be more robust, reliable and efficient, more characteristics of these protocols will be studied and simulated in this article.

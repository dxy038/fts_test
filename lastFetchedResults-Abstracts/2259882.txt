With regard to the ever-increasing need for energy in  current societies to satisfy various requirements, scientists and researchers from different countries, such as Iran, have a basic approach in  their agenda to achieve renewable energies. The scientists believe that with regard to the limited fossil fuels and their environmental pollutions, renewable and clean energies can be the first alternative to generate energy. Our country, Iran, has numerous capabilities in  the field of generating new and renewable energies. This fact emphasizes the need for an optimum model to develop the use of renewable energies. in  line with this objective the costfunction is chosenas the objective function. Given the potential and limits ofrenewable energy (resources Limited), Consumptionof electricpowerin each of16regions (apply Limited) confidencelimits  of renewable energy (technical limitations), the model was designed and with use Robust optimization model was solved in  LINGO software.The optimum of using renewable energies suggests the 36.71% generation of small hydropower energy, 18.22% wind energy, 17.19% biomass energy, 13.43% geothermal energy, 12.53% tidal energy, and 1% solar energy.

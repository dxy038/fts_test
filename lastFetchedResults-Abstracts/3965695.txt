A bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDC) with a new CLLC-type resonant tank, which features zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for the input inverting choppers and zero-current switching (ZCS) for the output rectifier switches, regardless of the direction of the power flow, is proposed in this paper. Possessing the very optimal ZVS +ZCS soft-switching feature, this proposed converter will have a minimized switching loss if all of the main switches are implemented with metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, and thereby, the proposed converter is fully soft switched and totally snubberless. The detail operation principles, as well as the design considerations, are presented. The methodologies to develop a unidirectional ZVS+ZCS dc-dc converter for the corresponding pulsewidth modulation and frequency modulation converters are proposed. The approach on how to construct a fully soft-switched BDC has also been proposed and analyzed. Finally, a topology extension is made, and another fully soft-switched BDC is derived. A prototype, which interfaces the 400-48-V dc buses for the uninterrupted power supply system with a power rating of 500 VA, was developed to verify the validity and applicability of this proposed converter. The highest applicable conversion efficiencies for the bidirectional operational modes are exceeding 96%.

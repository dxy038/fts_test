This paper addresses the problem of stabilization of LTI systems via static output feedback (sof). The objective is not only to compute a stabilizing sof but rather to compute a discrete set of stabilizing sof. Two complementary mixed LMI/randomized algorithms are defined for this purpose. The main idea is to combine a particular relaxed LMI parametrization of stabilizing sof with high efficiency of Hit-and-Run method for generating random points in a given domain. Their respective relevance is analysed on several examples of the COMPl<sub>e</sub>ib library which is intended to be the reference library for evaluating performance of reduced-order controller synthesis algorithms. Finally, the paper additionally provides an extensive evaluation of the different relevant instances of the COMPl<sub>e</sub>ib library.

Introduction: Invasive diagnostic procedures such as coronary angiography, in most cases, are accompanied by stress and anxiety for patients. which may effect on hemodynamic signs.
Materials and Methods: This research, as a quasi experimental study, has the objective to determine the influence of applying methods of relaxation on hemodynamic signs in hospitalized 40 patients, cxperienciny coronary angiography (CA),, has been studied, in regard to existing conditions and methods of sampling and random allocation to two groups of control and relaxation at 2003 . Data collection tool included demographic and disease related information sheet, as well as record sheets for hemodynamic parameters at intervals of 8-12 and '/2 hrs before, during and after the angiograph y. For relaxation group, the researcher would speak individually about the influence of relaxation, the day before angiography;
Then with the aid of client himself/herself, performed relaxation instances in a single bout, and eventually asked client to perform relaxation technique 2-3 times before going for angiography. In control group was attended in the usual manner preangiographically. Hemodynamic parameters were measured in both groups 8-12 and '/2 hrs, before during and after CA. Afterward, resulted data were analyzed statistically by T-Test Chi-squre.
Results: With T--Test, respiratory rates1/2 hrs, beforeAngiography, diastolic blood pressure and Respiratory Rate after Angiography showed statisticaly significant difference between two groups (P<0.05). 0 ther hemodynamic parameters showed no statisticaly significant difference between two groups (P>0.05).but most of parameters showed clinically significant difference between two groups.
Conclusion: Therefore it is offered that relaxation method is applied after invasive procedures.

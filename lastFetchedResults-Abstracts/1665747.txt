In this paper, a new approach to estimate the optimal performance of an unknown proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) has been proposed. This proposed approach combines the Taguchi method and the numerical PEMFC model. Simulation results obtained using the Taguchi method help to determine the value of control factors that represent the tested unknown PEMFC. The objective of reducing both fuel consumption and operation cost can be achieved by determining the parameters for the unknown PEMFC. In addition, the optimal operation power for the tested unknown PEMFC can also be predicted. Experimental results on the test equipment show that the proposed approach is effective in optimal performance estimation for the tested unknown PEMFC, thus demonstrating the success achieved by combining the Taguchi method and the numerical PEMFC model.

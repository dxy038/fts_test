BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders in children. Nutritional deficiency may play a role in the etiology of this disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the nutritional status (dietary intake and anthropometric indices) of boys with and without ADHD. 
METHODS: This case-control study was conducted on 36 boys with ADHD (case group) and 37 normal children (control group), aged 6-12 years. The case subjects were assesssed by an expert psychiatrist via clinical evaluations and psychiatric questionnaires. Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of the subjects were measured. Dietary intake was recorded, using a three-day food record (three non-consecutive days including one holiday and two weekdays) and analyzed using Nutritionist IV software.
FINDINGS: The mean weight, height, and BMI values were higher in children with ADHD, compared to the control group (p < 0.05); the mean±SD of BMI was 17.28±2.44 in the case group and 15.14±2.34 in the control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in terms of energy, macronutrient, or micronutrient intake between the two groups. However, folate and selenium intake in the two groups was lower than the recommended dietary allowance.
CONCLUSION: The results showed no signifcant difference between the energy intake of children with ADHD and healthy boys. However, boys with ADHD were taller and heavier than healthy subjects, and their BMI was higher.

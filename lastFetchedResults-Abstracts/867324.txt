This research is concerned with development of an integrated VRP (vehicle routing problem) solver for multi-depot supply system based on an improved genetic algorithm and GUI-type programming. In this research, αwe proposed a three-step approach to convert a multi-supply center problem into single supply center problems so as to make easy to solve. In this research we have developed an integrated VRP model using heuristic method and the improved genetic algorithm, GA, of which operators and initial population are improved. Also we developed a graphical user interface (GUI-type) program, Dongeui GA-VRP solver, based on three-step approaches such as: (1) clustering module to transfer the multi-supply center problem into single supply center problems which are easier to be solved, (2) improved vehicle routing, VRP, module, and (3) GA-TSP module. The objective of this problem is to minimize the logistic cost for a set of customers without being tardy or exceeding the travel time and the capacity of the vehicles. For the user’s conveniences, we have shown the sample results compared with those of existing methods. By the example problem, the proposed model is known to be potentially useful in solving the distribution routing problems.

When distributed power is connected to distribution network, it will produce all kinds of influence on distribution network. So we need to optimize all kinds of distributed power that access the distribution network. Mathematical model which contains the distributed power distribution network expansion planning is presented in this paper, takeing construction and maintenance cost minimum as objective function and applying binary coding quantum particle swarm algorithm to optimize type, location and capacity of distributed power and new or upgraded lines. To solve a large number of infeasible solutions of which is caused by distribution network planning, the related literatures are referred to repair infeasible solution, isolated chain and ring, converts the non-radial network to radial network. The example analysis shows that the planning schemes of power distribution network planning are more diversity and robustness.

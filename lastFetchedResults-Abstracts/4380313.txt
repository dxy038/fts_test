This letter proposes a full optimizer framework (IMoMIR framework) for designing photonic crystal waveguide (PCW). In this framework, three main issues of PCWs operation [group index, bandwidth, and group velocity dispersion (GVD)] are considered and optimized simultaneously. In other words, multi-objective optimization is performed to maximize the group index and bandwidth, while minimizing the |GVD|. Since these three objectives are in conflict, the proposed framework finds the specific designs with considering all objectives, the so-called Pareto-optimal solutions. In addition, the band-mixing phenomenon is avoided during the optimization process. The merits of the proposed framework is demonstrated by designing an oval-shaped-hole PCW. The results show that the IMoMIR framework is able to determine a diverse range of PCWs that completely outperform the current PCW structure in the literature.

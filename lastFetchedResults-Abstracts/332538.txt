Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate changes in proximal contact tightness up to 6 months after the restorative treatment.
Materials and methods

In a randomised clinical trial Class II composite resin restorations were placed in 52 patients. Proximal contact tightness was measured before, directly after, and 6 months after treatment. These data were analysed statistically using linear regression and t-tests.
Results

Proximal contacts, that increased in tightness as result of the treatment tend to loose tightness after a 6-months period but remain tighter than before treatment. Proximal contacts, that decreased after treatment hardly change after 6 months.
Conclusions

A change in contact tightness after restorative treatment will not always remain stable over time.

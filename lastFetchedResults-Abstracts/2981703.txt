A model based on information theory, which allows technology managers to choose the optimal strategies for yield management in the semiconductor industry, is presented. The knowledge extraction rate per experimentation cycle and knowledge extraction rate per unit time serve as benchmarking metrics for yield learning. They enable managers to make objective comparisons of apparently unrelated technologies. Combinations of four yield analysis tools-electrical testing, automatic defect classification, spatial signature analysis and wafer position analysis-are examined in detail to determine an optimal yield management strategy for both the R&amp;D and volume production environments

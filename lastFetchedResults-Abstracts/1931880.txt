The objective of the present experiment was to determine whether failure to become pregnant through out-of-season reproductive management regimes is attributable to a failure to stimulate normal corpora lutea (CL) production. Romney ewes and East Friesian Composite (EF) ewes were mated in summer, autumn, winter, and early and late spring after administration of intravaginal progesterone inserts (plus eCG in spring and summer) in a factorial (two breeds × five mating periods) experimental design. Oestrus rate was determined from mating data, and the numbers of CL were determined by laparoscopy 9 days after ram introduction. Conception rate, pregnancy rate and litter size were determined by transabdominal ultrasonography 62 days after ram introduction.

tions of ewes displaying oestrus did not differ significantly (75–100%) between seasons or breeds, except for the Romney ewes in summer (67%; P &lt; 0.05). Numbers of CL on Day 9 for EF ewes was lowest in autumn (1.5) and winter (1.5), and highest in late spring (2.1; P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, Romney ewes had the lowest CL count in summer (1.3), and the highest in autumn (1.8) and winter (1.6; P &lt; 0.05). Only in summer was there a difference between breeds (EF 1.8; Romney 1.3; P &lt; 0.01). The proportion of ewes that failed to conceive despite having one or more CL present was highest in late spring (EF 41%, Romney 43%), and lowest in autumn (EF 9%, Romney 4%) and winter (EF 14%, Romney 4%; P &lt; 0.05). Conception and pregnancy rates followed similar patterns with values for autumn (EF 91%, 91%; Romney 96%, 96%) and June (EF 86%, 82%; Romney 91%, 83%) being significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than in early (EF 50%, 40%; Romney 54%, 50%) and late spring (EF 44%, 36%; Romney 42%, 36%). Pregnancy rate in summer was higher for EF ewes (60%) than for Romney ewes (39%) but conception rates were not statistically different (EF 68%; Romney 60%). Numbers of foetuses identified at scanning was highest in autumn (1.5) and lowest in late spring (0.5 P &lt; 0.001): Litter size in pregnant EF ewes was highest in early spring and lowest in winter (1.8 versus 1.2; P &lt; 0.01), but for pregnant Romney ewes was highest in winter and lowest in early spring (1.9 versus 1.3; P &lt; 0.001).

 concluded that seasonal differences in the ability of ewes to conceive are not the consequence of failure to display oestrus or to ovulate, but probably are a result of failure of fertilisation or the establishment of pregnancy.

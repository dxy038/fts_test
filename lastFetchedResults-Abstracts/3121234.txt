On the basis of rough sets, by considering both the dynamic characteristics of the set x and the statistics information in the knowledge database, this paper constructs bidirectional probabilistic PS-rough sets model in probabilistic approximation space, discusses property and theorems of PS-rough sets, proves that PS-rough sets is the further extension of S-rough sets and Z.Pawlak rough sets, S-rough sets and Z.Pawlak rough sets is the special case of PS-rough sets. Comparing with S-rough sets, the approximation quality of the dynamic set X* in PS-Rough Sets is relatively increased and then the decision accuracy is improved. Finally, the efficiency of PS-rough sets is shown by an example.

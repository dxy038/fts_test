Requirement engineering is one of the most critical system engineering processes, particularly when it deals with the safety requirements which are non-functional requirements and are related to emergent system properties. In fact, safety requirements must be formulated at system level and then be derived at sub-system level. The main objective of this paper is to present a new tool, &#8220;SafetyLab&#8221;, which implements a method for safety treatment of complex systems. The method allows the definition of the system safety requirements following a risk and hazard analysis, and then their derivation according to a top-down approach. It is based on the famous Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and the use of Fault Trees.

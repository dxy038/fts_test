Background: The male factor contributes to more than 50% of the infertility cases. Studies have shown that a variety of mechanisms are involved in male infertility, though a few of them have been identified till now.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the testicular histopathology of men with non-obstructive azoospermia referred to infertility center of Shariati hospital. 
Methods: This experimental study was conducted on 50 testicular tissue samples of men with non-obstructive azoospermia who were candidates for assisted reproductive procedures referred to Shariati hospital in 2012. Paraffin blocks were prepared from the testicular tissue biopsy and the sections were stained in hematoxylin and eosin. 
Finding: 16% of the samples were classified as hypospermatogenesis; 48% were classified as spermatocytic arrest; 18% were classified as Sertoli cell only; and 18% were classified as tubular fibrosis.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, future studies would focus on reasons of germ cell cycle arrest in men with non-obstructive azoospermia and setting up the related diagnostic genetic tests.

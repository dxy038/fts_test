Nowadays, the information technology outsourcing is having a fast growth worldwide. However, according to recent studies, 20 to 25 percent of large IT acquisition projects fail within two years and 50 percent fail within five years. CMMI-ACQ is a model that provides guidance to organizations on the acquisition of software products and related services. This paper addresses an implementation sequence of the processes areas at maturity level 2. To achieve this objective, graphs theory is used to represent the existing dependencies among CMMI-ACQ processes areas, in order to find strongly connected cluster and cyclic processes areas. These clusters using formal criteria have helped to determine the implementation sequences of the acquisition processes areas at maturity level 2.

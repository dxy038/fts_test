Considering the importance of government investment in poverty alleviation.
the main objective of this study is to examine the direct and indirect impacts
of some of these investments on poverty alleviation and total growth of
productivity in rural areas of Iran. To do this, an equation system was used
which includes the effective factors on poverty and productivity growth.
Based on the results, rural poverty is more elastic to investment in rural
development and construction than other government investments, but
investment in this context has no impact on the growth of total productivity.
Investment in road construction is effective on rural poverty and ranked
second in this respect. The next rank belongs to investment in agricultural
research and its impact on the growth of total productivity is positive.
According to the results, the impacts of various government development
investments on rural poverty are direct, and their indirect impacts are
limited

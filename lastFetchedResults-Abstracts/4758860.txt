Radar backscattering response has the potential of retrieving desired snow parameters, such as snow water equivalence, snow depth, liquid water content which are important factors in hydrological investigation. The objective of this study is to develop an algorithm which can decompose the scattering of wet snow and also develop new description of surface scattering. There are two scattering sources - the volume scattering component from snow pack and the air-snow surface scattering component - for radar backscattering while observing wet snow. Depending upon which scattering component is dominant and then controls the response to snow wetness, an algorithm can be developed to quantitatively describe the relationship between this two scattering sources and snow wetness. We have established a model - simulated at C-band <sub>a</sub>ta-base by using two scattering components. The database covers the most possible wet snow physical properties and surface roughness conditions. Using this data-base, an inversion algorithm can be developed for using C-band multi-polarization measurements. The newly developed algorithm mainly involved two steps: 1) decomposes the surface and volume scattering signals, and 2) then use each scattering component to estimate snow wetness

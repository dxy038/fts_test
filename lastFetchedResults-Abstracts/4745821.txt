The mobile telecom industry has been able to specify what is required for monitoring and measuring quality of service (QoS) which means specifying the level of quality which should be provided for a service. By service, the paper refers to the mobile network´s service level not service connotations like customer care, sales support, repair time, provisioning, etc. Here, QoS specifically refers to services that are like those offered by 3G networks, e.g., MMS, picture and video messaging, video streaming, video downloads, etc. Conventional packet services like E-mail and Web browsing are also referred to. It is forecast that, in about a year´s time, vendors and operators of mobile networks will firmly establish the exact network parameters that are essential to classify and measure quality of service. These parameters, as we understand today, will be derived mostly from the IP environment; packet loss, maximum packet discard rate, reliability and throughput being some of them. The objective of the paper is to introduce and develop a QoS concept that caters to the customer´s demand rather than the service demand. Examples are provided on how to set up such QoS profiles. The QoS profiles can be termed MyQoS, personalised QoS or QoSS (quality of service to subscriber).

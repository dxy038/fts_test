The aim of the present work is to provide a reliable decision-making tool to enterprise managers that helps them to understand the available acquired competence resources network and to take the right decision to promote and ameliorate this network. For that purpose, a novel competence evaluation approach based on a fuzzy linguistic information model, named the 2-tuple linguistic representation model, is presented. It has been developed in order to obtain an objective evaluation generated by a group of experts with heterogeneous opinions. It has the advantage to overcome the loss and the distortion of information and then to offer conclusive information about each acquired competence level. To illustrate the different steps of the proposed approach, a didactic example is described. The found results allow a suitable comparison between competence resources levels that may help enterprise managers in making the right decisions when selecting and/or assigning the operators.

Objective: Lipid metabolism is involved in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer’sdisease (LOAD). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a multifunctional enzyme that plays amajor role in lipid metabolism; its abnormal function seems to be related, either directly
or indirectly,
to the pathogenesis of many diseases such as atherosclerosis,coronary
artery disease (CAD) and Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) . HindIII polymorphismis
a common LPL
genetic variant shown to increase the risk of LOAD. The
presentresearch
investigates
whether
this
polymorphism
is
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
ofIranian
LOAD patients.
Materials and Methods: In this case control study ,allele and genotype frequencies for the HindIII polymorphism of the LPL gene in 100 patients affected with LOAD and 100 healthy controls were determined by reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and compared using the chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests.
Results: LPL H+H+ genotype frequency in LOAD patients was 58%, which was significantly
higher
than
controls
(44%).
There
was
a
1.75-fold
increased
risk
for
thedevelopment
of LOAD in carriers of the H+H+ genotype compared to non-carriers(OR=1.75;
95%CI:
1.00-3.07;
p=0.048).

When
adjusted
for
sex,
the
H+H+
genotypewas
more frequent in patients than controls; this difference
was more remarkable inmales
(OR:
1.90;
95%
CI:
1.08–3.34;
p=0.024).
The
mean
age
of
disease
onset
didnot
differ
in patients with the LPL
H+H+ genotype compared to unaffected
individuals.
Conclusion: This study confirms the association between the H+H+ genotype with LOAD and supports the correlation of this genotype of the LPL gene with risk of developing LOAD in Iranian patients with AD.

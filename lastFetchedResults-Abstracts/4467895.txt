The Interline Power Flow Controller (IPFC) is a voltage-source-converter (VSC)-based flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) controller for series compensation in a multiline transmission system of a substation. The common DC link in the IPFC configuration enables each inverter to transfer real power to another, so regulation of DC link voltage is an important issue in overall performance of the system. In this paper, a new method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is presented to regulate DC link voltage. In this method, GA and system objective function are adopted to choose best PI parameters for the linear controller of DC link of IPFC. Simulation results in Matlab/Simulink verifies the effectiveness of optimized choose of PI controller parameters which are chosen in a try and error manner conventionally.

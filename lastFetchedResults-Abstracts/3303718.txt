Thanks to rapid development of Virtual Reality technologies, the research is not only limited in military training and scientific visualization realm, it has been expanded into more multidisciplinary areas, such as education, archaeology, conservation of culture heritage, etc. Many heritage objects can be found in museum, among them, historical mock-up represents a city with its precious historical value. The objective of this paper is not only to propose a prototype of future interface that uses VR technology in visualizing and interacting with 3D mockups, but also to provide a tool for decision-making aid, which helps to select proper interface depending on the content we desire to display. Our proposals exploit a variety of State of the Art, and raise a concept named multi-dimension model based interface, which can be applied to multiple VR applications, gives more information than a simple history book, explains to user the real cultural value in a virtual environment.

Objective
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of five primers (two sulfur, one phosphate, and two sulfur–phosphate dual-function primers) on the bond strength between a self-curing luting agent and gold–copper–silver (Au–Cu–Ag) alloy.
Methods

The primers used were two sulfur primers (V-Primer and Metaltite), one phosphate primer (Epricord), and two primers which contained a sulfur monomer and a phosphate monomer (Alloy Primer and Metaltite/Epricord). The surface of Au–Cu–Ag specimens were blasted with alumina, and then bonded with acrylic rods using a tri-n-butylborane-initiated self-curing luting agent. Shear bond strengths were determined after 5000 thermocycles. An additional alumina-blasted Au–Cu–Ag alloy specimen was subjected to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.
Results

The maximum shear bond strengths were obtained with Metaltite/Epricord (29.6 ± 2.3 MPa) and Alloy Primer (23.0 ± 1.6 MPa), followed by Metaltite (10.3 ± 4.2 MPa), V-Primer (8.9 ± 0.6 MPa), Epricord (6.4 ± 1.5 MPa), and No primer control (2.0 ± 0.5 MPa). The XPS analysis detected six chemical elements (Au, Cu, Ag, Al, O, and C) on the Au–Cu–Ag alloy. In addition to pure Au element, the metal oxide-states of Ag2O, AgO, Cu2O, and CuO were suggested.
Conclusion

The combined use of a sulfur monomer and a phosphate monomer significantly improved the bond strength of resin to Au–Cu–Ag alloy which should be especially significant to clinicians.

The present work is an attempt to explain the manifestation of Spirit in
history and development of consciousness and achievement of freedom in
Hegel's philosophical one, as the most comprehensive philosophical system.
Therefore, the narration of this development and the presentation of this kind
have no choice except to regard Hegel's "Encyclopedia of philosophical
science" as the stand points of this manifestation and degrees of that
development, if it has decided to attain the Truth and represent the
preciseness of Hegel's system. In this Article, at the beginning, we will take
"Spirit" or "consciousness" into consideration as a subjective affair that is
concerned to analgzing of categories of thought in the form of Logic and
following the absolute. But because of limitations of subjective world and
tendency of consciousness to the objective world, it changes its way into
objective affair in "Nature", and in "philosophy of Spirit" it finally attain his
satisfaction of soul and identity of subject and object that is climax of
consciousness and freedom.

This paper describes the application of a new regulation technique to a resonant converter that features zero-voltage (ZV) and zero-current (ZC) switching and works at constant frequency and duty cycle. The regulator utilizes the concept of regulating only a percentage of the total power in a bidirectional manner, thus allowing the converter to be optimized for both mass and efficiency. The proposed regulation technique has a wide range of applicability to almost all types of power converters or inverters that utilize a transformer to produce an isolated output. By using the concept of addition or subtraction of AC voltages, a fully regulated output voltage is achieved. The resultant effect of this regulation technique is that the main transformer of the converter or inverter appears to have a variable turns ratio. This turns ratio can be changed dynamically and in almost a lossless way to maintain the converter (or inverter) regulation. This technique can be used most effectively when input-voltage variation is limited to a reasonable tolerance range (e.g., + or -25%)

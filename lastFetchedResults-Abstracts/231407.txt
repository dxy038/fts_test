With the sustained development in computer technology, the use of more powerful computational tools becomes mandatory. The challenge today is to revisit safety features of the existing nuclear research reactors using new generation of computer tools. The objective is to verify that the safety requirements still met and when necessary to introduce some amendments coming from the new attainments. In the current paper the IAEA safety-related nuclear research reactors (RR) benchmark problem is reconsidered. The idea consists in performing static calculations of the benchmark using the last version of the MCNP5 code. This later offers updated code models and cross-section library. The results are afterwards compared with previous calculations and discussed.

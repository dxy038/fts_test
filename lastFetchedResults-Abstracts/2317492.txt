Utilizing an airfoil Parameterization method is one of the essential requirements for airfoils optimization. The selection of this method plays an important role, as using an unsuitable method yields the weak results. In addition, it will impose delay on convergence of the solution. Hence, in this work, an improved Harmony Search meta-heuristic optimization algorithm has been developed for investigating three common airfoil parameterization methods (Bezier curves, Parces method and 4-digit-NACA formula) using an inverse optimization design and a non-aerodynamics objective function. The obtained results show that the Bezier curves and Parces method are more efficient than 4-digit-NACA formula. Finally, because of having few control parameters, the Parces method has been used along with an improved Harmony Search algorithm for the shape optimization of an airfoil under a viscose and turbulent flow, with the objective of maximizing lift to drag ratio. To do this, 2-dimentional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with Spalart-Allmaras turbulent method have been solved around the airfoil. The results reveal that the improved optimization algorithm is highly capable of evaluating the airfoil parameterization methods and aerodynamics optimization.

Vocal fold functionality may alter in response to direct radiotherapy or indirectly by perturbation of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis. Perceptual assessment of voice quality is difficult to summarise in a single, reliable figure of normality and normality itself is undefined. In this study spectral analysis of vocal fold vibration, based on impedance variations measured across the larynx using an electro-glottogram, is used to build a single parameter description of standard vowel phonation in the normal male population. Patient data and perceptual assessment are then compared to this standard. The spectral pattern of the vowel/i/ electro-glottogram time series is analysed using approximate entropy after dynamic fundamental-harmonic frequency normalisation. The approximate entropy provides a single estimate of the spectral pattern complexity. A cohort of 89 normal males formed two statistically distinct groups, G1, with strong spectral pattern and high complexity 0.338 (±0.036), and G2 with a weak spectral pattern and low complexity 0.175 (±0.049). Membership ratio G1:G2 was 2:1. A cohort of 30 male larynx cancer cases were analysed approximately 3–6 months after irradiation, and three male prophylactic cranial irradiation cases some years after treatment. Two-thirds of patients had G2 or lower levels of complexity. The lower G2 complexity level appears to be the subjective, as well as the objective, threshold for voice normality.

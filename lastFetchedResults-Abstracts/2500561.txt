<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong><em>Escherichia coli </em>O157:H7, an emerging pathogen, causes severe enteritis and the extraintestinal complication of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The goal of this study was to evaluate the conjugate of <em>E. coli </em>O157: H7 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with diphtheria toxoid (DT) as a candidate vaccine in mice model.<br /><strong>Material and Methods: </strong>LPS from <em>E. coli </em>O157:H7 was extracted by hot phenol method and then detoxified. Purified LPS was coupled to DT with adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) as a spacer and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDAC) as a linker. The coupling molar ratio of LPS to DT was 3:1. Clinical evaluation of <em>E. coli </em>O157:H7 LPS-DT conjugate was also performed.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>The conjugate was devoid of endotoxin activity and indicated 0.125 U/ml of D-LPS. Mice immunization with D-LPS DT conjugate elicited fourfold higher IgG antibody in comparison to D-LPS. Also, in vivo protection of mice with conjugate provided high protection against the LD50 of <em>E. coli </em>O157:H7, which indicated a good correlation with the IgG titer.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Our results showed that the suggested vaccine composed of <em>E. coli </em>O157:H7 LPS and DT had a significant potential to protect against <em>E. coli </em>infections.</p>

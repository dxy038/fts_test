Controlling the loop flow phenomena is very important issue in the de-regulated power systems. It should be solved very efficiently. We have formulated the loop flow problem in fuzzy environment, as a multi-objective function using fuzzy set theory and fuzzy decision making. Then the resulted single objected optimization problem is solved using differential evolution which is one of the evolutionary search methods. We applied our method to IEEE 30 bus test system and presented the results.

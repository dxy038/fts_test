Cost of reliability of optimal distribution system planning is considered. The reliability cost model has been derived as a linear function of line flows for evaluating the outages. The objective is to minimise the total cost including the outage cost, feeder resistive loss, and fixed investment cost. Evolutionary programming was used to solve the very complicated mixed-integer, highly nonlinear and nondifferential problem. A real distribution network was modelled as the sample system for tests. There is also a higher opportunity to obtain the global optimum during the EP process

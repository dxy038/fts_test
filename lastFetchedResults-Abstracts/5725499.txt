One of the principal characteristics of the modern grid identified by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in its 2007 report to the US Department of Energy is &#8220;self healing&#8221;. That is, &#8220;The modern grid will perform continuous self-assessments to detect, analyze, respond to, and as needed, restore grid components or network sections&#8221;. (Reference: &#8220;The NETL Modern Grid Initiative - Powering our 21st-Century Economy - Modern Grid Benefits&#8221;; National Energy Technology Laboratory; August 2007.). Distribution Automation (DA) is able to assist in achieving this objective through the use of computer and communication technology, advanced software, and remotely operable high voltage switchgear. The Fault Location Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR) application can improve reliability dramatically without compromising safety and asset protection. This article briefly describes the FLISR function, provides information on the major trends of the day and issues that need to be resolved, and suggests where the industry should go from here..

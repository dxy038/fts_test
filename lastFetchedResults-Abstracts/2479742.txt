Objective (s): Embryo donation is one of the new technologies, which in recent decades has been used for the treatment of infertile couples. However, its usage, like other new biotechnology methods has made some ethical concerns. Since compatibility of such improvements with ethical standards against the misuse of new technologies should be guaranteed, the present study was designed to determine the ethics of embryo donation. 
Methods: This was a descriptive study of quality of services provided in 11 embryo donation infertility centers. Data were collected by interviews including 100 couples seeking embryo donation in the Tehran central forensic center. Also the embryo donation instructions of these centers were collected. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Results: In more than 50%, brief information on different aspects of embryo donation process had been given to applicants and in 80%, the necessity of legal or jurisprudence expert advices had not been provided. In 64%, the applicants-embryo compatibility issues had not been studied. In 76%, the embryo donation process had been described strictly confidential and in 28%, there was a conflict of interests between doctor and patient in infertility centers selection. There were no restrictions or priority in service providing and in most cases the donated embryo health was not guaranteed. 
Conclusion: In most cases, ethics such as autonomy, justice, beneficence is met.

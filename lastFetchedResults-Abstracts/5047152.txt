Some problems of computer network design (for example, the problem of connections between workstations of the computer network) are reduced to solving of the optimization problems on graphs under uncertainty. If the parameters of the problem are not known exactly then their uncertainty may be described by intervals. In this case, we deal with an interval objective function and can not compare solutions by the usual way - accordingly to the values of real numbers. The authors introduce a new criterion for the comparison of solutions.

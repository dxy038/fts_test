The objective of the paper is to describe an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; mechanism proposed for the task of document classification in a complex organization as a part of the so-called &#8220;Contextual Communication&#8221;, module developed in the ESPRIT III Project no. 8749 entitled ORCHESTRA. The task carried out by this system is similar to that carried out in a Post Office: classification and distribution. We focus on a module that realizes tasks of determination of addressees when the information of the document is insufficiently explicit. We describe the sub module called &#8220;generic contexts&#8221; within the classification module in charge of this task

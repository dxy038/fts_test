Objective (s): To determine the pattern of incidence and survival rates of cancers in elderly adult in the period of five years to obligate the screening and therapeutic aged care services to old people.
Methods: This is a historical cohort study based on the data analysis years (2001 to 2005) and cancer registries reporting survival rates for these cancers in people aged 60 years and older. Collecting data was through observation and data gathering Cancer Research Center, Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. The inclusion criteria were cancer patients 60+ years registered through the annual reports of cancer cases and survival patients followed. To compare the survival and separation of sex Kaplan Meier coax method was used. The death and death of the relative risks of various cancers were calculated by regression model.
Results: Based on data 33.5% of women surveyed aged 60 years and older and 66.5% were elderly men. The mean age was 71.2 years. Mean survival in this study was 88.2 years. The highest incidence of skin cancer was 5 years old. The geographical distribution of incidence was bladder cancer among elderly in Kermanshah province. Yazd province was the highest prevalence of common cancers in elderly. The average of five-year survival in Lorestan province was the highest and the Ardabil province had the lowest. The relationships between sex and death from cancers were (0.84 to 0.95), and the relationships between the relative risks of death from cancers (1.03 to 1.09) which were significant.
Conclusion: The risks of cancer death among nine provinces were varied comparision to Tehran metropolitan. In oderwords survival rate of cancers in the nine provinces significantly were less than Tehran province.

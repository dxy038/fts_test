Objective: To examine whether left atrioventricular plane displacement (AVPD) at rest was related to severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Design and patients: Global and regional left AVPD was evaluated by echocardiography in 159 consecutive patients with significant stenoses at coronary angiography and in 15 age-matched healthy controls. The setting was the University hospital with a primary catchment area of 250 000 inhabitants. Results: Mean AVPD in controls, patients with one-, two-, and three-vessel disease was 13.5±1.1, 12.4±1.5, 11.3±2.2 and 10.9±2.1 mm, respectively (P<0.0001). Similar significant differences were found both in those with (n=69) and without (n=90) a diagnosis of prior myocardial infarction. Regional AVPD did not correspond to the localization of infarction or coronary atherosclerosis. Conclusion: Irrespective of a diagnosis of prior myocardial infarction, left AVPD was related to the degree and extent of coronary artery disease. It was significantly decreased compared to controls in patients with one-vessel disease, and was further decreased with increasing extent of coronary atherosclerosis. Determination of regional left AVPD could not be used to identify regions perfused by stenotic coronary arteries or regions affected by prior myocardial infarction.

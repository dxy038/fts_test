The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) on Listeria monocytogenes inoculated onto disposable food containers including disposable plastic trays, aluminum foil, and paper cups. The parameters considered in APP processing were input power (75, 100, 125, and 150 W) and exposure time (60, 90, and 120 s). The bacterial reduction in the disposable plastic trays, aluminum foil, and paper cups was associated with increased input power and exposure time of APP. The D10 values were calculated as 49.3, 47.7, 36.2, and 17.9 s in disposable plastic trays, 133, 111, 76.9, and 31.6 s in aluminum foil and 526, 65.8, 51.8, and 41.7 s in paper cups at 75, 100, 125, and 150 W of input power, respectively. There were no viable cells detected after 90 and 120 s of APP treatment at 150 W in disposable plastic trays. However, only three decimal reductions of viable cells were achieved in aluminum foil and paper cups at 150 W for 120 s. These results demonstrate that APP treatment is effective for inactivation of L. monocytogenes and applicable for disposable food containers. However, the type of material is crucial and appropriate treatment conditions should be considered for achieving satisfactory inactivation level.

A dynamic pulsewidth modulator (DPM) is synthesized to generate a PWM (pulsewidth modulated) signal from dynamic converter variables and from a (quasi-)static control signal. Based on a pragmatic principle with simple hardware implementation, the DPM can be functionally integrated with a PWM converter to broaden the converter power bandwidth, enhancing the converterÂ´s ability to meet stringent dynamic specifications. Even if bandwidth broadening is not the prime objective, the smaller phase shift associated with the broader bandwidth simplifies the design of the regulation loop. The DPM principle can also linearize the large-signal behavior of a nonlinear converter. The theory is demonstrated and verified for a buck converter, whose PWM bandwidth is extended from 1/50 of the switching frequency to about 1/3 of the switching frequency.

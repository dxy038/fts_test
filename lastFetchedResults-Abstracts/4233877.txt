To solve the power system multi-objective reactive power optimization problem better, the shortcomings of the current multi-objective reactive power optimization were analyzed. The vector evaluated adaptive immune particle swarm optimization (VEAIPSO) algorithm based on evaluation vector is applied to multi-objective reactive power optimization in this paper which provides an effective method for solving the problem. Some conventional running models of reactive power optimization were analyzed. The improvement of the system static voltage stability margin was used as the one of the optimized objectives, and the minimum Jacobian matrix eigenvalue of the convergence trend was used as a voltage static stability scale. The multi-objective reactive power optimization model was established, its objective function contains reducing network power loss, improving the load node voltage level and increasing the static voltage stability margin. The operation simulation in this paper was done by simulation software MATLAB.

This paper deals with the design and implementation of a discrete dynamic control system using multi-objective dynamic programming. A discrete dynamic system along with the constraints regarding the values of the systemÂ´s state (output) and the applicable control input has been introduced. Using multi-objective dynamic programming, a control system has been designed which minimizes two objectives while satisfying introduced constraints. The implemented control solution is explained. Experiments have been performed to test the quality of the implemented solution. A single-objective version of the control problem has been tested to provide reference for analysis regarding the quality of the implemented multi-objective control solution. The comparison of the obtained experimental results confirms the effectiveness of the proposed control solution and demonstrates the benefits of the multi-objective approach.

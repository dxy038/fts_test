This paper proposes a novel 3-D space vector modulation scheme for three-level three-leg neutral point clamped converter used in the three-phase four-wire active power filter towards the performance optimization among load harmonic current compensation, mid-point voltage balancing, and Suppression of switching loss increase. Optimization functions for different objectives are analyzed based on the detailed state space equations of the system. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization process is presented to show how the compensation for the load harmonic current, mid-point balancing control, and switching losses reduction can be optimized based on the solution space of linear equations. Lastly, the simulation and experimental results are given for verification purpose.

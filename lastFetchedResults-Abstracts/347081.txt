Objective: Phase coupling between EEG channel pairs in various frequency bands was evaluated during propofol anesthetic induction and recovery periods.
Methods: Twenty-three patients participated in the study. Phase synchronization indices based on the Hilbert transform were investigated on frequency bands 0.05–1 Hz, 1–4 Hz, 4–8 Hz, 8–12 Hz and 12–16 Hz for all pairs of the 9 EEG channels covering midline and frontal areas. A straight line was used to approximate the index values as a function of time and the Sign Test statistics were applied to the slope parameters.
Results: Systematic phase synchronization changes were detected. Generally, phase synchronization in the sub-delta band decreased during the induction and increased during the recovery, while the directions were reversed in the alpha band. The changes were dependent on the channel pair. In the delta, theta and beta bands, the changes were aligned more irregularly than in the sub-delta or in the alpha bands. Highly asymmetric behavior between the induction and the recovery periods was also observed in these bands.
Conclusions: Induction and recovery from propofol anesthesia changes the phase synchronization between the EEG channels. The passband and location-specific behavior of these changes reveals the effects of the anesthetic to the different neural mechanisms.

Objective
jective of this study was to determine the effects of induced periapical abscesses on pregnant rats.

 of the animals (n = 16), the pulps of the maxillary right molars were exposed to the oral environment, which resulted in a periapical abscess. The other 1/2 (n = 16) were sham-operated. 1/2 of the animals of both groups became pregnant 2 weeks later. The pregnancy duration, and weight and number of pups were assessed at delivery. Serum, liver and uterine horn samples were taken from all animals at euthanasia and serum IL-6, endothelin-1, TNF-α, IL-10, cortisol and insulin were determined by ELISA. Liver concentrations of IL-6, CRP and IL-6 and uterine horn concentrations of IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TNF-α, IL-10 and IL-1-β were assessed by ELISA. Blood glucose concentrations were determined using a glucometer. Outcome variables were compared by factorial ANOVA, a post hoc Tukey test, and Pearson’s correlation test.
s
nt rats with periapical abscesses had a significantly longer pregnancy and delivered pups with a significantly higher birthweight (p &lt; 0.05). They had significantly higher concentrations of IL-6, VEGF, IL-1-β, and IL-10 within the uterine horn and IL-6, CRP and TNF-α within the liver (p &lt; 0.01). Blood glucose and serum TNF-α, IL-6, endothelin-1, IL-10, and insulin concentrations were significantly higher in the pregnant animals with pulpal abscesses (p &lt; 0.01).
sion
gnificant increase in serum TNF-α, taken together with significant increases in blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations, suggest that animals with induced periapical abscesses developed insulin resistance, which significantly affected their pregnancy outcomes.

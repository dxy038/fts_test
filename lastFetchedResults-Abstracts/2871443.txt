In this paper, we propose Threshold sensitive Energy Efficient Cluster Heads based on Maximum Energy (TEECHME) routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The main objective of this technique is to improve lifetime and stability period of network by applying threshold limitations on nodes deployed in static clusters. In our propose scheme, nodes with maximum energy become CHs of their regions. In TEECH-ME, we use threshold sensitivity parameters in network operation that limit the transmissions of whole network. We also apply Uniform Random Model to find out the drooped packets to make our protocol more practical. Simulation results show that our technique is 40% better than REECH-ME in terms of network lifetime.

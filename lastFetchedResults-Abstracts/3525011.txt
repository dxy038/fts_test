The need for high quality electron optical systems for small size color camera has remarkedly increased since the advent of compact VTRs. A new magnetic-focus static-deflection system has been developed under a program of exploration of possibilities of designing vidicon tubes. The objective is to make a focusing and deflection system which will have high quality electron optical characteristics with simple construction and require low power consumption. The main characteristics required are small focus spot size, scan linearity and normal beam landing. The beam landing angle affects shading, resolution, lag and flicker of camera tubes which employ low-velocity electron beam [1]. The normal beam landing performance is essential especially for a single tube color camera system in order to read out coded color signals with accuracy.

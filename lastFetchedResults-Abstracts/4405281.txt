This paper states a methodology in order to manage the saturation of the propulsion system providing flexibility to the vehicle control unit. To reach this objective a n-copter propeller system is described and a general dispatching law without constrains is found. Furthermore, an optimal propeller problem is proposed and a possible solution using a recursive least squares method is presented.

We propose a new computer package, PACFOTON I, with educational objective, that analysis the light behavior through the devices gates and analysis of solitons pulses using the 4&#176; order Runge-Kutta method. In this first CAD is showed an analysis of solitons pulses and, some electro-optic devices like directional coupler and intensity modulators

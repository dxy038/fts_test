The main objective of this work is the study of the influence of temperature on the stability of the uranyl peroxide tetrahydrate (UO2O2 · 4H2O) studtite, which may form on the spent nuclear fuel surface as a secondary solid phase. Preliminary results on the synthesis of studtite in the laboratory at different temperatures have shown that the solid phases formed when mixing hydrogen peroxide and uranyl nitrate depends on temperature. Studtite is obtained at 298 K, meta-studtite (UO2O2 · 2H2O) at 373 K, and meta-schoepite (UO3 · nH2O, with n &lt; 2) at 423 K. Because of the temperature effect on the stability of uranyl peroxides, a thermogravimetric (TG) study of studtite has been performed. The main results obtained are that three transformations occur depending on temperature. At 403 K, studtite transforms to meta-studtite, at 504 K, meta-studtite transforms to meta-schoepite, and, finally, at 840 K, meta-schoepite transforms to U3O8. By means of the differential scanning calorimetry the molar enthalpies of the transformations occurring at 403 and 504 K have been determined to be −42 ± 10 and −46 ± 2 kJ mol−1, respectively.

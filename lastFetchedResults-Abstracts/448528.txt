PURPOE: To tet the ability of a new type of multifocal objective perimetry to identify glaucomatou viual field defect.
METHOD: A multichannel viual evoked potential wa recorded uing the ObjectiViion Accumap perimeter. One hundred patient (age, 62.2 ± 9.8 year, mean MD −6.5 ± 4.17 dB) with open-angle glaucoma and confirmed glaucomatou viual field defect were teted and compared with the normal databae of 100 normal ubject (age, 58.9 ± 10.7 year). Both eye were teted, but for determining enitivity the eye with the leer field defect wa choen if both qualified. The amplitude and intereye aymmetry coefficient for each zone of the field were calculated. A mean amplitude and multifocal objective perimetry everity index wa calculated for each ubject.
REULT: In 95 of 100 (95%) patient with glaucoma Humphrey field defect were correlated with viual evoked potential amplitude reduction identifying a cluter of three or more abnormal zone. In two of five remaining patient with glaucoma the defect wa detected on the intereye aymmetry analyi. Topographic location wa well correlated with Humphrey field. Mean amplitude wa ignificantly reduced in 86 of the glaucoma cae (86%). The glaucoma everity index wa abnormal in 93 glaucoma cae and howed a correlation with Humphrey MD (r = 0.67 right eye, 0.69 left eye). In 37 glaucoma cae with no cotoma by definition in the fellow eye, 22 (59.4%) had an abnormal multifocal objective perimetry, wherea only eight had ome other apect of their Humphrey viual field flagged a abnormal.
CONCLUION: Multifocal objective perimetry can ae the viual field and identify glaucomatou viual field defect. It may have the potential for identifying defect earlier than conventional perimetry

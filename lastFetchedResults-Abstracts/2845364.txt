Distributed generation (DG) based on renewable sources becomes more and more implemented in distribution networks. Some of these sources have non constant (wind power plants, photovoltaic planes) and some have a constant power production (biogas plants). Also, loads on a feeder change during the day. There is a need for different optimizations because a number of variable changes over time. The total daily active energy losses, daily financial profit, and total daily active energy production of DG are considered for optimization in the paper. The load changes are considered on day level and for each load separately (not on the feeder level, but on node level). The multiobjective approach is applied in the paper for optimizing. The evolutionary strategy is utilized as the optimization method. The two and three objective optimization problems are presented and solved in the paper. The IEEE 13 node unbalanced distribution test feeder is used for presentation of multiobjective optimization. The proposed procedure is performed using OpenDSS and MATLAB software.

The objective of the present investigation was to determine bioavailability of calcium and vitamin D2 from milk fortified with either calcium or vitamin D2 alone or when both were used for preparation of multiple micronutrient fortified milk and also to study its interaction with iron and zinc bioavailability. 32 weanling male rats (aged 21â€“28 days) were assigned into four groups and were fed milk and milk fortified with calcium, vitamin D2 and calcium + vitamin D2. Vitamin D2 increased calcium bioavailability. In multiple micronutrient fortified milk, the bioavailability of both calcium + vitamin D2 increased in comparison to single fortification. Calcium fortification decreased, whereas vitamin D2 increased the absorption of iron and zinc. However, calcium and vitamin D2 when fortified in combination, the iron and zinc bioavailability was similar to control group. There was positive association between bioavailability of calcium and vitamin D2.

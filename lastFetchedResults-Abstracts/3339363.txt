Extending bidirectional brain-machine interfaces (BMI) tailored for specific experiments with additional software and hardware tools can be very onerous, if not impossible. To overcome this problem, we developed a modular configurable system by modifying the architecture of an existing bidirectional BMI. This modular system enables the seamless and efficient inclusion of new features and the integration of new protocols without changing the native systemÂ´s overall structure. By introducing a platform for the implementation of BMI algorithms on neuromorphic chips, this method represents a step towards the development of low-power, compact and computationally powerful tools for clinical applications.

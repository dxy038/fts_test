With the introduction of chemotherapy in the treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancers, endeavors at improving disease-free survival/overall survival are ongoing. As high objective response rates were seen with MVAC/CMV regimens (Mmethotrexate, V-vinblastine, A-adriamycin, C-cisplatin) organ conservation is being attempted. A phase II protocol was designed using MVAC as the initial therapy. Based on the response to two cycles all patients were evaluated and where possible the bladder was preserved. Twenty-nine patients completed the protocol and had a median follow-up of 24 months. Complete response (CR) was noted in 7/29 (24.1%) of patients, while 11/29 (38%) had partial response (PR) and 11/29 (38%) showed no response (NR). Bladder conservation was possible in 15/29 (51.7%) patients initially with the use of radiation therapy after the initial chemotherapy. Ten of these patients are presently alive with their bladders intact. Three patients died of distant disease, two with normal bladders and one with local relapse. Two of the other patients required salvage cystectomy and are alive and disease-free. All complete responders 7/7 (100%) and 5/11 (45%) partial responders could have their bladders conserved. Three of 11 partial responders who refused radiotherapy and 11/11 non-responders underwent radical cystectomy after initial chemotherapy. Subset analysis indicates that low stage and grade tumours had the highest likelihood of bladder preservation, and there was no difference in overall survival in the groups according to response criteria. As our study consists of a small number of selected patients, it would be improper to draw firm conclusions. However, it seems that initial chemotherapy selects out a subset of patients with a good prognosis and the chance for bladder conservation.

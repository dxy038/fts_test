The clinician's primary objective in treating a patient with decompensated heart failure is rapid and effective stabilization. This goal often is achieved through the use of inotropic support. Classic inotropic agents (Î²-adrenergic agonists and phospodiesterase III inhibitors) can provide short-term hemodynamic benefits, but their long-term use has been correlated with poor survival rates.

Calcium sensitizers comprise a new drug class that offers hemodynamic and symptomatic improvements without increasing cAMP and intracellular calcium concentrations. These agents enhance contractility without a concurrent increase in the risk of cardiac events and thus represent a significant improvement over classic positive inotropic agents.

Levosimendan is the most potent calcium sensitizer to date, exhibiting a unique dual mechanism of action that combines a positive inotropic action mediated via calcium sensitization and a vasodilator property via ATP-dependent potassium channels.

Available clinical data suggest that calcium sensitizer agents represent a promising class of inotropic agents in a field that has seen few advances in recent decades.

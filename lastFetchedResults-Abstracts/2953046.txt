The objective of this paper is to investigate the possibility of achieving a more realistic description of natural surfaces for microwave remote sensing purposes. By analyzing measured profiles, non-stationary effects which cannot be accounted for in the classical description of roughness are underlined. Subsequently, an expansion of 1/f processes in terms of wavelet orthonormal basis is used to derive a possible description of natural roughness

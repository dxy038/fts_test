In future applications, e.g. in ultra-flat OLED lamp drivers or flat screen power supplies, ultra-flat power systems are highly demanded. Therefore, the design and implementation of a PCB-integrated flyback transformer for a 1 mm thin PFC rectifier is under investigation. In this paper, an overview on several integration methods is given. It is shown that the PCB-integration of magnetic cores results in the required thickness of 1 mm and in a high energy density. Therefore, the design and the realization of ultra-flat magnetic components with PCB-integrated cores is detailed in this paper. The presented multi-objective design procedure determines the inductor and/or transformer setup optimal with respect to minimal losses and/or minimal footprint; for this purpose, the proposed design procedure considers all required electrical, magnetical, and geometrical parameters of the magnetic component. Furthermore, the design procedure accounts for anisotropic core loss behavior and includes an accurate reluctance model. Experimental results are used to verify the design procedure.

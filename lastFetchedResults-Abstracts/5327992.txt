The rapid advancement of electronics and communication technologies has led to extremely high density of equipment deployment in both the military and civilian sectors, resulting in cluttering of the electromagnetic spectrum. To alleviate this problem, global EMC initiatives have been intensified to ensure that electronic equipment conform to the EMC requirements. To meet this objective, the suppliers of equipment should implement stringent design control measures and also develop or have access to effective EMC test infrastructure for verifying compliance with specified requirements. This paper describes the EMC test infrastructure developed by BEL, Bangalore, for facilitating design and development of products conforming to EMI/EMC requirements

The objective of this work is to provide an overview of some alternative energy conservation technologies in industrial freezers and refrigerated facilities that are prone to coil frosting problems. This effort will particularly target three distinct techniques; namely, the use of heat-pipe assisted heat exchangers, employing dampered coils, and operating freezer coils at excessively high face velocities. The feasibility of these technologies will be explored both experimentally and analytically. The results will be supported by visual observations and images taken inside the laboratory freezer under study.

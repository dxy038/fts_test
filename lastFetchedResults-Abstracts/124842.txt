BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The side effects of antinociception chemical drugs caused notice to medical plants. This study was performed to investigate the effects of hydroalcoholic extract of thymus vulgaris (TV) on nurogenic and inflammatory pain in formalin test in mice. METHODS: Forty male albino mice (20-30 gr) were used. TV (100, 500 mg/kg) as extract and saline were injected 30 min before formalin test. Indexes for evaluation were duration of licking and foot elevation for assessment of acute pain (5 min) and chronic pain (15-40 min) after injection of formalin 5% (2511l) in paw.
FINDINGS: Results indicated that TV has analgesic effect in both doses (p<0.01), and higher dose (500 mg) was more effective.
CONCLUSION: Findings showed that hydroalcoholic extract of TV can modulate acute and chronic pain. Further research is required to determine the mechanisms by which TV has an inhibitory effect on pain sensation.

Objective
We evaluated the effects of calcium pyruvate supplementation during training on body composition and metabolic responses to exercise.
Methods

Twenty-three untrained females were matched and assigned to ingest in a double blind and randomized manner either 5 g of calcium pyruvate (PYR) or a placebo (PL) twice daily for 30 d while participating in a supervised exercise program. Prior to and following supplementation, subjects had body composition determined via hydrodensiometry; performed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test; and performed a 45-min walk test at 70% of pre-training VO2 max in which fasting pre- and post exercise blood samples determined.
Results

No significant differences were observed between groups in energy intake or training volume. Univariate repeated measures ANOVA revealed that subjects in the PYR group gained less weight (PL 1.2 ± 0.3, PYR 0.3 ± 0.3 kg, P = 0.04), lost more fat (PL 1.1 ± 0.5; PYR −0.4 ± 0.5 kg, P = 0.03), and tended to lose a greater percentage of body fat (PL 1.0 ± 0.7; PYR −0.65 ± 0.6%, P = 0.07), with no differences observed in fat-free mass (PL 0.1 ± 0.5; PYR 0.7 ± 0.3 kg, P = 0.29). However, these changes were not significant when body composition data were analyzed by MANOVA (P = 0.16). There was some evidence that PYR may negate some of the beneficial effects of exercise on HDL values. No significant differences were observed between groups in maximal exercise responses or metabolic responses to submaximal walking.
Conclusions

Results indicate that PYR supplementation during training does not significantly affect body composition or exercise performance and may negatively affect some blood lipid levels.

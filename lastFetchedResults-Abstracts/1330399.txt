Microbiological safety of food relies on microbial examination of raw materials and final products, coupled with monitoring process parameters and hygiene standards. The concept of predictive microbiology was developed to evaluate the effect of processing, distribution and storage operations on food safety. The objective of this paper is to review the approaches proposed by researchers to quantify the effect of competitiveness or fluctuating conditions on bacterial behaviour. The main microbial models that quantify the effects of various hurdles on microbial kinetics are presented. To provide complementary information for microbial models, three areas have to be considered: process engineering that characterises and models mass and heat transfer; microbiology that characterises and models bacterial behaviour and metabolite production, and; applied thermodynamics that characterises and models the physico-chemical properties of a food product. Global modelling approaches, developed by integrating the previous models, are illustrated with recent results.

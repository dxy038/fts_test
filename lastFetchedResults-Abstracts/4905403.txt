To advance the performance of AC adjustable speed system and to reduce the pollution to power network, this paper proposes a compound control strategy which combines matrix converter (MC) and direct torque control (DTC). The MC controlled by this strategy cannot only achieve DTC to a asynchronous machine but also acquire good input currents and adjustable power factor. The principle of this strategy is: firstly transform MC into an equivalent topology that is a combination of a rectifier and an inverter, and then perform DTC on inverter and current space vector modulation on the rectifier, at last combine two sides´ strategies and change them into the control signals of the MC´s nine bidirectional switches. A simulation about MC driving asynchronous machine has been done and the results prove that the strategy proposed by this paper is not only feasible but also excellent.

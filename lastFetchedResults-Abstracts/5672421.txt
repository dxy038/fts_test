This paper presents a method for design and implementation of a bidirectional infrared wireless data transmission system with half-duplex communication mode based on AT89S52 MCU. The system is mainly composed of infrared transmitter and receiver. 38kHz carrier circuit comprises of NE555 integrated circuit in the infrared transmitter. Integrated infrared receiver HS0038B is chosen to demodulate and amplify the received infrared signals in the infrared receiver. The complexity and difficulty of software development are reduced by using the function of encoding and decoding function of single-chip microcomputer UART in the system. The system has the characteristics of low cost, strong anti-interference ability and high reliability and it can be widely applied in mobile devices of short distance wireless data transmission.

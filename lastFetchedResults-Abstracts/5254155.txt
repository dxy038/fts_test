Static Compensators are used to improve power quality. In order to achieve this objective the control system requires accurate knowledge of the positive and negative sequences and user selected harmonics. This paper presents a technique based on an unusual PLL that simultaneously estimates the sequence components and several harmonics. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrating the technique are presented.

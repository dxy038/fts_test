An adaptive integrator backstepping approach is proposed in this paper for advanced motion control systems. The backstepping design achieves position command following objective, and the added integrator improves its robustness against the disturbance and modeling uncertainties and its steady-state performance. Adaptation is used to compensate parameter variations in terms of inertia, viscous friction, and load torque disturbance. The simulation result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach

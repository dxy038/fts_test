A reversible three-phase switching mode
rectifier consisting of a four-active-switch and
without current sensor is proposed. To achieve
controllable power factor, clean sinusoidal input
current, adjustable DC output voltage, and
bidirectional power flow capability, a closed-form
pulse width modulation (PWM) duty cycle
function is derived. The popularly used state
space averaging technique is extended for
modelling the reversible three-phase four-activeswitch
rectifier. The space vector representation
technique is then used to simplify the modelling
process without sacrificing accuracy and valid
frequency range. Both steady-state and small
signal analyses are made. Results show that the
proposed closed-form control law for the rectifier
can indeed achieve the desired property.
Moreover, the rectifier also possesses a
bidirectional power flow capability, which is
useful for many applications. Finally, a prototype
hardware circuit was constructed and
experimental results are presented for
demonstration. Guidelines for determining the
LC parameters and the PI controller gains are
described briefly in the text.

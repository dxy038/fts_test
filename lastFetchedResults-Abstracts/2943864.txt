A simplified adaptive nonlinear robust controller (SANROC) has been studied in the authorsÂ´ research. However, the estimate of an upper bound for uncertainties is increased by using the adaptive mechanism in this method. The objective in this paper is that a fuzzy reasoning is establish to be equivalent to the adaptive mechanism of SANROC without matching conditions. The proposed method is applied to a pantograph type manipulator. The effectiveness of the present method is illustrated by some simulations

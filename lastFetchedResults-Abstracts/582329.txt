Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation is an important factor for planning and implementation of soil and water conservation, flood control and drought mitigation projects. Precipitation zoning maps and their variability play an important role in land management activities. The objective of the current research was to evaluate the capability of geostatistical methods for estimating annual precipitation in the province of Fars. Data of 92 gauging stations with a common period of 20 years were collected and different approaches including ordinary kriging (OK), simple kriging (SK), and deterministic methods such as inverse distance weights (IDW), radial basis function (RBF), local polynomial interpolation (LPI) and global polynomial interpolation (GPI) were assessed based on R, MAE and RMSE. The results showed that the ordinary kriging had higher R and lower RMSE and MAE. Therefore, this method was implemented in the preparation of the isohyetal map of the province of Fars. The results indicate advantages of the kriging method  over those of the deterministic techniques. Moreover, the results revealed that 45.465% of the province has the annual precipitation range of 200-300 m while only 0.09 % of the province has the highest precipitation range of 900-1000 mm.

In this paper, optimization and techno-economic evaluation of a Combined Cooling, Heating and Power (CCHP) system for a hotel in Kerman has been investigated. The design parameters of system include capacity of gas engine(as prime mover), partial load (PL), thermal capacity of boiler, the cooling capacities of electric and absorption chillers that, by using energy, economic, and environment analysis and relative annual benefit (AP), as objective function, have been optimized. Then, for optimum results the payback period (PB) has been investigated by considering the time value of money and without it. Results show an increase in the number of prime movers, reduced  annual benefit. Moreover, this process has reverse relation with classic payback period since choosing a 2550 kW gas engine, maximum relative annual benefit (AP) with value of 45.5Ã—105($/year) and minimum payback period (PB) of 6 years will be obtained. Also, when the costs of energy increase and one prime mover (PM) is selected, the results of traditional and classical payback method are different as the time of payback period increases in classic method and decreases for traditional method.

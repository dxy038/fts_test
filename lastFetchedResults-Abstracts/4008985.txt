We present multiwavelength and bidirectional operation of a novel Brillouin/erbium fiber ring laser. Multiwavelength operation is seeded by an Er/sup 3+/:Yb/sup 3+/ fiber distributed-feedback (DFB) laser inserted into the ring cavity. We realized lasing at up to eight wavelengths separated by 10.6 GHz.

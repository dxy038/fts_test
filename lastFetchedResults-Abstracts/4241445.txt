The objective of this study was to develop a standardized protocol for the capturing and analysis of endoscopy digital images for subsequent use in a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system in gynaecological cancer. Images were captured at optimum illumination and focus at 720times576 pixels using 24 bits color in the following cases: (i) for a variety of testing targets from a color palette with known color distribution, (ii) different viewing angles and distances from calf endometrium, and (iii) images from the human endometrium. Images were then gamma corrected and their classification performance was compared against that of non-gamma corrected images. No significant difference in texture features was found between the close up and panoramic views, and between angles, either before or after gamma correction. There was significant difference in certain texture features between normal and abnormal endometrium, both before and after gamma correction. Our findings suggest that proper color correction can significantly impact CAD system performance, and we recommend its application prior to quantitative texture analysis in gynaecological endoscopy

The objective of this paper is to predict the flaw response in an inhomogeneous solid medium. Multi-Gaussian Beam (MGB) model is used to represent the incident ultrasonic beam. The effect of ultrasonic attenuation and phase velocity dispersion due to grain scattering is included in the predictions. The variation of received voltage is analysed against the distance of the flaw from the transducer for different dimensions of a square cylinder void. The effect of variation of mean diameter of the grains on the received voltage for different domain of interest is also studied. At the same time, the experimental results are also given about different mean diameter of the grains on the received voltage.

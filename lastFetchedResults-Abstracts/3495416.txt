This paper presents an algorithm for the wide-band optimization of H- and E-plane waveguide components with irregular shapes. The algorithm is based on the boundary-integral-resonant-mode expansion method, used in conjunction with a variational technique, which permits the determination of the objective function and of its gradient by solving a single electromagnetic problem. The same technique allows for performing a sensitivity analysis to check the effect of the mechanical tolerances on the performance of the component and to estimate the yield for a given manufacturing technology on a large-scale production. Many examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

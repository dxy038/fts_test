With the consideration of time sequence characteristics of load and distributed generation (DG), a novel method is presented for optimal sitting and sizing of DG in distribution system. Multiple-objective functions have been formed with the consideration of minimum investment and operational cost of DG, minimum voltage deviation and maximal voltage stability margin. To solve the multiple-objective optimization problem, an Improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (INSGA-II) has been proposed. Several experiments have been made on the modified PG&amp;E 69-bus and actual 292-bus test systems. The result and comparisons indicate the proposed method for optimal placement and sizing of DG units is feasible and effective.

Objective: To investigate clinical manifestations of relapsing polychondritis and to clarify the significance of type II collagen antibody in the disease. Methods: Clinical manifestations and antibody titers were examined in eight cases of relapsing polychondritis which had been treated at Otolaryngology Department, Hokkaido University during the eight years from 1991 to 1998. Anti-type II collagen antibody titer was measured by ELISA method. Results: The most frequent symptom was auricular chondritis; it was seen in 88% (7/8) of the cases. Ocular symptom, nasal chondritis, arthritis, respiratory tract chondritis, and audio-vestibular symptom were also common in the cases. Compared with previous reports, no difference was recognized in the manifestation frequency. Considering none of the samples from the controls was positive for anti-type II collagen antibody, two samples from the disease group were positive. The antibody positive rate was 25% (2/8). Conclusion: Though the measurement of type II collagen antibody titer is not a decisive factor for detection of relapsing polychondritis, it is useful as one of the complementary factors for the diagnosis, since there is no specific test for this disease.

A radiation harden technique based on gate sizing and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is developed to optimize the soft error tolerance of standard cell circuits. Soft error rate (SER), chip area and longest path delay are selected as the optimization goals and fast fitness evaluation algorithms for the three goals are developed and embedded into the MOGA. All the three goals are optimized simultaneously by optimally sizing the gates in the circuit, which is a complex NP-Complete problem and resolved by MOGA through exploring the global design space of the circuit. Syntax analysis technique is also employed to make the proposed framework can optimize not only pure combinational logic circuit but also the combinational parts of sequential logic circuit. Optimizing experiments carried out on ISCAS´85 and ISCAS´89 standard benchmark circuits show that the proposed optimization algorithm can decrease the SER 74.25% with very limited delay overhead (0.28%). Furthermore, the algorithm can also reduce the area for most of the circuit under test by average 5.23%. The proposed technique is proved to be better than other works in delay and area overhead and suitable to direct the design of soft error tolerance integrated circuits in high reliability realms.

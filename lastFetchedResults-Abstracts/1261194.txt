Objective To investigate the relationships between objective measures and the results of subjective assessment of voice quality and speech intelligibility in patients submitted to total laryngectomy and tracheoesophageal (TE) puncture. Study Design Retrospective. Materials Twenty patients implanted with voice prosthesis were studied. After surgery, the entire sample performed speech rehabilitation. The assessment protocol included maximum phonation time (MPT), number of syllables per deep breath, acoustic analysis of the sustained vowel /a/ and of a bisyllabic word, perceptual evaluation (pleasantness and intelligibility%), and self-assessment. Results The correlation between pleasantness and intelligibility% was statistically significant. Both the latter were significantly correlated with the acoustic signal type, the number of formant peaks, and the F2âˆ’F1 difference. The intelligibility% and number of formant peaks were significantly correlated with the MPT and number of syllables per deep breath. Moreover, significant correlations were found between the number of formant peaks and both intelligibility% and pleasantness. The higher the number of syllables per deep breath and the longer the MPT, significantly higher was the number of formant peaks and the intelligibility%. The study failed to show significant correlation between patientâ€™s self-assessment of voice quality and both pleasantness and communication effectiveness. Conclusion The multidimensional assessment seems to be a reliable tool to evaluate the TE functional outcome. Particularly, the results showed that both pleasantness and intelligibility of TE speech are correlated to the availability of expired air and the function of the vocal tract.

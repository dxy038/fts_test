1.Optimization based Energy Management Strategies (OBEMS) are convenient tools to split the power among different sources. 2.The objective function must be chosen in such a way that a given criterion of performance is accomplished (The minimum fuel consumption is only one possible option). 3.The objective function must be chosen so the existence of an optimum is guaranteed. Simple models of the ESS/FC/Engine are used also with this aim. 4.If the fuel consumption is chosen as objective function, the solution of the minimization unrestricted problem is trivial (i.e. null consumption) 5.The restricted version of the optimization problem above is the one that makes sense and its solution is always different from the unrestricted case (i.e. the feasible set does not contain the solution of the unrestricted problem). 6.Due to the observation in 5, the solution of the restricted case lays at the boundary of the feasible set. 7.If the ESS SOC is sufficiently high, the solution of the restricted optimization problem is to use the minimal FC power. 8.The EMS gives as output, a power split reference to be followed by the power converters. Failing in tracking the power reference leads always to suboptimal solutions. Do not use OBEMS with poor control designs!

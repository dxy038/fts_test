Every research and development effort has been undertaken in recent years to integrate otherwise disconnected manufacturing production and planning application software systems so that the enterprises can react quickly and accurately to the ever changing market dynamics. In such an integrated environment it is, at times, necessary to bring in a new application in order to replace an outmoded one or to provide functionality that is not available in the existing environment. The process of introducing a new application is very complicated and can be extremely costly in terms of time and resources. In This paper we propose an architecture system for the integration of manufacturing production and planning (MP/P). The proposed system exploits the open Internet standards and is based on connection bidirectional Model through an intermediate entity called Web service management.

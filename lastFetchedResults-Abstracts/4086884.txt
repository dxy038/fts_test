Energy consumption in wireless communication system is rapidly increasing due to growing wireless multimedia access. Combating adverse effects of excessive energy consumption demands for energy-aware system design, leading to a new research paradigm called green communication. In this paper, we propose user selection and power allocation schemes for a multi-user, multi-relay cooperative cellular system in order to minimize the cost of transmission. In the proposed schemes, the cost function is first formulated to optimize the weighted sum powers of base and relay stations. It is then extended to a more general multi-objective scheme which jointly optimizes the sum power and throughput keeping a balance between them. In both of the schemes, quality-of-service is guaranteed in terms of end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio. To make the proposed schemes realistic, we assume the presence of estimation errors in channel state information. An algorithm to enhance fairness among users in these schemes is also presented. Simulation results are presented to confirm the performance of proposed schemes in terms of energy efficiency, system throughput, outage probability, and fairness to end users.

Electric torque-loading test system can check the disturbed operating performance of servo system by simulating the disturbance torques during the operation. Using LabVIEW software, the PC software of this loading system has been designed in this article. Based on sine wave, square wave and some other waves, this paper focuses on the generation methods of bidirectional square wave and bidirectional triangle wave. The running performance fits the requirements well and the servo system can be effectively tested with the help of the designed simulation torque-loading system.

We investigate the impact of the human driver behavior on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Motivated by early studies, which investigated the driver behavior and which provided a rough classification of different reactions on presented traffic information, we integrated such models into our simulation framework Veins. We were able to determine a significant change in the performance of a technically optimized system due to suboptimal reactions of the drivers. The main objective of this study is to outline the need for integrated driver models into the development process of Traffic Information System (TIS) solutions. Based on our simulation framework, not only the driver model can be accurately represented but we were also able to show that simple probabilistic models show exactly the same behavior compared to sophisticated empirical measurement based ones.

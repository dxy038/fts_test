Firstly, the authors generalize the indiscernible relation to similarity relation, give a definition of &#955;-discernibility matrix; secondly, according to the properties of &#955;-discernibility matrix, an algorithm of computing significance of each condition attribute is put forward; thirdly, we give the comprehensive weight of each attribute according to subjective and objective weight; at last, the reasonable and available of this algorithm is accounted for through an example.

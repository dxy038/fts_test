A piecewise linear (with three or four segments) dynamic version for relaxation oscillations in a circuit with a bidirectional negative resistance transistor (BNRT) is studied. The circuit and dynamic equations are given, and some properties of the relaxation oscillations are discussed. Experimental results agree well with the computations, showing that the dynamic model is adequate and useful

Time goes forwards, IT-projects become more difficult and more expensive, acquire new links and technologies. To please efficiency, IT-commands balance on the edge between an economic gain of the project and obligations on periods and quality. Keeping up to date, some managers start to using actively testing automation at own risk, without an estimation of possible efficiency of its application. Others prefer to minimise usage of autotests, assuming their too difficult and ineffective. It is very difficult to IT Manager to define efficiency of the automated testing. He not always needs to rely on subjective opinion of experts and testers as it is grounded on experience of those projects in which experts participated. This manuscript is grounded on the data about application of autotests in successful IT projects and urged to generate for the reader an objective view on criterion of efficiency of autotests in various projects.

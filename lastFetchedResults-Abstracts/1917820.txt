Left ventricular (LV) deformation with ventricular septal shift is one of the most distinctive echocardiographic observations in patients with chronic right ventricular (RV) pressure overload (PO). However, little is known about the effects of RVPO on LV performance and regional synchrony. Accordingly, our objective was to test the hypothesis that chronic RVPO affects regional wall motion, synchronicity, and global LV function using a novel speckle-tracking approach to quantify and characterize regional LV wall motion dyssynchrony. Displacement and strain imaging echocardiographic studies were performed in 20 patients with RVPO from pulmonary arterial hypertension or pulmonic stenosis (mean age 53 ± 16 years, New York Heart Association class 2.6 ± 0.7, and peak RV systolic pressure 73 ± 28 mm Hg) and 20 age-matched normal subjects (mean age 47 ± 16 years). Segmental signals from 6 segments around the mid-LV short axis were defined as dyssynchronous if their changes were opposite to that of the global LV signal at each time frame, and overall LV dyssynchrony was calculated as the percentage of dyssynchrony in all 6 segments within the specified time interval from onset of QRS to the end of isovolumic relaxation. RVPO was associated with a large degree of regional dyssynchrony with paradoxical ventricular septal motion observed by displacement imaging (21 ± 6%, p &lt;0.05 vs control group), which was closely associated with LV eccentricity index (r = 0.79, p &lt;0.05) and LV myocardial performance index with linear regression (r = 0.76, p &lt;0.05). In contrast, strain imaging showed uniform segmental radial thickening in the RVPO group, which was similar to the control group, and suggests that there was no intrinsic LV contractile dyssynchrony. In conclusion, LV wall motion dyssynchrony assessed by displacement imaging, not intrinsic contractile dyssynchrony by strain imaging, coexists with LV chamber deformation with ventricular septal shift and is closely associated with impairment of LV performance.

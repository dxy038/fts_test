One of the main security concerns related to a distributed system is the lack of trust. In this paper, we present a trust ontology methodology based on access control concepts for Multi-Organization Environments (MOE). This ontology will be used to share the trust beliefs between participants and to make equivalence between their trust objectives. How to define this trust relationship, how to understand the trust objective of a requester, and how to evaluate the recommendation value will be presented in detail. In order to make easy to understand this process, an implementation and a case study with two ontologies are presented and discussed.

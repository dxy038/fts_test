In this paper, the authors present a decomposition approach based on duality theory for line maintenance scheduling with transmission and voltage constraints. The given formulation consists of a master program and sub-problems with two independent programming. In the master problem, the maintenance problem is solved and in the subproblems, the transmission and voltage problems are solved independently. Since canceling a transaction or purchasing reactive power relates to the loss of revenue, the trade-off between maintenance cost and revenue loss will be optimized in the proposed method. The test results on the modified IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate that limits on transmission and voltage affect the line maintenance scheduling and increase the maintenance cost. While introducing the loss of revenue as one of the objective functions, the proposed method is flexible enough to accommodate various pricing objectives and methods

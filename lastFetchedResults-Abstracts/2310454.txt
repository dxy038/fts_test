The U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground is the Department of Defense desert environment test center within the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. The Yuma Proving Ground has âˆ¼320 km of unpaved vehicle test courses that cross a variety of landforms of diverse geologic age and characteristics. The surface materials of the courses ranges from bedrock to silt and their topography varies from steep and rolling to flat. Research presented here aims to provide a systematic characterization of the terrain of eight vehicle endurance and three dust courses so that their comparability with other desert areas of the World may be assessed. Landform and surface cover (upper 1 m) characterization was accomplished by geomorphic mapping based on 1-m resolution IKONOS satellite imagery, 10-m digital elevation models, field verification, and by assimilating pre-existing soil surveys and geologic maps, as well as site-specific investigations. Results provide an assessment of each test course, including information on the landform, geology, surface materials, soil type, degree of desert pavement development, dust content, and percent slope. Data is presented both on individual terrain property maps for each course and in the form of tabulated data for each official milepost marker along the courses. The results for one course area and an example of how they may be used to assess comparability with another desert of interest are presented here with the objective to improve the fidelity of desert testing during material research, development, testing and evaluation prior to deployment in the field.

The paper proposes to analyze a real case study from Galati town power delivery system. The study will consider a technical solution to save power losses using an adequate harmonics filter together with a reactive power correction system. The solution conducts calculations with the objective to minimize the total power losses. On this purpose we use an important data base obtained by local power delivery system monitoring. The paper uses also the results of EDSA professional power system analysis software performing active and reactive power flow calculations for the analyzed power delivery system.

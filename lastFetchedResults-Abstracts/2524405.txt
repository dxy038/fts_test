Substance use among school-aged children is an international public health concern. Rates of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use among school children in Ghana have been increasing. The objective of this study was to assess Ghanaian teachers’ beliefs and perceptions regarding substance use among school children in Ghana. A cross-sectional design was used. A sample of teachers from the Central and Ashanti Regions of Ghana completed a survey questionnaire assessing their perceptions of substance use among Ghanaian school children. Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software version 23.0. T-tests and chi-square tests were used to identify associations between participants’ demographic factors and beliefs regarding drug use among school-aged children. The sample consisted of 289 teachers with over half (57.7%) of them being male, and ages ranging from 20-66 years old. The majority of the teachers (50.9%) indicated that they believed alcohol was the most common substance used by school-aged children in Ghana. Over 90% of them m indicated that they believe school children in Ghana will first use alcohol before they are 13 years old. Only 54.3% of teachers indicated that they are aware of drug policies in the schools where they teach. The results from this study should encourage the development and implementation of school policies on substance use and health education programs that discuss the risks and circumstances of substance use.

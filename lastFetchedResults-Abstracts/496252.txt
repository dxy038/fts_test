Background and objective: Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease, which leads to a decrease in bone mass and disorders in its structure. Leptin and adiponectin are hormones secreted from the adipose tissue. The objective of this study was to determine association between serum leptin and adiponectin and bone mineral density in postmenopausal women 40-60 years old.

Methods and Materials: This cross-sectional study included was 85 postmenopausal women, 40-60 years old. Samples of fasting blood were taken from the women in order to determine the serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin, and bone mass density (BMD) was measured by the DXA method in two areas, i.e., L2-4 and the femoral neck.

Results: The means ± SD of age and body mass index (BMI) of the subjects were 52.4±5.4 years and 29.4±4.5 kg/m2, respectively. There was a significant inverse relationship between the serum leptin level and BMD in the L2-4 area (p=0.02). The data also showed a negative association between the serum adiponectin level on the one hand, and the BMD of the femur (p=0.03) and the bone mineral content (BMC) of the vertebral column (p=0.03) on the other.

Conclusion: Leptin and adiponectin have inverse associations with the bone mineral density.

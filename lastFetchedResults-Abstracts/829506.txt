Background and Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of aerobic training on B- endorphin level and perceived training exertion in addicted men.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 20 addicted men aged 20-33 years old were randomly selected after a public call and were divided into drug supplement (n=10) and exercise-drug supplement (n=10) groups. While the first group had consumption of 10 milligram/day of methadone, the exercise-drug supplement group performed exercise training to intensity of 70-75 percent of VO2max for 20 sessions (5 sessions per week and for 45 to 55 minutes in each session) in addition to intervention of drug supplement group. Also, for checking of desired changes after intervention, blood samples were taken for survey of B-endorphin level and perceived training exertion was performed by Borg scale. Finally, SPSS software was used for data analysis at a significant level of p < 0.05. 

Results: Statistical surveys showed that after intervention, level of B-endorphin significantly increased in both groups (p < 0.05). Also, perceived training exertion significantly decreased in exercise-drug supplement group (p=0.002). In addition, in exercise-drug supplement group, there was a significant negative relationship between B-endorphin levels and perceived training exertion (p=0.033).

Conclusion: Considering the results of this study and existing literature, we can conclude that method of exercise-drug supplement is presumably a better one for treatment of addicted men in comparison with other interventions. It is also a good method for enhancement of endocrine system in addicted men. However, further research is needed to confirm available data.

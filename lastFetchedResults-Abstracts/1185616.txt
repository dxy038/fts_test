This paper proposes a method of locating and quantifying the damage in structural members using the concept of residual forces. To describe the damage in a structure, finite element (FE) models are parameterised by structural stiffness reduction parameters. The damage parameters are determined by minimising a global error derived from dynamic residual vectors, which are obtained by introducing a simulated “experimental” data into the eigenproblem. An eigenvalue prediction algorithm along with normalised residual function is employed to formulate the objective function. Two-point crossover binary coded genetic algorithm (GA) with tournament selection approach is adopted in minimising the objective and optimum set of stiffness reduction parameters are predicted. Current structural defect-identification scheme is verified and assessed using an analytically derived plane truss, a cantilever Euler–Bernoulli beam and a portal truss. Results are presented in the form of tables and graphs.

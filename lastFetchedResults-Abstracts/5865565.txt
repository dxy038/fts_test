The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that voltage sags can be mitigated through the application of demand voltage reserve technology. It means that a demand as voltage reserve with the capability of sensing the voltage magnitude supplied by the network could also be added to the cyclic control of thermal loads in order to disconnect the supplies in case of slow recovery voltage sags. The disconnection of the supplies for few seconds would lead to small impact on their temperature, but could be fundamental to avoid the trip of induction motors or other sensitive loads.

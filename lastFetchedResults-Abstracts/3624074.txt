In the context of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the discrete cosine transform (DCT), we present efficient methods for bidirectional conversion between transform coefficients of a signal block (one- or two-dimensional) and transform coefficients of the signalÂ´s subblocks. The DFT case is used to exemplify the underlying theoretical issues while the DCT case is considered for its practical importance. For typical DCT block sizes, our algorithms result in a 20% savings in multiplications over the fastest existing methods and have no penalty in reordering operations.

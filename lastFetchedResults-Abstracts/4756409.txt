Hydraulic machines used in a number of applications are highly non-linear systems. Besides the dynamic coupling between the different links, there are significant actuator nonlinearities due to the inherent properties of the hydraulic system. Automation of such machines requires the robotic machine to be at least as productive as a manually operated machine, which in turn makes the case for performing tasks optimally with respect to an objective function (say) composed of a combination of time and fuel usage. Optimal path computation requires fast machine models in order to be practically usable. This work examines the use of memory-based learning in constructing the model of a 25-ton hydraulic excavator. The learned actuator model is used in conjunction with a linkage dynamic model to construct a complete excavator model which is much faster than a complete analytical model. Test results show that the approach effectively captures the interactions between the different actuators

The objective of this study is to optimize the sizing of a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) system. The optimization of the PV energy generated by horizontal panels (or inclined) fixed (or movable) for a given site is realized. The estimation of solar radiation on inclined panels based on the measurements taken on a horizontal plane is presented. Then, an optimization of the inclination angle (tilt angle) is proposed to maximize the annual PV energy production. The energy efficiency of solar tracking system is analyzed and evaluated. Finally, the optimal sizing for the stand-alone photovoltaic system (SAPS) is presented based on an energy management between the PV panels, the batteries, and the load.

Background and Objective: Deficiency in the proprioception, balance and postural control are mostly found in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery (ACLR). These factors play a role in symmetric weight distribution on the lower limbs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of taping on the proprioception and weight distribution on lower limbs in ACLR patients.

Materials and Methods: Twenty volunteer athlete men with isolated ACL injury, aged 27Â±5.5 years, 4 to 6 months after surgery participated in the study. This study was performed in the Biomechanics Laboratory of Tarbiat Modares University. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups using random number table. Proprioception and weight distribution symmetry were measured by a digital goniometer and force platform. Measurements were performed before and after taping and 10 days after continues usage of taping. 

Results: The findings showed that the weight loading on the injured knee was toward increasing in 30 degree of squat but did not show a significant difference. There was not a considerable difference in 60 degree squat too. Angle reproduction test precision also significantly improved after taping.

Conclusion: It could be concluded that taping has a positive effect on the reducing angle reproduction absolute error via providing sensory inputs on the knee joint.

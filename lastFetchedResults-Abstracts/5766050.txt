A computer aided measurement and analysis system is designed to avoid the problem caused by Orthodontics Mould (Teeth Die) manual measurement of the possible measurement errors in this paper. Orthodontics Mould´s digital image may be collected by using digital CCD camera´s information acquisition technology, and achieved by means of a computer-aided measurement system of the Orthodontics Mould´s digital image. Digital image processing of the Orthodontics Mould makes it easy to process and analyse the measurement data from the mould. The system based on the Windows platform, Visual C++6.0 tools and MS SQL Server database technology completes Orthodontics Mould-image data measurement, processing, maintenance and management. The System based on the arch form´s measurement and analysis includes three subsystems, namely, Orthodontics Mould´s medical records management system, measurement systems and analysis system. The clinical results show that the computer aided measurement and analysis system for Orthodontics Mould has good performances,which provides dentists with a more objective evaluation method.

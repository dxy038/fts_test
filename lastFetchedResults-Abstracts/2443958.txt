Background: Continuous input of antibiotics to the environment can cause many potential problems such as antibiotic resistance in pathogens.
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare heterogeneous fenton process and adsorption process on magnetic nanocomposite for ciprofloxacin removal from aqueous solutions.
Methods: This experimental study was conducted at the Hamadan University of Medical Science in 2014. The efficiency of magnetic nanocomposite for ciprofloxacin removal was assessed in a batch system considering 15-300 min reaction time, pH 4-10, 30-200 mg/L initial ciprofloxacin concentration, 1-3 g/L adsorbent and 5-25 mmol/L H2O2. Physical and structural characteristics of the synthesized adsorbent were analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra (FTIR) techniques.
Findings: The maximum efficiency of heterogeneous fenton process and adsorption process was obtained at pH 4 and 7 in which the efficiency of ciprofloxacin removal was 95% and 87%, respectively. The equilibrium adsorption data was well fitted with Langmuir isotherm. The reaction rate had the best compatibility with pseudo-second-order kinetic model.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, magnetic nanocomposite (Fe3O4/MWCNTs) can be considered as an acceptable adsorbent in heterogeneous fenton procces for ciprofloxacin removal from aqueous solutions.

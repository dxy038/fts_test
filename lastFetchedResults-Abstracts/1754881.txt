Objective
ss intrusiveness” refers to illness-induced lifestyle disruptions. The primary aim of the current study was to compare the level of illness intrusiveness in anorexia nervosa (AN) to that reported in a variety of other chronic medical and psychiatric conditions. A secondary aim was to compare the two subtypes of AN (binge/purge vs. restricting) in terms of the nature and extent of illness intrusiveness. A final goal was to examine changes in the level of illness intrusiveness in AN following successful completion of specialized inpatient treatment.
s
rticipants were a consecutive series of 121 female inpatients with AN who were admitted to a specialized inpatient unit for treatment of the eating disorder. Assessments took place before and after inpatient treatment and at 3-month follow-up.
s
eline, illness intrusiveness scores for AN patients were significantly higher than those reported by women in the medical and psychiatric comparison groups. Overall, illness intrusiveness scores decreased (i.e., improved) significantly following successful completion of inpatient treatment. Among patients with the restricting subtype, scores continued to improve during follow-up, whereas this was not the case among patients with the binge–purge subtype of AN, whose scores did not change significantly during follow-up.
sion
e being notoriously ambivalent about change, these findings suggest that AN patients perceive their illness to be highly disruptive to a variety of life domains, even more so than patients with other chronic medical and psychiatric conditions.

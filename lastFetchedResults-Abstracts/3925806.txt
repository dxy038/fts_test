Full-order continuous-time average modeling and dynamic analysis of bidirectional dc-dc dual active bridge (DAB) converters are studied. The transformer current in DAB converter is purely ac, making continuous-time modeling difficult. The proposed full-order continuous-time average model uses the dc terms and first order terms of transformer current and capacitor voltage as state variables, resulting in a third-order model, if capacitor equivalent series resistance (ESR) is not considered, and a sixth-order model if ESR is considered. A control-to-output-voltage transfer function is derived for DAB converters. Experimental results confirm that the proposed model correctly predicts the small-signal frequency response and an even more accurate prediction can be obtained if capacitor ESR is taken into account.

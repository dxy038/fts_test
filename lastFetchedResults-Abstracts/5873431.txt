Stereo video is regarded as an important developing trend of video technology and there is an increasing need to develop efficient and perceptually consistent measures for stereo video quality evaluation in the field of stereo video signal processing. In this paper, a new metric for stereo video image quality assessment is proposed by incorporating the main characteristics of human visual systems (HVS) such as the visual non-linearity, contrast sensitivity, multi-channel model and so on. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional objective image quality assessment methods such as PSNR.

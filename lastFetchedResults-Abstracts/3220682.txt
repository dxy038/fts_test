The main objective of our paper is to implement on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) an architecture of a method used to detect circles from edge images based on Hough transform algorithm. At first, an algorithm has been developed and tested using Matlab software. The modified algorithm that we have followed to realize our architecture simplifies trigonometric calculations to just simple additions by using Cordic algorithm. Then architecture has been elaborated and implemented under Xilinx ISE 9.2i Foundation tool and tested on real-time. We will discuss the performance and parallelism of the algorithm and we will show its efficiency.

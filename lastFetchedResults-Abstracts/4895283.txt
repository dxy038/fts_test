Quadriplegics rely on power wheelchairs for mobility, but the hands-free controller systems currently available are obtrusive and expensive. The objective of this project was to design a power wheelchair with a novel control system for quadriplegics with head and neck mobility. The control system translates the position of the user´s head into speed and directional control of the wheelchair. Head movement was measured using camera-based motion-tracking of an infrared LED array on the back of the user´s head. The control system included a standby mode that was activated by pressing the head back against the headrest, which activated the braking system while deactivating the drive train, allowing for manual control of the wheelchair via a rear support system.

The objective of our paper is the investigation of the attracting domains, namely the sets consisting of the initial points for which the application of an iterative process leads to the equilibrium positions of a small body, upon which act the gravitational forces of N big bodies arranged in a ring-type configuration. We describe the process to form these areas and we investigate their dependence on the two parameters of the system. The results obtained, in many cases show a fractal-type structure of these regions.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study the association between severity of pelvic inflammatory disease at laparoscopy and the probability of achieving a live birth, while accounting for subsequent episodes of pelvic inflammatory disease. STUDY DESIGN: Beginning in 1960 a cohort of 1288 women in Lund, Sweden, who had clinical symptoms of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and who desired pregnancy was followed for up to 24 years. All participants underwent laparoscopy and were categorized by degree of salpingitis: mild (n = 371), moderate (n = 580), or severe (n = 337) pelvic inflammatory disease. Cumulative live birth rates, obtained by life-table analysis, and proportional hazards ratios were compared among women by severity of pelvic inflammatory disease, while accounting for subsequent episodes. RESULTS: The cumulative proportion of women achieving a live birth after 12 years was 90% for women with mild, 82% for women with moderate, and 57% for women with severe pelvic inflammatory disease. The occurrence of subsequent episodes in women with mild pelvic inflammatory disease did not diminish their long-term probability of live birth, whereas it significantly lowered the probability of live birth in women with severe pelvic inflammatory disease. Women with severe disease and subsequent episodes were eight times more likely to fail to achieve live birth compared with women with a single pelvic inflammatory disease episode with mild disease (relative risk 8.1; 95% confidence interval 3.0 to 22.2). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing severity of pelvic inflammatory disease correlates with a lower long-term probability of live birth. Subsequent episodes have a greater impact on women with severe pelvic inflammatory disease at the index episode compared with those with milder disease. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:977-81.)

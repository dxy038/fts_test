Objective
m of the present study was to describe the changes in the activity of ALDH3A1 in saliva in relation to the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. We also measured major salivary antioxidants, salivary peroxidase (SPO) activity and uric acid (UA) concentration.

g saliva samples were collected from 63 women with uncomplicated pregnancies and from 39 healthy women of reproductive age, but not pregnant. Saliva samples were also collected from 10 healthy women with regular menstrual cycles in the early follicular, the mid-cycle and the mid-luteal phase during one menstrual cycle. SPO and ALDH3A1 activity was determined fluorimetrically, whereas UA concentration photometrically.
s
DH3A1 did not vary significantly among phases of menstrual cycle. However, the enzyme activity decreased with the length of pregnancy and in the third trimester is significantly lower than that in the saliva of non-pregnant women.
sions
concentration of UA and in the third trimester the activity of ALDH3A1 in saliva of pregnant women could be a risk factor of, e.g. oral pathologies.

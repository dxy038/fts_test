Monitoring balance and movement has proven useful in many applications ranging from fall risk assessment, to quantifying exercise, studying people habits and monitoring the elderly. Here we present a versatile, wearable instrument capable of providing objective measurements of limb movements for the assessment of motor and balance control abilities. The proposed device allows measuring linear accelerations, angular velocities and heading either online, through wireless connection to a computer, or for long-term monitoring, thanks to its local storage abilities. One or more body parts may be simultaneously monitored in a single or multiple sensors configuration.

Due to the increase in electricity energy consumption and the crisis has been caused by greenhouse gases (GHG), it is now inevitable to use renewable energy. This would mainly be achieved by means of micro-grid that includes aggregated control of some Distributed Generation (DG) units that are grid connected and near the load. Therefore investing for installing new DGs in a micro-grid is needed. This paper investigates DG expansion planning for a micro-grid. A new method is presented employing a multi-objective mathematical programming (MMP) approach. The solution method is based on the augmented &#949;-constraint method. An illustrative example including a wind turbine, a photovoltaic, an electric vehicle, a heat storage tank and a &#956;CHP has been studied in this paper. The results show the efficiency of the proposed method.

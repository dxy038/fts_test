Background and Objective: Mycobacterium leprae is an intracellular micro-organism that is the causative agent of leprosy. This micro-organism has a long division time and does not grow in vitro. For there reasons it is difficult to evaluate the effects of drugs on it. Amongst techniques used for detection of micro-organisms polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is promising. This study was conducted to diagnose lyprosy using two antigens by PCR.
Materials and Methods: In this study by selecting specific M. leprae 36 kDa and 18 kDa antigens, a set of primers were designed for each gene and biopsies from 15 patients were screened for presence of M. leprae by PCR.
Results: Specific segments of M. leprae antigens were replicated in 5 patients with these primers. Conclusion: PCR is a relevant and promising method for M.leprae detection in biopsies of leprosy patients and it can be considered as a method of choice for early leprosy detection, especially in high risk groups.

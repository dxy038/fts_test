Background and Objective: Given the importance of having knowledge about intestinal parasitic infections in rehabilitation centers, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in the disabled.

Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 196 stool specimens obtained from four rehabilitation centers in Golestan province, 2009. Triple fecal samples were collected and examined by direct wet Mount, Formalin-ether concentration technique and Trichrome permanent staining (with optical microscope). 

Results: Of 196 specimens, 24 (12.3%) had parasitic protozoan infection (5 species) and worm (1 species). The prevalence of intestinal protozoa was 11.8 %, and the highest rate of infection was related to Blastocystis hominis (4.2%) and Giardia lamblia (3.1%). The rate of infection was the highest in under 9 and 20-29 years (4.1%) and the lowest in over 40 (0.5%). The prevalence in mentally handicapped was 9.2% and in physically disabled was 2.5%. 

Conclusion: Due to serious complications of Amoebiasis, Giardiasis and other parasitic infections, it is essential to be careful about personal and social hygiene in these centers.

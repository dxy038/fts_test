OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine oxygen free radical activity in the neonate at birth and relate it to umbilical cord blood acid-base status. STUDY DESIGN: A series of 110 singleton deliveries had determination of two lipoperoxides in umbilical cord blood: malondialdehyde and organic hydroperoxide. Umbilical pH, PO2, PCO2, bicarbonate, and base excess were also measured. RESULTS: There was a significant association between lipoperoxides and cord blood pH and base excess. A significant difference existed in the levels of umbilical artery lipoperoxides between nonacidemic and acidemic fetus, as defined by an umbilical arterial pH <7.20. CONCLUSION: There is a positive association between lipoperoxide production and acid-base balance at delivery. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:62-5.)

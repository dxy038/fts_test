This paper proposes a support system which helps in deciding the allocation of resources for newspaper production. The system is structured starting from a covering model with the objective of determining the best sequencing of n tasks in m machines, obeying the schedule of delivery of the tasks. In the application of this model, the problem of sequencing of the printing of the parts of the newspaper is applied. The tasks will be defined based on the characteristic of each of the newspaper parts (amount of black &amp; white and colored pages) and of the capacity of the machines. Some factors can influence in the definition of this sequence. Then, a multicriteria model was developed based on the above mentioned factors that aid in the determination of the priority in which the newspaper parts will be printed

This paper compares power ratings and filtering performance of two hybrid active filters. A novel parallel filter topology is presented and compared with most commonly used series hybrid filter topology. Both filters are composed of a small-rating active part and passive LC compensator. The main objective of the passive part is to compensate reactive power, while the active part is used to improve filtering performance and damp the resonance amplifications of current harmonics. The effectiveness of both hybrid filters is compared by means of real-time digital simulations.

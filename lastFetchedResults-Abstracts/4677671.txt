Nowadays, advances in technology for energy generation and new directions in the electricity industry regulation made distributed generation (DG) to become more widespread, representing significant impacts on the operational characteristics of distribution networks. For this reason, new methods of identification of these impacts are necessary for research and development of new tools and resources that will keep and ease this continue expansion towards DG. Therefore, this paper describes a study of electricity distribution system planning, aiming at an adequate DG sitting for steady-state operation of distribution systems. In addition, the main advantages of the correct DG sitting and the possible disadvantages of the wrong DG location are presented. Hereby, this work intends to develop a multi-objective analysis defining some quantitative and qualitative parameters, using the Bellman-Zadeh methodology to apply weights (importance levels) to each parameter. These parameters may be classified by each energy supplying company. Therefore, this study will allow that any energy supplying company may choose its own parameters with the respective weights, giving focus to the adequate DG location for each distribution system, so much in the main feeder, as well as in any nodes or ramifications of radial networks. Considerations and results described in this paper are part of the Research &amp; Development Program developed by the Companhia Estadual de Energia El&#195;&#169;trica (CEEE) and the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Brazil.

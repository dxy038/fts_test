A new signal subspace technique for beamforming is analyzed and compared using simulated and measured data. The objective is to find a set of array weights to maintain a given low sidelobe radiation pattern, that accommodates specific s in the directions of interferers which may be present in the system due to various interference sources (aircraft body, mutual coupling etc.). The procedure is numerically intensive, since it requires complete analysis of the eigenstructure of the interference covariance matrix. Estimated weights are suitable for offline applications. Performance evaluation is carried out using simulated data as well as measured data. Some of the advantages, associated difficulties and the limitations are investigated.

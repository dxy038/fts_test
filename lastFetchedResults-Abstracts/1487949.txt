The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of succinate on raw and cooked ground beef color. Chubs (n = 10) were divided in half and assigned to either succinate (final w/w concentration of 2.5%) or distilled water. Patties (n = 14 per chub half) were assigned to initial day 0 color and each of 6 treatment combinations, created by crossing 3 packaging types (vacuum, high-oxygen/80% O2, and PVC) with 2 storage times (days 1 and 3). After storage, patties were cooked to either 66 °C or 71 °C. Succinate increased (P &lt; 0.05) ground beef pH and metmyoglobin reducing activity but had no effect (P &gt; 0.05) on raw a* and chroma values. Moreover, succinate decreased (P &lt; 0.05) raw L* values, lipid oxidation, and premature browning for patties packaged in PVC and high-oxygen. Succinate may increase cooked patty redness via its influence on meat pH.

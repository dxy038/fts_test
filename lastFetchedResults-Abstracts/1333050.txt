The new thermo-ecological performance optimization of an absorption heat pump operating between three temperature levels with the losses of heat resistance, internal irreversibility and leakage is analyzed by taking the ecological coefficient of performance (ECOP) as an objective function. The new thermo-ecological criterion takes into account the first and second law of thermodynamics and is defined as the heating rate per unit loss rate of availability. The ecological coefficient of performance has been expressed and maximized in terms of the temperatures of the working fluid in the main components of the system. The corresponding optimal temperatures and other optimum performance parameters have been derived analytically, and the effects of the internal irreversibility, the heat leakage coefficient and the source temperature ratio on the global and optimal performances are discussed. The obtained results may provide a general theoretical tool for the ecological design of absorption heat pumps.

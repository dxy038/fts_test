Objective
A survey was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that female gender would positively affect job satisfaction among obstetrician gynecologists.
Study design
A survey was sent to 500 randomized, age matched American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology members, 50% each men and women: 49.8% responded. Data were analyzed with the Ï‡2 contingency test, Cochran's test for linear trends, Student t tests, and multiple regression.
Results
Women considered their gender an asset in deciding on a career in obstetrics and gynecology, in obtaining jobs, and in maintaining their practices. Men considered that their gender limited their practice options and were more likely to report that they would not choose a career in obstetrics and gynecology if they could choose again. The only significant difference between men and women in measures of obtaining and maintaining a practice was that men were more likely to practice in small urban or rural settings. Men reported higher incomes. Both genders were equally satisfied with their jobs.
Conclusion
Although both genders considered female gender to be an asset in obstetrics and gynecology, this survey showed no difference in their ratings of overall career satisfaction.

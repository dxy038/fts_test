In this paper, we study the single commodity flow problems, optimizing two objectives simultaneously, where the flow values must be integer values. We propose a method that finds all the efficient integer points in the objective space. Our algorithm performs two phases. In the first phase, all integer points on the efficient boundary are found and in the second phase, the efficient integer points that do not lie on the efficient boundary are calculated. In addition, we carry out a computational experiment showing that the number of efficient integer solutions that do not lie on the efficient boundary is greater than the number of integer solutions on the efficient boundary.

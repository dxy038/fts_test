Background&Objective: Atopic diseases are one of the most common chronic conditions in children. A population based matched study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of atopic diseases and this study used to identify its correlation in primary school children aged 6-12 years in Shiraz (Shouthern Iran).
Materials& Methods: This case - control study was carried out in 2228 primary school children. The children were selected using two-stage random sampling from the foureducationl distrincts of for each child. The consultant physician examined the children with positive result. After diagnosis of eczema, utricaria and allergic rhinitis control groups were selected by using matching method (age- sex- school). The correlations of atopic diseases were determined by conditional logestic regression.
Results: The most important results were as follow: Prevalence of diagnosed allergic rhinitis, utricaria and eczema in primary school children estimated in order 5.2% (boys: 5.2% & girls: 5.12%), 3.6% (boys: 3.57% & girls 3.7%) and 1.6% (boys: 1.53% & girls: 1.7%). There was no significant association between atopic diseases and birth order, social class, parent's education. parent's smoking and period of breast-feeding. An increased risk of childhood atopic diseases were associated with familiar history of allergic rhinitis (P<0.05), familiar history of utricaria (P<0.05) and familiar history of eczema (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Our study confirmed that familiar atopic diseases were significant predictors of childhood allergic rhinitis, utricaria and eczema among school children in Shiraz.

The nuclear fuel of light water power reactors are manufactured by powder metallurgy. This is also the method that is used for the production of fuels containing minor actinides that have high activity and long life. Given their radiotoxicity, it is necessary to simplify the manufacturing process to the maximum, limiting dissemination and retention of matter. In addition, the fuel must have a mostly open porosity. Implementation of particles of a few hundred micrometers and controlled cohesion could meet this dual objective. However, it should be ensured that the mechanical strength of compacts before sintering is sufficient without adding binder. The phenomena that occur during the manufacture of compact are thus analyzed and quantified. It is shown that only a portion of the particles breaks upon application of a stress up to 600 MPa and it is possible to detect this fragmentation by acoustic emission (AE).

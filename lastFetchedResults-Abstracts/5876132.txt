Switched mode power supplies (SMPS) have become an indispensable part of modem electronic systems. In this paper, a generalized MATLAB/SIMULINK modeling techniques is presented. The proposed techniques have been successfully integrated into SMPS design course at Lunghua University, Taiwan. The main objective of the course is to teach final year undergraduate students and first year MasterÂ´s students how to design an SMP in real life. Positive response from students indicates that the proposed technique is useful for SMPS design courses.

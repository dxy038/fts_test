In this paper, we present a combination of the Terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) technique. This approach called Fuzzy Terminal Sliding Mode Control (FTSMC) can compensate the chattering problem caused by (TSMC). In addition, this technique can decrease significantly the rule number and present the robustness compared with the parameters uncertainty and external disturbance. We applied the proposed (FTSMC) to control of the position and the velocity of each joint of a robot arm actuated by pneumatic artificial muscles. The simulation results are presented for objective to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

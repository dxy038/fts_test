This paper highlights the space time frequency block codes (STFBC) that exploit spatial, time and frequency diversity can be designed using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). However, OFDM suffers from ICI. Hence, a new OFDM-MIMO using STFBC method combining ICI-SC scheme is investigated to reduce ICI and error correction effectively. The technique of reducing ICI using Space Time Frequency diversity is recognized to be an ultimate means to achieve the objective of this work and providing diversity at the same time. The system developed is analyzed with CFO and compared in terms of BER performance. It can be seen from the simulation results that the system developed improved the BER performance with high diversity order and successfully reduce ICI effect.

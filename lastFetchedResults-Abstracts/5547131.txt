This paper presents a fast second-order derivative-based intra-field deinterlacing algorithm. The algorithm uses two second-order derivatives along the pro-diagonal and anti-diagonal directions, and one vertical direction difference. The algorithm estimates the missing signal with a linear average of the closest pixels along the direction that has the smaller second-order derivative of the image intensity. The algorithm is compared with other benchmark algorithms in terms of PSNR and SSIM objective quality measures and deinterlacing speed. It was found to provide desirable performance and the best quality - speed tradeoff among the algorithms researched.

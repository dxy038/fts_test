This paper mainly presents the general model and solution of multi-objective linear programming problem under fuzzy constraint and An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the approach. Also multi-objective fuzzy linear programming problem which contains the solution to the objective function with fuzziness or both the objective function and the constraint condition with fuzziness in multi-objective linear programming problem is discussed.

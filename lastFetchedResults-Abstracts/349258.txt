Objective
We study burst-like patterns of epileptiform discharges in non-convulsive status epilepticus (SE).
Methods
Epileptiform burst-like transients were identified by estimating the amplitude envelope of the EEG signal, and recurrence and similarities were identified by pairwise matching in the time-domain.
Results
We identified similarities in the onset of a significant fraction of the epileptiform bursts, and a bimodal distribution of the burst durations.
Conclusions
Bursts of epileptiform discharges during a non-convulsive SE are manifestations of multiple patterns of recurring brain states.
Significance
Quantitative description of ictal phenomena in epilepsy and status epilepticus adds to the knowledge of abnormal brain behavior and may assist in improved patient care.

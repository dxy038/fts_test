The paper considers two efficient improved artificial reverberation algorithms built with an early Schroeder´s and a late reverberator: modified Schroeder´s or an absorbent all-pass. Both of them simulate the behavior of a real concert hall by taking into account the variation with frequency of the reverberation time. Several reverberation algorithms can be found in the literature, but very few design and performance analysis hints are given. Our paper includes a detailed design of the reverberators, simulations are run for each algorithm, acoustic parameters are computed and an objective performance analysis is carried out

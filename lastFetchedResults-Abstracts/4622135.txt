According to the characteristics of the multi-resource, multi-depot and multi-objective emergency scheduling problem, this paper establishes a multi-objective mathematical model with the goal of the shortest time and the smallest cost. We propose an algorithm for multi-objective fuzzy decision using the fuzzy ideal point method, which transforms the multi-objective decision into the single-objective programming question. This algorithm is applied in the provincial level emergency management information demonstration platform, and runs successfully.

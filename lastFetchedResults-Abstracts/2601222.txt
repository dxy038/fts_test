Background and Objective: The importance of menopause is due to the onset of menopausal symptoms and complications. Hot Flushes are one of the most common and earliest of them, for which treatments such as hormone therapy and nonpharmaceutical methods have been proposed. In this study due to the tendency of most patients in choosing nonpharmaceutical methods, we evaluated the effect of acupressure on hot flushes.

Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was randomly conducted on 90 subjects (30 in KI1, 30 in LI4, and 30 in HT7 groups) selected through purposive sampling in Shahid Motahari clinic, Shiraz in 2014. Acupressure was applied on KI1, LI4, and HT7 acupoints by rotational method twice a week each time for 5 minutes for 5 weeks. The position of the KI1 acupoint is located on the sole of the foot, at the junction of the anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3 of the line connecting the bases of the second and third toes with the heel. The HT7 acupoint is located at the wrist crease (on the radial side of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon) between the ulna and the pisiform bones. Afterwards, the data were entered into the SPSS statistical software (v.16) and analyzed using ANOVA.

Results: The results showed a significant difference in the intensity of hot flashes in LI4 and KI1 groups (P&lt;0.001), but no significant change was observed in the control group (P=0.233). Moreover, no significant difference was observed within the three groups regarding the duration of hot flashes (P&gt;0.05). Nonetheless, a significant difference was found between the intervention groups and the control group with respect to the frequency of hot flashes (P&lt;0.001).

Conclusion: Our results show that acupressure is significantly effective in treating hot flashes. Therefore, acupressure can be recommended as an inexpensive and easily applicable treatment method.

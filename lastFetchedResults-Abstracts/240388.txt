In this paper, based on steady-state models of flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices, the sizing of static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) controllers in transmission network is formed as an optimization problem. The objective of this problem is to reduce the transmission losses in the network. The optimization problem is solved using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The Newtonâ€“Raphson load flow algorithm is modified to consider the insertion of the SSSC devices in the network. Numerical examples, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, are introduced. In addition, a novel model of a three-phase voltage source converter (VSC) that is suitable for series connected FACTS a controller is introduced. The model is verified by simulation using Power System Blockset (PSB) and Simulink software.

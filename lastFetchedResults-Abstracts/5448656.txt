Vehicles which operate in agricultural row crops, need to strictly follow the established wheel tracks. Errors in navigation where the robot sways of its path with one or more wheels may damage the crop plants. The specific focus of this paper is on an agricultural robot operation in row cultures. The robot performs machine vision detecting weeds within the crop rows and treats the weeds by high precision drop-on-demand application of herbicide. The navigation controller of the robot needs to follow the established wheel tracks and minimize the camera system offset from the seed row. The problem has been formulated as a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) problem with the objective of keeping the vision modules centered over the seed rows, and constraining the wheel motion to the defined wheel tracks. The system and optimization problem has been implemented in Python using the Casadi framework. The implementation has been evaluated through simulations of the system, and compared with a PD controller. The NMPC approach display advantages and better performance when facing the path constraints of operating in row crops.

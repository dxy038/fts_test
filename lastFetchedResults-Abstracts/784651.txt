Background: During the course of the Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), many patients need to be
hospitalized either due to the direct consequences of the disease itself, or due to associated diseases or life event.
The objective of the present study was to determine predictive factors for hospitalisation in AD patients.
Methods: Six hundred eighty-six AD patients from the French Network on AD (REAL-FR) were follow up and
assessed every 6 months for 2 years. During follow-up, all events occurring between two visits, in particular
hospital admissions were carefully recorded. Results: Annual incidences for hospitalizations were 26.13% (95%
CI, 22.52 to 29.74). After two years, 202 subjects were hospitalized for 296 hospitalizations. Three variables
were found to be significant predictors of hospitalisations in the multivariate regression model: dependency for
ADL (RR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.70-0.95, p=0.0091), the drug use (use of four or more drugs) (RR=1.83; 95% CI:
1.31-2.58, p=0.0005) and the NPI score (RR=1.011; 95% CI: 1.001-1.022, p=0.0427). For hospitalizations due to
the direct consequences of the disease itself, three variables were found to be significant predictors of
hospitalisations: dependency for ADL (RR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.53-0.88, p=0.0033), the caregiver burden Zarit score
(RR=1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p=0.0079) and the NPI score (RR=1.07; 95% CI: 1.03-1.12, p=0.0007).
Conclusions: Intervention to support patients and caregivers to manage loss of ADL may be a practical approach
to reduce hospitalisation. Prevention of drug use or optimal treatment of associated diseases in AD seem to be
also a challenge to decrease the rates of hospitalization or readmission, and the costs of providing care

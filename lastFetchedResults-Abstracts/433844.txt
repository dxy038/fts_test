Tracheal stenosis is a rare complication that follows operations for congenital heart disease in the newborn period. We report the case of an infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who developed symptomatic tracheal stenosis 5 months after a first-stage Norwood operation. The combined surgical procedure of a bidirectional Glenn anastomosis and a tracheoplasty under cardiopulmonary bypass was undertaken.

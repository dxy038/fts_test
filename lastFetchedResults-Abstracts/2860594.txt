In this communication, the investigated study deals with on-line parametric identification in a one-dimensional thermal system. The main objective is the determination of the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity considering noisy temperature measurements. In such a way, the identification problem is written as a minimization one. Since inverse heat conduction problems are ill-posed, a regularization method has to be numerically implemented. Thus, the conjugate gradient method (a well-known iterative regularization method) has been adapted for on-line purposes.

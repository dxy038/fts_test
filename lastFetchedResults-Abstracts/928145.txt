During last few decades Iran has experienced a massive flow of afghan immigrants. The majority of afghan immigrants are typically unskilled and illegal workers. They expect lower wages than their Iranian counterparts and are ready to work in troublous conditions. Keeping in mind that a high percentage of Afghan immigrants are working in the construction sector, it is expected that most effects take place in this part of the economy. This study aims at investigating the nature of the causal relationship between Afghan immigrants and investment in construction sector usingautoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing procedure and Granger-causality within vector error correction model (VECM) based on annual data spanning the period between 1976 and 2006. Results of the ARDL bounds test are supportive of the theory that the variables are in a long-run equilibrium level relationship. On the other hand,results of the Granger-causality tests support the existence of a long-run, bidirectional causality between immigration and investment in construction sector. While in the short run there is unidirectional Granger causality running from investment in construction sector to immigration.

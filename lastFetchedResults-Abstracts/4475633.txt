As the scheduling objective of taking the maximal profit of each task consisting of work pieces submitted bycustomers, a non-cooperation game model for batch scheduling is presented. In order to effectively find the Nash equilibrium point of the model, a strategy about multiple transport and gapless equivalent batch splitting is adopted. A hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm based on hill-climbing method is designed. A numerical case study is carried out to demonstrate the validity of scheduling methods.

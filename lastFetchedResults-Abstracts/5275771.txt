To achieve high efficiency of the power drive, a novel low cost and light weight front-end diode rectifier with bidirectional power switch is implemented to achieve unity power factor and low current harmonic distortion. The multilevel inverter is controlled to synthesis numbers of output voltages level, which results in low voltages harmonic distortion, low voltage stress and high power capability. Furthermore, several pulse-width modulation strategies (PWM) for rear-end multilevel inverter is further investigated in this work. Proposed rear-end multilevel inverter offers better efficiency and quality on the AC output terminal without any bulky and expensive LC filter. To confirm the converter performance, obtained results are presented all of which confirm the predicted converter waveforms.

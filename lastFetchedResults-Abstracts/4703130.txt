Presents high-precision control of a magnetically levitated (maglev) linear actuator with novel geometric configuration. The linear actuator is used as a unit actuator in the development of a maglev instrument with six-axis nanopositioning capability. The novel configuration in this design concept leads to a lightweight and compact size. The objective of development of this maglev linear actuator is to verify the underlying theory and fundamental working principles. The device allows a linear motion range of &#177;500 &#956;m with nanoscale positioning resolution. We present electromechanical design, controller design and implementation, and preliminary closed-loop experimental results with various step sizes for this linear actuator.

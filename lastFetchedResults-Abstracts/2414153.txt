Background and Objective: The neuroprotective effect of uric acid as a natural antioxidant on neurodegenerative diseases has been proposed repeatedly, but its antiapoptotic effect on spinal neurons has not been examined yet. Due to the critical role of sensory neurons in the improvement of functional outcome in neuroprotective strategies, the antiapoptotic effect of uric acid on dorsal root ganglions was investigated.
Materials and Methods: In this study, 10 two-day-old neonate rats were subdivided into experimental and control groups. In both groups right sciatic nerve was transected. In the experimental group immediately following surgery 10mg/kg uric acid and in control group the same volume of normal saline was injected intraperitoneally. Five days following axotomy, bilateral L5 dorsal root ganglia in both groups were prepared for morphometric cell counting and TUNEL assay.
Results: In the control group, in axotomized side compared to intact side, 37.41% of the sensory neurons were lost, indicating the efficiency of axotomy model in the induction of cell death in sensory neurons. The results of TUNEL assay approved the apoptotic type of neural cell death. Comparison of the control and experimental groups indicated that intraperitoneal injection of uric acid could not inhibit apoptosis of dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons. 
Conclusion: This study illustrated that uric acid has not any significant neuroprotective effect on axotomized sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia.

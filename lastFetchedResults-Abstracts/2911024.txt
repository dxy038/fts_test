The objective of this study is to analyse the interoperability between pan-European eCall and Russian ERA-GLONASS in-vehicle emergency call systems. The analysis is based on a definition of interoperability from International Telecommunication Union and related system standards of eCall and ERA-GLONASS. The authors results indicate that the core functions of both systems - minimum set of data (MSD) transmission at the start of the call and establishing the related voice connection between vehicle occupants and a public safety answering point - will be available in the interworking scenarios analysed in this study. However, not all features of both systems will be available in use cases with interworking between the systems, such as SMS-based MSD retransmission. The study indicates that further empirical tests are required to obtain more information on practical interoperability between the systems.

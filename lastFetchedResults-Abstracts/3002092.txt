Mobile satellite networks are now being utilized to provide complementary service coverage to their terrestrial counterparts. The migration from voice-dominated service delivery to a data-centric environment implies that the choice of one particular access network over another will need to take into account many different criteria, which previously need not have been considered. For this reason, it is important that a suitable decision making algorithm is designed to ensure that all of the different characteristics of the system are taken into account when making the segment selection for a particular service delivery. In this paper, a segment selection algorithm based on the fuzzy multiple objective decision making algorithm is presented. This algorithm is analyzed to show how the overall performance of a multi-access segment network can be improved by varying the relative importance of certain service and network characteristics.

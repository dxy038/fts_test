This paper presents a 2.45 GHz patch antenna over an EBG substrate with the objective of higher radiation efficiency and compact operation in close proximity to a lossy medium, both of which are critical for body worn antennas. To achieve compact size, several sizes of EBG are included and the individual antenna efficiency and radiation pattern are studied. From these results, the EBG substrate demonstrates great improvement of the antenna efficiency but its size has a considerable effect on efficiency when the antenna is used in close proximity to the human body.

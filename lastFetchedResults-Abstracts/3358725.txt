For vehicles using grid power to charge the battery, traction circuit components are not engaged during the charging time, so there is a possibility to use them in the charger circuit to have an onboard integrated charger. The battery charger can be galvanically isolated or nonisolated from the grid. Different examples of isolated or nonisolated integrated chargers are reviewed and explained. Moreover, a novel isolated-high-power three-phase battery charger based on a split-phase permanent-magnet motor and its winding configuration is presented in this paper. The proposed charger is a bidirectional high-power charger with a unity power factor operation capability that has high efficiency.

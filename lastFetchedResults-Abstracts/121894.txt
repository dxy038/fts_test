Background : One of the causes of mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is ventricular tachycardia. Potassium (K) level disturbances is one of the probable causes of ventricular tachycardia in patients with AML
Objective : To determine the relationship between serum potassium level and frequency of ventricular tachycardia in early stages of AMI.
Methods : Through a cross-sectional study on 162 patients with AMI in the C.C. U of Nour hospital in Isfahan (1999) , the patients' serum potassium level was classified into three groups: 1) K<3.8 meq/lit , 2) 3.8K<4.5meq/lit and 3) K?4.5 meq/lit. Then , the incidence of ventricular tachycardia in the first 24 hours after AMI was determined in each group by Chi square statistical method.
Findings : The frequency of ventricular tachycardia in the first 24 hours after AMI in K< 3.8 meq/lit , 3.85K<4.5 megllit and K>4.5 megllit groups were 19.0% , 9.6% and 9.9% respectively. The frequency of this arrhythmia in the first group as compared with the second and the third group was significant (P<0.05).
Conclusion : Hypokalemia increases the probability of ventricular tachycardia in patients with AMI. Thus , the follow up and treatment of Hypokalemia in these patients is of special importance.

In late 1978, the U. S. Army Missile Command (MICOM) began a task to develop an advanced G&amp;C system for Future Army Modular Missiles (FAMMS). G&amp;C systems were scheduled for investigation and evaluation in a six-degree-of-freedom digital simulation which models a high perfomance air defense interceptor. The FAMMS interceptor initially had an analog autopilot with a rate command switching to an acceleration command early in the flight. In order to be compatible with the latest technology, the autopilot had to be redesigned. In the design process, it had to meet certain classic servo performance criteria while using strictly digital techniques. A rate-commanded autopilot was an incidental product of the acceleration-commanded autopilot design and was capable of controlling the interceptor if required. However, the principle objective of designing an acceleration autopilot was accomplished and shown to yield the results expected.

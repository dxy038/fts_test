Calculation methods of the signal formation parameters at the central station and of selective conversion in a mobile terminal receiver of the vehicle moving at speed of 200-300 km per hour are described. This solution provides high-rate services (up to 12 Mbit per second) for subscribers moving on the highway or high-speed railway using a hybrid radio over fiber network. Objective of research: calculation methods development of the signal formation and conversion parameters. A signal is a set of services in the form of OFDM-symbols, the total bandwidth of which is much higher than 1 GHz.

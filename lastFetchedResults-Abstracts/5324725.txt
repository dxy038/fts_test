Practical considerations for mapping the traffic and QoS requirements of TCP/IP applications to ATM resources on an intercontinental ATM WAN were one of the objectives of the Canada-Germany research activity &#8220;Support for Multimedia Protocols on International High-Speed Connections&#8221;. The focus of our research was the study of transport connection admission control policies for bundling TCP/IP connections with different QoS requirements in a pilot trans-Atlantic ATM WAN environment between Canada and Germany. To allow for an ATM WAN-ATM LAN comparison, TCP bundling strategies were provided using the BALI local ATM testbed in Berlin. TCP/IP performance experiments using bundled connections that belong to different application classes and unidirectional and bidirectional bundled connections that belong to the same application class are presented in this paper. The impact of the TCP window size, the propagation delay and the operating system environment on the QoS of bundled TCP/IP connections are evaluated

The principal objective of this study was to identify the experiences of, and issues relevant to, women in senior police management with a view to identifying barriers and opportunities for women who reach senior management positions (i.e., at the level of Inspector or above, and equivalent non-sworn levels). Male and female participants, both sworn and non-sworn, from all Australian police jurisdictions were mailed a questionnaire which included a wide range of questions regarding personal characteristics and experiences within the police organization. These included issues such as career barriers, self esteem, organizational commitment, experience with mentors, and personal and professional development opportunities. A total of 127 questionnaires were returned. The findings suggest that women experience discrimination and not being a part of 'the men's club' are barriers to their career. In addition, the conflict between work and family due to inflexible working hours was more of an issue for women. On the other hand, there were many similarities between male and female managers which may be due to the fact that women in this study had already successfully negotiated through a strongly masculine organization and had adapted to the culture. Recommendations are provided to assist in the management of diversity in police organization.

In this paper, a new multi-objective dynamic rebalance scheduling model for the mixed-model assembly line is introduced to minimize the idle time of stations with the given resource and balance the workload between stations and within stations. The scheduling model includes a priority queue scheduler, a cyclic production strategy named optimal part set (OPS) and a sliding window scheme for processing products stream. Then, a multi-objective dynamic rebalance scheduling algorithm base on this model is presented, and it is used for balancing the workload during the production process. The test instance LA01 in job shop scheduling benchmark described by S.Lawrence is applied to verify this dynamic rebalance scheduling algorithm. Experiments show that the idle time in all stations for all arrived orders has reduced significantly when this algorithm is applied. With this algorithm, the idle time will decrease when working cycle is extended. But the average workload difference between stations and within stations for all orders will increase with working cycles extended.

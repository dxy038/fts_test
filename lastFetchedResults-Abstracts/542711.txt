BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Furcation involvement is thought to have a strong negative effect on prognosis. Various treatments have been proposed for treatment of furcation defects. Regeneration is the treatment of choice in this type of defect. Recently an OCHS (Oily Calcium hydroxide Suspension) has also been supposed to support periodontal regeneration. The aim of this study was clinical and radiographic evaluation of effect of OSTEORA on class II furction defects in patient with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: In this clinical trial 24 class II furcation defect divided into two groups. All the patients received phase I treatment (scaling & root planing). Test group treated with access flap surgery and the application of Control group treated with access flap surgery alone. The fallowing parameters were recoded: horizontal clinical attachment level (H-CAL) vertical clinical attachment level (V-CAL), gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), furcation vertical component (FVC), furcation to alveolar crest (FAC), fornix to base of defect (FBD), furcation horizontal component (FHC). A periapical radiograph was taken in parallel method before and 6 months after surgery and they were analyzed by digital subtraction. FINDINGS: No significant difference was in mean change of investigation parameter among two groups. In study group only gingival recession increased significantly after 6 months from 0.67± 0.778 to 1.375± 0.9324 (p=0.04). In control group only gingival recession increased significantly from 0.58±0.793 to 1.583±1.379 (p=0.002), and VPD decreased significantly from 3.17±1.115 to 1.83±0.835 (p=0.015). Radiographic changes among two groups didn't show significant difference. CONCLUSION: No difference was found between the test and control site. None of treatment modalities improved periodontal regeneration in class II furcation defects.

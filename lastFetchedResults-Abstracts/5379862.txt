A complex multiple decision-making problem with unknown objective function is studied. The problem has three special characters that objective functions of decision-makers are difficult to be quantitative and structured, preference of the decision-makers is changing during the decision-making process, and the solution space is huge. The structure model of IDSS integrating interactive evolutionary computation that deals with the proposed problem is developed. The functions of every module in the model are discussed in detail and the implementation of the main module is presented. The simulation of new fashion design computer aided system shows the proposed model is rational

A GA based method is proposed to obtain the optimal capture points for constraining a moving prismatic 2D object using multi agents. Frictionless point contact at the robot and object interface is assumed and form closure is obtained using accessibility angle. An objective function is optimized that minimizes the contact forces and the number of robots required for form closure. The robots first avoid obstacles and converge on the C-space surrounding the object. After the object is captured the mobile robots reorient themselves optimally and push the object to the goal point. Simulation results prove the proposed method.

In this paper, a hybrid craziness-based PSO with differential evolution (CRPSO-DE) algorithm is presented to solve complex, nonlinear, non-differentiable electric power system problems of combined economic and emission dispatch (CEED) with different cost functions and constraints. Traditionally, electric power systems are operated in such a way that the total fuel cost is minimized regardless of emissions produced. With increased requirements for environmental protection, alternative strategies are required. The proposed CRPSO-DE optimization algorithm attempts to reduce the production of atmospheric emissions (SO<sub>x</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> oxides), caused by the operation of fossil-fueled thermal generation, along with the reduction of fuel cost. Such conflicting objectives are achieved by including equivalent cost of emissions as a part along with the fuel cost part in the multi-objective CEED optimization problem. The efficacy of the proposed optimization algorithm is tested on some test power systems taken from the literature and the results obtained are compared with those obtained by other methods reported in the state-of-the art literature. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for solving the CEED problems.

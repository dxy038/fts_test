A solid-state, pulse-width-modulated (PWM) phase shifter, based on gate-turn-off )GTO) thyristors or other valves with force commutation capabilities, is described. Besides serving the phase-shifter function, it offers regulated control over three independent quantities: the real power passing through it and the VAR (volt-ampere reactive) on both sides to which it is connected. The power transferred can be bidirectional, and the VArs can be leading or lagging. Digital simulations show that the PWM phase-shifter reported here is capable of regulated control of bidirectional real power flow and independent regulated control of positive or negative VArs on both sides of the phase shifter

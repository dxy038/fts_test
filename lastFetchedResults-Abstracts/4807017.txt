We develop a 3D knowledge pyramid/prism model to structure the relationships of (i) lower-level learning, (ii) `optional&#194;&#191; knowledge bases, (iii) concurrent knowledge, and (ii) new knowledge; so one may view the learning needs of a higher-level learning objective. Our paradigm stems from Bloom&#194;&#191;s taxonomy of learning, but has the advantage of supporting `just-in-time&#194;&#191; and `learn-by-doing&#194;&#191; delivery, teaching and learning styles. We illustrate the paradigm through the BMMKP (the 3D knowledge pyramid/prism model of the highest-level, batch-means-method learning objective for our language-focused, undergraduate course). The BMMKP reveals how highly dependent and fully integrated this learning is to calculus, probability, statistics, and queuing theory-regardless of the simulation modeling language chosen to teach in the course. The BMMKP is then used to develop a set of lower-level learning objectives for the undergraduate course. The 3D pyramid/prism approach should lend itself well as a communication tool for visualizing other simulation learning objectives.

The primary goal of this experimental research was to replicate Nakahara's (2005)
experiment on Iranian learners' acquisition of polysemous words, and to see whether
the underlying meaning approach is an effective strategy to teach polysemous words to
low proficiency learners or not. The participants were 46 female first grade students
with the age range of 14 to 15 studying in two intact classes of the same high school
instructed by the same teacher (researcher). To achieve the research objective, the
participants were taught 40 polysemous words using two distinct approaches: one
traditional sense selection approach, and the other more modern reference specification
approach through the presentation of the underlying meaning. To analyze the collected
data, t- test was used. Results of the analysis indicated that the application of
underlying meaning approach was more beneficial to Iranian learners than the
traditional alternative; that is sense selection approach. The study ends with the
pedagogical implications of this principled approach for teaching polysemous words
that both EFL teachers in teaching and learners in learning have difficulty with.

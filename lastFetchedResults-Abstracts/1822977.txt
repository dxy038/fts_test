Objective
rpose of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin E on alveolar bone loss (ABL) and anxiety in rats with ligature-induced experimental periodontitis (EP).
al and methods
 rats were subjected to ligature-induced EP and treated with vitamin E (500 mg/kg, orally) for 9 days. Then anxiety was tested using the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test. All of the animals were euthanised by cervical dislocation on day 11. ABL was analysed morphometrically and histopathologically. Lipid peroxidation quantification, activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase and immunohistochemistry to tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) and inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) were also tested.
s
uced a marked inflammatory process and intense ABL. Treatment with vitamin E decreased inflammatory reaction, prevented malondialdehyde formation and reduced the immunoreactivity to iNOS, but did not decrease ABL. Vitamin E had an anxiogenic effect on rats with or without EP.
sions
n E may have potential to reduce oxidative damage and inflammatory response in EP but does not prevent ABL. Attention should be given to indiscriminate use of vitamin E due to the risk of causing anxiety in patients.

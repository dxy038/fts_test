The objective of this research is to canvas the landscape of existing standards and guidelines relating to electronic personal health records (PHRs). Here, we propose a consensus standard for PHRs consisting of 14 data components, 11 of which should be essential for all PHRs and 3 additional recommended data components, as well as 4 key features. Through a survey of existing commercially PHR vendors, we observe a low level of adoption of existing standards.

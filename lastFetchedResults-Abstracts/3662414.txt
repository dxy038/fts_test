The overall objective of this sequence of papers [1]-[4] is to present the development of a single technique that simultaneously calculates several widely used indices of power system reliability. The sequence has already discussed generation and load models, indices of reliability used for generation planning, and models to represent multiple boiler-multiple turbine units and partial capacity outages. This part brings up for examination what the authors believe to be some of the more relevant generation planning problems. The paper presents methods for recognizing the effects of delays in unit installations and for implementing the various techniques for handling the calculation of frequency indices for two interconnected systems. Computer programs and numerical examples of the methods presented are also discussed.

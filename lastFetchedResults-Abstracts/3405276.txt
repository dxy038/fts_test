The growing use of &#8220;computer algebra&#8221; (or &#8220;symbolic computation&#8221;) makes it very attractive for employment in engineering education. Also the compromise between the analytic and numerical methods may be very useful. The objective of this paper is to draw the attention of broad engineering and educational circles to the enormous capabilities of symbolic computation and, via a few examples, show their application to the teaching of engineering

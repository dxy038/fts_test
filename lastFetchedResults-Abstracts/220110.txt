Introduction: Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Is one of the most common factors which
causes pericarditis following suffering from lung tuberculosis. To diagnose pericarditi s
caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis, methods like PPD test, culture and staining of
pericardial fluid , biopsy of pericardial tissue and peR of pericardial fluid are used. In
this study, level of specific sensitivity of PPD test for diagnosis of pericardial
tuberculosis has been evaluated .
MateriaJs&Methods: 100 patients admitted at the academic hospitals of Shahid
Behshti and Irnan Kbomaini medieal universities underwent experimental observations
for diagnosis of primary perieardial tuberculosis during 1981-4. First PPD test was
done, then a sampling of pericardial fluid and' biopsy of pericardial tissue were
accomplished. The pericard ial was used for fluid staining by Ziehl-Neelsen and culture
on Leuin - Estein Jonson media. After fixation and H&E staining, the necessary studies
continued to eonsider the cheesy granuloma and tuberculo sis bucilli.
Findings: In this study, out of the 100 selected patients, 40 cases were diagnosed as
suffering from perieardial tuberculosis by laboratory tests, all the cases were
eomplaining of tuberculosis symptoms. Culture ofpericardial fluid in 18 patients (45%),
and pericardial biopsy in 18 ones (45%), staining of pericardial fluid in 9 patients
(22.5%) and tuberculin cutanous test in 30 patients (75%) proved positive, while false
negative cutanous tuberculin test in] 0 patients (25%) and false positive results in (45%)
ofpatients were significantly were achieved .

In this paper, multi-objective uniform-diversity genetic algorithm (MUGA) with a diversity preserving mechanism
called the -elimination algorithm is used for Pareto optimization of 5-degree of freedom vehicle vibration model
considering the five conflicting functions simultaneously. The important conflicting objective functions that have been
considered in this work are, namely, vertical acceleration of seat, vertical velocity of forward tire, vertical velocity of
rear tire, relative displacement between sprung mass and forward tire and relative displacement between sprung mass
and rear tire. Further, different pairs of these objective functions have also been selected for 2-objective optimization
processes. The comparison of the obtained results with those in literature demonstrates the superiority of the results of
this work. It is shown that the results of 5-objective optimization include those of 2-objective optimization and,
therefore, provide more choices for optimal design of vehicle vibration model.

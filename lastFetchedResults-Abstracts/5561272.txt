Arterial behavior analysis requires an accurate and dynamic knowledge of the stimuli and reactions involved. Belonging parameters quantification is performed by a data acquisition process and the application of existing models. However, it turns essentially to analyze the adjustment degree of the aforementioned models in terms of the arterial tree. Blood flow behavior as well as wall shear rate and the arterial compliance are anatomic location dependent. The main objective of the present work is to analyze the existing functional relationships between arterial wall and blood flow, in a particular place (brachial artery), in order to asses the specific model applicability, in cases such Poiseuille or Womersley models. In addition, due to the characteristic of the study, gender differential dynamic responses will be evaluated.

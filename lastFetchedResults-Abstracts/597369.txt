The primary objective of the study is to examine the relationship between knowledge management processes and organizational performance, and to analyze the mediating effects of intellectual capital on the relationship between knowledge management processes and organizational performance. The self-administered questionnaire was distributed to the owner or senior manager of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) multimedia super corridor (MSC) status organizations. A total of 289 useable questionnaires were collected from them. The results reveal that knowledge management processes were confirmed as the antecedents of intellectual capital; and intellectual capital was established as a mediator between knowledge management processes and organizational performance. Findings show that the combination of knowledge management processes as organizational capability with intellectual capital as organizational strategic assets facilitates improvements in organizational performance.

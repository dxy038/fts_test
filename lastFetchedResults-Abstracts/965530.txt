Background: With regard to wide spectrum application of microwave in human life, its biological effects on tissues are still under debate. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of 950 MHz microwave radiation on morphometric changes of prostate in rabbit.
Methods: In this experimental study, 18 New Zealand male rabbits (11-13 weeks old) were randomly divided into control, 3 W and 6 W groups in Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in 2012. The rabbits in the experimental groups were exposed to simulated 950 MHz and 3 or 6 W microwave radiation 2 hours a day for 2 weeks. After one week rest, the rabbits were sacrificed using anesthetic drugs and the prostate tissue samples were prepared. After preparing microscopic slides, villous height, villous thickness and muscle layer thickness were measured. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s test. 
Findings: The villous height was significantly decreased in the 3 W group compared to the control and 6 W groups while it was significantly increased in the 6 W group compared to the control group. The villous thickness was increased in both experimental groups compared to the control group but the difference was statistically significant for 6 W group. Increased villous thickness was not different between the experimental groups. The muscle layer thickness was significantly increased in both experimental groups compared to the control group.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, it seems that the microwave radiation with 950 MHz frequency has negative effects on morphometric changes of prostate in rabbit.

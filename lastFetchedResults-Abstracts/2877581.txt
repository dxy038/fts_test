A controlled restart in differential evolution (DE) is proposed. The conditions of restart are derived from the difference of maximum and minimum values of the objective function and the estimated maximum distance among the points in the current population. The restart is applied in a competitive-adaptation variant of DE. This DE algorithm with the controlled restart is used in the solution of the benchmark problems defined for the CEC 2014 competition. Two control parameters of restart are set up intuitively. The population size, which is the only control parameter of competitive-adaptation variant of DE, is set up to the values based on a short preliminary experimentation.

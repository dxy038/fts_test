With RF (radio frequency) energy transfer capability, an access point not only communicates with wireless nodes, but also supplies them with energy for data transmission. In this paper, we consider the wireless network with RF energy transfer. To support quality of service (QoS) in the network, we introduce an admission control policy, which decides whether incoming nodes can be admitted into the network or not. Also, the policy determines the RF energy transfer strategy to maximize the reward of the network, while the performance requirement in terms of node throughput is maintained at the target level. We present optimization and queueing models to obtain an optimal admission control policy and performance measures of the node in the network, respectively. The performance evaluation shows that the admission control policy can successfully achieve the network objective and meet the node constraint on QoS requirement.

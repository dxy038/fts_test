In this paper we review the research activities on optical gain control techniques of optical amplifier. Several configurations are explored to increase robustness to power transients. Optimized amplifier design with bidirectional operation is achieved. In particular we explore potentialities and limitations of Erbium-doped waveguide amplifier for optical networks. Note that all results are applicable for Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers once the parameters are properly scaled.

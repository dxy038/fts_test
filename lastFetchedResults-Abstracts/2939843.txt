In the last decade there has been a growing interest in the assessment of investments in advanced manufacturing technologies (AMTs). Several authors have pointed out the shortcomings of traditional financial techniques, and have suggested non-conventional approaches, among which are fuzzy models. The objective of the paper is twofold: (1) to show the potentials of the fuzzy set theory for supporting the appraisal and selection of investments in AMTs, in relation to the other major approaches proposed in the literature; and (2) to suggest a reference framework for the application of some fuzzy models to the selection of investments in AMTs

Spatial data are usually far from perfect, and the spatial analysis process is full of various kinds of uncertainty. The Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence reasoning model provides an adequate theoretical basis for managing uncertainties in multi-resources geological spatial data integration. In this paper, the uncertainty mapping method of mineral resources prospectivity for iron deposits is performed in the Eastern Kunlun Mountains, China, using the Dempster-Shafer model and GIS methods, mainly including belief function assignment, evidence combination and uncertainty assessment. Nine evidence maps were selected after summarizing and analyzing the geological setting of ore-forming processes in the eastern Kunlun Mountains. The relative objective prospectivity assessment for iron resources is suggested in this region, for which the belief, disbelief, plausibility and uncertainty maps of iron deposits in the Eastern Kunlun Mountains were generated from a combination of the D-S model and ArcGIS.

In this paper the ability of the SSSC and STATCOM to enhance the dynamical stability of a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) power system using linearized Phillips-Heffron model is compared. The design problem of these FACTS devises is formulated as an optimization problem and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is employed to search for optimal controller parameters. By minimizing the frequency-domain based objective function, in which the deviation in the oscillatory rotor angle of the generator is involved, dynamical stability performance of the system is improved. Simulation results have been carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK show that the SSSC performance is better than STATCOM and it provides higher damping than that of the STATCOM.

We propose a new approach to identify the parameters in a linear discrete dynamic system subject to abrupt random state changes. The parameter estimation of the system is formulated as an optimization problem. The identification algorithms comprising state regime classification and parameter estimation are developed. Due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, two heuristic iterative algorithms that ensure the decrease of the objective functions are then proposed

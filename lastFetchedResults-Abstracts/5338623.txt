This paper present a novel approach to determine optimal location, number and parameter setting of Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) under single line contingency (N-1 contingency). Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) based on Line Flow Based (LFB) equations is being used for this purpose as a fast and robust approach. Contingency analysis is performed to detect and rank the severest one-line fault contingency in a power system. The optimization objective function is consists of line overloads alleviation and bus voltage magnitudes enhancement. To validate the effectiveness of proposed approach, simulations are carried out on IEEE 9 bus system. The obtained results show that TCSC is very effective device in security enhancement under single line contingency, considering its smooth and rapid reactance change according to system requirements.

One of the existing general definitions of a cyber-physical system (CPS) can be stated as: a firmly integrated engineered system consisting of electronics, computing, communication, and control sub-systems. It is a relatively new emerging multidisciplinary field, and can be thought as an intersection of physical, biological, engineering and information sciences. CPS has a number of potential applications that include: advanced automotive systems, avionics, energy conservation, environmental control, healthcare, instrumentation, process control, traffic control and safety, as well as transportation. This paper addresses a brief review on existing cyber-physical systems for healthcare related applications; some initial prospective developments of such systems in Indonesia will also be discussed. After introducing some definitions of cyber-physical systems, a review on the existing cyberphysical systems for healthcare applications will be briefly presented. Different types of cps-based healthcare applications in various sectors are covered, that include: tele-healthcare systems for chronic diseases management (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, hearing impairment, and respiratory diseases), medication intake management support, and telehomecare systems. Some prospective initial developments of the cyber-physical systems for healthcare applications conducted in Indonesia will also be presented. Design of mobile health systems for supporting tuberculosis management, mobile telemedicine system with multi communication links, as well as tablet PC and smart phone-based systems for supporting the integrated management of childhood illness are briefly covered. Future cyber-physical systems for healthcare applications are expected to have better reliability and high degree of trustworthiness. More and more CPS-based systems for different types of healthcare applications, in both developed and developing countries, are envisaged.

This paper analyzes the problem of modeling the collisions in a distributed and heterogeneous fixed wireless network in which spatial reuse enables multi-packet communication (MPC), thus allowing the coexistence of multiple peer to peer communications. The objective is to present a completely theoretical model that provides closed form expressions for the capture probability, and for the statistics of the interference power and of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) experienced by a receiving node. The presented theory aims in particular to investigate the impact on the capture probability of the heterogeneity introduced by the network topology and by the use of different antenna systems. All theoretical results are validated by independent Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, this study discusses the possible analogies between the developed and the existing frameworks for homogeneous scenarios, and presents a preliminary application of the developed capture analysis by evaluating the throughput-delay behavior of a homogeneous 802.11 MPC network.

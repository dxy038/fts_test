Objective: Comparison of self-regulation of emotional and motivational executive functions in subtypes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder based on Barkley's model. Method: In this ex post facto research, 50 male students with ADHD (ages 9 to 11) were selected using Child Symptom lnventory-4 (SCI-4), clinical interview and Raven's Intelligence Test. The subjects were assigned to two groups of ADHD-PHI (predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type) and ADHA-PI (predominantly inattentive type) with 25 subjects in each group. The subjects were then assessed by Bender- Gestalt Test, Discriminative Reaction Time Test, and researcher-made tasks. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance. Results: There was a significant difference between two groups in behavioral inhibition (p=0.001) and self- regulation of emotion and motivation (p=0.001 and p=0.01). In other words, the students with ADHA-PI had a better performance in behavioral inhibition and self- regulation of emotion and motivation in comparison with the group with ADHD-PHI. Conclusion: In general, findings suggest that both groups can be differentiated based on etiological factors. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that due to a primary deficit in behavioral inhibition in ADHD-PHI, this group had more difficulties and deficiencies on executive functions than the group with ADHD-PI. Therefore, Barkley's model of ADHD was confirmed.

Ovarian steroidogenesis and antral follicular development in ewes, following the treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP) and equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG), are affected by the reproductive season. The objective of this study was to compare the ultrasonographic attributes of large antral follicles between cyclic (December) and seasonally anovular (June–July) ewes, after a 12-day treatment with MAP-soaked intravaginal sponges, with or without the administration of 500 IU of eCG at sponge removal, and to determine whether there is a correlation between the ultrasonographic attributes of the follicular wall and serum concentrations of oestradiol. Digital images of ovulatory follicles from cyclic ewes and eCG-treated anoestrous ewes (n = 34 follicles), and of anovulatory follicles attaining ≥5 mm in control anoestrous ewes (n = 8 follicles), were analysed using the spot and line techniques designed to determine the echotextural characteristics of the follicular antrum (central and peripheral), follicular wall and perifollicular ovarian stroma. The mean diameter of ovulatory follicles was greater (P &lt; 0.001) in cyclic than anoestrous ewes, with or without the eCG treatment. The mean pixel heterogeneity (SD of numerical pixel values) of the follicular antrum (P &lt; 0.05), as well as mean pixel intensity and heterogeneity of the peripheral antrum, follicular wall proper and perifollicular ovarian stroma (P &lt; 0.05), were consistently greater in anoestrous than cyclic ewes at the time of sponge removal and 24 h after the treatment with MAP sponges or MAP/eCG. Mean oestradiol concentrations were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in cyclic compared to anoestrous ewes in both MAP- and MAP/eCG-treated animals, from 1 to 2 days after sponge withdrawal. There was a moderate negative correlation (r2 = 0.12, P &lt; 0.05; Pearson's Product Moment and r2 = 0.23, P &lt; 0.05; ANCOVA) between mean pixel heterogeneity (standard deviation of mean pixel values) of the follicular wall proper (all follicles ≥5 mm in diameter) and serum concentrations of oestradiol after sponge withdrawal. Our results indicate that large antral follicles from cyclic and seasonally anovular ewes exhibit distinctive ultrasonographic characteristics. The differences in follicular echotexture appear to be related mainly to seasonal variations in ovarian follicular morphology and oestradiol production.

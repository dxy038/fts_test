With the commercial availability of SiC JFET and BJT, their acceptance are expected grows in consideration to the excellent low switching loss, high temperature operation and high voltage rating capabilities of these devices. The objective of this paper is to assess the performance of bidirectional SiC switch devices for matrix converter. Two 2-phase to 1-phase matrix converters are constructed with SiC JFET and BJT. The improved performance of the SiC switch devices is assessed with reference to measured switching waveforms. Furthermore, the effect of two different SiC switch devices on the overall performance of the matrix converter with particular attention to power circuit losses is investigated.

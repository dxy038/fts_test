The cities of Chongqing and Hong Kong are both located at hilly areas which are highly populated, with buildings and major highways located very close to slopes and earth-retaining structures. Landslides and rockfalls are very common in both cities, and large expenditures are being incurred by both Governments on the investigation, design and implementation of mitigation and preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of the loss of life and economic losses due to landslides.

esult of the collaborative studies and technical exchange programs between the University of Hong Kong and the Chongqing Jianzhu University, a more in-depth understanding of the landslide problem, methodology and mitigation measures in Chongqing and Hong Kong was achieved. The objective of this paper is therefore to: (1) highlight the similarities and differences of the slope safety problems which these cities have been facing and (2) present and compare the key technical approaches these two cities have been undertaken to reduce the risk of landslide and rockfalls, so that both cities could benefit from the experience and lesson learnt.

on the review of literature and published case records, it is concluded that the city of Chongqing has to deal with natural hazards such as earthquake, river erosion and flooding more than that in Hong Kong, but both cities have been applying practical and latest technology to mitigating the landslide problem.

recommended that the city of Chongqing should consider establishing a sustainable long-term landslide management plan and that the landslide prevention system being used in Hong Kong could be a good reference starting point.

Background and Objective: Diversity of sources and information services in the field of food science and technology in Iran, and problems and difficulties of having access to them, are inhibiting factors in their use. Preparation and publication of the Iranian Food Science and Technology Data Bank (IFSTDB) and its regular updating have facilitated complete and quick access to the existing information sources in Persian. In this article the methodology of the preparation of IFSTDB is explained, followed by analysis of its contents during the period 1978-2001.

Research Method: Information was collected by a trained team. The team members consulted directly the educational, research and executive institutes and canters active in the field of food science and technology and completed bibliographic worksheets containing items/questions on seven types of documents,, including articles in scientific journals, abstracts/full papers presented in conferences, M.Sc. and doctoral dissertations, research project reports, books, food standards, and patents, during the period 1978-2001. The documents were classified into main groups and subgroups, using the Food Science and Technology Abstracts (FSTA) as a model, followed by coding and selecting proper keywords. Data entry and processing were carried out using a software designed for the purpose, and a compact disk (CD) of IFSTDB was prepared. Relative frequency distributions of the documents were determined according to the type of document, time period (3-year intervals), and subject, and an analysis of the shares of journals and conferences and the contribution of specialists and researchers in publishing the documents was made. The findings are presented in the form of tables and histograms.

Results: The total number of documents collected was 5071, consisting of 443 (8.7%) journal articles, 1725 (34.0%) conference abstracts/full papers, 405 (8.0%) research projects, 956 (18.9%) dissertations, 344 (6.8%) books, 1046 (20.6%) food standards, and 152 (3.0%) patents, classified into 18 groups and 118 subgroups, and 4750 keywords were chosen. This Data Bank contains published information from 780 organizations, 46 scientific journals, 111 conferences, and 3739 authors. The highest proportions of the documents were on fruits, vegetables and nuts (18.0%), milk and milk products (10.9%), and food additives, spices, and condiments (10.5%) groups, while the lowest proportions belonged equally (0.6%) to cocoa, chocolate and confectionary products, eggs and egg products, and food economics. The largest number of documents belonged to the 1999-2001 period and the lowest number to the 1981-83 period. The average number of documents added annually to the Data Bank was 211.

Conclusion: Publication of IFSTDB aims at facilitating selection of scientific documents, information collecting, avoiding unnecessary repeats, and improving and promoting educational and research activities, by accurate and precise planning for the future, taking into account the needs and gaps. It is recommended that IFSTDB be updated and presented in different forms and a survey on its documents is carried out regularly.

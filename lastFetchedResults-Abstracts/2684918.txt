This paper demonstrates the need for and provides an improved fitting of the line parameters when a wide range of frequencies with emphasis on the dc response is the objective. The improved fitting is based on a low-order fitting of a function error for each of the line parameters, that is, the characteristic admittance and propagation function, in the low-frequency range. The function error represents the difference between the analytical evaluation of the line parameters, that is, obtained from a frequency-dependent distributed parameters line model, and their initial rational approximation, for example, given by an electromagnetic transients software tool. The approximated function error, added to the initial rational approximation of the line parameters, provides the enhanced fitted line model. The enhanced fitting improves the dc response of the line and ensures numerical stability in time-domain simulations. This paper applies the proposed fitting approach to the universal line model for time-domain simulations. The simulation results by the enhanced fitting are validated by comparing the results with those obtained from a frequency-domain line model (FDLM). Two case studies are presented to illustrate the proposed fitting approach.

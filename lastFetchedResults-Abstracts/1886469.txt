The objective of this study was to asses the physiological impact of fluid gained during routine shoulder arthroscopy. Included in this study were 40 consecutive patients undergoing an arthroscopic procedure of the shoulder. The weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and physiologic observations were compared pre- and postsurgery and correlated to the duration of the procedure and the amount of fluid used. The mean operative time was 27.4 minutes (±11.2) with a mean fluid use of 3.2 liters (±2.2). There was a mean weight gain of 0.9 kg (±.64, 0-3.2, P &lt; .0001) and a mean drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit of 0.6 g/dl (±.5, 0-2, P &lt; .0001) and 1.5% (±1.5%, 0-6%, P &lt; .0001), respectively. There was a strong correlation between the amount of fluid used and the weight gain (R = .89, P &lt; .0001). Although serious complications from fluid absorption during shoulder arthroscopy are rare, there is a significant absorption of irrigation fluid during the procedure. The time taken and the amount of fluid used should be kept to the minimum required for safe completion of the procedure.

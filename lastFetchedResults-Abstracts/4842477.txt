This study modifies Scholefield&#194;&#191;s (1994) dynamic R&amp;D resource allocation concept and discusses its relationship with business strategies. We substitute original measures with the degree of business leverage (DBL) and the degree of R&amp;D leverage (DRDL). These two measures are more useful and objective than those of Scholefield&#194;&#191;s. In addition, DBL and DRDL can be combined with the concepts of product and technology lifecycle and technology adoption more firmly. Managers can use DBL and DRDL to help them make optimal R&amp;D resource allocation and business strategy decisions.

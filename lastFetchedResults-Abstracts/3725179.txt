The stated objective of this book is to "develop a unified analysis and control design framework for impulsive and hybrid dynamical systems using a Lyapunov and dissipative systems approach." The book is organized into 13 chapters and includes an appendix section. Some of the topics covered include: stability theory for time-variant and time-varying impulsive systems; extending the notion of dissipative dynamical systems to impulsive dissipative dynamical systems; vector dissipativity for large-scale nonlinear impulsive dynamical systems; the stability of feedback interconnections of dissipative impulsive dynamical systems; qualitative analyses of special classes of impulsive hybrid feedback control systems; disturbance rejection control and robust control for nonlinear impulsive dynamical systems with bounded exogenous disturbances; and Poincare\Â´s theorem adapted to left-continuous dynamical systems. This book fills a void in the area of systems research and is a welcome addition to the literature on hybrid and impulsive systems. The book is well-organized, well written, and rigorous in the development of the subject on hand. It would be of great use to many researchers within the control systems community and could be used as the basis for a graduate course om control systems.

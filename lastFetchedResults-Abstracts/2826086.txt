This paper presents the architecture of the non-contact sensor for measuring the rope swinging angle in two planes. The sensor were dedicated to the all kind of the crane device, especially to overhead travelling crane. The main objective of this statement applies a solution for improving early developed and described non-contact vision swinging sensor. In the article, the author main attention has been focused on issues related to the possibility of using a "smart camera" device as a full functional contactless two-dimensional sway sensor. All tests and considerations were conducted on the scaled physical model of overhead travelling crane with hosting capability 150kg.

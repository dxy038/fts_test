A confocal scanning optical microscope implemented in an integrated-optic structure is demonstrated. The compact nature of the device proves to be more suitable for environments where mechanical shock can result in optical misalignment of discrete components. The device is implemented in a thin-film optical waveguide with optical fiber connections for light input and output. An objective lens and focusing beam splitter are incorporated into the waveguide structure to form the sensing head of the microscope. The fabrication of the device is discussed, and both intensity and differential contrast images are presented to demonstrate the device operation. The confocal imaging characteristics of the microscope are also demonstrated

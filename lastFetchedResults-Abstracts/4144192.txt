The transmission of block-coded visual information over packet networks introduces fidelity problems in terms of data losses, which result in wrong reconstruction of block sequences at the decoder. Concealment techniques aim at masking the visual effect of these errors, by exploiting either spatial or temporal available information. Both temporal and spatial approaches present drawbacks: the first is in general inefficient in handling complex or fast objectsÂ´ motion, while the second is computationally expensive and is not able to recover high-frequency contents and small details. In this paper, a new solution is proposed that combines temporal and spatial approaches. The technique first replaces the lost block with the best matching pattern in a previously decoded frame (BMA), using the border information, and then applies a mesh-based warping (MBW) that reduces the artifacts caused by fast movements, rotations or deformations. The first step is achieved by a fast matching algorithm, for a high precision is not needed, while the second step uses an affine transform applied to a deformable mesh structure. Experimental results show that significant improvements can be achieved in comparison with traditional spatial or temporal concealment approaches, in terms of both subjective and objective reconstruction quality

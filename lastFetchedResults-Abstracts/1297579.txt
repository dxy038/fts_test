We consider a single-machine scheduling problem in which due dates are linear functions of the job waiting-times and the objective is to minimize the maximum lateness. An optimal sequence is constructed by implementing an index-based priority rule for a fixed value of the due date normalizing constant k. We determine in polynomial time all the k value ranges so that the optimal sequence remains the same within each range. The optimal due dates are computed as linear functions of the global optimal value of k. The overall procedure is illustrated in a numerical example.

This investigation introduces the application of a relatively rapid technique to obtain information about the dynamic nature of microbial communities in activated sludge. The objective has been to consider variability due to measurement errors and protocol changes within the same quantitative framework as the analysis of systematic differences in microbial communities in large-scale aerobic activated sludge secondary wastewater treatment systems. Adjustments to the methodology were considered due to their potential for simplifying and shortening the analysis procedure. All modifications to the protocols used to assay the composition of microbial fatty acids (MFAs) of activated sludge imposed some bias to the chromatographic data. This methodological bias was similar in magnitude to the level of discrimination between activated sludge microbial community structures that were considered as part of the present study. MFA analysis supported the expectations of subtle but systematic community structure differences and shifts in activated sludge based on the current understanding of these wastewater treatment systems. A standardized MFA methodology was shown to be sensitive to minor systematic changes in activated sludge communities due the anticipated underlying factors of selective pressures from the process configuration, history, operational conditions and/or nutrient status. The chemometric approach of fatty acid isopropyl ester analysis of activated sludge can provide a routine tool for meaningful and quantitative information of changes in activated sludge quality in full-scale treatment systems.

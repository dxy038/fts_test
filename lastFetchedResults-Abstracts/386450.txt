The value of hyperthermia as an adjuvant to radiotherapy in patients with malignant melanoma was studied in a European multicentre trial. 134 metastatic or recurrent lesions of malignant melanoma in 70 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy (three fractions of 8 Gy or 9 Gy in 8 days) alone or followed by hyperthermia (43°C for 60 min). Overall, the 2-year actuarial local tumour control was 37(SE 5)%. Univariate analysis showed a beneficial effect of hyperthermia (radiation alone 28% vs combined treatment 46%, P=0·008) and radiation dose (24 Gy 25% vs 27 Gy 56%, P=0·02), but no effect of tumour size (4 cm 42% vs >4 cm 29%, P=0·21). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed the most important prognostic variables to be hyperthermia (odds ratio for 2-year local control 1·73 [95% Cl 1·07-2·78], P=0·023), tumour size (0·91 [0·85-0·99], P=0·05), and radiation dose (1·17 [1·01-1·36], P=0·05). Addition of heat did not significantly increase acute or late radiation reactions. Heating was well tolerated, but because of difficulties with equipment only 14% of treatments achieved the protocol objective. The overall 5-year survival rate was 19%, but 38% of the patients for whom all known disease was controlled survived 5 years. Adjuvant hyperthermia significantly improved local tumour control when applied in association with radiation in treatment of malignant melanoma. Successful local treatment of patients with a single or a few metastatic malignant melanoma lesions has significant curative potential.

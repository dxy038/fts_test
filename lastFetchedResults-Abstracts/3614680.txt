In this brief, objective prioritization of multiobjective cost functions using the lexicographic approach is applied in the model predictive control (MPC) framework of sewer networks. Using the lexicographic approach, the control problem solution can be obtained by solving a sequence of single objective, constrained, convex programming problems. This brief demonstrates with an elaborated case study treating a portion of the Barcelona sewer network, that important improvements can be achieved in performance using lexicographic optimization. At the same time, costly commissioning and implementation efforts related to the traditional weight based approach for implementation of priorities are avoided.

This paper presents the combined technique from optimal feeder reconfiguration and the installation of distributed generators (DG). The objective is to reduce power loss in distribution system. The optimization problem is solved by simulated annealing method to simultaneously identify the proper on/off patterns of the switches and the optimal location for DG placement. The impacts of this combined technique are evaluated from the simulation results of case study in 69-bus radial distribution system. It can be summarized from simulation results that the optimal DG placement and optimal feeder reconfiguration not only help reduce losses but also increase the magnitude of bus voltages.

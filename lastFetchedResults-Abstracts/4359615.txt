Presents an online and reactive system of production scheduling for flexible manufacturing systems. The proposed system simultaneously schedules machining operations and transportation operations through an approach based on fuzzy logic, alternative part-production routes and multi-objective function programming or scheduling. The decision parameters in the decision-making are the routing distance, the due dates of parts and the next operationÂ´s processing time. A prototype was developed in order to illustrate the advantages of the proposed system

The objective of this paper is to compare the potential of RADARSAT and JERS-1 images to discriminate primary forest, secondary forest and recent activities areas in Amazon. The surrounds of Tapajos National Forest (Para State, Brazil) was used as a study site. Tonal and textural parameters were used in the analysis. It is shown that the discrimination between primary forest and secondary forest was only possible with RADARSAT image, and recent activities was better classified with the use of the JERS-1 image

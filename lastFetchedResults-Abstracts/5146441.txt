In this paper a procedure is proposed to construct a heterogeneous wireless Sensor network (WSN) that is both bi-directional and fault tolerant. Fault tolerance, is based on finding the k-best disjoint paths using trellis graph transformation. Recognizing limited energy in WSNÂ´s the proposed algorithm minimizes energy consumption. Simulation study reveals how metrics, such as average end to end delay, transmission overhead and throughput, compare for unidirectional and bidirectional graphs.

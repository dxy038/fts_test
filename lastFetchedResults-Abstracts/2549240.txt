Objective: The stem cell theory in the endometriosis provides an advanced avenue of
targeting these cells as a novel therapy to eliminate endometriosis. In this regard, studies
showed that lovastatin alters the cells from a stem-like state to more differentiated condition
and reduces stemness. The aim of this study was to investigate whether lovastatin
treatment could influence expression and methylation patterns of genes regulating differentiation
of endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) such as BMP2, GATA2 and
RUNX2 as well as eMSCs markers.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental investigation, MSCs were isolated from endometrial
and endometriotic tissues and treated with lovastatin and decitabin. To investigate
the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of eMSCs treated with the different
concentration of lovastatin and decitabin, BMP2, RUNX2 and GATA2 expressions were
measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To determine involvement of
DNA methylation in BMP2 and GATA2 gene regulations of eMSCs, we used quantitative
Methylation Specific PCR (qMSP) for evaluation of the BMP2 promoter status and differentially
methylated region of GATA2 exon 4.
Results: In the present study, treatment with lovastatin increased expression of BMP2
and RUNX2 and induced BMP2 promoter demethylation. We also demonstrated that lovastatin
treatment down-regulated GATA2 expression via inducing methylation. In addition,
the results indicated that CD146 cell marker was decreased to 53% in response to lovastatin
treatment compared to untreated group.
Conclusion: These findings indicated that lovastatin treatment could increase the differentiation
of eMSCs toward osteogenic and adiogenic lineages, while it decreased expression
of eMSCs markers and subsequently reduced the stemness.

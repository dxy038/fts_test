Objective (s): The present study aimed to determine the impact of message framing on calcium-rich foods intake in high school girls using the regulatory focus theory.
Methods: A random sample of students was selected and divided into 3 groups: a control group and two intervention groups (n= 56 per each group). Intervention groups received loss frame and gain frame pamphlets while the control group just received basic information. Post-test was carried out at tow months follow-up.
Results: The loss frame message was more effective on encouraging students to consume calcium-rich foods compared to gain frame message (p=0.02). There was no significant difference within control group.
Conclusion: The findings indicated that loss frame oriented message was more effective.

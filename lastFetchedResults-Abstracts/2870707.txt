A great deal of research effort has focused on the study of network resilience in recent years. In this paper, the method of enhancing network resilience under attacks is investigated. Degree-preserving cross-link rewiring is adopted to adjust the topological structure. Then, the problem of optimization of network resilience is transformed into a single-objective combinatorial optimization problem. The optimization model is established, in which the node robustness index is used as the objective function. An optimization algorithm based on Simulated Annealing is proposed. Lastly, through numerical simulations BA scale-free network and two real networks are investigated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method, also, during optimization the change of several important structural parameters is recorded and analyzed.

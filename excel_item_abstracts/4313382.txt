Along with the development of the science technology and the exploiting of the bank business, e-commerce plays a very important role and is the development direction in bank commerce. Now, existing bank e-commerce only uses database to support on-line transaction, but it has obvious limitation at the decision analysis and cooperation work, and it canÂ´t meet the need of the development of bank commerce. In order to resolve the above problems, in this paper the researches focus on how to create cooperative e-commerce system by workflow technology on the base of database and data warehouse under the background of bank business. It can provide more cooperation and decision support for bank e-commerce. In this system, data warehouse is established by relation database; because that data warehouse spends vast space, a linear transformation approach is used to compress dimensions of multidimensional data table. Finally, the experimental data is given to show that the method mentioned in this paper is effective and feasible.

With the proliferation of mobile communication, the allocation of resources such as bandwidth, buffer in mobile cellular networks becomes an increasingly important issue. In addition, varying mobility and various service class requirements of the present multimedia applications makes it a challenging one. It is mostly realized in the present third generation (3G) and beyond 3G (B3G) mobile network system. Hence an effective and efficient utilization of resources such as bandwidth in mobile cellular system using better optimization schemes are needed. This paper addresses the critical issues of resource allocation - in particular about optimization of bandwidth with adaptive quality of service (QoS) requirements. In order to have optimized bandwidth applications, two optimization schemes - linear programming (LP) and simulated annealing (SA) are considered. LP methods solve optimization problem having linear objective function and constraints. But the optimization method employed by LP has been proven to fall into general local minima. But the SA scheme provides a solution that has minimum energy with global minima. Experimental results have been obtained using LP method. The results are then compared with those obtained without LP and SA. The quality of solution obtained proves that evolutionary method - SA will be a strong contender for solving optimization problems in real time cellular network environment

This letter proposes a gaming model with coalition among producers in subgroups for the market setting with multiple producers. The possible number of coalitions is obtained for a total number of N(N&#8805;3) producers. The generic spatial gaming model with coalition has a vector as its objective function, with each vector element representing a coalition profit. Various constraints are formulated, including the spatial constraints (e.g., the DC power flow equations). The Cournot gaming strategy is adopted. A small system is used for testing the model with satisfactory results.

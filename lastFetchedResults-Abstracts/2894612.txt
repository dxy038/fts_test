This paper focuses on the problem of controlling a single phase DC-AC switched power converter used in Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). The control objective is to generate, at the system output, a sinusoidal voltage with amplitude and frequency fixed by the reference signal. To this end, three types of regulators are designed based on Backstepping technique, Sliding Mode approach and linear PID controller. A comparative study of performances of designed controllers is made by simulations in Matlab/Simulink environment.

Objective
The objective of the present study was to improve fissure sealing by pre-treatment with Carisolv in order to remove organic debris. The surface morphology and roughness of fissure cavities and the degree of microleakage after Carisolv application were compared with those after bristle brush treatment in vitro.
Methods

Fifty extracted human teeth were used in this study. The teeth were randomly divided into two groups of 25 each. Artificial fissures were prepared in all teeth into which artificial organic debris was placed. The debris in 25 teeth of one group was removed using Carisolv applied for 30 s and excavation was performed with a dental explorer until the gel was clear. The remaining 25 teeth were then cleaned using bristle brush with prophylaxis paste. Surface roughness was analyzed in five samples from each group by color laser three-dimensional (3D) microscopy and by scanning electron microscopic examination. The remaining samples were filled with sealant and subjected to a microleakage test under thermocycling. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mannâ€“Whitney U-test; a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results

Morphologically, most of the debris in the fissures was removed by Carisolv treatment, whereas some fissures were not cleaned by bristle brush. Carisolv-treatment with acid-etching resulted in removal of debris-like smear layer leaving enamel prisms open, and 3D laser microscopy demonstrated that the roughness values increased after acid-etching. However, microleakage test of both Carisolv and brush methods showed similar results.
Conclusions

Carisolv-treated surfaces especially when subjected to acid-etching might facilitate good adaptation of sealant to enamel, because of an increase in surface roughness and favorable surface characteristics.

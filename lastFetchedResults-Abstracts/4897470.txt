This paper presents a new adaptive fuzzy control scheme that is formulated and constructed directly in the control objective space. The formulation on the basis of decomposition of closed-loop response profile is clarified first followed by a detailed description of the scheme. Unlike the existing adaptive fuzzy control methods, the fuzzy controller in the new scheme is fixed and the adaptation is done on the input and output weighting factors of the fuzzy controller. A state-space based approximate analysis technique is employed to analyze the stability of the closed-loop system. A simulation analysis is also conducted to evaluate the controller performance in regulating a structure varying process, and to illustrate the advantage of the scheme in controlling plants that can not be easily handled by other control approaches

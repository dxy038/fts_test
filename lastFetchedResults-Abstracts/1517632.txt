The objective of this review with 122 references is to provide structure and retention mechanisms of porous graphitic carbon by chromatographic analysis and computational chemical analysis of retention mechanisms. Synthesis methods of porous graphitic carbon are described. Applications for use as matrix for dynamic coating on porous graphitic carbon and direct separation of polar compounds on porous graphitic carbon demonstrated that the physical and chemical stability of graphitic carbons performed in both chromatography and extraction, especially for polar compounds, those are difficult on both silica-based and organic polymer-based packing materials. The disadvantage is difficult desorption of non-polar compounds adsorbed on the surface. The development of 3.5-Î¼m particles improves the separation power of graphitic carbon columns with the high theoretical plate number.

We demonstrate bidirectional long-reach 35-channel DWDM-PON based on wavelength-locked Fabry-Perot laser diodes with 50 GHz channel spacing. The mode control of the Fabry-Perot laser diodes enhances output power and decreases the required injection power. We show packet-loss-free transmission of all 70 channels over 70 km single mode fiber without optical amplifier. The DWDM-PON can consolidate a metro network into an access network by bypassing the central office within the reach of the WDM-PON

Detailed numerical investigations are undertaken of wavelength reused bidirectional transmission of adaptively modulated optical OFDM (AMOOFDM) signals over a single SMF in a WDM-PON incorporating a SOA intensity modulator and a RSOA intensity modulator in the OLT and ONU, respectively. A comprehensive theoretical model describing the performance of such network scenarios is, for the first time, developed, taking into account dynamic optical characteristics of SOA and RSOA intensity modulators as well as the effects of Rayleigh backscattering (RB) and residual downstream signal-induced crosstalk. The developed model is rigorously verified experimentally in RSOA-based real-time end-to-end OOFDM systems at 7.5Gb/s. It is shown that the RB noise and crosstalk effects are the dominant factors limiting the maximum achievable downstream and upstream transmission performance. Under optimum SOA and RSOA operating conditions as well as practical downstream and upstream optical launch powers, 10Gb/s downstream and 6Gb/s upstream over 40km SMF transmissions of conventional double sideband AMOOFDM signals are feasible without utilizing inline optical amplification and chromatic dispersion compensation. In particular, the transmission performance can be improved to 23Gb/s downstream and 8Gb/s upstream over 40 km SMFs when single sideband subcarrier modulation is adopted in the downstream systems.

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the influence of fish oil (FO) supplementation in
the diet of broiler chickens on the humoral immune response as well as some blood parameters.
Two hundred and sixteen one day old broiler chickens were divided into four dietary groups
0, 1, 2, or 4% FO with 3 replicates of 18 birds. Four chicks randomly selected and marked
from each replicate were immunized intramuscularly with 0.2 ml of 5% sheep red blood cells
(SRBC) as a non-infectious antigen, at the ages of 15 and 35 days and blood samples were
taken 7 days after each immunization. The highest BW was observed in the 2% FO dietary
group (T3), followed by T2 (P < 0.01). The serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels significantly
decreased in the FO groups at the age of 42 days (P < 0.01). In addition, the inclusion of FO in
broiler diets significantly increased the blood glucose (G) level and decreased the total protein
(TP), albumin (A) and globulin (GL) concentrations. Fish oil-treated birds had significantly
more serum antibody (predominantly immunoglobulin M, IgM) to SRBC than the control
group. The highest response to primary and secondary injections of SRBC after 7 days, were
detected for group 4 (4% FO), followed by 2% FO group (P < 0.05). The results indicate that
the addition of 2 % FO to broiler chickâ€™s diet may stimulate the development of the immune
response and improve blood indices, while 4% level was not recommended because of probable
off-flavours in the product.

We present the basis of SATI system which integrates new human-machine collaboration approach for interactive construction of image processing (IP) chains. This approach consists in constructing chain interactive goal specification in abstraction of operators. Two aspects are considered: the connection between objectives and IP; and the interactive formulation of objective. The connection is based on a explicit description of transformations realised by each operator. It allows the generation of IP chains and provides a basic objective description formalism. To preserve the link with IP, the formulation is realised in this formalism. It requires a rich interactive environment which integrates manipulation and construction of description aids

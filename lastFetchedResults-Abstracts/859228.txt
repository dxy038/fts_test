This paper is concerned with the numerical solution of a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem by methods that use a splitting of the objective matrix. We present an acceleration step for a general splitting algorithm and we establish the convergence of the resulting accelerated scheme. We report the results of numerical experiments arising in constrained bivariate interpolation to evaluate the efficiency of this acceleration technique for a particular splitting of the objective matrix and for the corresponding extrapolated form.

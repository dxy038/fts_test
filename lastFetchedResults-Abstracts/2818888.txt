Bulky capacitors are often needed in DC systems to smooth voltage ripples, which reduces the power density and system reliability considerably. In this paper, a Ripple Eliminator (RE) that is a bidirectional buck-boost converter terminated with an auxiliary capacitor is proposed to reduce voltage ripples after connecting it to the DC bus. A controller is proposed to transfer the voltage ripples on the DC bus to the auxiliary capacitor, of which the voltage can be controlled either lower or higher than the DC-bus voltage. Three control strategies are proposed for this purpose and simulation results are presented to verify the control performance.

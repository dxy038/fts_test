This paper presents the preliminary prototype design and implementation of the Nazarbayev University (NU) Hand, a new semi-anthropomorphic multigrasp robotic hand. The hand is designed to be an end effector for industrial and service robots. The main objective is to develop a low-cost, low-weight and easily manufacturable robotic hand with a sensor module allowing acquisition of data for autonomous intelligent object manipulation. 3D printing technologies were extensively used in the implementation of the hand. Specifically, the structure of the hand is printed using a 3D printer as a complete assembly voiding the need of using fasteners and bearings for the assembly of the hand and decreasing the total weight. The hand also incorporates a sensor module containing a LIDAR, digital camera and non-contact infrared temperature sensor for intelligent automation. As an alternative to teach pendants for the industrial manipulators, a teaching glove was developed, which acts as the primary human machine interface between the user and the NU Hand. The paper presents an extensive performance characterization of the robotic hand including finger forces, weight, audible noise level during operation and sensor data acquisition.

With the development of power electronics, the power quality of AC power supply is increasingly paid attention to. In general, diode uncontrolled rectifier and thyristor phase controlled rectifier are adopted for AC/DC conversion, which inject plentiful harmonic and reactive power into AC mains, and result in serious pollution. So lots of researches have been focus on high input power factor and minimum harmonic injection into AC mains. A novel control method for three-phase star-connected switch three-level rectifier was proposed in order to meet harmonic current distortion limits set by IEEE-519. The desired source currents are output from a current compensator, the compensator gain and the phase delay at each phase for each order harmonic are determined by an optimal control algorithm, where the permissible levels of individual and total harmonic distortion, power factor, as well as active power consumption are taken into account. The desired source currents can drive the bidirectional switches. The simulation results show that this control strategy is effective in minimizing source current distortion and maximizing load power factor. The proposed converter is suitable for a wide power application.

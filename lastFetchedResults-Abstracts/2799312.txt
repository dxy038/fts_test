Objective of this research is to apply a feasible study and experiments on deploying location and surrounding environmental information expression mechanism based on Probe Vehicle System. We performed two approaches, one uses smart-phone as a basic infrastructure of not only display but also information gathering. Another uses GNSS/CN OBU for precise position data. The former can build a service platform that using the information on the sensor. The latter can realize &#8220;just on time, at the right place&#8221; service. This research enabled Probe Vehicle System to become a new innovative platform to serve digital contents based on surrounding environmental information, not only limited to vehicular, transports and mobile activities but to use it as a new digital contents deliverable service platform based on ubiquitous information.

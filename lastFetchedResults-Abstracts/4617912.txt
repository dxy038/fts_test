This paper proposes a model to support sign language content development and deployment in digital television scenarios. The model objective is to overcome traditional video limitations on the production of signed content and improve accessibility on digital television. Previous work on sign and gesture recognition, sign notation systems and avatar animation are reviewed. Sign communication requirements are investigated and adequate algorithms are identified to enable sign language processing and transmission. An application interface is proposed in order to access the model functionalities. The final discussion lists the benefits and limitations of the proposed model.

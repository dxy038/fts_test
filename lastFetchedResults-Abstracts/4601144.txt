This paper presents a robust feedback controller design for parametric uncertainty systems via constrained optimization. The proposed controller design employs modern optimization tools (Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution) in a single objective constrained optimization. The objective of the optimization is to search for a set of robust controller gains such that the stability radius of the closed-loop system is maximized. The constraint of the optimization is a closed-loop poles region which is directly related to the desired time-domain control performance. The proposed controller design is applied to control of pendulum-like systems (gantry crane, flexible joint and inverted pendulum). The results show the robust performance of the designed controller.

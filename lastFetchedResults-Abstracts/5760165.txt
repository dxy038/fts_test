In this paper, the genetic algorithm is employed in optimization of a reluctance synchronous motor. To evaluate fitness of each offspring, finite element method is employed. The model is implemented in finite element environment and for each offspring variation of torque in synchronous speed is calculated for different rotation angles. In optimization process harmonic contents are applied as a penalty to objective function. Mechanical stress analysis of optimized design is also presented to test the mechanical strength of the rotor at high speeds.

The current-voltage-fed bidirectional dc-dc converter, which refers to a current-fed inverter at low voltage side and a voltage-fed inverter at high voltage side, can realize zero voltage switching (ZVS) for the switches with the use of phase-shift (PS) technology. However, the current-fed switches suffer from high voltage spike and high circulating conduction loss. In order to solve these problems, a novel phase-shift plus pulsewidth modulation (PSP) control ZVS bidirectional dc-dc converter is proposed in this paper. By adopting active clamping branch and PSP technology, the converter can realize ZVS for all switches in a wide range of load variation while input or output voltage varies. In addition, a novel control strategy with one port voltage regulation and another port current regulation is proposed to make energy bidirectional conversion freely. The operation principle is analyzed and verified by a 28 V/270 V conversion prototype rated at 1.5 kW.

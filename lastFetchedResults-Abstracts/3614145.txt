The optimization of the design variables of a single-sided linear induction motor (SLIM) using the finite-element method (FEM) and the sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT) is presented. Thrust is taken as an objective function in order to maximize thrust under a constant current drive, and seven independent design variables and nine constraints are chosen. As a result, pole pitch/airgap and pole pitch/aluminum depth for the best design are determined. Thrust is increased by 30% under a constant current of 12 A, so that the input current can be reduced to 10.5 A for necessary starting thrust because thrust is proportional to <e1>I</e1><sup>2</sup>

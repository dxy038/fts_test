In this paper, we present an integration framework for heterogeneous motion generators. The objective is to outline issues that are currently easily solved in professional post-processing systems used in film and game production but which cannot be transposed as is to real-time systems with autonomous agents. We summarise our approach for articulated agent-modelling and their animation by combining heterogeneous motion generators, such as real-time motion capturing, key-framing, inverse kinematics, procedural walking. We propose an agent/action-oriented framework. Activity properties such as action simultaneity and motion blending, spatial coherence, motion-flow update schemes, agent attachments, and location corrections, are the main topics handled by our generic animation framework. Numerous examples throughout the paper illustrate our approach and outline encountered problems and solutions or open research directions.

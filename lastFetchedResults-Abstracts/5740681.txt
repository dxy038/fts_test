The objective of this paper is to present the preliminary results of design basis reconstitution of the systems, dedicated to prevention of containment boundary failure of the VVER440/V213 unit. The results are based on large set of calculations (using MELCOR code) of various Loss of Coolant Accident scenarios, which have been integrally evaluated and processed to preliminary set of parameters (characteristics) of bubble tower and containment spray system. An accent will be given to the comparison of existing characteristics of relevant systems to the by design basis reconstitution derived ones. The paper will provide recommendations which may lead to the modifications of some parameters of the safety systems.

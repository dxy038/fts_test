A description is given of a knowledge base design and prototyping tool, Crayon, based on an enhanced formal functional data model implemented in Prolog. The objective was to explore use of this data model for knowledge base management. A discussion is presented of the advantages of the model (formal representation, semantic richness and simplicity) from the perspective of two knowledge representation guidelines and the advantages of using Prolog as the implementation language for knowledge base prototyping. The authors propose and discuss theoretical enhancements to the functional data model in the form of knowledge-oriented constraints

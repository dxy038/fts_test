AbstractObjective
ved criticism from family members influences mental health. The link between perceived criticism and physical health has not been thoroughly investigated. The objective of this study was to examine the association of perceived criticism with dyspnea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
s
dividuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated COPD completed questionnaires at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-up. Perceived criticism at baseline was examined as a predictor of dyspnea at all three time points using a linear mixed model that adjusted for demographic and health characteristics.
s
was an interaction between perceived criticism and psychological distress (p = 0.038). Perceived criticism was associated with dyspnea only among individuals with elevated psychological distress (b = 0.32, SE = 0.13, p = 0.018).
sion
r research is needed to replicate these findings and determine the extent to which they apply to other common subjective physical symptoms such as pain.

Background and aims: Although pregabalin shows efficacy against neuropathic pain, very
limited evidence support postoperative analgesic efficacy. Our study objective to investigate
analgesic efficacy of oral pregabalin in orthopedic surgery postoperative pain and opioid
consumption.
Materials and methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled was performed in
orthopedic surgery. Patients received in first group(30 patients) PCA morphine (20
mg/100ml) and in second group(30 patients) PCA morphine (10 mg/100ml) + oral pregabalin
300 mg daily for 48h after surgery. Pain score (VAS) and opioid consumption assessed in 48
hr after surgery.
Results: There was not significant difference between groups for demographic data. Pain
score and opioid consumption in pregabaline group was significantly lower than morphine
group without any significant complications.
Conclusions: preoperative oral dose of 300 mg pregabalindailyfor 48h after surgery reduces
post operative acute pain in orthopedic surgery.

After a presentation of the domain of conceptual modeling of the enterprise and the famous methods used, we present a panorama of methods and tools particularly for the functional and the decisional modeling. Some techniques present hiatuses and they are not precisely coherent or complementary for modeling the functional and decisional system of the enterprise. The objective of this paper is to show the relevance of the methods of conceptual modeling particularly for the methods SADT (Structured Analysis Design Technique), GRAI (Graph with Results and Actions Interrelated) and GIM (GRAI Integrated Methodology) in order to offer a complete and a combined modeling of an enterprise.

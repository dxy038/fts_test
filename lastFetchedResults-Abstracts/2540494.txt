Objective: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is one of the most common knee chronic disorders especially among females that is closely related to forces imbalance of vastus medial is oblique (VMO) and vastus lateral is (VL) muscles. The purpose of study was to examine the effect of knee isokinetic extension in maximum lateral tibia rotation on VMO and VL litudes in PFPS patients.

Materials  Methods:  Thirtysix women with PFPS participated voluntarily in this study and were randomly placed in one of three groups included the VMO selective isokinetic strengthening exercise, quadriceps general strengthening and control groups. Each exercise was performed for 8 weeks. Muscle RMS of VMO and VL and VMO/VL RMS ratio were recorded and calculated before and after training using of an 8channels electromyography system. Data analysis was made by analyses of variance with repeated measures.

Results: In baseline, VMO litude was less than VL in all groups (Ple 0.05), but after interventions, it was more than VL in selective group (P=0.01) and less than VL in general (P=0.001) and control (P=0.036) groups. Before interventions, there was no difference between groups in muscles litude (P>0.05). Yet, after interventions, VMO litude and VMO/VL litude ratio were more in selective group than in general and control groups (Ple 0.001), and VL litude was more in general group than in selective and control groups (Ple 0.01).

Conclusion: According to the study results, isokinetic extension training with maximum lateral tibia rotation and in close to knee full extension can be recommended as an appropriate training for improving VMO/VL electrical activity ratio and decreasing imbalance between lateral and medial vastus muscles litudes in patients with PFPS.

This paper proposes a generic framework for no-reference quality evaluation of video testimonials. The global quality of the video testimonials is estimated by fusing the individual scores of a selection of spatial, temporal, audio and content-related metrics. Based on the global quality score, feedback is given to the user and the video/audio quality improver can be activated. Experiments on a large set of video testimonials show that the proposed objective evaluation closely matches the perception of users.

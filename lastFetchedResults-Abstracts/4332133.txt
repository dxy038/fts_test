The development of low-complexity blind techniques for equalization, timing and carrier offset recovery is of enormous importance in the design of high data rate wireless systems. In this paper, we propose a practical solution for blind equalization, timing recovery and small carrier offset correction in slowly-fading frequency selective wireless communication channels. We extend the Modi ed Constant Modulus Algorithm (MCMA) to handle the timing offset parameter. We propose a single objective function to achieve equalization, timing and carrier recovery without the need of any training sequences. Our algorithm achieves 5-10 times faster convergence, compared to previous research, for the Mean Square Error (MSE) at the equalizer output due to the nely tuned step sizes and updating the equalizer taps and timing offset jointly to minimize the mean dispersion and inter symbol interference. Our results show that the proposed technique can successfully handle synchronization and combat the frequency selectivity of the wireless channel.

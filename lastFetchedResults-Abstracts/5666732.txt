This work is motivated towards building a complete bidirectional architecture based on the reversible principles and to study the feasibility of implementation and bottlenecks encountered during this design. A new bidirectional architecture with each core built using infamous single cycle MIPS architecture is proposed. The bidirectional design facilitates the reversible principle of forward and reverse direction of execution of the architecture. The main goal of this work is to implement and empirically study the outcomes of the reversible system built. The architecture is implemented using commercially available 90 nm technology node. The processor operates at 200 MHz with medium mapping and optimization effort and the performance can be improved with further optimization.

Based on the fuzzy control theory and taking vehicleÂ´s overtaking process as the research objective, the fuzzy controller is designed and simulated. For the control strategy of intelligent vehicles, most research institutions construct the model according to the given moving trajectory, which has the disadvantages of low anti-jamming capability, great costs and lower response speed. The fuzzy control strategy for intelligent vehicles in this paper is a new dynamical fuzzy controller with three-input and three-output, and its control rule base is composed of 135 pieces of fuzzy reasoning rule. The simulation result proves that the control system of this dynamical fuzzy controller is obviously superior to the traditional system of non-fuzzy controller.

The reconstruction of a conducting cylinder is investigated. The forward scattering problem is first analyzed by using the FD-MEI (finite difference measured equation of invariance) method, then the objective function is constructed in terms of the difference between the computed scattering fields and the measured fields, and finally the objective function is minimized based on genetic algorithms for the boundary shape. The solution results in the image reconstruction of a conducting cylinder and is demonstrated by examples.

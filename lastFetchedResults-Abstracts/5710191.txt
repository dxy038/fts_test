This paper presents a computationally efficient method to correct the phase aberration problem arises from the subcutaneous fat layer. The method is based on the determination of thickness of the fat layer to calculate the focusing delay perfectly. The thickness can be determined manually by the user through a qualitative assessment or automatically using a quantitative measure as an objective function. Minimizing the value of the entropy was selected as the cost function. The effect of the fat layer was simulated as a time delays added to the RF data. Experimental studies addressing that the entropy can be used to accurately determine the thickness of the fat layer depending on the selected region of interest. Images of a six pins phantom were reconstructed using a simple and fast method for digital beamforming

Objective: Advancements in fixation devices and techniques in orthopedic surgery during the
recent decades have brought about an increase in operative indications of fracture fixation.
However, in spite of these advances the rate of infection ranges between 0.8 to 1.2% for Total
Hip Arthoplasty (T.H.A), 3.6 to 8.1% for closed fractures and 17.5-21.2% for open fractures.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and correlate the factors affecting
the development of infection among orthopedic patients requiring fracture fixations in our
centre.
Subjects and Methods: This study was carried out during the period of 1383-1384 in
orthopedics ward of Ahwaz Razi Hospital. All patients who were admitted due to upper and
lower extremity fractures and had undergone fracture fixation operations were included in this
study. The patients were followed up and assessed for clinical and laboratory findings of
infection. A specimen from deep tissues were taken for microbial testing and personal data
regarding age, sex and predisposing factors were recorded in a questionnaire.
Results: During the period of this study, 1573 patients had undergone fracture fixation which
including 1239 (78.8 %) men and 334 (21.3%) women. There were 1349 closed fracture
(85.8%) and 224 open fractures (14.2%). Overall 60 patients (3.7%) showed clinical and
laboratory findings of wound infection. In 56 cases the fractures were in lower extremity and
4 in the upper extremity. Infection rate in closed fractures was 1.55% vs 17.41% for open
fractures, the rate of infection increased with severity of fracture type I to lIlc. The most
common recovered microorganisms were Pseudomoras (23.3%), Klebsiella (21.6%) and
Staphylococcu aureus (11.6%). Twenty five % of patients were smoker (>= 10
cigarettes/day), 8.6% had UTI and 6.6% had history of diabetes.
Conclusion: The rate of infection in closed fractures in this study corresponds to universal
data. However, infection rate in open fractures and especially type II & III (a,b,c) was higher
than expected. Among the predisposing factors are smoking more than or equal to 10
cigarettes/day.

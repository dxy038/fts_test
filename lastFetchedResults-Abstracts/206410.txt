Background: Prolactin, a neurohormone, can act as a stimulator of immunity in a number of autoimmune diseases and its high levels have been shown in these diseases.Objective: This study was designed to discover the possible role of prolactin in autoimmune blistering skin diseases. The main gole was to compare the serum prolactin levels and the frequency of hyperprolactinemia in autoimmune skin patients with a control group.Patients & Methods: Serum prolactin levels were measured in 44 patients with autoimmune blistering skin diseases and 44 age and sex matched normal persons.Results: The mean serum prolactin level was higher in the patients group than the control group (13.7 nglml vs 8.4 nglml). Seven of 44 patients (16%) had hyperprolactinema which was significantly higher than control group (P=0.006). Conclusion: According to this study a higher frequency of hyperprolactinemia was observed in	patients suffering from  autoimmune	blistering	diseases in comparison with a control group.

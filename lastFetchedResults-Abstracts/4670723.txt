Many systems are required to perform maintenance actions at the breaks between successive missions. However, it is often impossible to perform all the desirable maintenance actions due to the limited time of the breaks. In such a case, many selective maintenance models were proposed for this problem. In this paper, we propose a selective maintenance model considering the different mission duration time for different subsystems. We formulate the selective maintenance model as a non-linear 0-1 programming problem. The maximum reliability of the next mission is formulated as objective. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated via a numerical example.

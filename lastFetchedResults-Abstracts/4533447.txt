Performance of asphalt pavement gradually declines in using process. As a result of differences such as material, structure, construction, geology and hydrology condition, the development of pavement diseases also exist certain degree of difference. Taking advantage of decision-making method of multi-objective and multi-attribute in mathematical programming, this paper determines the sorting of road maintenance based on the synthesis comparison of smoothness and damage condition as well as pavement skid-resistant.

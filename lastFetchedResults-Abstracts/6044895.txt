Multi-objective control is the problem of optimising various conflicting objectives. In this paper, the multi-objective active vibration control via switching is proposed. The switching is applied to the separately designed <i>H</i> <sub>2</sub> and <i>H</i> <sub>w</sub> controllers, instead of considering both objectives in the synthesis of a single controller. Each controller is designed using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The overall stability of the closed-loop is guaranteed through a specific controller realisation. The <i>H</i> <sub>2</sub> controller is utilised to improve the transient response and the <i>H</i> <sub>&#194;&#191;</sub> controller in steady-state performance. The switching approach in multi-objective control reduces the conservatism of the design. Control of the active vibration system as a regulator is studied in the present paper.

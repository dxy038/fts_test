The major goal of this present work is to evolve combined economic emission dispatch problems employing a modified glowworm swarm based optimization (MGSO) approach. The objective function of this article is treated as cost and emission. The assumption has been carried out by the decision maker for which the multiobjective problem is translated to one intent function. The glowworm swarm based algorithm is considered as a heuristic based approach where the agents communicate with each other via bioluminescent glowing, that enables them to explore the objective function more effectively. The viability and usefulness of the preferred method has been manifested on fourteen generating models. The real results divulge that the elaborated algorithm is facile to converge with significantly less prosecution time. The best favorable solution for economic emission dispatch with reasonable generating amount can thus be reached.

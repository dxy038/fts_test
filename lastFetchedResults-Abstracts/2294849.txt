Psychologists suggest that envy is a negative emotion since it can result  in negative consequences for the organization. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of envy on intention-to-leave the job via self-esteem and uncivil behaviors. To this End, 110 Ghaem hospital nurses in Mashhad were chosen as the statistical population. A questionnaire made of 26questions was used. Construct validity was investigated by Confirmatory-Factor-Analysis method and Korunbakh-Alpha coefficient certified the reliability. AMOS software based on Structural-Equation-Modelling method was applied to analyze data. The results of the research showed the mediating variables_ self-esteem and uncivil behaviors_ can't predict nurseâ€™s intention-to-leave and also envy doesn't have impact on it. However envy can positively affect uncivil behaviors and self-esteem.

Objective: We sought to review the status of patients with breast cancer who were treated with estrogen replacement therapy and compare the results with those of nonestrogenic hormone users and women not treated with hormone replacement. Study Design: The study group consisted of 76 patients with breast cancer, including 50 using estrogen replacement for up to 32 years, 8 using nonestrogenic hormone replacement for up to 6 years and followed for up to 11 years, and 18 using no hormones for up to 10 years. In addition to estrogen use, 40 of the 50 hormone users were treated with androgens, usually in the form of implantation of testosterone pellets. Forty-five subjects were also given progestogens, usually megestrol acetate 20 to 40 mg for 10 to 25 days each month. The 8 nonestrogen hormone users were treated with various combinations of testosterone pellets, tamoxifen, and progestogens. Forty-two of the 50 estrogen users are still being treated in our clinic, as are 2 of the 8 subjects using nonestrogen hormone. Follow-up was done through the tumor registry at University Hospital, and those whose tumor records were not current were telephoned. Results: Of the 50 estrogen users, 3 have died (a mortality rate of 6%), and the rest have been followed for 6 months to 32 years, with a mean duration of follow-up of 83.3 ± 8.81 months. One of the 8 nonestrogen hormone users has died (a mortality rate of 12.5%), and the rest have been followed for 2 to 11 years, with a mean duration of follow-up of 72.0 ± 5.93 months. Six of the 18 women not using hormone replacement have died (a mortality rate of 33.3%), and the rest have been followed for 6 months to 10 years, with a mean duration of follow-up of 50.5 ± 6.01 months. Conclusion: Estrogen replacement therapy apparently does not increase either recurrences or mortality rates. Adding progestogens may even decrease recurrences. Women with early breast cancer should be offered hormone replacement therapy after a full explanation of the benefits, risks, and controversies. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:288-95.)

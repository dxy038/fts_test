The most important risk associated with glaucoma is the onset and progression of intraocular pressure. The objective of this study was to formulate in situ gel of chitosan nanoparticles to enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of dorzolamide in the glaucoma treatment. Optimized nanoparticles were spherical in shape (particle size: 164 nm) with a loading efficiency of 98.1%. The ex vivo release of the optimized in situ gel nanoparticle formulation showed a sustained drug release as compared to marketed formulation. The gamma scintigraphic study of prepared in situ nanoparticle gel showed good corneal retention compared to marketed formulation. HET-CAM assay of the prepared formulation scored 0.33 in 5 min which indicates the non-irritant property of the formulation. Thus in situ gel of dorzolamide hydrochloride loaded nanoparticles offers a more intensive treatment of glaucoma and a better patient compliance as it requires fewer applications per day compared to conventional eye drops.

In this paper, we develop a new control approach for IM. The IM mechanical speed variable perfectly follows its references through a PI controller based on the sliding mode. The associate PI gains of the flux regulator are calculated by pole placement method. The basic idea of this technic is to make stable the closed loop system in the sense of Lyapunov. This method compared with traditional IM control use a simple calculation by the fact that we obtain a global asymptotic stability. The objective of this control technic is based on an appropriate choice of the voltage control values that guaranty a global stability of the closed loop system.

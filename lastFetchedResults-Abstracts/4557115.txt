Considering the situation that both the orbital transfer point of the chaser spacecraft and the intersection of the chaser spacecraft with the target spacecraft are undetermined, the problem of Lambert two-impulse orbital transfer with the optimizing of energy and time is studied. Using knowledge of orbital dynamics to establish a mathematical model of multi-objective orbital planning, the problem is solved by NSGA-II, and a number of Pareto solutions of orbital maneuver are obtained. In the end of the paper, two examples are given. One is the fuel optimal transfer between circular orbits, in which the computing results are compared with that of Hohmann transfer. The other is the fuel and time optimal transfer between elliptical orbits, in which the computing results are imported into STK for Verifying. The results show that this multi-objective planning method for orbital maneuver is reasonable and effective for solving the orbital transfer problem in which energy and time are optimized, and has a certain using value in engineering.

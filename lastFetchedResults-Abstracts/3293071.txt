The objective was to find a way for analyzing the medical x-ray images using fuzzy inference systems in order to confirm the presence of osteosclerosis in the bone sections of the joints of the hand and the knee. The medical x-ray is segmented in order to separate the bone sections from the background. The histogram of the bone sections with the metadata extracted from the medical x-ray is analyzed by the fuzzy inference system. The metadata contains the exposure settings of the x-ray image and is used to determine if the x-ray image was under or over exposed. By using of a special program the osteosclerosis could be emphasized earlier if the patient is coming to doctor when the first symptoms occur. The described method has the advantage to decrease the number of clinical errors in imagistic interpretation.

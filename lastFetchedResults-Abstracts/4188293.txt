The determination of 3D structure from images is one of the most active field in computer vision. This paper gives a contribution presenting a symmetric stereo matching algorithm, based on a bidirectional dynamic programming scanline optimization. Consistent matches are detected by inspecting the images scanlines with a complex exponential weighting window and then analyzing matching score map into a bidirectional optimization framework. Results are presented running the algorithm on stereo pair freely available on the Web, in order to numerically validate the performance.

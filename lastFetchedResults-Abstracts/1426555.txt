Objective
tudy describes the clinical phenomenology and family history of preschool age onset Bipolar Disorder (BD).
s
children and adolescents out of 118 cases (6.78%), both genders, meeting current DSM-IV criteria diagnosis of BD were described. The clinical assessment, CBCL, DICA-IV and CGAS were performed directly with each patient and their parents.
s
87.5%) presented classical symptoms of mania: euphoria, grandiosity, irritability, psychomotor agitation and agitated sleep or, in the same proportion, sleeplessness. Hyperactivity and increase of energy were found in all eight cases. The clinical course varied from a rapid, ultra-rapid, ultradian cycle to a continued pattern. Five out of eight children (62.5%) presented aggressiveness toward others and one deliberate self-harm. Most (87.5%) had psychiatric family history. The average number of medications used during their life was 4.5 drugs.
tion
all sample and retrospective reports of the first manic symptoms in three of the cases (cases V, VI and VII).
sion
ortant incidence of classical manic features was found in very young children. The clinical course tended to be continuous, and preschool BD seems to have a strong association with affective disorder family history.

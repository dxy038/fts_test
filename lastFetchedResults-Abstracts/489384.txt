BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lingual bar is the most common major connector in the mandibular RPDs (removable partial dentures). There is a great controversy about required space for lingual bar. The aim of this study was to evaluate the lingual tissues of anterior mandible and to locate the immovable tissues for placement of lingual bar.
METHODS: In a cross sectional study 60 subjects with normal lingual gingival tissue (Loe gingival index=1or 0), without any history of orthodontic treatment, and with at least 8 teeth from the right 2nd premolar to the left 2nd premolar. These subjects were divided into 3 age groups including (20-29), (30-39) and (40-49) ranges. These measurements consisted of the gingival sulcus, keratinized gingiva, the functional depth of mouth floor, and the width of immovable lingual tissues. Then the measurements were analyzed statistically by SPSS t-test, ANOVA, and post hoc tests.
FINDINGS: The mean value range of immovable lingual tissue width was from 4.53 mm for central incisor to 7.62mm for 2nd premolar. The mean value of lingual immovable tissue width of anterior mandible was greater in male cases (7.22mm) than female ones (6.7mm) except for the right canine. But this difference was not significant statistically.
CONCLUSION: The majority of studied subjects didnâ€™t have capability for lingual bar use. There was no difference between sexes in terms of the mean value of lingual immovable tissue width of anterior mandible. The mean value of lingual immovable tissue width in anterior mandible increased antero-posteriorly.

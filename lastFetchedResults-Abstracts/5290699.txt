Robot vision is very useful for correcting the absolute position error during position control of a robot hand. However it still has difficulties in practical use. The objective of the authorsÂ´ research is to design a stable vision sensor system used for a space robot, by the method of sensor fusion with multi-agents, which is very effective in the actual environment. By this approach, the system will be able to adapt to environmental alterations

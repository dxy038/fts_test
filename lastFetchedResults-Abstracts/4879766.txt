The objective of the logistics management and control in a transport enterprise is to plan for the cheapest way to fulfill the transport needs of the customers and to offer the service to the customer so that, at any time, they know where their products are in the transport process. In case of delays in their transports, it is very important to have the possibility of informing customers as soon as possible in order for them to fulfill their obligations. This paper describes an architecture for mobile integrated logistics management and control where performance, local autonomy and availability are optimized by using relaxed ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) properties and different asynchronous replication methods, and where it also is possible to make integration with stationary systems like the ERP system of the transport enterprise itself and the ERP systems of cooperating transport operators.

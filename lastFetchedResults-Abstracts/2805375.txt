The task of system design involves several aspects including the description of system components and functions, performance requirements, critical failures, and system maintenance. Employing a system-of-systems approach allows the designer to focus on not only the individual aspects but also their interconnection to form a unified whole. The use of SOMPA Core Modeling is a viable strategy for applying the SoS approach to complex system design. The objective of this paper is to illustrate its salient features through a case study, that is, the design of an aircraft landing gear. Using a system of systems approach, one is able to identify design criteria that must be followed if the landing gear is to perform as should reasonably be expected. It is important to note that the design, in addition to the physical and control elements, includes operational procedures and maintenance processes as integral elements. Information from this SOMPA core modeling may be used in a systematic design optimization process through, for example, knowledge amplification.

In this paper, the influence of &#949;-dominance on multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) methods is studied. The most important role of &#949;-dominance is to bound the number of non-dominated solutions stored in the archive (archive size), which has influences on computational time, convergence and diversity of solutions. Here, &#949;-dominance is compared with the existing clustering technique for fixing the archive size and the solutions are compared in terms of computational time, convergence and diversity. A new diversity metric is also suggested. The results show that the &#949;-dominance method can find solutions much faster than the clustering technique with comparable and even in some cases better convergence and diversity.

The main scope of this paper is the implementation of a nonlinear parametric generalized predictive control (NPGPC) that integrates the control and the economic optimization of the system. The two problems are solved simultaneously through the modification of the control cost function that includes an additional term related to the economic objective. This methodology was implemented to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and the results show that the method is efficient and can be used, in several practical case.

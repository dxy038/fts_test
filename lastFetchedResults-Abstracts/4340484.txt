In this paper, we study the performance of a routing algorithm in a CDMA-based sensor network with respect to three energy metrics. These commonly used metrics are expected lifetime, multiple access interference, and queue length - all of which provide insight into how energy is depleted when nodes participate in packet forwarding. We formalize these metrics and show how the delay, throughput, and node life time are affected when routing is performed with a specific objective. Through ns-2 based simulation experiments, we show the tradeoffs between network performance and the different routing strategies adopted. These strategies can also be combined in order to achieve a desired system performance

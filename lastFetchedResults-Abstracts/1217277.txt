Background and Objective:  Resistin, as an adipokine is associated with obesity and insulin resistance, but the effects of different exercise trainings on the levels of this hormone is unknown. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of aerobic with resistance exercise training on change in serum resistin level in obese postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes.
Subjects and Methods:  In a quasi-experimental study 40 women with type 2 diabetes were selected as available and by purposive sampling and were randomly assigned into 3 groups of aerobic training (n = 14), resistance training (n = 13) and control (n = 13) groups. Aerobic group accomplished (12 weeks of aerobic training, 3 times a week, for 20-50 minutes at 50-70% of maximum heart rate), the resistance group received (resistance training 3 times a week in 3 sets of 10 repetitions with 40-60% of a repetition maximum). The control group was sedentary during the same period. Blood samples were collected for measurement of the levels of resistin, insulin, HbA1c and glucose. Insulin resistance was calculated with HOMA-IR equation.
Results: Resistin serum level was increased in both exercise training groups (P < 0.05), anthropometric measurements decreased in aerobic group only (P < 0.05), while insulin resistance was decreased in resistance group (P < 0.05). Glycated hemoglobin and glucose decreased in both training groups (P ?0.05).
Conclusion: It seems that during 12 weeks, both types of aerobic and resistance exercise training have beneficial effects, through different mechanisms, in patients with type 2 diabetes

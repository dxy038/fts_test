We present a novel framework for encoding latency analysis of arbitrary multiview video coding prediction structures. This framework avoids the need to consider an specific encoder architecture for encoding latency analysis by assuming an unlimited processing capacity on the multiview encoder. Under this assumption, only the influence of the prediction structure and the processing times have to be considered, and the encoding latency is solved systematically by means of a graph model. The results obtained with this model are valid for a multiview encoder with sufficient processing capacity and serve as a lower bound otherwise. Furthermore, with the objective of low latency encoder design with low penalty on rate-distortion performance, the graph model allows us to identify the prediction relationships that add higher encoding latency to the encoder. Experimental results for JMVM prediction structures illustrate how low latency prediction structures with a low rate-distortion penalty can be derived in a systematic manner using the new model.

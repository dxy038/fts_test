Procedures are described for implementing finite element magnetic field analysis techniques in the design of electric machines, transformers, and related devices. The implementation is aimed at a rapid-response, low-cost intelligent graphics terminal. By means of interactive commands communicated via the graphics screen or terminal keyboard, designers can solve two-dimensional field problems involving saturable materials, and to produce graphs, curves, and flux plots, as well as to compute numeric results. Either black and white or color can be used. The objective of this work is to make the finite element method an engineering design tool easy to use in practical situations, rather than to present a new mathematical formulation.

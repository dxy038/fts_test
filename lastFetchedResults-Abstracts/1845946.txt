The objective was to ascertain whether MRI and image processing can be used to quantify atherosclerosis by measuring wall thickness in rabbit aorta. The abdominal aortas of 2 healthy and 5 atherosclerotic rabbits were examined with a gradient-echo inflow angiography sequence (2DI) and a proton density weighted turbo-spin-echo sequence (PDW). Using thresholding by four observers and 3D morphology operators, segmentation of the artery and vein lumina was performed from the 2DI sequence, and of surrounding fat and muscle from the PDW sequence. Remaining voxels adjacent to the aortic lumen were classified as vessel wall. By measuring the vessel wall volume and the lumen volume, the wall percentage was calculated. The values were significantly higher for the diseased animals than for unaffected individuals (p &lt; 0.01). It is concluded that aortic wall thickening in atherosclerotic rabbits can be measured quantitatively by using MRI combined with 3D morphology image processing operators.

Objective: We determined the relative abundance of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase type 1 and type 2 messenger ribonucleic acid levels in the human fetus and newborn infant. Study Design: We used ribonuclease protection assays and normalized values to messenger ribonucleic acid of cyclophilin. Tissues were obtained from all 3 trimesters and in the first 9 days of the newborn period. Results: Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase type 1 and type 2 messenger ribonucleic acid is present in every fetal tissue examined (lung, kidney, intestine, heart, brain, and stomach). Kidney and lung demonstrated no changes in the expression of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase type 1 messenger ribonucleic acid with gestational age, whereas postnatal levels in lung were one third those in the first trimester (P< .05). A large increase (5-fold to 30-fold; P< .05) occurred throughout gestation for the expression of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase type 2 messenger ribonucleic acid in intestine, lung, and kidney, which extended into the newborn period for lung and kidney. Conclusions: These data imply that the expression of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase type 2 messenger ribonucleic acid may be responsible for prostaglandin-related effects and is coordinated in several human fetal tissues in late gestation.

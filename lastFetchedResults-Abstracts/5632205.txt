We present a novel sensor calibration methodology that is suited to an evidence theoretic unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) localization system. The proposed procedure for sensor calibration employs a series of designed experiments with the objective of creating parametric calibration models and forming a mass assignment table for a Dempster-Shafer belief system. Sensors calibrated include custom built magnetic encoders positioned at the rear wheels of the UGV, an accelerometer, a solid-state rate-gyro, a digital compass, and a global positioning system (GPS). The estimated parameters together with a mass assignment table are presented. This table is created for the GPS unit based on the factors that significantly impact the accuracy of the readings using an experimental procedure. We conclude with a brief summary of the main results.

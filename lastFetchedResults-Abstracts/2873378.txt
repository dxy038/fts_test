With high data rate and mobility support wireless networks are becoming an integral part of the ubiquitous broadband access. Appropriate dimensioning of the wireless access networks is essential to satisfy users´ Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Once the network is dimensioned, dynamic variations in traffic or population distribution can affect the capability of the network to deliver the agreed QoS of connections. Consequently, re-dimension the network may be necessary. Current researches do not discuss the effects of QoS schemes on the capacity of the network. In this paper, we investigate the impact of QoS schemes on the capacity of the network. The objective is to determine the capability of the network to deal with the variations in the demography of the covered area and the user´s traffic profile with the proposed QoS schemes including Congestion Control (CC) and Radio Admission Control (RAC). Different scenarios are presented to evaluate the effects of QoS schemes on the capacity of the network. This investigation will assist network operators to determine the point after which the network needs to be re-dimensioned.

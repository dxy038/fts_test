This paper presents the continuing development of flexible Level-0 command and telemetry collection hardware. Results of the requirements analysis, systems design and hardware fabrication and test are presented in detail. The objective of this research program was to provide a module that could handle a variety of interfaces accessible from either a spacecraftÂ´s main computer or an on-board microcontroller. The module must serve as a level-0 &#8220;safe&#8221; mode processor and be able to execute commands received from the ground. The system designed as a result of this IR&amp;D will be used in those applications where a critical need exists for a level-0 &#8220;safe&#8221; mode processor. The design may also be used to speed up system throughput by way of parallel processing with the main computer

This work presents a systematic approach for modeling, optimization and control of metal hydride tanks used for hydrogen storage. A detailed mathematical model is developed using commercial software MATLAB, the objective is to know the maximum of temperature generated during hydrogen absorption and its profile according to time for various tank dimensions. The material we use here is LaNi4.78Sn0.22. This model provides significant insight into the problem of heat exchange and first hand information about the temperature at the surface of the tank at different times.

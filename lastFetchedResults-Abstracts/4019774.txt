Evaluating the perceptual quality of video is of tremendous importance in the design and optimization of wireless video processing and transmission systems. In an endeavor to emulate human perception of quality, various objective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms have been developed. However, the only subjective video quality database that exists on which these algorithms can be tested is dated and does not accurately reflect distortions introduced by present generation encoders and/or wireless channels. In order to evaluate the performance of VQA algorithms for the specific task of H.264 advanced video coding compressed video transmission over wireless networks, we conducted a subjective study involving 160 distorted videos. Various leading full reference VQA algorithms were tested for their correlation with human perception. The data from the paper has been made available to the research community, so that further research on new VQA algorithms and on the general area of VQA may be carried out.

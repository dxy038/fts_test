For residue hydrotreating catalysts that are deactivated mainly by pore blockage due to deposition of metals, the capacity for accommodation of the deposited metals is an important parameter in determining its stability and life. The primary objective of the present work is to determine the maximum metal capacity of different catalysts that are used in different reactors of atmospheric residue desulfurization (ARDS) units by accelerated aging tests in a short duration. A feedstock with high metals content, namely, Boscan crude, was used for the tests in a multireactor pilot plant to cause complete deactivation of the catalysts by metal accumulation in a shorter period. The influence of operating temperature and LHSV on the rate of catalyst deactivation was also examined for the high metal feed. Catalyst deactivation rate was found to be more than five times faster for the high metal Boscan feed compared to the conventional atmospheric residue from Kuwait export crude. It was possible to determine MMOC of an ARDS catalyst system within 45â€“50 days by accelerated deactivation test using a high metal feed (e.g., Boscan crude).

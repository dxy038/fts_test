The deployment of air power from the US to a target through staging bases requires a highly flexible and reliable means of communications. Such a system must be in place and ready to support an air effort when it is required. The United States Air Force Strategic Communications system, commonly referred to as GLOBECOM, is described. GLOBECOM is a world-wide long-range, point-to-point and air-ground communications system designed for the control of air operations world-wide. It consists of an integrated and engineering system of US Air Force radio stations, together with other leased or allocated wire and radio channels, necessary terminal equipment, relay facilities, communications centers, and cryptographic centers, for use by the Air Force as a whole. It does not include tactical and special purpose communications systems except as specificially designated by Air Force Headquarters. The broad Air Force policy objective is to integrate all Air Force communications facilities except tactical into one system, so as to achieve efficient control of air operations and. the effective and economical utilization of common facilities for both administrative and operational communications. Air Force H??adquarters formulates the over-all policies, plans and programs with respect to the installation, removal, or change of GLOBECOM circuits.

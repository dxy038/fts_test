Also, several dictionaries, encyclopedias and reference books were used for correct understanding of the meaning of ancient medical terms and idioms. 
Results: The findings demonstrated that many of the topics mentioned in the ancient Iranian textbooks had a scientific foundation and are compatible and comparable with the contemporary dental science.
Conclusion: Based on the results of the present study and similar previous researches, we can state that the ancient Iranian medicine is not at all distant from the contemporary science. It is the foundation of the contemporary medicine and further researches on the medical history of ancient Persia can reveal many valuable findings that can be used for educational, therapeutic and research purposes.

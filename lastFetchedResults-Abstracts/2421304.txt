Background and objective: Swimming pools being some of the popular sport centers are able to potentially receive some pollutants such as nasal secretions, saliva and urine and endanger the health of swimmers. The aim of this study was to determine the bacterial and fungal pollution of swimming pools in Karaj
city and effect of some environmental factors on it.

Materials and Method: In this study, 7 pools and 103 samples including water and environmental surfaces were evaluated with standard methods. Residual chlorine, pH, number of swimmers and temperatur were studied. SPSS statistical software (version 19) was used for data analysis and the P-value was ? 0.05.

Results: research showed that the average of PH and residual chlorine was 7/5 & 2/20 ppm, correspondingly. 24/27% of samples were positive for one or more fungal contamination. Aspergillus spp were 65/71%, Candida spp 20%, Rodotrolla spp 2/86%, other filamentous fungi 8/57% and other yeast species 2/86%.
MPN test in 93/4% and HPC test in 84/6% were in the standard range. Results of tests with carpet samples showed the highest contamination was in dressing room. statistical analysis indicated that there is a direct relationship between decrease of residual chlorine, increase of number of swimmers with increase
of contamination.

Conclusion: Test results indicate the presence of bacterial and fungal contamination in water and equipment pools. It is proffered to use the filtration and chlorination systems and teaching people about compliance hygiene

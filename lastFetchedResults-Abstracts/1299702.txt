Background and Objective: Continuing Medical Education (CME) is a key element in increasing the knowledge, skill, quality and effectiveness of health systems. Initially the CME programs were defined as face to face programs, but for many reasons distance learning by CME programs was also introduced. 
Aim: This study aimed to determine the viewpoints of faculty members of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences about distance learning by CME.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 74 faculty members participating in CME programs in 2011 were selected by convenience sampling method. The data was collected through a researcher-made questionnaire which was complete by self-report. The data were analyzed by SPSS (v.18).
Results: 58.6% of subjects agreed with distance learning CME and said that they preferred over 40% of CME be performed as programs. Among these subjects, 53.7% put on-line CME as a first priority.
Conclusion: The attitudes of faculty members toward distance learning programs were positive. Therefore, distance learning programs including on-line CME are suggested.

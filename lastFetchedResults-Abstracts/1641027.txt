The objective of this study was to develop stainless steel slag (oxidizing slag-SSOS) and (reducing slag-SSRS) of varying fineness to replace concrete binding material. The findings indicate that when the fineness of stainless steel SSOS and SSRS is approximately 4400 cm2/g in 30% substitution cement, the compressive strength is better than the ASTM C150 standard, the Slag-Activity index of stainless steel SSRS matches the ASTM C989 standard Grade 80 of B.F. slag, the setting time also conforms to the ASTM C150 standard requirement, and there is no heavy metal dissolution problem. Therefore, the stainless steel slag may qualify as a concrete binding material; the need for cement could thereby be reduced, which can contribute to resource recycling and environmental protection.

An adjoint-based functional optimization technique in conjunction with the spectral stochastic finite
element method is proposed for the solution of an inverse heat conduction problem in the presence
of uncertainties in material data, process conditions and measurement noise. The ill-posed stochastic
inverse problem is restated as a conditionally well-posed L2 optimization problem. The gradient of the
objective function is obtained in a distributional sense by defining an appropriate stochastic adjoint
field. The L2 optimization problem is solved using a conjugate-gradient approach. Accuracy and
effectiveness of the proposed approach is appraised with the solution of several stochastic inverse heat
conduction problems

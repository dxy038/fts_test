Objective: We designed this study to investigate the effects of oral L-camitine administration on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) and lipid parameters in patients with diabetes mellitus type II. Materials and methods: The effect of L-camitlne on FPG and lipid parameters was investigated In 22 male and 14 female type II diabetic patients, mean agetSD was 51.3±3.7 years. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups (i.e.test and control groups). One gram of L-carnltine or placebo was given orally three times a day to the test and control groups respectively for a period of 12 weeks. Results: Fasting plasma glucose in the test group decreased significantly from 143±35 mgldl to130±33 mg/di (p=0.03), and a significant increase of triglycerides (TG) from 196±61 mgldl to 233±116 mg/dL (p=0.05), of APO Al from 94±20 mgldL to103±23 mgldl (p=0.02), of APO B100 from 98±18 mg/dL to108±22 mg/di (p=0.02) after 12 weeks of treatment was observed. There were no significant changes in LDL-C, HDL-C, HbAIC or in total cholesterol (IC) between the two groups. Conclusion: L-camitine significantly lowers fasting plasma glucose but increases fasting triglycerides in type II diabetic patients.

Introduction & Objective: Malaria is a cosmopolitan parasitic disease. Its causative agents, i.e. strains of plasmodium, still sacrifice more than any other infectious disease in many regions. According to WHO report, more than 300-500 million people are affected by malaria in the world and from these 1.5-2.7 million cases ( specially children) die annually. Concerning the unclear epidemiological situation of malaria in Kohgiloyeh and Boyerahmad province and suitable condition of transmission of this disease by migration of people to this province, this study was carried out to investigate the situation of malaria in 1996-2003 . Materials & Methods: This descriptive study was carried out prospectively by collecting the patients records (485) in health center of Kohgiloyeh and Boyerahmad province during 1996-2003. The data were transferred to the designed tables according to desired variables such as age, sex , year, nationality, type of the parasite and township. Collected data were analyzed by SPSS software.
Results: Most of 485 Malaria cases were from Kohgiloyhe (41%) and the least cases were from Gachsaran (18.7%). The highest rate of infection was among 20 years old people. P.vivax and P. falciparum were responsible for 64.4 and 5.2 percent of the cases respectively while 0.4% of cases were infected with both parasites. 64% of cases were male and 36% were female. In nationality aspect, Iranian patients were 62.7% and Afghan patients were 37.3 % .
Conclusion: Results of this study show that status of malaria is getting better and this means that the prevention and control programs of malaria have been successful. However for reaching ideal situation, programs of prevention and control of disease should be continued with more attention. Nonnative individuals especially Afghan migrant should be quarantined and allowing them for dwelling after complete recovery.

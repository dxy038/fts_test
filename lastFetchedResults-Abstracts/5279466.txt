Aiming at solving multi-criteria decision (MCDM) problems in transmission network planning, a new decision-making method based on gray correlation degree and TOPSIS is proposed. On the basis of introducing the concept of gray correlation degree into traditional TOPSIS, it combines the Euclidean distance with gray correlation degree and establishes a new kind of relative similarity degree to decide the quality of alternatives. The method could overcome error originated from biased thinking due to subjective and objective factors in decision-making problem when using single method and boosts up reliability of evaluation result in transmission network planning.

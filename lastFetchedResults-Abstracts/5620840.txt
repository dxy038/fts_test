In order to obtain the optimal parameters of flight control laws for a certain helicopterpsilas coordinated turning motion, a novel method based on multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is proposed. In this method, design of flight control laws for coordinated turning motion is viewed as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) where obtaining optimal performances in each design flight envelop are treated as sub-objectives and that in all design flight envelops are looked upon as overall objectives, parameters of coordinated turning control laws, specified performance criteria are respectively viewed as decision variables and constraints. Then MOGA is used to solve the MOP intention to find out the optimal parameters of control laws for coordinated turning motion in all chosen flight envelops. The simulation results show that the parameters own better ability of restraining sideslip, better adaptability and robustness, which further prove that the method is effective.

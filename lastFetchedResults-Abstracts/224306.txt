The purpose of thw paper is to present a
useful algorithm for mimmizing harmomc voltage distortion
levels wth multi le current-constrained active power line
conditioners (APtCs) in a power system. The algorithm
contains a sensitivity analysis-based single- APLC placement
rocedure and uses a nonlinear programming optimizer
ERG2 to improve the solution if necessary The usefulness
of this algorithm is then illustrated by a distribution system
Simulation results show that the algorithm is
simp e, computationally efficient, and can be easily extended
to minimize several other alternative harmonic-related
network objective functions.

This paper focuses on a dc-ac resonant power converter using a special sine-wave amplitude-modulation concept with the objective of achieving a linear input-output behavior, low harmonic content at the output, and reduced stages number. This technique can be applied to a wide range of resonant convertersÂ´ applications. Sine-wave generation techniques and phase-modulation method limitations are analyzed. Alternative solutions, such as a new predistorted phase modulator, are developed. A prototype was designed and implemented. Presented experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented principle.

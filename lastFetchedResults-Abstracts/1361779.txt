Strategic thinking introduced over the past two decades; and its need was emphasized for organizations and managers since 10 years ago, but there is no model for evaluating the ability of strategic thinking yet. Therefore in this study, a conceptual model was provided based on strategic thinking literature for measuring the strategic thinking. To achieve this objective, a questionnaire prepared and distributed between 70 active managers in the Tile and Ceramic Industry. Finally, 55 questionnaires data were analyzed using structural equation approach and  the Amos software. 
The results show that strategic thinking could be measured by five factors of "incarnation of the desired future and focusing on it", "intelligent opportunism with systems perspective", "understanding the situation based on learning and cognitive concepts", "flexible decision making based on the hypothesis" and "ability for development of organizational infrastructure" as observable variables. Moreover, an incarnation of desired future had a positive effect on intelligent opportunism and ability of development for organizational infrastructure.

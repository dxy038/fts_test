Introduction: Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is one of
the most appropriate methods for assessment of clinical skills.Validity and
reliability assurance is a mandatory factor for any assessment tool. In Shiraz
University of Medical Sciences, medical students’ clinical competences are
evaluated by a pre-internship OSCE. This study is designed to examine the
validity and reliability of this exam. Validity is the extent to which the test
measures what it intends to measure. Reliability refers to the accuracy of
measurement and the consistency of test results.
Methods: Content validity was evaluated by expert opinion about blueprinting
and station checklists. To determine the construct validity, station scores
correlation with the total OSCE score and inter station correlations were
calculated. The inter examiner reliability was assessed by coefficient of
correlation.
Results: Content validity was established by alignment between the curriculum
and the blueprint using expert opinion. Correlation of the station scores with
the total OSCE score were positive and statistically significant in all stations
except the 16th station (suturing). Inter examiner reliability coefficients of
correlations ranged 0.33 – 0.99, with an average of 0.83.
Conclusions: Our findings support the assumption that the pre-internship
OSCE is valid, reliable and suitable to assess students’ clinical competence.
Validity and reliability studies should be performed for all new assessment
tools, particularly in high-stakes assessments.

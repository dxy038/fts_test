In the small community like a family, there exist several TODO tasks to be performed cooperatively by the members for making the community life easier. The TODO tasks have to be performed by someone in the community, therefore, it is preferable that the tasks should be done by the members without a big burden. In this context, we focus on TODO task management in a family, and propose a method to make a schedule in which the family members cooperate each other to achieve TODO tasks by taking account of multiple constraints, e.g., membersÂ´ expert ability, schedules, etc. To make such a schedule, we use multi-objective genetic algorithm.

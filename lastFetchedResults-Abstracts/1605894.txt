In this study, selenium was recovered from an industrial dust. After the purification process, the researchers were able to prepare selenium micro powder. The objective of this study was to prepare selenium nano particles by water solution phase method from the micro powders. The results showed that selenium micronized powder and nano particles had high purity. The obtained nanoparticles were tube shaped with 20 nm size.

Objective: Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are common among the women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Familial aggregation of PCOS has implications on the role of heredity in this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate insulin resistance among the fathers, mothers, and siblings of the women with PCOS referring to the clinics affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.
Materials and Methods: The present case-control study was conducted on 107 individuals as the case group and 107 individuals as the control group. After recording their height and weight, blood samples were obtained from all the participants in order to assay their serum insulin and blood sugar. Then, the participants were supposed to drink 75 gr glucose solutions and after lapsing 2 hours, blood samples were again taken from all the participants. Finally, the data were analyzed using independent t-test, Fisher's exact test, and chi-square test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statically significant. All the statistical analyses were performed through the SPSS statistical software (ver. 11.5).
Results: A significant difference was found between the two groups regarding glucose intolerance, obesity, and insulin resistance according to Homeostasis Model Assessment Index (HOMA) and
Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), and fasting insulin indexes (P < 0.05). Moreover, a significant association was observed between android obesity and glucose intolerance (P < 0.05), body mass index (? 30 Kg/m2), and type II diabetes in the two groups.
Conclusion: The first-degree relatives of the women suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome constitute a risk group and early identification of insulin resistance may prevent the onset and progression of the disease.

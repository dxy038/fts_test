Objective
rpose of this study was to examine the associations between dimensions of perfectionism (self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism) and health functioning in a sample of 489 women with fibromyalgia.
s
chical multiple regression was used to determine whether dimensions of perfectionism were differentially associated with health functioning among women with fibromyalgia after accounting for broader personality traits related to both perfectionism and health functioning.
s
sults confirmed that both socially prescribed perfectionism and self-oriented perfectionism were associated with lower health functioning. Moreover, these associations were found after accounting for the effects of conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism. The findings involving self-oriented perfectionism were particularly complex and suggested that moderate self-oriented perfectionism may be somewhat adaptive, but too much or too little self-oriented perfectionism is associated with substantial reductions in health functioning among women with fibromyalgia.
sion
tively, these findings clarify that overall levels of perfectionism are not elevated among women with fibromyalgia, but those women who are exceptionally high in levels of self-oriented perfectionism or high in socially prescribed perfectionism are particularly likely to suffer lower health functioning. These results suggest that perfectionism should be specifically assessed and targeted for intervention among women with fibromyalgia and there should be a particular emphasis on the pressure to meet perceived or actual expectations imposed on the self.

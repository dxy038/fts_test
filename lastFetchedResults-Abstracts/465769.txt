Objective: This study was undertaken to investigate changes in chondroitin sulfate levels in the cervix and the physiologic role of chondroitin sulfate isomers in the process of cervical ripening. Study Design: Uterine cervical mucus samples were obtained from 57 women (7 nonpregnant women, 19 at preterm gestation, 9 at term gestation, 16 during the first stage of term labor, and 6 with threatened premature labor). Chondroitin sulfate isomer (chondroitin 0-sulfate, 4-sulfate, and 6-sulfate) concentrations in cervical mucus were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The effect of exogenous chondroitin sulfate on hyaluronidase activity in cervical mucus was evaluated by gel permeation chromatography of fluorolabeled hyaluronic acid. Results: Chondroitin sulfate concentrations in cervical mucus were increased significantly (P< .05) in the threatened premature labor group compared with the preterm and term groups. However, the same finding was not observed in the first stage of term labor. Exogenous chondroitin sulfate inhibited hyaluronidase activity in mucus. Conclusion: Chondroitin sulfate may defend against cervical ripening in threatened premature labor.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:334-9.)

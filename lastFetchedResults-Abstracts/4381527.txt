This paper presents a rotational phase frequency detector (RPFD) for reference-less clock and data recovery circuit (CDR). The proposed RPFD changes the bang-bang phase detector (BBPD) characteristic from a bidirectional phase detection to an unilateral phase detection for capturing clock frequency. The phase-and-frequency lock loop (PFLL) locks the clock frequency and the clock phase alternatively. The single-loop CDR replaces the dual-loop CDR so as to eliminate the noise contribution from the frequency lock loop (FLL). This proposed design is fabricated in TSMC mixed-signal 1P9M 90-nm standard CMOS process with overall die size of 0.71- mm<sup>2</sup>. With input 10-Gb/s data of a 2<sup>31</sup>-1 PRBS, the CDR tracks free running clock over the capture range of 1.48 GHz and locks in the acquisition time of 20 &#956;s. At the same time, the peak-to-peak jitters show only 5.0 ps in the recovered clock and exhibits 15.11 ps in the recovered data. The measured chip consumes 92 mW with 1.0-V supply voltage.

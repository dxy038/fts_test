Objective
rch for possible novel genes that may be involved in tooth development, we analysed the genome-wide transcriptome of developing mandibular tooth germs of mouse during embryonic and early life and selected family-with-sequence-similarity-46, member A (Fam46a) gene for further expression analysis.
s
lied microarray, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridisation methods for the expression study of the mouse Fam46a gene.
s
nd the family-with-sequence-similarity-46, member A (Fam46a) gene to be highly expressed and further verify its temporo-spatial expression in the mouse tooth.
sion
e shown that Fam46a is expressed in ameloblastsâ€™ nuclei of tooth germs and hypothesise that it might act together with morphogenetic factors important for the formation of enamel in mouse tooth.

Selection of advanced manufacturing technology is important for improving manufacturing system competitiveness. This study builds a group decision-making model using fuzzy multiple attributes analysis to evaluate the suitability of manufacturing technology. Since numerous attributes have been considered in evaluating the manufacturing technology suitability, most information available in this stage is subjective and imprecise, and fuzzy sets theory provides a mathematical framework for modeling imprecision and vagueness. The proposed approach involved developing a fusion method of fuzzy information, which was assessed using both linguistic and numerical scales. In addition, an interactive decision analysis is developed to make a consistent decision. When evaluating the suitability of manufacturing technology, it may be necessary to improve upon the technology, and naturally advanced manufacturing technology is seen as the best direction for improvement. The flexible manufacturing system adopted in the Taiwanese bicycle industry is used in this study to illustrate the computational process of the proposed method. The results of this study are more objective and unbiased, owing to being generated by a group of decision-makers.

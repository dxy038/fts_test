The function of a bioprosthetic heart valve is determined largely by the material properties of the valve cusps. The mechanics of natural and bioprosthetic valve cusps have been studied extensively using uniaxial tensile testing. This type of testing, however, does not duplicate the natural biaxial loading condition. Whole-valve biaxial testing therefore is preferred. The objective of the present study was to investigate the heterogeneity of the valve cusps by mapping out the regional variability of the biaxial strain versus pressure relationship. Whole porcine aortic valves were mounted horizontally, submerged in physiologic saline solution at 37°C, and pressurized in the range of 0 to 130 mm Hg of pressure. The ventricular side of the cusps were marked with black dots and the three-dimensional position of these dots was recorded together with the aortic pressure. By calculating the distance between the dots in the radial and circumferential directions in different regions, the local strain versus pressure relationship was determined. The results showed that the valve cusp material strained by 23% ± 0.8% in the radial direction and 10.0% ± 0.5% in the circumferential direction before lock-up. It was also found that while the valve cusp was highly anisotropic in the central region, the basal region was relatively isotropic, and the cusp as a whole was asymmetrical in its distensibility.

We suggest a shape optimization method for a non-linear and non-steady-state metal forming problem. It
consists in optimizing the initial shape of the part as well as the shape of the preform tool during a two-step
forging operation, for which the shape of the second operation is known. Shapes are described using spline
functions and optimal parameter values of the splines are searched in order to produce, at the end of the
forging sequence, a part with a prescribed geometric accuracy, optimal metallurgical properties and for
a minimal production cost. The finite element method, including numerous remeshing operations, is used for
the simulation of the process. We suggest using a least-squares-type algorithm for the unconstrained
optimization method (based on external penalty) for which we describe the calculation of the derivatives of
the objective function. We show that it can reduce to calculations which are equivalent to the derivative
calculations of steady-state processes and to evolution equations. Therefore, the computational cost of such
an optimization is quite reasonable, even for complex forging processes. Lastly, in order to reduce the errors
due to the numerous remeshings during the simulation, we introduce error estimation and adaptive
remeshing methods with respect to the calculation of derivatives.

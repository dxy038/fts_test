Abstract
Introduction: Although nurses are among the main users of hospital information systems, sometimes their resistant to using information technology are reported. The main objective of this study was to compare nurses’ satisfaction with, and expectations of, hospital information systems in Firoozgar and Imam Khomeini teaching hospitals.
Methods: This was an applied research study. The study population was nurses worked in Firoozgar and Imam Khomeini teaching hospitals. The study sample was 267 nurses. Data were collected using two questionnaires. Content validity and coefficient Cronbach Alpha were used to check the validity and the reliability of the questionnaires. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (t-test).
Results: The results of the study showed that most of the nurses’ expectations of the system were not met in Firoozgar (n=88, %92.6) and Imam Khomeini (n=74, %89.2) teaching hospitals. Also, the results showed that there was a significant relationship between the nurses’ expectations confirmation and the perceived system usefulness (Pvalue < 0/001), between the nurses’ expectations confirmation and their satisfaction with the systems (Pvalue < 0/001) and between the perceived system usefulness and nurses' satisfaction with the systems (Pvalue < 0/001).
Conclusion: The findings of the study suggested that the nurses’ expectations of hospital information systems were not met in most areas. It seems that more attention should be paid to the nursing processes and nurses’ information needs. Moreover, it is necessary to involve nurses in the process of designing and developing hospital information systems.

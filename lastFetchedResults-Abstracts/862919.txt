A general instance of a Degree-Constrained Subgraph problem may be found in an edgeweighted
or vertex-weighted graph G whereas the objective is to find an optimal weighted
subgraph, subject to certain degree constraints on the vertices of the subgraph. This class
of combinatorial problems has been extensively studied due to its numerous applications
in network design. If the input graph is bipartite, these problems are equivalent to
classical transportation and assignment problems in operational research. This paper is an
illustration of a research of the NP-hard Maximum Degree-Bounded Connected Subgraph
problem (MDBCS). It is a classical NP-complete problem. Moreover this paper offers a
first integer linear programming formulation of the (MDBCS), and a formal proof that it
is correct. A genetic algorithm for obtaining the optimal solution of (MDBCS) has also
been provided. The proposed solution comprises a genetic algorithm (GA) that uses binary
representation, fine-grained tournament selection, one-point crossover, simple mutation
with frozen genes and caching technique.

Raising the degree of grain filling is an important issue for the genetic improvement of extra-heavy panicle type rice which does not always realize the high yield potential due to low degree of grain filling. The objective of this study was to analyze the variation and association of the traits related to grain filling in four cultivars, three extra-heavy panicle types and one non-extra- heavy panicle type as a control, under seven environments. The results showed wide variation among cultivars and among growing environments in most of the traits examined. In addition, significant interactions between cultivar and environment were detected. From the analyses of joint regression and genetic and environmental correlations, an extra-heavy panicle type cultivar, Milyang 23, showed a higher degree of grain filling and higher rate of grain filling (grain weight/ cumulative temperature), in response to several environments with a higher temperature and longer sunshine hours under which a large amount of photoassimilates would be available to grains. On the contrary, another extra-heavy panicle type cultivar, Akenohoshi, showed a lower rate of grain filling, even under the favorable environments mentioned above, resulting in a lower degree of grain filling. The difference in the rate of grain filling between Milyang 23 and Akenohoshi might be due to the difference in the growth of individual endosperm cells, not in the number of cells, because these two cultivars had similar grain sizes. This study obviously emphasized the importance of high grain sink activity in the genetic improvement of grain filling in extra-heavy panicle type rice.

In this paper, we propose an integrated architecture for modeling, simulation, and execution of PLC (programmable logic controller) based manufacturing system. The main objective is to integrate the high level modeling, simulation, and device level executable code generation. This architecture can improve the fidelity between high level system model and lower level PLC controlled devices. In this paper, we model the shop floor controller system using DEVS (discrete event system specification) formalism, subsequently, simulate the model and generate SOP (sequence of operations). We added two algorithms in conventional DEVS, the first algorithm makes an interface between 3D graphic model and DEVS model, whereas, the second algorithm generates SOP. As a result, the generated SOP can be mapped with PLC I/O (input/output) address to generate an executable controller code. For the purpose of further validation and implementation, the generated program can be downloaded to software or hardware PLC.

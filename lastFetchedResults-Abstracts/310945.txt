Objective. Plantar pressures of Parkinson patients in a mild or moderate stage of the disease were analyzed in order to determine characteristics of the heel to toe motion of the foot in Parkinson patients during free walking.

Design. Pressure sensitive insoles were used to quantify the in-shoe pressure distribution for 24 patients with Parkinson's disease and for 24 age-matched healthy adults. Peak plantar pressures, relative loads and the variability of relative loads were analyzed for 10 different anatomical foot areas. Inferential statistics and regression analyses were performed to compare subject groups and to relate pressure data to a clinical score (Webster).

Background. It is well-known that Parkinson patients experience disorders of balance, posture and gait. Recent studies revealed that Parkinson patients show abnormalities in foot strike during walking. However, only little is known about the heel to toe motion of the foot in Parkinson patients in compensating for instability during walking.

Results. Parkinson patients show significant changes in foot loading behavior. Parkinson patients have a reduced impact at heel strike. This mechanism was found to be related to the severity of the disease. Furthermore, Parkinson patients show a trend towards higher relative loads in the forefoot regions combined with a load shift towards medial foot areas. These mechanisms are highly stereotypical.

Conclusion. Parkinson patients, even in a mild or moderate stage of the disease, show significant changes in heel to toe motion of the foot during free walking. The characteristics of Parkinsonian gait are probably caused by adaptive mechanisms of the patients to avoid unsteadiness during walking.

An improved genetic algorithm is proposed for nonlinear programming problems with inequality constraints. In this algorithm, mutation operator is given by mimicking the physics of electromagnetism, and fitness function is given by evaluation function and objective function. To evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm, the algorithm is applied to two test problems, and our results are compared with other methods.

Although cationic metal contaminants can be effectively removed from wastewaters by treatment with biopolymers, application of biopolymers for the removal of anionic contaminants (such as As, Cr(VI), and Se) has been limited. The objective of this study was to examine the fundamental aspects of a possible remediation strategy for removal of anionic metal species employing the biopolymer alginic acid pretreated with Ca and Fe(III). Spherical gel beads (2 mm in diameter) were formed by dispensing the biopolymer solution dropwise into 0.1 M CaCl2; Ca beads were then washed and equilibrated with 0.1 M FeCl3 to achieve partial substitution of Fe(III) for Ca. The resulting Ca–Fe beads were found to be effective at removing As(V) from solution on a time scale of approximately 100 h. As(V) sorption was pH dependent; optimal removal and stability of the Ca–Fe beads was achieved at pH 4. At a given initial As(V) concentration, As(V) removal efficiency increased with increasing Fe content (number of beads); at an initial As(V) concentration of 400 μg/l, up to 94% removal was achieved at pH 4 after 120 h. For a given Fe content, uptake of As(V) increased with increasing initial As(V) concentration until saturation was reached. Sorption data was modeled using a single type of As(V) binding site. Data on As(V) sorption as a function of dissolved As(V) concentration and Fe content were used to obtain and validate the site density and conditional affinity constant for As(V) sorption.

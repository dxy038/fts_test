The optimisation of mass rapid transit
(MRT) systems is often a slow process as it
requires a large number of simulations of train
operations. In order to reduce the solution effort,
tabu search is applied. Tabu search is a modern
heuristic optimisation method that can achieve an
optimal or sub-optimal solution within a
reasonably short time. The paper demonstrates
how the search is applied over a period of time to
successfully optimise the traction substation
location and rectifier firing angle. Integrated with
a train simulator, the approach is tested with two
objective criteria: minimum traction energy
consumption and equal load sharing.

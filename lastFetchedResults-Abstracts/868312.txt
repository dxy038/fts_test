This paper studies the single machine scheduling problem for the objective of minimizing the expected number of tardy jobs. Jobs have normally distributed processing times and a common deterministic due date. We develop new approaches for this problem that generate near optimal solutions. The original stochastic problem is transformed into a non-linear integer programming model and its relaxations. Computational study validates their effectiveness by comparison with optimal solutions.

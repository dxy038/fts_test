This paper describes the modeling of CO<sub>2</sub> cap &amp; trade among coal power plants. A regional approach is used to include CO<sub>2</sub> emission restriction (or cap) and trade in electrical power production. The model accommodates multiple nodes, each with its own demand growth, existing capacity, transmission lines connecting the nodes, and sequestration sites. Technologies for CO<sub>2</sub> capture are assumed available to all nodes at the same price tag. Mixed integer programming (MIP) is used: binary variables are used for new construction of either power plants, or transmission, or CO<sub>2</sub> pipelines, while continuous variables are used for representing others such as power production, CO<sub>2</sub> generation, etc. The objective is to minimize regional cost of meeting nodal demands under assumed CO<sub>2</sub> cap &amp; trade regulation and other practical constraints.

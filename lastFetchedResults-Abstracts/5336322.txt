The objective of this research was to characterize the dielectric and induced piezoelectric properties of Ba<sup>2+</sup>-doped, 0.87Pb(Mg <sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-0.13PbTiO<sub>3</sub> relaxor ferroelectrics. The induced k<sub>t</sub>Â´s measured at 25&#176;C depended strongly on the Ba<sup>2+</sup> amount and electric field, maximizing at a value of 0.59 for an applied field of 5 kV/cm and a 2% doping level. The corresponding k<sub>p</sub> was 0.38. These results correlate well with the dielectric properties; the 2% composition exhibits the highest permittivity, with the macro-microdomain transition near 25&#176;C

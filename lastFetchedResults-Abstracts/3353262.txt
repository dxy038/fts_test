In this paper we discuss the paradigm shift that has to be understood by the decision makers as well as societies in the field of transportation. It is not sufficient to focus only on mobility as the current strategies do, but we need to look at citizens quality of life as whole. It is affected through different aspects, and only one of them is transportation. We need to provide a better way to participate in activities - increase accessibility of goods and services. This cannot be done with look at transportation only. We need to understand the entire organism of a city. This has been recently understood by the Smart cities initiative. A smart city is defined within this paper as an alliance system, i.e. a system where particular subsystems use the common resources in a synergic way. In order to make this concept work, an objective function following the above mentioned principles must be provided. In this paper, we offer entropy of a city as a promising candidate for such objective function.

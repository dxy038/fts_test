The main objective of this work was to increase the solubility of sulfadiazine by formation of inclusion complexes with β-cyclodextrin, and methyl-β-cyclodextrin. The apparent stability constants have been determined by phase solubility studies in water and buffer solutions of pH values of 2 and 8. The stoichiometry of all complexes was found to be 1:1 but different relative affinities were found for each cyclodextrin. It was possible to obtain a greater overall solubility by using a combined approach of pH adjustment and complexation with cyclodextrins. Guest–host interactions have been investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance. Complexes were prepared in solid state by different methods and were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy. The dissolution rate of the drug from the inclusion complex made by freeze-dried was much faster than this of the pure drug.

The objective of this work is to embed watermark information into digital audio data as the deterioration of sound quality is not perceivable to human ears. Hence, we consider that watermark information is embedded in the consonance to melody line or bass line. Generally, unison, octave, perfect fifth and perfect fourth are called consonance and human ears can hardly feel annoyed for consonance. Hence, we focus on perfect fifth and perfect fourth in the consonance. For decision of embedding positions, we need to estimate tone pitches, and we use spectrogram analysis as a technique of automatic music transcription. We embed watermark information with perfect fifth or perfect fourth of consonance from the pitch which is estimated by spectrogram analysis, and we aim at good sound quality of watermarked audio signal without sense of discomfort. Therefore, we propose an audio watermarking method by using automatic music transcription information.

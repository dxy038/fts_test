This paper introduces an original technique of neural network optimization of substantially less computational cost and suitable for viable CAD of complex microwave systems. A number of necessary full-wave simulations are dramatically reduced due to a special objective function and CORS sampling in the dynamic training of the decomposed RBF network. Performance of the algorithm is illustrated by its application to a waveguide band-pass filter and a dielectric resonator antenna; their optimal designs are found from 5-parameter optimizations requiring as little as 167 and 99 analyses, respectively.

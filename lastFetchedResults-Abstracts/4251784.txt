It has been proposed that a matrix is a good method to express and arrange the traffic demand in a WDM ring, and problems in ring design can be converted into matrix construction and operation. We propose a novel circle matrix construction algorithm for optimal wavelength assignment under all-to-all uniform traffic circumstance. This construction algorithm is designed for bidirectional SONET/WDM rings.

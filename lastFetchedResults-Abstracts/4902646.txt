Unbalance radial active distribution network (URADN) is the combination of unbalance radial distribution network and distributed energy resources (DERs) such as micro sources, wind turbines, fuel cell, photovoltaic system, etc. Regarding to unbalance structure, different kinds of DERs models and bidirectional power flow, some network parameters such as amplitude voltage, percent unbalance voltage, and power losses of network will alter accordingly. The complexity of URADN will be more when different kinds of DERs are allocated. So investigating the behavior of DER models in URADN is necessary. A suitable power flow analysis will provide a platform to analyze these behaviors in steady state condition. This paper offers suitable models for URADN components such as loads, lines, DERs and so on according to their structure and operation. Moreover appropriate method for handling DERs such as PV and PQ nodes will be proposed in a Power flow program which is developed using MATLAB<sup>&#174;</sup> for two practical case studies. The results are shown and compared in an abbreviated manner.

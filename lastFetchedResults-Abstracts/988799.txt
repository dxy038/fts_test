The objective of this work is to study the heat and mass transfer between air and soybean seeds in a countercurrent moving bed dryer, based on the application of a two-phase model to the drying process. The numerical solution of the model is obtained by using a computational code based on BDF methods (Backwards Differentials Formulas). The experimental data of air humidity and temperature and of seed moisture content and temperature at the dryer outlet are compared to the simulated values, showing a good agreement.

The objective of this paper is to discuss a new space control system utilizing ??SUBORDINATE OR?? logic blocks. This technique retains the highly efficient stabilization characteristics of the ??TRIGGER LOGIC?? system and adds the capability of optimum response to maneuver commands. Modification and incorporation of the command signal into the control logic is shown so that optimum response results. Optimum herein means getting into the new commanded limit cycle box in minimum time with the least fuel possible expended. The use of elementary digital logic blocks is emphasized for designing a simple nonlinear control system. Such usage precludes the problem of summing small and large analog signals, and also provides more flexibility in control logic design.

The paper presents a generative development methodology and component models of COMDES-II, a component-based software framework for distributed embedded control systems with real-time constraints. The adopted methodology allows for rapid modeling and validation of control software at a higher level of abstraction, from which a system implementation in C can be automatically synthesized. To achieve this objective, COMDES-II defines formally various kinds of components to address the critical requirements of the targeted domain, taking into consideration both the architectural and behavioral aspects of the system. Accordingly, a system can be hierarchically composed from reusable components with heterogeneous models of computation, whereas behavioral aspects of interest are specified independently, following the principle of separation-of concerns. The paper introduces the established generative methodology for COMDES-II from a general perspective, describes the component models in details and demonstrates their application through a DC-Motor control system case study.

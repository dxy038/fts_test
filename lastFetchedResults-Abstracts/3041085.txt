A method for equalizer design based on symmetry of system´s response to a band-limited signal is presented. The equalizer minimizes time-domain distortion, assuming that significant signal components are contained within the specified low-pass band only. Design is based on nonlinear optimization. The objective function is given and the appropriate choice of the optimization starting point is discussed. Practical aspects of implementation are considered. Method´s features are illustrated by example.

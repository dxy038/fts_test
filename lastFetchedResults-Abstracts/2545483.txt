Background: Domestic violence is the most popular form of
violence against women. Phenomenon of In the Declaration on the
Elimination of Violence against Women-1993 (DEVAW), was
introduced as a barrier for reaching equality, development and
peace. The objective of this research was to study individuals’ lived
experiences, especially the experiences of women exposed to
violence in Iran.
Methods: This research is a descriptive research which employs a
systemic review. The statistical population consists of all the
qualitative studies conducted in Iran to consider the physical
violence against women. To collect the data, Persian keywords for
violence against women, domestic violence, wife abuse, violence
against spouse and spouses who were beaten were searched in the
Iranian online databases including SID, Irandocs, Iranmedex,
Iranpsych, and Magiran. As the result of this search, 27 qualitative
studies were selected which were exactly dedicated to the domestic
violence from the viewpoints of men, women and experts. Then, the
repetitions and the studies which were conducted before 2001 were
excluded. After close reading of all the researches 10 of them were
eventually selected.
Results: The most reported items after studying the individuals’
lived experiences of physical violence against women in Iran
included patriarchy, drug abuse, inappropriate sociability, lack of
men’s mental stability, deficiency in communicative skills between
the couples and ignorance of each other’s mental and sexual needs.
The most reported strategies also encompass inactive and inefficient
approaches such as keeping quiet but preoccupied with the problem,
filing complaints, not being on speaking terms for a long while,
revenge and deprivation of intercourse.
Conclusion: This social issue should be also studied like all other
social issues as a multi-dimensional phenomenon in the social
context.

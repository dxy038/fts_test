In this paper, we analyse two well-known objective image quality metrics, the peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as well as the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and we derive a simple mathematical relationship between them which works for various kinds of image degradations such as Gaussian blur, additive Gaussian white noise, jpeg and jpeg2000 compression. A series of tests realized on images extracted from the Kodak database gives a better understanding of the similarity and difference between the SSIM and the PSNR.

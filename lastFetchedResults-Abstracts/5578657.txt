A high-efficiency power amplifier (PA) is important in a Megahertz wireless power transfer (WPT) system. It is attractive to apply the Class-E PA for its simple structure and high efficiency. However, the conventional design for Class-E PA can only ensure a high efficiency for a fixed load. It is necessary to develop a high-efficiency Class-E PA for a wide-range load in WPT systems. A novel design method for Class-E PA is proposed to achieve this objective in this paper. The PA achieves high efficiency, above 80%, for a load ranging from 10 to 100 &#937; at 6.78 MHz in the experiment.

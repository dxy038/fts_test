Performance management as a new and important subject is studied in strategic human resource management. Personnel performance appraisal is also one of the serious subjects in human resource management.
In this article, designing a personnel evaluation system is considered. Phases of this design are as follow: Steps taken for designing such system are: 
1-	Reviewing the literature
2-	Determining basic variables in personnel evaluation.
3-	Designing check list and collecting experts' Opinions. 
4-	Designing AHP questionnaire for criteria weighting. 
5-	Analyzing AHP algorithm and determining weight. The research brought about the following results:
1.	An evaluation system is designed for line and staff managers separately.
2.	Personnel evaluation is performed taking 360 degree approach.
3.	Total weight of 100 assigned to 14 to 15 basic factors defined for the evaluation system.
In this research, taking the 360? approach of evaluation through colleagues, (2 colleagues, the manager, the personnel, and the personnel evaluation committee were considered. Different criteria that their weights are determined through AHP algorithm are considered. Results showed that in this algorithm supervisor judgment turns pale and the evaluation turns out to be more objective.

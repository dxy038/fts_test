The development of intelligent hand-held devices provides a new resolution for remote robot control. Using the intelligent hand-held devices, user could perform the control robot from anywhere at anytime. In this paper, the characteristics and classification of intelligent hand-held devices are analyzed and a universal architecture mode for remote robot control using intelligent hand-held devices is proposed. And then, the technical solutions and implementation mechanisms are discussed according to current technologies. Finally, taking the PT500 industry robot as the control objective, this paper adopts multiple solutions to construct and implement its remote control system based on intelligent hand-held devices. The experiment shows that the intelligent hand-held devices extremely extend the controllable scope of robot in time and location, which provides much convenience for remote users.

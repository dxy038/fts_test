Objective: The objective of this study was to find readily ascertainable intraoperative pathologic indicators that would discriminate a subgroup of early corpus cancers that would not require lymphadenectomy or adjuvant radiotherapy. Study Design: Between 1984 and 1993, a total of 328 patients with endometrioid corpus cancer, grade 1 or 2 tumor, myometrial invasion ≤50%, and no intraoperative evidence of macroscopic extrauterine spread were treated surgically. Pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 187 cases (57%), and nodes were positive in nine cases (5%). Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to 65 patients (20%). Median follow-up was 88 months. Results: The 5-year overall cancer-related and recurrence-free survivals were 97% and 96%, respectively. Primary tumor diameter and lymphatic or vascular invasion significantly affected longevity. No patient with tumor diameter ≤2 cm had positive lymph nodes or died of disease. Conclusion: Patients who have International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade 1 or 2 endometrioid corpus cancer with greatest surface dimension ≤2 cm, myometrial invasion ≤50%, and no intraoperative evidence of macroscopic disease can be treated optimally with hysterectomy only.

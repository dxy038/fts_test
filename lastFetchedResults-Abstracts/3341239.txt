This paper develops an image processing based approach for classification of vehicles with the objective of their parking. In the paper, the heights and lengths of the vehicles are first measured on applying image processing and feature extraction techniques. Then, based on the information of the heights and lengths of the vehicles, the vehiclesÂ´ eligibility to park in a specific parking lot is determined under condition of certain constraints. The determination of the heights and lengths are carried out by comparing the maximum height for a set of vehicles. The system was implemented using MATLAB and the developed technique was tested for accuracy considering various classes of vehicles. For ease of implementation, the system incorporates a camera mounted on a flat surface with fixed pixel setting.

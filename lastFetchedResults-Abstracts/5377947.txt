Through the analysis of all optimized objectives in coking process, blending ratio is extracted as a key variable, and a model for coking optimization control is presented. Adopting evolutionary algorithm in each layer of multiple multi-objective optimization, hierarchical multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is put forward. Based on this hierarchical structure, four optimization objectives in coking optimization model are grouped into two layers. Detailed evolutionary strategy in each layer is discussed. Simulation results indicate blending ratio computed by the model can increase production efficiency, decrease cost and energy wastage greatly. Comparison of blending ratio computed under different objective weights proves this model can satisfy the requirement of different production objectives. All these show that the model plays an important directive role in coking production structure optimization

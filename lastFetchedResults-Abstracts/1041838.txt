The main objective of this analytical study is to investigate heat transfer from tube banks in crossflow under isothermal boundary condition. For this purpose, a control volume is selected from the fourth row of a tube as a typical cell to study the heat transfer from an in-line or staggered arrangement. An integral method of boundary layer analysis is employed to derive closed form expressions for the calculation of average heat transfer from the tubes of a bank, that can be used for a wide range of parameters including longitudinal pitch, transverse pitch, Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. The models for in-line and staggered arrangements are applicable for use over a wide range of parameters when determining heat transfer from tube banks.

The authors discuss an automated, objective video quality measurement system being developed for use in measuring end-to-end user performance. The method is based on extraction and classification of features from sampled input and output video. The extracted features quantify many of the distortions present in modern digital compression and transmission systems. These distortions include video compression artifacts resulting from spatial compression (blocking, edge blurring/smearing, etc.) and temporal compression (image persistence, jerky motion, etc.). Since the quality of the motion and still portions of a video scene can differ dramatically, an algorithm that segments each video frame into motion and still parts has been developed

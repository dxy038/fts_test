In practice section, they have breast self examination (33%), clinical breast examination (11.3%) and mammography (5%) in their past history.  Four- point -seven percent have high level of susceptibility and 46.7% high level of severity. Higher susceptibility was significantly associated with mammography (p=0.042) performance and not associated with breast self examination and clinical breast examination.

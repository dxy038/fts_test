ABSTRACT: Knowledge of interrelationships between grain yield and its contributing components will improve the efficiency of breeding programs through the use of appropriate selection indices. The objective of this study was to evaluate of interrelationships among grain yield and related characters in eleven corn hybrids. The hybrids were evaluated in randomized complete block design with four replications. Plant height, ear length, days to physiological maturity, kernel length, number of kernels per ear, cob percentage of ear, total number of kernels per ear and 100-grain weight correlated positively with grain yield. The highest correlation was shown by plant height and ear length (r= 0.65) and followed by 100-grain weight and number of kernels per row (r= 0.61). Path analysis was used to partition the genetic correlations between grain yield and related characters. Ear length, kernel length, 100-grain weight, total number of kernels per ear and cob percentage of ear showed positive direct effect on grain yield. The highest direct effect belonged to number of total kernels per ear the highest direct effect (0.59), followed by 100-grain weight (0.25). On the other hand, the highest indirect effect belonged to 100-grain weight and ear length via number of kernels per ear. The relatively high positive direct effect of 100-grain weight on grain yield was partially counterbalanced by its negative indirect effects via number of rows per ear and number of kernels per row.

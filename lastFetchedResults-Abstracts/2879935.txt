In this paper we present an antenna array model based on serial feeding to the antenna array such as that used in a leaky waveguide antenna. Further we introduce a dual feeding configuration so that the leaky waveguide can be fed from either end of waveguide and produce similar antenna beam pattern in broadside irrespective of the direction of feeding. This dual feed configuration places constraints on the allowed power coupling coefficient distribution of the waveguide array. We carry out multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithm to find an optimum power coupling coefficient distribution of the waveguide array elements. The two objectives optimized are the gain and sidelobe level.

In this paper, we utilize an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm for the design of static output feedback controllers for linear time-invariant systems. The particular multi-objective design we propose considers the tradeoff between the closed-loop system H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-performance bound and the spectral abscissa bound. We apply the resulting-method to an example related to flight control, where three different formulations of the robust control problem are being considered. The results indicate the benefit of the use of evolutionary strategies for the problems at hand as well as the potential of this approach for further related problems.

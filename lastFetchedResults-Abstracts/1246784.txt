Spatial variation in soil properties is attributable in part to redistribution of moisture and topsoil and to soil compaction associated with water-logging. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) can define topography at a fine scale where these processes may occur as related to field landscape positions such as footslope, depression, crest, and plateau. Our objective was to relate micro-relief (slope, elevation) to soil physical properties and to maize (Zea mays L.) yield under wet spring conditions and delineate soil management units in the field. The experimental 9-ha field was located in the St-Lawrence Lowlands, Quebec, Canada. A topographical survey was conducted using an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) equipped with high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers sampling 3-D coordinates to generate a grid as fine as 3 m. The GPS sampling method was compared to a total station (TS) for land survey on a 20-m grid. Soil samples and grain yield were collected and geo-referenced on a 30-m grid. Kriging, mapping, and correlation analyses were conducted. Topographic data sampled using a GPS receiver embedded on an ATV were accurate (<10 cm) compared to TS. Soil compaction indexes (bulk density, clay and clay/OM ratio) were the most closely related to yield (r2=−0.57 to −0.60). An independent dataset across the St-Lawrence Lowlands indicated that maize yield exceeding 10 t ha−1 in 1999 and 2000 was obtained with clay/OM ratios less than 12. The DEM and clay/OM ratio distribution maps were useful to locate five landscape positions of clay accumulation, water-logging, and soil compaction, forming two soil management units. In the footslope and depression management units, specific allocation of organic amendments may increase maize yield.

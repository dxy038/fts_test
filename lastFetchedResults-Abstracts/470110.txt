Objective
This study was undertaken to quantify the frequency, clinical course, charges, and outcomes of hyperemesis gravidarum.
Study design
California birth certificate data linked with maternal and neonatal hospital discharge data in 1999 were used (N = 520,739). Hyperemesis was defined by ICD-9 codes. The frequency, estimated charges, and demographic characteristics associated with hyperemesis patients were assessed. Maternal and neonatal perinatal outcomes were compared by maternal hyperemesis status.
Results
Hyperemesis complicated 2,466 of 520,739 births. The average length of stay was 2.6 days and the average charge was $5,932. Singleton hyperemesis infants were smaller (3,255 vs 3,380 g; P< .0001 and more likely to be small for gestational age (29.21% vs 20.8%; P< .0001).
Conclusion
Hyperemesis occurs in 473 of 100,000 live births and is associated with significant charges. Infants of mothers with hyperemesis have lower birth weights and the mothers are more likely to have infants that are small for gestational age.

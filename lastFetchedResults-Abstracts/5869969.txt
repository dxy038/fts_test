Image segmentation is an important technique in the area of image processing with wide applications in medicine, remote sensing to mention a few. A lot of research work is in progress in various areas resulting in many computationally efficient algorithms. There are conventional as well as improvised segmentation algorithms depending on the application. The choice of the technique in most cases depends on the application and image in question rather than a generalised method. In this paper we used histogram for segmentation. The conventional histogram method is modified to adopt for automatically determining the threshold for different regions in the image. The objective of this paper is to realise the segmentation algorithm on a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). The segmentation processor also has the capabilities to perform other tasks so that it could mimic an image processor. FPGA implementation renders it more useful for real time applications.

Hybrid Model Predictive Control (HMPC) framework is used to design a vehicular Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system. Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm, combining standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with multi-objective optimization method, is used in the process of the receding horizon optimization of the HMPC. Firstly, we design a hybrid model for the ACC system, and make use of Hybrid Systems Description Language (HYSDEL) to transform the hybrid model into a problem of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Then, we apply MPSO algorithm to solve the MILP problem online, and the results are used to change the velocity of the cruising vehicle. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can make the cruising vehicle follow the leading vehicle very well. Moreover, the MPSO algorithm efficiently accelerates the process of HMPC.

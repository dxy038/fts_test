Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is characterized by adrenergic induced bidirectional or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias. Some of CPVT families were reported to be associated with cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RyR2) mutations. However, association between RyR2 and other arrhythmogenic disorders is not clarified. In this study, we analyzed 83 Japanese patients including patients with long-QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, arrhythmogenic right ventricular caridiomyopathy and CPVT. Genetic screening of RyR2  revealed 3 distinct mutations among 4 families with CPVT (75% of incidence). However, no mutation was found in other groups. This is the first report to demonstrate prevalence of RyR2 mutations in various arrhythmogenic disorders in Japan. RyR2 mutations were detected frequently in CPVT but not in other diseases.

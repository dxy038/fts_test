This paper deals with the problem of robust control for Uncertain Nonlinear System via fuzzy control approach. First, a fuzzy controller with robust control capability is proposed. For avoiding complex controller parameters adjustment, Multi-objective particle swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted during the controller design. Secondly, the multi-model is employed to represent the nonlinear system with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. Finally, a simulation example illustrates the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed approach.

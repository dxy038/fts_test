The objective of this paper is to propose an innovative visual servoing method in order to improve the 3D reconstruction of objects for quantitative measurements. The method uses a Stereovision system that allows us to obtain several shots of an object, at regular intervals according to a predefined trajectory. In our case, the stereo rig is equipped with two different cameras, consequently the intrinsic parameters are not the same. The first one is fixed while the other one is mounted on a pan and tilt. Simulation and preliminary experiments in laboratory conditions shows the validity of our approach

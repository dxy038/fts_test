Long term sugarcane cultivation can alter soil physical properties. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of 38 years of sugarcane (Sacchrum officinarum L.) cultivation on the physical properties of fine textured soils (Haplustepts and Calciustepts) in southwestern Iran. Six paired soil profiles (three pairs in each soil type) were dug along parallel transects (100 m apart) in a side-by-side comparison of areas cultivated and uncultivated with sugarcane. Composite and undisturbed soil samples from 0-30, 30-60 and 60-90 cm layers were taken for physical and chemical analysis. The results of this study revealed that long term sugarcane cultivation resulted in a higher bulk density, lower structural stability, and an increased proportion of fine pores. The decreased number of macropores together with decreased structural stability indicated the formation of a dense compacted layer at 30-60 cm in sugarcane cultivated soils

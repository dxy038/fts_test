An updated Lagrangian implicit FEM model for the analysis of large thermo-mechanically coupled hyperelastic-
viscoplastic deformations of isotropic porous materials is considered. An appropriate framework for consti-
tutive modelling is introduced that includes a stress-free thermally expanded con guration and a plastically
deformed unstressed damaged con guration. A two-level iterative scheme is employed at each time increment
to solve the  eld equations governing the conservation of momentum (mechanical step) and the conservation
of energy (thermal step) for the coupled thermo-mechanical problem. Exact linearizations for the calculation
of the tangent sti ness are performed in each of these solution steps. A fully implicit, thermo-mechanically
coupled and incrementally objective Euler-backward radial return based map is developed for the time inte-
gration of the constitutive equations. The present model is used to analyse a number of benchmark examples
including metal forming processes wherein temperature and the accumulated damage play an important role
in in
uencing the deformation mechanism and the nature of the deformed workpiece. Copyright

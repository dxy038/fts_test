This paper presents an analytical model based on mean value analysis (MVA) technique for a
probabilistic re-entrant line. The objective is to develop a solution method to determine the total
cycle time of a Reflow Screening (RS) operation in a semiconductor assembly plant. The
uniqueness of this operation is that it has to be borrowed from another department in order to
perform the production screening task. Since the operation is being shared, there is a time limit
to utilize it in a day. Screening of lots that cannot be completed within the given time has to be
continued in the following days. The contributions of this paper is the development of a lot
clustering method and factoring the limited time sharing condition and thus develop an
analytical model. Comparison results were made using available real historical data. The
proposed model provided operation managers with the total cycle time computation method and
determining the appropriate cluster size to be loaded into the operation.

The utilization of renewable energies like wind energy and solar energy, have been grown in the last decades. In the solar energy, photovoltaic modules are connected with a power stage for electric energy production. Normally, when the converter works for some time, yours inductive and capacitive components suffer heating, causing an increase on the converter´s output resistance. This problem changes the system´s operating point, contributing directly in output power loss. The main objective of this work is synthetize a robust control that minimizes the effects of the converter inductor parasite resistance and possible modifications of solar radiation. The main objective of the controller is maintaining a constant voltage in the output load considering uncertainty at the duty cycle in the operating point. The results showed that the robust control techniques H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>&#8734;</sub> minimized the effects of the uncertainties and the disturbances approximating the system output response to its operating point.

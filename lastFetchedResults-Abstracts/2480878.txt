In this study, honeycomb energy absorber is optimized using genetic algorithm. The design goal is to absorb whole impact energy within a limited shock load level. First the crashworthiness and parameter sensitivity of honeycomb structure are extracted as explicit functions that are utilized to find optimized shock absorber configuration. Energy absorber must depreciate the impact kinetic energy and mitigate its defects on the structure and aboard. So the energy absorption capacity while the shock load is kept limited is the main design objective. The volume and mass restrictions are also important objectives from an application point of view. Based on the simulation results available in the article Part I, the honeycomb response surfaces of crashworthiness parameters including the mean and peak crushing stresses are extracted. Utilizing the genetic algorithm based on response functions, the multi-objective optimized energy absorber is investigated. The main objective of the optimization problem is set to minimization of mass or volume while the maximum allowable shock and minimum energy absorption capacity are included as the problem constraints. The geometric specifications of honeycomb structure including cell-size, foil thickness, height and absorber face area are among the design variables with optimization outputs of energy absorption capacity, volume, mass, and shock level. Some optimization results are compared with those available in the literature and a typical problem is handled. Results show that mass and volume optimized geometries are almost similar and reduction of acceptable shock level causes the optimized geometry height to rise.

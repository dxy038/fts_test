The ultimate objective of e-governance is to establish good governance. The elements of good governance can be identified as follows: a. Efficiency b. Reliability c. Accountability d. Accessibility and Transparency e. Visionary in decision making. All of these elements can be achieved through proper implementation of e-governance. Already Government of Bangladesh (GOB) takes several projects to implement it. Here we discuss about a GOB office named Bureau of Manpower Employment &amp; Training (BEMT) who uses ICT very efficiently. Since 1976 BMET has been processing ldquolabour migrationrdquo manually. Measures to develop a congenial atmosphere in migration process and to develop institutional framework a computer database network has been established in 2004. Prospective job-seekers register their name and other particulars at DEMO. Selection of candidates for the overseas market is done from this database. Emigration clearance is also being provided from this database by BMET through computer network. Its capacity and activities are continued mainly to issuing emigration clearance for those who have been offered an overseas employment by either private companies or authorized agents. This system is running nonstop since 2004 without a single day interrupt or crash which is a remarkable achievement in context of a developing country like Bangladesh. Moreover, 4000/5000 job seeker registration done in every working day in 21 District Offices and around 3000-4000 clearance done in BMET head Office with departure checking in airports.

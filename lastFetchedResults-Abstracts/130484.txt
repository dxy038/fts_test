Objective(s): To investigate about seroma formation in breast cancer patients after definitive surgery. Material & Methods: A convenience sample of breast cancer patients was entered into the study. Eligible patients were those who underwent surgical therapy (modified radical mastectomy or breast preservation and axillary lymph node dissection). The demographic data and clinical information were extracted from case records. Seroma formation was studied in relation to age, type of surgery, tumor size, nodal involvement, pathological type, preoperative chemotherapy, surgical instrument (electrocautery or scalpel), use of pressure garment, duration of drainage and arm activity. In all, 135 breast cancer patients were studied. The mean age of the patients was 46.2 (SD = 11.8) year and mostly presented with the stage II disease (59%). Seventy-two percent underwent modified radical mastectomy and the remaining 28% received breast preservation surgery.
Results: Seroma occurred in 39% of patients. In logistic regression analysis an association of postoperative seroma with pathological type was noted (ductal versus non-ductal, odds ratio = 17,7, P = 0.01). The seroma formation did not show any significant results by any other variables studied. Conclusion: The findings suggest that breast cancer patients' pathological characteristics are an independent predicting factor for seroma formation.

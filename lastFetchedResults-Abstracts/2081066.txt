Objective
rpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the association between loss of attachment (LA) which is clinical index of periodontitis and bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar vertebrae and femur measured with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in Japanese community-dwelling postmenopausal women.
ts and methods
ts were 347 women aged 55–74. The oral cavity was divided into 6 areas according to the WHO's method for the determination of the clinical attachment level score (CALscore); the LA was measured at 6 sites using a WHO probe in 17, 16, 11, 26, 27, 37, 36, 31, 46, and 47, and the values were recorded in mm. Then, we assessed BMD of the lumbar vertebrae (L2–L4) and femur (femoral neck, proximal part) by DXA. Based on these data, analysis of covariance was used to estimate relation between periodontitis and systemic BMD status excluding effect of age. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to estimate relation between periodontitis and BMD adjusted for 17 variables.
s
icant differences were observed in the mean value between the mean CALscore = 0 and CALscore ≥ 1 groups in the Z value in lumbar vertebrate (106.9 ± 18.7 vs. 102.3 ± 1.0, p &lt; 0.05, t-test). Multiple regression analysis was conducted using the mean LA as dependent variable. Lumbar vertebral BMD (regression coefficient: B = −1.039 ± 0.379, p = 0.007), femoral neck BMD (B = −1.332 ± 0.627, p = 0.034), and proximal femoral BMD (B = −1.329 ± 0.536, p = 0.014) all exhibited a significant negative correlation with the mean LA.
sion
ificant negative correlation was observed between periodontal disease and truncal bone BMD in this study.

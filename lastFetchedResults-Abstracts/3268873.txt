Developing a low-carbon power system is critical and fundamental to cope with the challenges of global warming, in which transmission network will play a key role. Conventional models for transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) are mainly concerned with the economic and security costs. In this paper, with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions cost arising from transmission loss and wind/water spillage incorporated into the objective function, an optimization model for TNEP under low-carbon economy is proposed. An illustrative example based on the modified New England (NE) 39-bus system is analyzed to show that the model proposed is effective and practical.

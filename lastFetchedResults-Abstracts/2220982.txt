The objective of this study was detection of polymorphism in B-Lctoglobulin gene and its association with milk production traits in Mahabadi goats using PCR-SSCP method. For this purpose, blood samples were taken from 89 Mahabadi goat that reared in the farm of animal science department at Tehran university (Karaj). DNA was extracted from whole blood using optimized salting out method. Specific primers used for amplification of 177 bp fragment from then 7 B-Lactoglobulin gene. For identifying the polymorphism, PCR products were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gel (SSCP method) and stained with silver nitrate method. Results indicated the different patterns, may be due to polymorphism in this fragment. The frequency of the six pattern were 7.14%, 10.71%, 13.09%, 33.33%, 9.52% and 26.19% respectively. The statistical analysis indicated that the effect of different patterns were significant on milk production and somatic cell count (p < 0.01), but on fat and protein percentage had no significant effect.

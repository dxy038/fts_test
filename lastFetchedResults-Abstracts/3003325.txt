The study has been conducted with the objective of a real time control analysis with tactile sensors. This has led to the design and fabrication of a cost-effective artificial tactile sensor. The wafer technology is based on potentiometric principles. In the process, an in-depth study has been made keeping in view the reliability, accuracy, data processing, and flexibility. Very large scale integration (VLSI) computing array techniques have been incorporated to develop an independent logic control for real time analysis.

A novel method of optimization by coupling the genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial neural network (ANN) is presented in this paper. A trained artificial neural network is taken as objective function in GA for optimization. By utilizing this technique the optimized dimensions of patch antenna on thick substrate has been calculated. It is seen that the results obtained by this method are closer to experimental value compared to earlier results obtained by curve fitting method. To validate this, the results are compared with experimental values for five fabricated antenna. The results are in very good agreement with experimental findings.

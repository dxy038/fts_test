Microstrip CPW-fed patch antennas on alumina substrates using a Photonic Band Gap (PBG) with a 2D metallic matrix, were designed and fabricated. The objective of these devices is to test the behavior of the antennas with a 2D PBG matrix in the range from 30 GHz to 40 GHz. The obtained results show the band gaps introduced by the PBG matrix and the formation of new propagation modes. The millimeter wave or near millimeter wave band are expected to be a frequency resource for wireless terrestrial and satellite, 3G/4G mobile communication system and PC-card-radio terminal. These bands accommodate multimedia wide band operation.

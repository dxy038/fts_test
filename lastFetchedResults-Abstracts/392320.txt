Objective: The purpose of this present study was to investigate pollinosis in the spring and oral allergy syndrome (OAS) in Sapporo to utilize it for future treatment. Materials and methods: Of the patients referred to our out-patient clinic during April and May in 1999, all those that were suspected to have pollinosis were asked to fill in a questionnaire. A 101 patients (30 males and 71 females) with a mean age of 33 years (range 7â€“74 years) answered the questionnaire. In all, the patients specific IgE tests were performed. Results: The most common allergen was birch, affecting 54 of 87 patients (62%). In 61% of patients with birch allergy, we observed fruit and vegetable allergy. Among them, apple was the most prevalent allergen (97%), followed by peach (67%), cherry (58%), pear (40%), plum (40%) and melon (33%). The sensitivity of skin prick test with commercial extract to apple was low (11%). Conclusion: Patients with birch pollen allergy had OAS much more frequently than ever reported in Japan, although OAS has not widely been known in Japan. Patients with birch pollen allergy should be informed about the possibility of hypersensitivity to certain fruits.

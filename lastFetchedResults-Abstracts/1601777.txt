T -independence of fuzzy variables is a more general concept than the classical independence. The objective of this study is to deal with some new properties of T -independent fuzzy variables. First of all, for any general t -norm, some criteria of T -independence are discussed for fuzzy variables under possibility, necessity and credibility measures. Subsequently, on the basis of left continuous t -norms, some formulas are derived on the “max” and “min” operations of the T -independent fuzzy variables in possibility distribution and in expectation. Finally, making use of continuous Archimedean t -norms, several convergence properties are discussed for T -independent fuzzy variables in credibility and in expectation, respectively, and some laws of large numbers are proved as well.

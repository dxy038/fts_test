Hsp70 potentiates specific immune responses to some antigenic peptides fused to it. A recombinant hsp70 protein expression vector in methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, was developed that fused the major antigenic segment of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) E protein to the amino terminus of Mycobacterium tuberculosis hsp70. The C-terminal peptide binding domain of hsp70 stimulated Th1-polarizing cytokines, CC chemokines and an adjuvant effect. However, the N-terminal ATPase domain (hsp70 1–358) failed to stimulate any of these cytokines or chemokines. Based on these data, a vector was constructed that permits the fusion of major antigenic segment of E protein to the amino terminus of peptide binding domain of hsp70. Antibody titers, lymphocytes proliferation, the level of mIL-2 or mIFN-γ and neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice showed that antigenicity of E-binding domain fusion protein was almost as effective as E-hsp70 fusion protein and more effective than carrier protein hsp70 alone. In eliciting a humoral and cellular immune response, both fusion proteins were more powerful than the major antigenic segment of E protein alone, but less effective than the segment administered with Freund's adjuvant.

This paper describes two- and multiset canonical
correlations analysis (CCA) for data fusion, multisource, multiset,
or multitemporal exploratory data analysis. These techniques
transform multivariate multiset data into new orthogonal variables
called canonical variates (CVs) which, when applied in
remote sensing, exhibit ever-decreasing similarity (as expressed by
correlation measures) over sets consisting of 1) spectral variables
at fixed points in time (R-mode analysis), or 2) temporal variables
with fixed wavelengths (T-mode analysis). The CVs are invariant
to linear and affine transformations of the original variables
within sets which means, for example, that the R-mode CVs are
insensitive to changes over time in offset and gain in a measuring
device. In a case study, CVs are calculated from Landsat TM
data with six spectral bands over six consecutive years. Both Rand
T-mode CVs clearly exhibit the desired characteristic: they
show maximum similarity for the low-order canonical variates
and minimum similarity for the high-order canonical variates.
These characteristics are seen both visually and in objective
measures. The results from the multiset CCA R- and T-mode
analyses are very different. This difference is ascribed to the noise
structure in the data. The CCA methods are related to partial
least squares (PLS) methods. This paper very briefly describes
multiset CCA-based multiset PLS. Also, the CCA methods can
be applied as multivariate extensions to empirical orthogonal
functions (EOF) techniques. (Multiset) CCA is well-suited for
inclusion in geographical information systems (GIS).

The current densities of the integration on chip allow the implantation on a same circuit of the applications dedicated for multimedia services, according to three possible approaches: a software approach which consists of programming cores of microprocessors or DSPs, an approach dedicated that leads to realize a specific core to the application and an approach using a dynamic reconfiguration of the components offered by "design reuse". This paper presents a study of the dynamic reconfiguration and/or static in the systems on chip aiming at the integration of the accelerators into the multimedia applications in order to exploit the contribution offered by the dynamic reconfiguration and to orientate toward the concept of the SoC programmable (SoPC). On the other hand, the time allowed for the choice of the virtual components constitutes a challenging conception imposed by the increase of IPs providers. Indeed, our objective consists of developing a tool permitting the automation of the selection and the reuse of the VCs (virtual component) and to optimize the choice of the adequate solution based on criteria linked to the restraints of the environment (area availability, time of execution and power).

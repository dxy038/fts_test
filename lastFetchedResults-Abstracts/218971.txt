In this research the application of Nanosil containing hydrogen peroxide and silver was studied in
disinfecting swimming pool water and itâ€™s Environment. The effect of the disinfectant on Candida
albicans (ATCC No. 10231), Aspergillus niger (ATCC No. 16404), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC
No. 9027), Serratia marcescens (PTCC No. 1111), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC No. 10031) and
Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC No. 29737) ) was evaluated. The main objective of this experiment was to
determine the effective dose of Nanosil which could be used for disinfecting the environment of
swimming pools and other surface area. Then, the effectiveness of Nanosil was studied in two private and
one public swimming pools. Heterotrophic plate count, thermotolerant coliforms, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were monitored as the target microorganisms in disinfection
practice According to the result of this study, it is recommended to apply the Nanosil with the
concentration of >3% (30000 mg/L) for contact time of 30 min or more for practical disinfection in
swimming pools environment. The application of Nanosil in real conditions of two private and one public
swimming pools indicated that the acceptable microbial quality is also achievable if the disinfectant
residual concentration would be as high as 20 mg/L in swimming pool water.

Background and Objective: Attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is accompanied with different complications such as decreased occupational and educational performance. At present, stimulant drugs are used as the first line treatment in this disorder. However, possible development of side effects and dependence on these drugs are of concern. Therefore, it was decided to evaluate the efficacy of reboxetine in the treatment of adults with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder.

Subjects and Methods: Forty adult diagnosed with ADHD without any significant psychiatric disorder were participated in a 6-weeks a double blind clinical trial with reboxetine (8 mg/d) in two divided doses. The principle measured outcome was the Conner's ADHD Rating Scale (adult version).

Results: Rate of response (decrease of Conner's rating scale scores) in reboxetine group were significantly greater than control group (p<0/001).

Conclusion: Reboxetine may be an effective treatment for the adult with attention-deficit/

hyperactivity disorder.

Designers each have their own design objective cooperating in complex design circumstance that a variety of software tools run on different hardware platforms. Different CAD systems are used by different design stages and departments, and the design result is usually delivered per paper drawings. The proliferation of data and the rising number of disparate data systems do not communicate with each other and certainly do not collaborate. Advanced 3D modelling tools are exploited for the advantage to improve the productivities. However these 3D models are repetitiously constructed as per the specified design objectives of disparate software tools in various design stages. This paper describes the development of intelligent modelling framework to make a Web-based data-sharing collaborative environment potentially allowing facilitating some applications

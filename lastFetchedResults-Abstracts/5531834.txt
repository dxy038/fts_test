In this paper, performances of three topologies of bidirectional ports applicable to phase shift converters are compared. The proposed topologies include full bridge, half bridge and boost-half bridge that are commonly used as bi-directional port in various topologies of DC converters. The proposed analyses based on several indicators and characteristics of the topologies including reliability factor, switching loss, current ripple, cost, size, efficiency, range of power flow versus phase shift angle and control complexity. A phase shift converter based on proposed topologies was simulated using P-SIM. The analysis shows that considering all effective factors, full bridge topology provides better characteristics compared with others and can be selected for a phase shift converter. Also in some applications other topologies still remain a favorite choice.

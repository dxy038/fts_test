The main objective of this paper is to design a viable GFRP (glass fiber reinforced plastics) deck profile for highway girder bridges. E-glass fibers with vinylester resin were selected for the material design. Five GFRP stacking patterns having different material compositions were designed. A total of 100 coupon specimens were tested to verify the material properties of the proposed GFRP patterns. A multi-cellular cross-sectional shape was proposed for the deck profile. The proposed profile was optimized to obtain a viable cross-sectional shape that is especially suitable for the pultrusion process. This paper also presents design of a GFRP deck for prototype of a steel I-girder bridge using the proposed deck profile.

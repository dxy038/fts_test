Call Admission Control (CAC) is one of the most important parts in radio resource management of the wireless networks and it has a huge impact on the quality of service (QoS).Traditional CAC strategies focus on increasing the radio resource utility by decreasing the service blocking probabilities. In this paper, a new CAC scheme based on game theory is introduced to analyze the conflicts and rewards for different network operators. The game theoretic based CAC scheme contains two parts, utility function computation and a non-cooperative game between two networks to maximize their rewards. The proposed framework is preliminary and its objective is investigate the possibility that networks should be able to autonomously define policies for different parts of a coverage area depending on the priority of users and their requirements. In this approach, the two simulated WiMAX networks compete with each other for traffic units in overlapping coverage area and maximize their rewards. The proposed scheme is illustrated with the help of an example in which most of the traffic units lie close to one network as compared to the other network. Future work will present results of simulation studies for more detailed experiments.

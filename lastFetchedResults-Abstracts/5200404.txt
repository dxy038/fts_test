A need exists for a mock ventricle and vasculature that behaves in a physiological manner for testing cardiac devices in normal pathologic states. To this end, an integrated mock cardiovascular system consisting of a mock atrium, mock ventricle, and mock systemic and coronary vasculature was developed specifically for testing ventricular assist devices. This surgically-equivalent test configuration enables atrial or ventricular apex inflow and aortic outflow cannulation connections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mock ventricle for its pressure-volume (PV) relationships under normal, heart failure, and partial recovery test conditions. The PV relationships were investigated by varying ventricular volume over a wide range via atrial (preload) and aortic (afterload) occlusions. The mock circulation was set-up to mimic physiologically-equivalent normal, heart failure, and partial recovery test conditions. Results showed that the mock PV loops and the end-systolic PV relationships were representative of the physiological behavior characteristics of the natural heart for these test conditions. Although mock circulations cannot replace in vivo models, this configuration should be well suited for developing experimental protocols, testing device feedback control algorithms, investigating velocity profiles, and training surgical staff with operational procedures of assist devices.

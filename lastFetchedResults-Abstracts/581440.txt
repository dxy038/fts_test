Abstract
Classical inventory models are not able to encode precision and certainty of classical mathematical logic. Actually, a realistic situation is no longer realistic when the imprecise and uncertain information are neglected for the sake of mathematical model building. In this paper we developed inventory control model (r,Q) in multi-items environment with two objectives as minimizing costs (holding & shortage) and risk level under constraints including available budgetary, the least service level, storage spaces & allowable quantities of shortage. Demand distribution functions are assumed to be exponential and extra demands are supposed as lost sales. At first we develop crisp model then fuzzy stochastic model with fuzzy budgetary, allowable quantities of shortage and shortage spaces (i. e. stochastic with normal distribution function) parameter. All of fuzzy numbers are triangular type. In methodology of solution we change model to a crisp multi-objective by using difuzzification of fuzzy constraints and fuzzy chance-constrained programming methods, and then solve it by fuzzy logic method. Finally an illustrated example is taken and solved using LINGO package

Scalable coding is the most suitable way of coding for video transmission over heterogeneous networks. Different characteristics of video displaying devices as well as variable transmission conditions make usage of the scalable coding increasingly significant for mobile networks. Depending on userÂ´s device capabilities, in many occasions there is a need for the upscaling of the video coded on a lower spatial, temporal and/or quality scale. This paper deals with different spatial video upscaling methods. A comparison of four upscaling methods is done by using two objective video quality evaluation metrics: PSNR and MS-SSIM. Also, a comparison of subjective quality evaluation results of videos presented on mobile devices and on PCs is presented.

Today the problem of a traveller is to obtain the right information at the right time. To do that, many solutions have been proposed, the main one being the personalization of Traveler Information. But, they are often limited to specific types of applications and/or deal with only a part of the theoretical potential offered by personalization. In addition, tools and methods that have been proposed often focus only on the technical aspects of personalization, making it difficult to integrate them into a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach that would allow personalized interactive applications to be modeled. To remedy these deficiencies, we have developed the PERCOMOM method, whose objective is to allow business experts to autonomously create personalized interactive applications by assembling pre-existing models. The case study concerns traveler information in ITS.

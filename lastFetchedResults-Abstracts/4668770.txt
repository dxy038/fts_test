This paper proposes a novel structure of an 8 &#215; 8 bidirectional optical cross connect (BOXC) which is designed using fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and optical circulators (OCs) for bidirectional wavelength-division-multiplexing (BWDM) network. The impact of coherent and incoherent crosstalk in a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) network has been taken into account and Bit Error Rate (BER) is calculated. The BER is then compared to that of 2 &#215; 2 and 4 &#215; 4 BOXCs.

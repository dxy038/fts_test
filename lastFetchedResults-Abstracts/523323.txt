The objective of the present paper is to comparatively study the existence philosophers’
ideas about the nature of ethics and man’s ethical life as well as to infer
ethical fundamentals and related principles of teacher-student relationships. The
research methodology applied in the present paper is comparative analysis (a qualitative
research approach) and practical syllogism (a philosophical research method).
According to the findings of this research, the existence thinkers lay emphasis on
common points with regard to man’s existence and his ethical life. On this basis,
three fundamentals and six principles are proposed for ethical relationships between
teacher and student: the fundamental of validity of individuality and unique characteristics
of human being and the principles of respect to individuality and choosing
student-teacher relations instead of teacher-student relations; the fundamental of
validity of originality and the principles of choosing me-you relations instead of
me-that relations with student by the teacher, establishment of existence relations
with student by the teacher and preparing the grounds by the teacher for experiencing
border situations by the students; and finally, the fundamental of validity of
emotional and exiting aspects of life on the side of rational aspect and the principle
of providing information about humane being and preparing the grounds for all-out
participation of student in the real life. Lastly, referring the shortcomings of the
ideas of these philosophers, it is concluded that on the side of following ethical fundamentals and principles in relations between teacher and student in the higher
education system of our country, due attention should be paid to the shortcomings
as well.

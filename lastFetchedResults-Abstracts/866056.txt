The objective of project scheduling is to determine start dates and the labor resources assigned to each activity in order to complete a project on time. By moving start dates within available slack times and altering labor levels, the daily labor-demand profile can be changed. The objective of personnel scheduling is to determine how many of each feasible workday tour are required to satisfy a given labor-demand profile while minimizing the cost of labor plus overhead. Integrating these two problems permits the simultaneous determination of start dates, labor levels and tours for a minimum-cost and on-time schedule. In this paper, single and multiple resource optimization models and heuristic solution procedures to solve the integrated problem are presented. The heuristic procedure outperformed the non-integrated two-step scheduling procedure by reducing the cost of labor and overhead and performed nearly as well as the optimization procedure.

With the objective of arriving at a better agreement, heretofore unattainable, between the power factor of a blended electrical insulating oil measured directly and that calculated from those of its components, the concept of "ion content," as initiated by Whitehead, was brought into play. As the term implies, "ion content," signifies a real and numerically addible quantity rather than an abstract one, no matter how this quantity is derived. Keeping this fact in mind, the computation of the power factor of a blended electrical insulating oil may be made easier, more rational, and more reliable. In this phase of the present series of studies, the agreements arrived at through the use of this method of approach have demonstrated vividly the reality and usefulness of this concept.

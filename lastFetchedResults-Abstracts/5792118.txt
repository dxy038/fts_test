Owing to the weakness of the existing method of the regional technological innovative capacity, this paper adopts the method of time multi-dimension dynamic comprehensive evaluation. In view of the characteristics of the evaluation index system of the regional technological innovative capacity, the traditional method of time multi-dimension dynamic comprehensive evaluation has been improved with the help of the factor analysis method and the ideal point method. This paper uses the improved method of time multi-dimension dynamic comprehensive evaluation, that the factor analysis method and the ideal point method are comprehensively applied in the technological innovative capacity evaluation of 31 regions in China from 2005 to 2008, making the evaluation results more scientific and objective in order to provide the effective support for the formulation and adjustment of decisions of different regions.

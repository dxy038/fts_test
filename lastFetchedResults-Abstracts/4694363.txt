The SFD-268 is a high duty, low noise, low jitter version of the CFA used in the AN/SPY-1 radar. It has been developed in a cooperative effort with NSWC Crane. The objective of this program was to increase CFA performance while maintaining the same form, fit, function, and life as the previous version of this CFA, known as the SFD-262. This paper describes the design improvements and development process of the SFD-268 CFA. Opportunities for future design enhancements are also discussed.

The meaning of sound quality assessment is summarized. Based on the analysis of some characteristics of human auditory system and the model of loudness perception, an efficient loudness estimation approximate algorithm is proposed using the regression analysis method. Experimental results show that the approximate algorithm has fine performance for speech signal. Additionally, different peopleÂ´s speech signal loudness is also distinct. Based on this, other psychoacoustical parameters for objective speech quality assessment may be obtained.

This paper presents our study on the effects of cell loss on QoS for the MPEG video transmission in ATM networks. A new evaluation method for the cell loss behavior of ATM networks due to congestion is proposed. The method uses a real MPEG video sequence as the input source and the MPEG video data is packetized into ATM cells. A cell discard process model called the Gilbert model is used to generate a cell discard pattern. The pattern represents the occurrences of ATM lost cells due to buffer overflow in multiplexers, Finally, the effects of cell loss on QoS is evaluated by de-packetizing (assembling) the resultant ATM cells back into MPEG video data, The QoS evaluations presented in this paper include subjective and objective evaluations of video quality under different network conditions. The evaluation results show that the effects of cell loss on QoS for MPEG video transmission in ATM networks depend on factors such as the burst cell loss length and the MPEG coding modes used

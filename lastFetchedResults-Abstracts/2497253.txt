Objective: Sleep complaints ‎are common among Iranian ‎chemically-injured veterans. ‎The growing body of research ‎has investigated (in) equalities ‎between such subjective ‎complaints and objective sleep ‎records. Moreover, sleep ‎complaints are associated with ‎depressive symptoms. ‎Depressive symptoms, also, ‎have been frequently reported ‎in chemically-injured veterans. ‎Therefore, the purpose of this ‎pilot study was to investigate ‎the relationship between ‎perceived sleep quality, ‎polysomnographic measures ‎and depressive symptoms in ‎Iranian veterans with chemical ‎injuries‏.‏
Methods: In this pilot study, 35 ‎Iranian veterans with chemical ‎injuries complaining of a sleep ‎problem were selected. Initially, ‎participants were evaluated via ‎all-night polysomnography, ‎then, they completed the ‎research questionnaires. ‎Collected data were analyzed ‎using Pearson correlation ‎coefficients‏.‏
Results: Data analyses ‎showed that there was no ‎significant correlation between ‎many of self-reposted variables ‎and polysomnogaphic ‎recordings, however, ‎remarkable relationships were ‎found between the Pittsburgh ‎Sleep Quality Index and the ‎Beck Depression Inventory ‎scores‏.‏
Conclusion: The findings ‎indicated that sleep complaints ‎of chemically-injured veterans ‎are not equivalent to objective ‎sleep disturbances, however, ‎these complaints are largely ‎associated with level of ‎depression. This study ‎emphasizes the important role ‎of mood in sleep evaluation. ‎Further, the findings suggest ‎using a combination of both ‎subjective and objective ‎measures for accurate ‎assessment of sleep quality in ‎Iranian veterans with chemical ‎injuries (i.e., multimethod ‎approach).‎

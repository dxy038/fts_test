Objective: Research related to induce pluripotent stem (iPS) cell generation has increased
rapidly in recent years. Six transcription factors, namely OCT4, SOX2, C-MYC,

KLF4,
NANOG, and LIN28 have been widely used for iPS cell generation. As
there is a

lack
of data on intra- and inter-networking among these six different
transcription factors,

the
objective of this study is to analyze the intra- and inter-networks between them using

bioinformatics.
  
Materials and Methods:In this computational biology study, we used AminoNet, MATLAB
to
examine
networking
between the six
different
transcription
factors. The
directed

network
was constructed using MATLAB
programming and
the distance between nodes
was
estimated using a phylogram.
The
protein-protein interactions
between the nuclear
reprogramming
factors was performed using the software STRING.  
Results: The relationship between C-MYC and NANOG was depicted using a phylogenetic
tree and the sequence analysis
showed
OCT4,
C-MYC, NANOG, and SOX2 together
share a common evolutionary origin. 
Conclusion: This study has shown an innovative rapid method for the analysis of intra
and inter-networking among nuclear reprogramming factors. Data presented may aid researchers
to understand the complex regulatory networks involving iPS cell generation.

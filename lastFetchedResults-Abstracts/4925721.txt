In present work, positional accuracy of robotic arm has been discussed. The factors considered in the experiment were the length of links, the mass of both links, the velocity of end point and torque on both links. A considerable reduction in performance variation can be obtained by Taguchi technique. Through simple multifactorial experiments on manipulator, controlled factors can be isolated to provide centering and variance control for a process variable. The primary objective in present work is to investigate the effect of process parameter on performance variation to improve positional accuracy. An attempt has been made to introduce a small variation to current approaches broadly called Taguchi parametric design method. In these methods, there are two broad categories of problems associated with simultaneously minimizing performance variations and bringing the mean on target, viz. Type 1- minimizing variations in performance caused by variations in noise factors (uncontrolled parameters); Type 2-minimizing variations in performance caused by variations in control factors (design variables).

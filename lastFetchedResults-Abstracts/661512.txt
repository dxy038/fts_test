The objective of this study was to compare the effects of CO/CO2 reducing conditions with those of air oxidizing conditions on the pouring temperature of the sludge melting process and the heavy metal leachability of the resultant sludge slag. Synthetic sludge ash composed of SiO2, CaO and Al2O3, as well as sewage sludge ash generated from a laboratory incinerator was employed. The experimental results indicated that the pouring temperatures are significantly reduced under the reducing conditions of CO/CO2, or 24 and 77 Â°C lower than under air conditions for synthetic and sludge ash, respectively. The heavy metal leaching tests further indicate lower heavy metal concentrations present in the leachate under the reducing conditions, notably an order of magnitude lower in Zn. However, X-ray diffractogram indicates similar peaks for these two slags produced under different conditions.

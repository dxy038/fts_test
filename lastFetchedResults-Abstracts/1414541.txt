Background & Objective: Increased rate of mortality and morbidity due to coronary artery disease (CAD) could result into defining the involved factors, since different parts of artery are involved in CAD so the aim of this study was to determining the role of cardiovascular risk factors in involvement of coronary arteries, as a predictive model.
Materials & Methods: This study was case series and performed on all patients in angiography center of Imam Ali hospital in Bojnurd. Variables of study included age, sex, history of diabetes, hypertension, smoking, level of cholesterol, level of fasting blood sugar, level of triglyceride, the location and number of vessels involved on angiography and angina’s grade. Data were evaluated by SPSS 16 and presented with t test, ANOVA and  post hoc tests.
Results: The results of this study showed that there was significant relationship between age, sex, history of diabetes, smoking, angina grade and number of vessels involved. It was also showed that there was significant relationship between history of diabetes, smoking, triglyceride and systolic blood pressure. Another significant relationship existed between age, history of blood pressure, systolic blood pressure and angina grade.
Conclusion:Despite significant relationship between the type and location of coronary artery disease with several risk factors, we can’t able to predict the location of the involved artery angiography before starting the process, Because of the overlap between multiple cardiovascular risk factors vary with the type of vessel involved.

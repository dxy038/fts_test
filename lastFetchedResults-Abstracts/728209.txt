Thiocarlide (THC; N,N′-bis[p-(isoamyloxy)phenyl]-thiourea; also known as isoxyl) has been used in the past as anti-tuberculosis agent. In an effort to improve the therapeutic value of THC several N-pentofuranosyl-N′-[p-(isoamyloxy)phenyl]-thiourea derivatives were synthesized by coupling of an aniline derivative and pentofuranosyl isothiocyanates. The MIC values of the new products against M.tb indicate that this new approach to the synthesis of potential anti-TB therapeutic agents was successful.

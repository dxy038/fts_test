Control system design for the Active Control Technique Evaluation for Spacecraft (ACES) structure at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center is discussed. The primary objective of this experiment is to design controllers that provide substantial reduction of the line-of-sight pointing errors. Satisfaction of this objective requires the controllers to attenuate beam vibration significantly. The primary method chosen for control design is the optimal projection approach for uncertain systems (OPUS). The OPUS design process allows the simultaneous tradeoff of five fundamental issues in control design: actuator sizing, sensor accuracy, controller order, robustness and system performance. A brief description of the basic ACES configuration is given. The development of the models used for control design and control design for eight system loops that were selected by analysis of test data collected from the structure are discussed. Experimental results showing that very significant performance improvement is achieved when all eight feedback loops are closed are presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

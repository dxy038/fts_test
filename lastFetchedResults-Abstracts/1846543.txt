The objective of this study to examine the clinical impact of magnetic resonance imaging in long-term follow-up of patients (pts) with chronic disease of the thoracic aorta such as coarctation of the aorta, chronic aortic dissection and true aortic aneurysm. A total of 322 magnetic resonance examinations obtained in 82 pts with chronic disease of the thoracic aorta (31 pts with coarctation of the aorta (CoA), 29 pts with chronic aortic dissection and 22 pts with true aneurysm) over a period of 0.25 to 13.5 (mean ± SD: 6.5 ± 3.4) years were retrospectively reviewed. Diameters of the thoracic aorta were measured at predefined levels and morphological and functional parameters of special interest were analysed in each patient group. Pts were classified as having constant or progressive disease and clinical end-points were defined as (re-)operation or death. 43 pts (52%) (CoA 15 pts, chronic dissection 16 pts, true aneurysm 12 pts) had constant findings. None of them underwent (re-)operation and seven patients (16%) died, three of them from their aortic disease more than five years later after their last magnetic resonance examination, one from an arrhythmogenic event, and in the remaining 3 pts the cause of death could not be definitely established. 39 pts (48%) (CoA 16 pts, chronic dissection 13 pts, true aneurysm 10 pts) had progressive disease as demonstrated by repetitive magnetic resonance imaging. Of these 39 pts 24 pts underwent (re-)operation, in 15 pts operation was postponed. Four pts died from their aortic disease. Repetitive magnetic resonance imaging is a clinically feasible technique for long-term follow-up of pts with chronic disease of the thoracic aorta because it can detect progressive disease in a large subset of pts requiring elective surgery. The results of magnetic resonance imaging provided the rationale for either (re-)operation or conservative management, thus guiding patient management.

The objective of the present study was to develop floating microspheres of cefpodoxime proxetil in order to achieve an extended retention in the upper GIT, which may result in enhanced absorption and thereby improved bioavailability. The microspheres were prepared by non-aqueous solvent evaporation method using polymers such as hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC K 15 M), ethyl cellulose in different ratios and cefpodoxime proxetil in each formulation. In vitro drug release were performed by USP apparatus type I and the microspheres were characterized by polymer compatibility by using FT-IR. The yield, particle size, Buoyancy percentage, drug entrapment efficiency, and in vitro drug release were studied. The result showed that microspheres yielded 50.5-72.2%. The particle size was distributed between75-600 Î¼m, drug entrapment efficiency was 14.1- 28.2%, and Buoyancy percentage was 70.1-88.3%. The best drug release profiles were seen with formulation 2 at the ratio of drug to polymer of 1:2.

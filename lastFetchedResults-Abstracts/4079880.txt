THE PROPOSED AIEE SYMBOLS and definitions for feedback control systems are employed. The term &#8220;signal component control&#8221; (scc), is used to designate the control method, and the term &#8220;scc device&#8221; to specify the particular associated equipment. The primary objective of the method is to shape the reference input so either the indirectly or the directly controlled variable, as may be elected, will be nearly identical at all times to the command signal. It is intended to achieve this objective so that: 1. The controlled variable will contain, at all times, a component which is identical to the command signal. 2. In a very short time (usually this will be made less than one-half the longest natural period of oscillation of the control system), all aperiodic deviations of the controlled variable from the command signal will be reduced to zero. 3. In the same short time each natural mode of the control system will be reduced to zero.

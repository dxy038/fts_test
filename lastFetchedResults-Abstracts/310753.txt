Objective. To evaluate intrasubject repeatability of data obtained from computer-aided motion analysis in normal and spastic children.

Design. Prospective controlled study.

Background. Information from gait analysis is used in selecting therapeutic interventions for gait improvement in cerebral palsy. While there are several studies regarding repeatability of normal gait, there are no studies evaluating the repeatability of spastic gait.

Methods. Forty children (20 normal, 20 with diplegic type of cerebral palsy) were subjected to gait analysis. Kinematic, kinetic and time distance parameters obtained from gait analysis were studied for intrasubject variability within-day and between-day using statistical measures.

Results. Normal children had lower variability in time distance parameters than spastic children both within and between days. The repeatability of kinetics was better than those of kinematics, and values for normal children were better than those for spastic children. Within-day repeatability of kinematics and kinetics was better in normal children. Between-day repeatability of kinematics was better in normal children, while spastic children showed better repeatability for kinetics.

Conclusions. We found lower repeatability of gait analysis data in spastic children compared to normal children. Restricted joint range of motion due to spasticity in the group of cerebral palsy patients may be responsible for the lower repeatability of data. Some errors due to marker placement are inadvertent and contribute to the lower between-day repeatability.

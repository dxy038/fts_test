This paper proposes a single-phase bidirectional dc-dc converter feasible to dc distributed power systems and electrical vehicles. The topology provides high frequency galvanic isolation and is able to protect the system during eventual short-circuit in the output side. The current control in the primary side is performed by the duty cycle variation of the primary bridge. It is possible to regulate the dc bus voltage even during voltage dips and short-circuits. The secondary side bridge is driven with constant duty cycle and the power flow is controlled by the variation of the phase shift angle between the two bridges. The basic equations are shown and experimental results are presented and discussed.

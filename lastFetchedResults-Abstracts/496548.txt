In mice, the myostatin (Mstn) null mutation and treatment with clenbuterol both increase muscle growth and decrease fat
mass. Our objective was to determine whether mechanistic overlap exists by administering clenbuterol to Mstn null mice. Male
Mstn null and wild-type mice of similar genetic backgrounds received either 0 (control) or 20 p.p.m. clenbuterol in tap water
free choice for 14 days. Several traits were measured to estimate muscle and fat growth. The Mstn null mutation resulted in
increased body and empty carcass weight, increased muscle weights and decreased fat pad weights. Fat content was reduced
and protein content was increased in the empty carcasses of Mstn null mice. Similarly, treatment with clenbuterol resulted
in increased body and empty carcass weight, increased muscle weights and reduced fat pad weights. Fat content of empty
carcasses and viscera was reduced and protein content of empty carcasses was increased with clenbuterol treatment.
A significant interaction of genotype and clenbuterol treatment would indicate an altered responsiveness of Mstn null mice
to clenbuterol. However, only the weight of gastrocnemius muscles exhibited a significant (P50.01) interaction of genotype
and clenbuterol treatment, indicating that Mstn null mice were less responsive to clenbuterol compared with wild-type mice.
Thus, for all other traits, the impact of Mstn null mutation and clenbuterol treatment was completely additive. These data
suggest that disruption of Mstn function does not alter the response of mice to b-adrenergic agonists.

Objective: To offer reference data for standardized study the clinical syndrome differentiation for the senile patients of post lumbar surgery, we study on the feature of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) syndrome differentiation for the senile patients of post lumbar surgery. Methods: Adopting clinical epidemiological method, clinical investigation on 359 senile patients of post lumbar surgery was carried out. We designed the clinical syndrome questionnaire and filled in, acquired the data, then analyzed the data with descriptive statistics. Results: On the first day of post lumbar surgery, according to constituent ratio, the syndromes were mainly: syndrome of spleen deficiency and blood stasis(20.7%), syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis(19.8%), syndrome of qi deficiency with blood stasis, syndrome of spleen-stomach weakness, syndrome of damp abundance due to spleen asthenia, syndrome of dual deficiency of qi and blood. On the third day of post lumbar surgery, according to constituent ratio, the syndromes were mainly: syndrome of qi deficiency with blood stasis(35.6%), syndrome of spleen deficiency and blood stasis(21.9%), syndrome of damp abundance due to spleen asthenia, syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis, syndrome of spleenstomach weakness, syndrome of kidney deficiency and blood stasis. On the seventh day of post lumbar surgery, according to constituent ratio, the syndromes were mainly: syndrome of qi deficiency with blood stasis(36.6%), syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis(18.8%), syndrome of damp abundance due to spleen asthenia, syndrome of blood deficiency, syndrome of kidney deficiency and blood stasis, syndrome of spleen deficiency and blood stasis. On the fourteen day of post lumbar surgery, according to constituent ratio, the syndromes were mainly: syndrome of qi stagnation and blood stasis(29.2%), syndrome of dual deficiency of qi and blood(28.2%), syndrome of qi deficiency with blood stasis, syndrome of kidney deficiency and bloo- stasis, syndrome of spleen deficiency and blood stasis, syndrome of liver-kidney yin deficiency. Conclusions: The dynamic change law of early syndrome for the senile patients of post lumbar surgery was from deficiency syndrome to deficiency with excess complication syndrome, then to the excess syndrome.

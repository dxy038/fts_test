In this paper, a new target detection and location approach which is performed in three stages is proposed, i.e. array manifold calibration, clutter rejection and target radial velocity estimation. Once the array manifold has been calibrated based on clutter echoes in range-Doppler domain, the objective of clutter cancellation can be achieved by the linear combination of the joint pixels data with the corresponding adaptive weighting vector. This step does not require target steering vector searching. The last stage is carried out at determinate cell under test (CUT) to locate moving target by velocity searching for that one fitting best to the moving target signal, thus the location performance would not be sacrificed in order to suppress clutter and/or interference and the high resolution radial velocity estimation can be achieved. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

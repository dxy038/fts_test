Introduction: Home care should intervene in the nutritional status of the elderly. Objective: To analyze
the nutritional status of the elderly assisted by a Home Care Program (PAD) and associate it with income and
education level of the caregiver. Casuistic and Method: Thirty-four individuals of both genders who received
home care from PAD. The MNA (Mini Nutritional Assessment) was used along with arm circumference. Dietary
intake assessment was done with three 24-hour recalls in non-consecutive days. We collected data on income,
education level of the caregiver and user in years of formal education and autonomy of user. The differences
between the proportions of the nominal variables were tested by the chi-square test. The continuous variables
were tested for normality and if normal, the Studentâ€™s t-test or ANOVA was applied. The adopted significance
level was P < 0.05. Results: The studied sample represented individuals older than 65 years, assisted by PAD and
100% dependent on the caregiver. MNA revealed that 38.2% of the users were malnourished and 61.8% were at
risk for malnourishment. Energy, fiber, vitamin E, calcium and zinc intakes were inadequate. Education level of
the caregivers was a determining factor (P=0.01) for the nutritional status of the elderly while no association was
found with respect to income. Conclusion: These findings allows us to conclude that the nutritional status of this
population is worrisome and that it may be associated with low quality of life influenced by the education level of
the caregiver, but also by age, economic conditions and limited autonomy of this population.

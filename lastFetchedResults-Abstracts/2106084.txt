Mycobacterium bovis infections in fallow deer have been reported in different countries and play an important role in the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), together with other deer species. There is little knowledge of the pathogenesis of bTB in fallow deer. The aim of this study was to perform a histopathological characterisation of the granulomas induced by M. bovis in this species and the immunohistochemical distribution of different cell subsets (CD3+, CD79+, macrophages) and chemical mediators (iNOS, TNF-α, IFN-γ) in the different developmental stages of granulomas. Stage I/II granulomas showed a marked presence of macrophages (MAC387+) expressing high iNOS levels while stage III/IV granulomas showed a decrease in the number of these cells forming a rim surrounding the necrotic foci. This was correlated with the presence of IFN-γ expressing cell counts, much higher in stage I/II than in stage III/IV. The number of B cells increased alongside the developmental stage of the granuloma, and interestingly the expression of TNF-α was very low in all the stages. This characterisation of the lesions and the local immune response may be helpful as basic knowledge in the attempts to increase the vaccine efficacy as well as for disease severity evaluation and for the development of improved diagnostic tools. Immunohistochemical methods using several commercial antibodies in fallow deer tissues are described.

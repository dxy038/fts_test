This article studies the control configuration of a microgrid-connected photovoltaic (MCPV) source. In the control of an MCPV, maximum power point (MPP) tracking, droop control, and dc bus voltage regulation are the main required functions. To increase their penetration in the microgrid, MCPV sources have to participate in the microgrid?s frequency regulation. Consequently, MCPVs may be forced to depart from MPP for short periods of time. In this article, a control method is proposed to operate the MCPV in the MPP at all times except when there is a need to stabilize the frequency. The method achieves this objective autonomously without the need to change the control configuration. This method is explained, and its superiority over other controllers to achieve the same objective is investigated. The suggested control configurations are validated through simulation studies and experiments.

The proposed fuzzy logic controlled (FLC) system can be considered as a soft switching technique that substantially reduces the switching loss and hence attains higher efficiency by the switching capacitor converter. The proposed frequency modulation FLC quasi-resonant zero-current switching switched-capacitor (SC) converter is a new type of bidirectional power flow control conversion scheme. This device provides voltage conversion ratios from double-mode against half-mode to <i>n</i>-mode against 1/<i>n</i>-mode by adding a different number of SCs and power semiconductor switches with a small series-connected resonant inductor for forward and reverse schemes. The state-space modelling and analysis for the designed FLC take advantage of cybernetics theory. The dynamic simulation and experiments for the proposed FLC for the studied converters are used to demonstrate the validity of the constructed model under different energy conversion topologies and load conditions.

At the global scale peatlands are an important soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. They sequester, store and emit carbon dioxide and methane and have a large carbon content per unit area. In Ireland, peatlands cover between 17% and 20% of the land area and contain a significant, but poorly quantified amount of SOC. Peatlands may function as a persistent sink for atmospheric CO2. In Ireland the detailed information that is required to calculate the peatland SOC pool, such as peat depth, area and carbon density, is inconsistent in quality and coverage. The objective of this research was to develop an improved method for estimating the depth of blanket peat from elevation, slope and disturbance data to allow more accurate estimations of the SOC pool for blanket peatlands. The model was formulated to predict peat depth at a resolution of 100 ha (1 km2). The model correctly captured the trend and accounted for 58 to 63% of the observed variation in peat depth in the Wicklow Mountains on the east coast of Ireland. Given that the surface of a blanket peatland masks unknown undulations at the mineral/peat interface this was a successful outcome. Using the peat depth model, it was estimated that blanket peatland in the Wicklow Mountains contained 2.30 Mt of carbon. This compares to the previously published values ranging from 0.45 Mt C to 2.18 Mt C.

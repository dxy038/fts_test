Study Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate physician manpower and mobilization in an urban emergency department receiving patients after a major earthquake. Methods: Patient charts were reviewed. The workload of physicians was assessed semiquantitatively before and after a major earthquake. The physicians' mobilization in the postearthquake emergency response was assessed by using a confidential questionnaire. Results: In the 3 days after the earthquake, 566 patients with earthquake-related illnesses or injuries were sent to the urban ED. Three hundred one (53.2%) patients arrived within the initial 10 hours. In the initial hours, there was no significant difference between the number of patients per physician per hour before and after the earthquake. Workloads of wound treatment and advanced life support procedures were significantly higher after the earthquake compared with before the earthquake, during the first to sixth hour and second to fifth hour, respectively. Sixty-five percent of the hospital's physicians did not assist in either the ED or in any other parts of the hospital in the initial 6 hours after the earthquake. Conclusion: The number of physicians in the ED was insufficient in the initial hours after the earthquake because of the sudden influx of a large number of patients. Future disaster planning must address the issue of physicians' behavior with regard to their priorities immediately after a major earthquake and include greater provision for efficient mobilization of physicians.

In this paper, computational intelligent methods are utilized in designing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for a five bar linkage manipulator, which is a nonlinear, unstable and non-minimum phase system. The controller gains should be specified in a way to confront these problems and make the manipulator track the desired trajectory. A cost function is introduced the minimization of which is the key objective. Different optimization methods are applied to minimize the cost function through which the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) obtains the best result. ICA has good characteristics in obtaining the global minimum of a cost function in comparison to other intelligent algorithms. Simulation results present the strength of ICA in minimizing step response features such as steady state error, overshoot, rise time, settling time and control signal.

Decision making problems in multi-objective systems is optimum selection among the alternatives. The "superiority" and "inferiority" of alternatives are fuzzy concepts, so the fuzzy set theory can be used in the process of decision-making. Based on this point, a fuzzy decision making methodology is presented and two kinds of models are developed. One is MFPRM (multi-pole fuzzy pattern recognition model), which deals with the criterion set is known to evaluate and select the satisfying alternative. The other is DFPRM (dual-pole fuzzy pattern recognition model), which is generated from MFPRM to deal with the criterion set is very hard to be found. Furthermore, a weight-assessing method and its conjunction with two models is introduced. Studies show that the model is a new development of engineering fuzzy set theory (EFST), it has distinct mathematical and physical meaning, and can be used in both the cases: the criterion set is known and unknown. Therefore, it may provide a new method in the decision making of a multi-objective system.

The objective of this study was to define in a quantitative manner the geometrical relationship between the human esophagus and the heart. This information is useful in the design of 3-D transesophageal ultrasound probes where the entire heart is to be imaged from within the esophagus. Serial coronal CT sections of ten live human subjects were studied For each section, the esophageal centroid and the border of the pericardium were digitized. The boundaries of the heart were defined in terms of a distance r, and two angles cP and 8. The maximum ranges of r, &#966;, &#952; were (0.4 cm-20 cm), (-7&#176;-279&#176;), and (1.5&#176;- 155&#176;), respectively

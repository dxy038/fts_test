The paper presents the method of large neighborhood templates realization (i.e. templates with r&gt;1) in a nearest-neighbor connected (i.e. r=1) discrete-time CNN Universal Machine. This is accomplished by decomposing an objective template into a sum of two-dimensional 3&#215;3 template correlations. An appropriate procedure which ensures a desired circuit operation is given in an algorithmic form

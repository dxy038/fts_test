Many studies have pointed out a possible role of gut peptides, including gastrin and ghrelin, in the pathogenesis and natural history of gastrointestinal malignancies, one of the most common death cause in the Western world. The objective of this work is to check gastrin and ghrelin serum levels in patients with colorectal cancer according to tumour's location, stage, Helicobacter pylori infection and BMI, in order to understand the two peptides' behaviour through the tumour's natural history and evaluate their assay's use in research and clinical practice.
Twenty-nine subjects affected by colorectal cancer and 50 healthy controls were studied. Circulating gastrin and ghrelin levels and H. pylori serum antibodies were assessed by radioimmunologic assay and ELISA method.
Gastrin and ghrelin serum levels were respectively slightly higher and significantly lower in colon cancer patients than in controls. Gastrin levels were higher in patients carrying left colon cancer and H. pylori infection while ghrelin levels were lower in both these groups. Both hormones' serum levels decreased from tumour earlier to later stages. Significant differences persisted in the correlation between BMI and ghrelin levels in controls but not in patients.
Additional studies are necessary to ascertain the significance of gastrin and ghrelin opposite behaviour in colon cancer probably linked with interferences in endocrine pathways involving other gut peptides in this compromised condition.

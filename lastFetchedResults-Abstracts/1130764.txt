Since hazardous material transportation has been dramatically increased in terms of quantity, their incident impacts are getting to be known as a serious concern. Therefore, transport risk is usually considered as a main factor in hazardous material transportation and management. In this paper, a bi-objective mathematical model is developed for solving the fuel distribution problem, in which routing and location problems are solved simultaneously. While the problem is formulated as a mix-integer programming (MIP) model, distribution centers are considered as candidates, in which its main aims are to select the best set of establishing centers and find the best routes for carrying fuels from selected distribution centers to gas stations. The proposed model is eventually validated using the experimental data. Finally, the associated results are analyzed and the conclusion is provided.

Background: Hirsutism can result in cosmetic and psychological problems in women. Because of diverse etiological factors, treatment with a single drug is not usually successful. On the other hand, treatment of hirsutism can be associated with adverse effects.
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a herbal ointment consisted of Leguminosea spp. and Zingiberaceae spp. extracts in reduction of hair density in hirsute women.
Patients and Methods: In an open clinical trial 10 hirsute women were treated with a herbal ointment 3 times a day for two weeks in three consecutive months. Pre- and post-treatment assessments of number, length, and diameter of hairs were done in individual patients. Paired t test was used for statistical analyses.
Results: After three treatment courses the mean number of the hairs showed significant reduction in comparison with pre-treatment values. Some patients mentioned that treatment resulted in softer, thinner, and lighter hairs.
Conclusions: The studied herbal ointment was effective in hair density reduction in hirsute patients. It was also a simple, inexpensive and safe treatment for hirsutism.

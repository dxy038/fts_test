A dynamic symbol mapping technique is proposed for downlink and point-to-point multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. The proposed mapping introduces a perturbation to the transmitted symbols by adaptively changing the order or the values of the symbols to be transmitted within a sub-frame of symbols with the objective to enhance the received symbols´ power. The symbol mapping aims at taking advantage of constructive instantaneous interference, considering the channel´s characteristics as well as the actual symbol values. In other words, rather than minimising interference between the symbols, the goal is to optimize the resulting interference so that it is more constructive. In this way the received symbol energy is enhanced and detection is made more reliable. It is shown by the presented results and analysis that it provides significant benefits to the corresponding conventional system´s error rate performance.

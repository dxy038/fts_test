Integration of PV system and EV charging station is a typical way of spot utilization of renewable resources. Research on multi-objective optimal scheduling of a DC micro-grid consisted of PV system and EV charging station is proposed in this paper. Based on the structure of the DC micro-grid and function of each component, mathematical model of the multi-objective optimization for scheduling, which takes the cost of electricity purchasing and energy circulation of storage batteries as objective functions, is built and then solved with NSGA-II. Constraints including EVs´ charging time, the range of the charging/discharging power and SOC (state of charge) of the storage batteries, power supply rate of the distribution network and system power balance are considered in this model. A certain case is studied and verifies the model´s rationality. Compared with an instant charging plan, the optimal scheme is superior in reducing cost and energy circulation.

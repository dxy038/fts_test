Background and Objective: Post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are unpleasant feelings which frequently occur after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of dexamethasone and propofol in prevention of PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Materials and Methods: 60 patients with ASA status 1-2, who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy with similar general anesthesia were selected and were randomly assigned to one of the three groups (20 patients in each group). Group I received 0.5 mg/kg propofol (i.v), group II received 8 mg dexamethasone (i.v) and group III received normal salin 9.0% (i.v) as placebo, following the completion of surgery, 1 and 24 hours after the surgery patients with 0-2 level of consciousness were questioned about the presence of nausea and vomiting. 
Results: Over 1 to 24 hours after the surgery, PONV in the dexamethasone group was significantly less than the other groups. Also the incidence of PONV in the Propofol group was lower compared to Placebo group. 
Conclusion: A single dose of dexamethasone after surgery is effective in prevention of PONV in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Also the incidence of PONV can be effectively reduced with Propofol.

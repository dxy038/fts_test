Problems of optimization in computational electromagnetics are discussed with particular reference to the determination of the global minimum of practical objective functions. An optimizing environment is described which uses integral methods for calculating user-defined objective functions. Results are presented which combine stochastic and direct search techniques to find a satisfactory design optimum of practical problems

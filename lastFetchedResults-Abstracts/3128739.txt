A multiobjective optimal service restoration methodology for shipboard power system (SPS) using a simulated annealing genetic algorithm is presented. All the multiple objective functions related to restoration problem for SPS are formulated as fuzzy sets. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is adopted to determine the weighted factors of each objective functions which is more convenient to be apprehended and operated by decision-maker, and a weighted product functional operator is used to form the integrated objective function. The multiobjective model is adopted by a simulated annealing genetic algorithm to solve the service restoration problem for SPS. The test results on a typical shipboard power system show effectiveness of the proposed restoration methodology.

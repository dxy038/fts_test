The research of designing floating-point digital infinite-impulse response (IIR) filter using multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is a newly emerged research field. However, none of previous work takes notice of the fixed-point representation in the MOEA based digital IIR filter design research. In this paper, we introduce fixed-point representation in a new local search operator enhanced multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (LS-MOEA), which is specifically proposed for multi-objective optimization digital IIR filter design problems, to form a new version LS-MOEA with floating-point representation (LS-MOEA-FR). The effectiveness and efficiency of LS-MOEA-FR is verified on four types of digital IIR filter design problems, including low pass (LP), high pass (HP), band pass (BP) and band stop (BS).

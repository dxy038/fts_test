Objective of this paper is to design a structure of a safety control system for electric vehiclesÂ´ circuits, drives and brakes. The authors review analysis methods used to detect electrical circuits, engines and brakes failures during its operation while outside the technical service environment. The authors examine the algorithms used in artificial immune systems to review possibility to apply them to the system.

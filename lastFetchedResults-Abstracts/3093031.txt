This work aims at the design of antennas for telecommunication networks base stations containing metallic electromagnetic band gap (EBG) materials. Our objective was to make and study new concepts of metallic EBG antennas able to work according to a wide (or broad) form pattern radiation presenting a 3 dB beamwidth at least 60deg. The emission and/or reception devices using these antennas have the advantage to ensure a wide angular cover with a high gain. Thus, by using the multisource technique in this type of structure, we carry out a network of interlaced radiant apertures which makes it possible to obtain a more important directivity by summation of the apertures contribution.

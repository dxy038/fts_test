Objective: Our purpose was to describe the surgical procedure, its results, and its complications and to determine whether patients are satisfied with surgical reduction of labia minora in cases of hypertrophy. Study Design: The records of 163 patients who underwent reduction of the labia minora during a 9-year period were reviewed. The ages of the patients ranged from 12 to 67 years (median, 26). Motives for requesting surgery were aesthetic concerns in 87% of the cases, discomfort in clothing in 64%, discomfort with exercise in 26%, and entry dyspareunia in 43%. Anatomic results were assessed 1 month postoperatively. Patient satisfaction was assessed by means of a mailed questionnaire. Results: No surgery-related significant complications were noticed. Anatomic results were satisfactory for 151 patients (93%). Ninety-eight completed questionnaires were returned. Eighty-one patients (83%) found that the results after surgery were satisfactory. Eighty-seven (89%) were satisfied with the aesthetic result, and 91 (93%) approved the functional outcome. Four patients (4%) would not undergo the same procedure again. Conclusion: Labia minora reduction is a simple surgical procedure associated with a high degree of patient satisfaction. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:35-40.)

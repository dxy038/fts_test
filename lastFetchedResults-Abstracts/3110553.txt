A design strategy which integrates model reduction by modal cost analysis and a multi-objective controller synthesis algorithm is applied to design controllers for NASA\Â´s Mini-Mast system. The necessary modeling and control algorithms are easily programmed in Matlab standard software. Hence, this method is very practical for controller design for large space structures. The design algorithm also presents a solution for the very important problem of "tuning" multiple loop controllers (MIMO).

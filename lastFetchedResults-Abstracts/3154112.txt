It argues that a cluster is a CAS with a multi-level, multi-subsystem structure. In agent-and-layer modeling (ALM) given by authors, the various agents are initiative to adapt complex environments inside and outside the cluster, which exchange materials, information, technologies and values via the core network, support networks and external networks as well, and acquire knowledge and accumulate experiences from technological learning to form a dynamic, self-adaptive system. The paper examines the motivation for independent and interacting firms in clusters to learn technologies comes from seeking to increase and maximize their own revenues from technological learning. Entrepreneurs in the cluster CAS are driving force of innovation and learning in the whole process.

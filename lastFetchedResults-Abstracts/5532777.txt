This work develops accepted layer-based analysis techniques to support the preliminary stages of electric machine design. The approach pairs a simplified geometric model with an analytical solution for magnetic diffusion to make computations for optimization tractable. The flexibility of the method supports exploration of unusual material parameter combinations, and is illustrated through a three-layer composite system. Design tradeoffs associated with rotor material parameters are studied, and subsequent reduced-order system optimization is shown to act as a preliminary objective within electric machine realization. Emphasis is placed on induction machines.

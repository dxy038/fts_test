The objective of this paper is to examine the IEEE 1451 standard family in order to add smart, plug-and-play and self-adaptation capabilities to systems based on different quasi-digital sensors. It was shown that due to the use of one universal component - the universal frequency-to-digital converter UFDC-1, UFDC-2 or Universal Sensors and Transducers Interface chip any quasi-digital sensor can be transformed into a smart transducer compatible to the IEEE 1451 standard. This gives strong benefits to both: customer and manufacturers, by increasing the level of adoption of the IEEE 1451 family of standards in industry and smart sensors market up to 15-20%.

Objective: The goal of this study was to describe the influence of physical health on social role perceptions, role performance, and role balance in women after heart surgery and coronary angioplasty. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was used. Setting: The study was undertaken at a Midwestern community hospital. Sample: The study considered 58 midlife and older women who had received heart surgery or coronary angioplasty. Outcome Measures: The following measures were used: Inventory of Adult Role Behavior, Role Discrepancy Measure, Role Balance Measure, and Salient Social Roles Measure. Results: Women in poorer health had lower role performance and more negative role perceptions. In general, the balance of rewards and concerns in roles rated most important were not affected by health status. Conclusion: Dimensions of women’s social roles are related to physical health after heart surgery and angioplasty. Knowledge about the effect of physical health on women’s social role experiences is important information for clinicians who care for women with heart disease. If a woman can be helped to achieve better functional health to perform role and daily living tasks, she may feel more positive about her current and future health states.

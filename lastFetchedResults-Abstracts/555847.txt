Abstract
Introduction: The liver played an important role in the metabolism of thyroid hormones and was involved in their conjugation, excretion and peripheral deiodination in synthesizing Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG). Thus liver dysfunction can be influenced thyroid function.
Objective: Determine the changes of thyroid functional tests in patients with liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis B and C and correlation of thyroid hormone levels with severity of liver dysfunction.
Materials and Methods: Sixty Four Cirrhotic patients due to hepatitis B and C referring to Razi hospital were studied during 2007-2009 years. Data were collected by prepared questionnaire. Thyroid hormone levels were measured in a unit laboratory. Liver dysfunction was scored by MELD and child pugh scoring systems. Mann-Whitney U, chi square and kruskal wallis test were used for measuring severity of liver dysfunction.
Results: Among 64 patients, (42 patients were male and 22 patients were female). Mean age of patients was 55.03Â±12.05. Level of TT3 TT4 and FT3 had decreased in the majority of patients, TT3, TT4 and FT3 levels. There was a correlation between level of TT3 and severity of liver dysfunction base on Child score (p=0.0001) and MELD (p=0.02).There was a reciprocal correlation between TT3 level and probability of the history of digestive systems bleedings, Ascites and encephalopathy (P=0.01, P=0.011, P=0.009) .It means that when TT3 level was low probability of this complication was high.
Conclusion: This study showed that liver disease is accompanied by changes in thyroid hormone levels specially decrease the level of TT3, TT4, FT3 and it is indicated that TT3 level can be used as liver function index in cirrhotic patients due to hepatitis B and C.

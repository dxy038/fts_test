In this paper, the dynamic thermal-wet comfort objective evaluation indexes such as K<sub>Ts</sub>, K<sub>Te</sub>, T<sub>equ</sub>, &#916;T and RH<sub>equ</sub> of 36 kinds of knitted fabrics were tested. And then the 36 kinds of knitted fabrics were made into clothes of same style. The thermal-wet comfort subjective evaluation indexes such as hot feeling, wet feeling, sticky feeling and cold feeling after exercise of these clothes were assessed by human body wearing tests. 28 kinds of the fabrics were selected to establish the prediction model between the objective and subjective evaluation indexes based on BP neural network. The other 8 kinds of fabrics were used to validate the accuracy of the model. The results showed that the model can effectively predict the subjective thermal-wet comfort properties of fabrics.

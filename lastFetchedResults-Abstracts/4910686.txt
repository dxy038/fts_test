The objective is to identify and discuss several potential application areas for intelligent agent technology that will enable the US Army to rapidly transform itself from its current military organization and operational capabilities to that of a future, more modern force structure. The thrust of the US Army´s transformation concept is to evolve to a lighter, leaner, faster, more highly mobile and agile, command-centric, combined arms force structure that lives in a network-centric world and leverages state of the art information technologies to interpret and understand the evolving battlefield situation and take decisive action before the adversary. We will discuss how the implementation of the military decision making process is changing under the Army´s transitioning to its future force structure and how and where the application of agent-based systems will be the essential enabler.

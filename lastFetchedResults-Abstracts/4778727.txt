As the most important objective parameter, reverberation time plays a significant role in acoustic field characteristics evaluation of the hall. We can get it by measuring an actual room. In this paper, a new method is proposed based on rough fuzzy neural network to reckon the reverberation time from a scene image, which is obviously distinguished from the conventional methods. Finally the validity of the network is proved through the experiment results of network training on the test data. It provides a brand-new idea for virtual reality technique and sound quality evaluation of virtual environment with using this method.

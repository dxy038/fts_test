According to the Earth Observatory dust outbreaks are considered as natural hazards, which affect the ecosystems and human
life. The main objective of this study is to assess and monitor the movement of aerosols and pollutants from local or other sources,
both natural and anthropogenic, using a combination of ground-based monitoring and satellite data. The turbid and polluted
atmosphere in the densely-populated area of Hyderabad, India is further degradated from dust outbreaks originated from Thar
desert. A dust event occurred during 10th to 11th April 2006 in the northwest region of India; its plume substantially spreaded
across the downwind direction affecting the study region. Using both irradiance measurements and satellite data this dust event is
investigated. The analysis shows a significant change in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Aerosol Index (AI) and aerosol-particle
size during the dust event. The Aerosol Optical Depth in the dusty day is about 0.2 higher than the previous non-dusty days, while
the Ångström exponent rapidly decreases when the dust plume affected the study area. The surface PM concentrations show
enhanced values during the dusty day directly influenced by the dust deposition. There is also a remarkable decrease in groundreaching
global radiation, UV erythemal (UVery) and other irradiance components. The analysis suggested that the use of the
diffuse-to-direct-beam ratio is the most appropriate parameter for the dust monitoring since its values at the longer wavelengths are
not affected by the solar zenith angle.

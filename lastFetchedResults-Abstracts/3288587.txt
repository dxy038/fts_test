This paper addresses the efficacy of a Living Lab approach to improving the quality of the teaching and learning of mathematics and science at secondary school level as well as student outcomes. A nation-wide initiative is underway in Lesotho, with the objective of promoting interaction amongst learners and teachers of mathematics and science in secondary schools. This creates an open platform upon which learners, educators, researchers, policy makers, and the private sector cocreate value by enhancing the quality of science and maths education, and helping the youth to choose careers. The project was motivated by the need to promote a learner-centred approach and exploit the cultural practice whereby a learner is charged with responsibility to help others. The project uses 3G technologies together with the Internet, social networks and educational software. A supporting case study is described.

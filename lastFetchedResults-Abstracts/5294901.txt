Advances in microelectronics and microprocessors in the last decade have revolutionized the electronics industry , making feasible the realization of sophisticated, "smart"and yet inexpensive, processing and control subsystems. The advantages of discrete controllers are two fold: being of digital nature they are less dependent on the accuracy and stability of passive and active components and secondly, they can be configured by software. This latter feature is especially important when digital controllers are used to close feedback loops, since they permit one to realize sophisticated control laws which are difficult, and some time impossible, to realize by analog phase compensation techniques. Indeed, increasingly used in control systems because of their low cost, flexibility, programmability and their ability to handle simultaneously a number of tasks. The objective of the present study was to investigate the performances of a sinusoidal power inverter, using a digital signal processor which generates a sinusoidal PWM for power driver.

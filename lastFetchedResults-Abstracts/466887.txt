Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the topical application of recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor gel influences healing after abdominal wound separation. Study design: A double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients with surgical wound separation. Results: Ten patients were randomized to treatment, and 11 patients were randomized to placebo. There was no difference between groups with regard to age, initial wound volume, type of surgical procedure, incision, or body mass index. Patients in the placebo group received 47 ± 24 days of therapy. Patients in the treatment group received 29 ± 14 days of therapy (P= .057). The wounds of the placebo group closed 54 ± 26 days after operation. Wounds in the treatment group closed in 35 ± 15 days (P= .05). Wound closure rates were significantly different, as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Conclusion: Our preliminary study suggests that the topical application of 0.01% recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor gel accelerates healing of separated surgical wounds. Additional studies will be required to determine comparative efficacy and effectiveness relative to the current clinical practice of wound granulation and secondary closure.

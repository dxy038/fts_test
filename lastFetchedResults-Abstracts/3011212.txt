We present a new adaptive vector-quantization scheme with codebook replenishment for color image-sequence compression in this paper. This scheme uses mean/residual vector quantization with binary-tree search algorithm to vector-quantize the Y component and the low-passed I and Q components of color images. It also incorporates an objective criteria for codebook replenishment. The mean and label replenishment technique is also applied to further reduce the bit-rate. Computer simulations on two 60-frame, 512 &#215; 512 color image-sequences have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

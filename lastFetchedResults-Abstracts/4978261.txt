An inter-channel decorrelation procedure via resampling in the frequency domain for multi-channel acoustic echo cancellation (MCAEC) based on residual echo enhancement is proposed. The objective is to efficiently alleviate the non-uniqueness problem while introducing minimal distortion to the audio quality and the signal statistics. The effectiveness is illustrated with respect to the standard approach of using a memoryless nonlinearity or additive noise. A combination of the new decorrelation procedure and the residual echo enhancement technique points towards a computationally feasible yet very robust frequency-domain MCAEC system.

The results of an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and Sandia National Laboratories joint study of the status and needs of power conditioning for photovoltaic power stations are presented. The overall objective was to assess the state of the art and define a critical path for evolving next-generation power conditioners that are suitably reliable, efficient, and economical for the large-scale commercialization of photovoltaics. Power conditioning requirements for station sizes ranging from about 50 kW to hundreds of megawatts were considered. The study scope included site visits to several pilot photovoltaic stations, interactions with power electronic equipment vendors, consultations with utilities, and review of the extensive information on the subject compiled by Sandia, EPRI, and others. The authors identify key areas for improving power conditioning technology and describe some desirable activities for fostering the appropriate technology development

Objective(s):Recently cell therapy is a promising therapeutic modality for many types of disease including acute kidney injury (AKI). Due to the unique biological properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attractive cells in this regard. This study aims to transplant MSCs equipped with nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in rat experimental models of acute kidney and evaluate regeneration potential of injured kidney especially expression of injury and repaired biomarkers.
Materials and methods:Nrf2 was overexpressed in bone marrow-derived MSCs by pcDNA.3.1 plasmid. AKI was induced using glycerol in rat models. The regenerative potential of Nrf2-overexpressed MSCs was evaluated in AKI-Induced animal models using biochemical and histological methods after transplantation. Expression of repaired genes, AQP1 and CK-18, as well as injury markers, Kim-1 and Cystatin C, was also assayed in engrafted kidney sections.
Results:Our results revealed that transplantation of Nrf2-overexpressed MSCs into AKI-induced rats decreased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine and ameliorated kidney regeneration throughout 14 days. Upregulation of repaired markers and downregulation of injury markers were considerable 14 days after transplantation.Â 
Conclusions: Overexpression of Nrf2 in MSCs suggests a new strategy to increase efficiency of MSC-based cell therapy in AKI.

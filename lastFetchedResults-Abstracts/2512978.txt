<p><strong>Objective:</strong> This study determined the chromosomal constitution of recurrent spontaneous abortions by Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis of fetal samples.<br /><strong>Material and methods:   </strong>Forty pregnant women with early recurrent pregnancy losses aged 21 to 42 years old from Tehran University of Medical Sciences affiliated hospitals entered in this descriptive study. Hibridization analysis of fetal samples whose standard karyotyping were not possible due to poor sample quality was performed. Number of successful chromosome analysis using CGH comparing with all samples analyzed was determined.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> CGH was able to determine the chromosomal constitution of all samples. Overall, CGH detected chromosomal abnormalities including trisomies and monosomies in 18 samples (46%).<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> CGH can be used to reveal the chromosomal constitution of fetal samples when the sample quality does not permit an accurate chromosome analysis. CGH can also play a role as a complementary method, to the traditional cytogenetic techniques used in the investigation of recurrent spontaneous abortions.</p>

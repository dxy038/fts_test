This paper presents a multi-objective fuzzy optimal transaction model based on optimal power flow for electricity market. The proposed mode! is formulated as multi-objective optimization problem of minimizing both pool purchase cost and the pollution emission, which takes the generator capacity, transmission lines capability and node voltage security constraints into account. Firstly, the pool purchase cost and emission objectives are optimized individually in order to define the membership function of objective, then, the multi-objective problem is reformulated into a new standard nonlinear problem by the fuzzy sets theory and max-min operator, finally, it is solved by interior point method and the results that corresponding to multi-objective optimization problem are gained. The simulation results of IEEE 6-generator 30-bus system show that the proposed model can make multi-objective optimization and ensure the multifactor fairness of bidding unit

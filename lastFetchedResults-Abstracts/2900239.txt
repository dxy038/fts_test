Inter-speaker variability resulting from factors such as gender, emotions, accent and age lead to the decrease in recognition accuracy of speaker-independent Automatic Speech Recognition systems. Accent variation in Hindi speech and its effect on the performance of Continuous Speech Hindi ASR was studied with the objective to design and develop a compensation technique for accent variation. This paper presents the results of the preliminary experiments conducted in the process.

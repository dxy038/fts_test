Introduction & Objective: Coronary arteries diseases and atherosclerosis are the most prevalent mortality and morbidity in the world. This study was designed with goal of effect of frankincense extract on accumulation of fatty streaks in coronary arteries of high- cholesterol fed male rabbits.
Materials & Methods: Twenty white male rabbits (wt = 1.780 kg) were weighed and blood samples were taken for analysis-of serum cholesterol, TG, LDL, HDL, VLDL. After taking the sample rabbits were randomly divided into two groups. For 40 days group 1 (n=10) was given high cholesterol (1%) diet with frankincense extract (500 mg/kg) and group 2 (n=10) were fed with high   cholesterol with distilled water. Then, both groups weighted and blood samples were taken. Finally, the animals were sacrificed and their coronary arteries were dissected. Pathological smear were prepared and stained with H&E. The plaque of atherosclerotic was evaluated by light microscope.
Results: Results of this study indicate that rabbits which received frankincense extract showed significant difference in cholesterol, TG, LDL, HDL, VLDL in compare with other group (p < 0.05). Also, our results showed a significant difference in mean of pathological scoring of four branch of coronary arteries (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Significant differences in all of parameters such as; weight, serum cholesterol, TG, HDL, LDL, VLDL might be related to effect of frankincense extract on lipid metabolism. Pathological results showed that frankincense extract could decrease accumulation of fatty streaks in all branches of coronary arteries. Thus frankincense extract can be for preventing of used cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis and for treatment of lipidemia.

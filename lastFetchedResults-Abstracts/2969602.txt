One of the key issues in wireless ATM is concerned with an efficient handoff scheme that can provide seamless network connectivity to mobile terminals. The handoff scheme must be fast and reliable so that service disruption is minimized. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a backward handoff scheme, which is currently under active consideration in the ATM Forum. The main objective is to study the impact of critical parameters on end-to-end cell delay and service disruption period during connection rerouting

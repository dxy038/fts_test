In this paper, the authors investigate the use of two destination-initiated wavelength-weighted reservation (DW<sup>2</sup>R) protocols for the distributed setup of dynamic lightpaths in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) rings. The two protocols are based on a weight-based wavelength selection heuristic, recently proposed for mesh topologies. The main objective of the DW<sup>2</sup>R protocols is to reduce the probability of service denial due to multiple and concurrent wavelength reservation attempts, initiated by distinct sources. A detailed performance study based on simulation experiments on ring topologies reveals for the first time a number of desirable scalable properties of the DW<sup>2</sup>R protocols.

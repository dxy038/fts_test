The objective of the present study is to provide an overview of available literature on problems and potential solutions in bioethanol production. The preparation of an overview of bioethanol as motor fuel requires knowledge of its chemical-physical properties and different production methods. The study points out the most popular opinions and test results to characterise the production of bioethanol. This overview considers potential methods for producing ethanol and production technologies suitable for ethanol as motor fuel, especially most recent achievements in converting carbohydrates into ethanol.

In this note, we study a distributed coordinated tracking problem for multiple networked Euler-Lagrange systems. The objective is for a team of followers modeled by full-actuated Euler-Lagrange equations to track a dynamic leader whose vector of generalized coordinates is time varying under the constraints that the leader is a neighbor of only a subset of the followers and the followers have only local interaction. We consider two cases: i) The leader has a constant vector of generalized coordinate derivatives, and ii) The leader has a varying vector of generalized coordinate derivatives. In the first case, we propose a distributed continuous estimator and an adaptive control law to account for parametric uncertainties. In the second case, we propose a model-independent sliding mode control algorithm. Simulation results on multiple networked two-link revolute joint arms are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms.

An improved method of more than halving the turn on frequency of a 4-arm log-periodic (LP) antenna for dual-circularly polarized (CP) bidirectional use is demonstrated. The ground plane currents of a slot-LP are manipulated by varying &#8220;ground plane&#8221; shape to form a ring-turnstile-slot LP aperture and thus extend the overall antenna bandwidth. The proposed concept is used to design and fabricate an antenna that is 2.3 times smaller than the conventional 4-arm LP and works from 500 MHz to 3 GHz. Microstrip impedance transformer/balun is used to feed the LP thus allowing for bidirectional use and much simpler beamforming network for dual-polarized operation. VSWR and far-field behavior of the antenna are characterized and its high-power thermal stability is demonstrated through a high-power test. The advantages over the previously designed ring-turnstile-LP configuration are highlighted and the design principles undertaken to make the antenna high-power capable are illustrated. The prototyped antenna is meant not only to illustrate the proposed concept but also as a viable high-power bidirectional antenna.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective therapy for treating chronic pain. The St. Jude Medical PENTA<sup>TM</sup> paddle lead features a 4&#215;5 contact array for achieving broad, selective coverage of dorsal column (DC) fibers. The objective of this work was to evaluate DC activation regions that correspond to dermatomal coverage with use of the PENTA lead in conjunction with a lateral sweep programming algorithm. We used a two-stage computational model, including a finite element method model of field potentials in the spinal cord during stimulation, coupled to a biophysical cable model of mammalian, myelinated nerve fibers to determine fiber activation within the DC. We found that across contact configurations used clinically in the sweep algorithm, the activation region shifted smoothly between left and right DC, and could achieve gapless medio-lateral coverage in dermatomal fiber tract zones. Increasing stimulation amplitude between the DC threshold and discomfort threshold led to a greater area of activation and number of dermatomal zones covered on the left and/or right DC, including L1-2 zones corresponding to dermatomes of the lower back. This work demonstrates that the flexibility in contact selection offered by the PENTA lead may enable patient-specific tailoring of SCS.

Biomolecular behavior of tumor cells has become attractive to investigators. p53 as an oncosuppresor gene has been core of various studies and Ki67 is a nuclear protein involved in proliferation process. Stopping of onco-suppressor function theoretically allows proliferative system to get out of any control. In this case-control study we evaluated 50 patients with non small cell lung cancer, considering the association between P53 oncoprotein and Ki67 with rate of tumoral cells differentiation. We found the concurrent move of P53 and Ki67 according to the rate of differentiation and a significant risk (odds ratio) for being poorly differentiated in samples having higher rates of these two factors. We suppose that mutant P53 protein not only may be used as an objective finding for tumor grading, but probably as a practical point of approach for determining prognosis and planning therapy for this patients.

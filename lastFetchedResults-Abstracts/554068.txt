This article is a sociological analysis of the war in the first of the eight military treatise On War by the German military historian and influential military theorist Carl Philipp Gottfried von Clausewitz (June 1, 1780 -November 16, 1831).

The end of the World Wars, the Korean War, and Vietnam War, etc prompted the warring countries to delve more into Clausewitzian theories.

Clausewitz is unknown to the Iranian military personnel, and even those who have heard his name, know him solely through one of his famous quotes, " War is a continuation of politics by other means."

In his notion of war, Clausewitz says, "War is thus an act of force to compel the enemy to do our will" He considers war as a logical tool of national policy and rides out moderation in it.

His second very famous concept of war is to do with what he called friction in war.

He maintained that anything could go wrong in war, and plans, no matter how simple or perfect they are, may not turn out as expected[ "The greatest enemy of a good plan, is the dream of a perfect plan."

To justify this, Clausewitz mentions uncertainty, fatigue, errors, inclement weather, hunger, etc. He further insists on the role of mental powers such as the mind, will and military genius in a war.

Clausewitz's primary objective in his treatise On War is to give a definition of war, which he does so expertly.

Therefore, this article is only a sociological analysis of the aspects and nature of war in this part of his treatise.

In this paper, a pricing-based resource allocation (PBRA) scheme is proposed in downlink multi-cell orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) networks. As a powerful means to mitigate inter-cell interference (ICI), base station (BS) coordination (BSC) technology has been considered. We propose to select the set of co-channel users to maximize the system utility based on variable pricing function relating to real-time channel conditions and representing the corresponding interference degree to other coordination cells. The iterative water-filling algorithm is adopted to solve the objective problem based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Moreover, simulation results prove the substantial performance of the proposed PBRA algorithm.

The paper presents a digital servo system of the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) implemented in the satellite antenna position control. The novel control system based on DSP and CPLD modules is proposed to satisfy the requirements of the high performance servo system. The hardware and software control procedures are designed and developed. The objective of the whole digital system is to adjust the speed, determine the position and track it precisely. The performance of the servo system is validated through the simulation and experimental results. The results indicate that the servo system has completed the steady and dynamic high precision control operation for the satellite antenna position control. Meanwhile it shows that the designed servo system could be implemented in industrial control field and has certain practical values.

In this paper, we propose a disturbance adaptive controller for a machine-to-machine system (MMS), with the objective to study the adaptation of the machine to an external disturbance. For this, MMS is built and experiments are conducted. The disturbance is then estimated by an observer, which assists the machine to adapt to the effects of the disturbance via a feedback controller, called the disturbance adaptive controller. Real-time experiment results are presented and discussed. These results form the very first step of our main goal in building a human-machine system where the machine will adapt to the human finger-motion for developing adaptive Braille reading devices.

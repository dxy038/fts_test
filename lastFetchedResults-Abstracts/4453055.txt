A new weighted order scheme is presented for finding alternative Pareto optimal solution of multi objective linear programming problems. In developing the weighted scheme, a big M model is proposed. We establish some properties of the ordering scheme and the proposed model and show how to determine proper values of the parameter M. Illustrative examples are worked out to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the competitiveness of the obtained solutions as compared to the ones obtained by the weighted maxmin and the weighted aggregation methods.

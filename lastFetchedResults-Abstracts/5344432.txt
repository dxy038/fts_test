In this paper, we propose a characterization of the main classes contained in the database of the system K-DSS and related to the domain of identification of the crucial knowledge for which a capitalizing operation is required. We exploit ontological categories existing in the literature to define the notions of knowledge, actor, support and criteria of knowledge vulnerability. The objective is to improve the process of the potentially crucial knowledge evaluation by providing to different decision makers a unified semantic of these entities. A such approach brings us a preliminary analysis for the construction of an application ontology that we aim to integrate as a new component of the decision support system K-DSS.

This paper proposes a new solution to the audio source separation problem. The objective is to separate the original audio source signals generated by various musical instruments in one mixture. Existing approaches to solving this problem that humans easily cope with still have little success. In this paper, the blind source separation (BSS) is approached from a new point of view and is dealt with as a machine learning problem.

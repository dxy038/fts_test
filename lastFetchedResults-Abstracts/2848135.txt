In this paper, The improved Particle Swarm Optimization in dynamic objective function environment (DOFPSO) is purposed. The dynamic environment will change with the time t. The DOFPSO algorithm discuss that how to determine changes of the time (environment) and how to keep population diversity. The improved algorithm has the ability to fast response the change of environment and could find the best fitness value quickly. The results of experiment indicate that DOFPSO is more effective than particle swarm optimization (PSO) and restart method particle swarm optimization (RMPSO) in the response of change of environment and fast convergence.

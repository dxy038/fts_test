An induction motor drive that uses an improved high-frequency resonant DC link inverter is presented. The resonant circuit was systematically analyzed first to establish the criteria for initial current selection, and a circuit to establish the bidirectional initial current was then proposed. The proposed current initialization scheme solves voltage overshoot and zero crossing failure problems in the ordinary resonant DC link inverters. A three-phase 3 kW insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor (IGBT) based 60 kHz resonant link inverter has been constructed and successfully tested with an induction motor drive. The speed control system is implemented using two microprocessors. Experimental results are presented to show superior operation of the proposed resonant DC link inverter drive

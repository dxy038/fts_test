Introduction: There are considerable evidence on increased prevalence of asthma and allergic disease in the world. But due to different methodologies, these studies cannot be compared.
Objective: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of allergic diseases in children of Rasht city by ISSAC methodology in 2001-2002.
Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study; the samples were selected randomly from first grade students of 63 primary schools and second and third grade students of 22 guidance schools. Based on ISAAC protocol, students completed questionnaires, and results were analyzed by SPSS soft ware by 95% confidence interval.
Results: Out of 6145 questionnaire, 6060 were returned. The prevalence of "ever wheezing " was 25% in guidance school and 22% in primary school students. In boys it was higher than girls (26.7%VS. 22,57%) (P< 0.05). Prevalence of asthma was 7.1% in 6-7 year olds and 7.1% in 13-14 year old students. It was higher in boys (P < 0.05) and in 6-7 year olds was higher than 13-14 year old students (p < 0.05). And totally was higher in 2001-2002 study than previous studies (5,96% VS. 3.4%, P < 0.05). 1 14 students (3.68%) had sleep disruption over one night a week and 143 students (17%) had speech limitation due to wheezing. These results were lower than previous studies (19% sleep disruption and 23.7% speech limitation in 1995-1996)(p < 0.05).

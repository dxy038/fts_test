Objective
T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL) is a chronic clonal lymphoproliferation of cytotoxic T cells often complicated by cytopenia. Because the outcomes of splenectomy in patients with T-LGL have been only reported sporadically, we objectively assessed the outcomes of splenectomy.
Materials and Methods

When a cohort of 56 T-LGL patients was analyzed, patients with splenomegaly (n = 34) and had higher frequency of bi- and pancytopenia than patients with no splenomegaly (70% vs 27%; p = 0.001). We identified 15 patients who, in their clinical course, underwent splenectomy and studied their hematological and clinical outcomes.
Results

Indications for splenectomy included symptomatic splenomegaly and/or severe refractory cytopenia. Median spleen weight was 1300 g, consistent with diagnosis of splenomegaly; T-cell receptor (TCR)-γ rearrangement and typical T-LGL were detected by immunophenotype in all specimens. There was no surgery-related mortality, with the median follow-up and survival of 719 and 498 days, respectively. Two patients died due to causes possibly related to the splenectomized state and/or primary disease. All patients showed lineage-specific hematologic response and achieved transfusion independence; however, precise molecular analysis of TCR and variable chain Vβ flow cytometry showed persistence of the LGL clones.
Conclusion

We conclude that splenectomy constitutes a viable and safe therapeutic option for patients with T-LGL, splenomegaly, and refractory cytopenia.

A method based on ant colony algorithm is given for optimizing wavelet de-noising double-threshold. The optimization interval and the objective function are chosen according to the difference of autocorrelation coefficient, which belong to signal´s wavelet coefficient and noise´s wavelet coefficient respectively. The optimal upper threshold and lower threshold are calculated by ant colony algorithm. Simulation and compressor vibration fault detection application results demonstrate that the proposed method can optimize the de-noising threshold and de-noising effectively.

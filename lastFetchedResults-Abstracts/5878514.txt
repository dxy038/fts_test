In this paper presents an algorithm for solving optimal power flow problem through the application of a modified differential evolution algorithm(MDE). The objective of an optimal Power Flow(OPF) is to find steady state operation point which minimizes total generating unit (thermal) fuel cost and total load bus voltage deviation from a specified point while maintaining an acceptable system performance in terms of limits on generator real and reactive power outputs, bus voltages, transformer taps, output of various compensating devices and power flow of transmission lines. Differential Evolution (DE) is one of evolutionary algorithms, which has been used in many optimization problems due to its simplicity and efficiency. The proposed MDE is in the framework of differential evolution owning new mutation operator and selection mechanism. To test the efficacy of the algorithm, it is applied to IEEE 30-bus power system with two different objective functions. The optimal power flow results obtained using MDE are compared with other evolutionary methods. The simulation results reveal that the MDE optimization technique provides better results compared to other methods recently published in the literature as demonstrated by simulation results.

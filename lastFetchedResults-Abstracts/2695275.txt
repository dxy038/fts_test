In this paper, an offline torque sharing function (TSF) for torque ripple reduction in switched reluctance motor (SRM) drives over a wide speed range is proposed. The objective function of an offline TSF is composed of two secondary objectives with a Tikhonov factor to minimize the square of the phase current (copper loss) and derivatives of current references (rate of change of flux linkage). The proposed TSFs with different Tikhonov factors are compared with the conventional TSFs including linear, cubic, and exponential TSFs in terms of efficiency and torque-speed performance while operating in both magnetic linear and saturation regions. Then, the Tikhonov factor is selected based on a tradeoff between the copper loss and torque-speed performance. The maximum torque-ripple-free speed of the selected offline TSF is validated to be seven times as high as the best case in these conventional TSFs. The performance of the offline TSF is verified by simulations and experiments with a 2.3-kW, three-phase 12/8 SRM. Results show that the proposed offline TSF can significantly reduce the torque ripple of SRM without increasing copper loss over a wide speed range.

Wind is one of the fast growing renewable resources that can significantly contribute in achieving emission-free electricity generation system. Since wind resources are distributed across geographical locations, wind resource sharing among different geographical locations is essential to facilitate wind energy penetration and its full utilisation. A wind resource sharing strategy, for interconnected electricity networks, to achieve the national and regional renewable energy target is presented in this study. A multi-objective decision making problem has been formulated to optimally share the installed wind generation capacity in a multi-area power systems. Computational models have been developed for wind generation adequacy, emission reduction from wind energy and capacity upgrade requirements for tie-line interconnections. Trade-off analysis has been used to select the best wind resource sharing options. The proposed wind resource sharing strategy has been applied to the interconnected power systems operated within the National Electricity Market (NEM) framework of Southeast Australia to share the available wind resources within the geographical areas of the participating states in the NEM.

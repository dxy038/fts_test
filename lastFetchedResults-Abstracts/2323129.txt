Background & Objectives: Now TB is one of the lethal infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the prevalence of latent Tuberculosis in health care workers in hospitals of Mashhad..
Material & Methods: This study was a prospective descriptive- analytic that performed in 2011, in health care workers in hospitals of Mashhad. Samples were selected according to age, occupation activity in the infections and others wards. Samples with history of TB or close contact with TB patients outside of hospital were excluded. Collected data were analyzed by using the SPSS software.
Results: 476 care workers were studied. 53.8% case were male and 17.9% work in infectious unit. 256 people were Negative PPD. 39 people were working in infections ward and 217 were working in others ward. 149 people had 5-9mm PPD in duration that 35 people were working in infections ward and 114 people were working in others ward. 71people had PPD?10mm, 11 people were working in infections ward and 60 people were working in others ward. There was not found significant level of difference between PPD induration of    infection wards care workers in comparison with other wards (P =0/255)
Conclusion: In this study positive PPD test was 12.95% in infections ward health care workers and 15.36% in other wards that  difference  was not significant. In endemic regions such as Iran, working in hospital and close contact with TB patients would not be the sole determinant and there might  be the risk of contamination during working and daily activities in community .Therefore such insignificant difference between health workers and community    would be reasonable

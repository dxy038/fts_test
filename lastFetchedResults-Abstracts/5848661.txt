The overall goal of this paper is to design a new modulator/mixer at 38 GHz in uniplanar technology. The primary objective is to develop a theoretical and an experimental study of each elementary block in the millimeter frequency range which allows us to design directly the device at 38 GHz. As part of this study, a uniplanar modulator/mixer was built in X-band in order to aid in the verification of the design concept.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

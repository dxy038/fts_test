Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has emerged to facilitate tracking items and inexpensively automate the processes of supply chain management. The deployment of RFID technology requires the development of a robust middleware which will manage the huge amount of data captured by RFID antennas and sent by RFID readers. The main objective of this article is to provide insights into how radio frequency identification (RFID) can enhance supply chain management (SCM) applications. Our approach is based on developing a generic interface on top of the FlexRFID middleware in order to allow existing SCM applications get the benefit from RFID technology. Our Wireless and Mobile Computing lab (WML) has initiated the development of the FlexRFID middleware since fall 2008. Since then, the work of our lab puts the light on the emergence of RFID technology in the market. The results of this work indicate that our approach will enhance many processes of SCM through the advantages of RFID technology starting from inventory control, asset management, work in process, and ending at tracking the shipments. On the whole, the generic interface that we have developed on top of the FlexRFID middleware will allow companies lower not only the cost of the deployment of RFID technology, but also it will help companies reuse their existing SCM applications and thus maintaining the usability of their applications.

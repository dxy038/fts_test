Background: In response to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recently issued “Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities, 1994,” during May 1994 we implemented and evaluated a pilot tuberculosis respirator training program that used four self-directed learning stations, through which participants proceeded at their own pace. Employee tuberculin skin testing was included in the training program.
Methods: The time required to train each employee was recorded. At the completion of the training program, all participants were asked to assess their ability to attain the learning objectives and whether they believed the program format was an effective and efficient use of their time. Two weeks later, a convenience sample of 100 employees completed an 11-question test designed to measure knowledge retention.
Results: One hundred seventy-six employees completed training during the pilot period. The average time necessary to train each employee was 19.5 minutes. Overall 97.1% of participants stated that they were able to fully meet the course objectives. Test scores among the convenience sample averaged 88% 2 weeks after training.
Conclusions: The use of self-paced stations for tuberculosis respirator training and employee tuberculosis skin test screening was both effective and time-efficient for employees. We have expanded this program to include all of our approximately 500 employees who may be exposed to tuberculosis.

Monolithic high aspect ratio silicon micromirror devices were demonstrated with fully isolated vertical comb drives micromachined from the back side and front side of a 50-&#956;m silicon-on-insulator device layer. The devices are suspended by torsional support beams and exhibit bidirectional single-axis rotation, as well as independent up- and down-pistoning actuation. The comb drives are fabricated with initial comb-finger preengagement of up to 10 &#956;m for constant force actuation and have accurately self-aligned comb-fingers. Device 1 with a 30-&#956;m-thick support beam measured static optical beam deflection from -20/spl deg/ to 19/spl deg/ and bidirectional pistoning motion from -7.5 to 8.25 &#956;m. Device 2 utilizes a highly compliant 10-&#956;m-thick support beam and measured static optical beam deflection from -14/spl deg/ to 16/spl deg/ and downward pistoning motion to -12.5 &#956;m, all at &lt;70 V.

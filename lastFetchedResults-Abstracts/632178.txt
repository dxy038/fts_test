James Ladyman ([2000]) argues that constructive empiricism is untenable because it
cannot adequately account for modal statements about observability. In this paper, I
attempt to resist Ladymanâ€™s conclusion, arguing that the constructive empiricist can
grant his modal discourse objective, theory-independent truth-conditions, yet without
compromising his empiricism.

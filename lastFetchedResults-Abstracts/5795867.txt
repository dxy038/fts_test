A new strategy for harmonic elimination for single phase shunt active filter system is proposed in this paper. The control objective of the filter is defined as: shift the phase angle of the input current with the phase angle of the fundamental load current component. For discreet implementation the objective can be obtained without sensing the input voltage. The controller on the sensed input currents applies phase shifting method and a resistor emulator type input current shaping strategy is applied on the phase shifted current. The proposed control algorithm is computationally simple furthermore effective in filtering the harmonic currents. The simulation results for various kinds of nonlinear loads are presented in this paper.

Summary form only given. In 2-dimensional wire-cylinder reactor, the influence of electric field and charged particle density is simulated. Poisson equation for the electric field and continuity equation was calculated to find out the temporal evolution of streamer corona using FEM-FCT method. Also the temporal distribution of radicals was calculated using Runge-Kutta method. A bidirectional pulsed voltage was applied to remove noxious flue-gas efficiently.

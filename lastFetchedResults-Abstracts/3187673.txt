Optimization of network planning is important for improving the QoS of the RFID networks before deployment. This paper proposes an efficient approach for RFID network planning based on k-coverage. A k-coverage model is developed to evaluate the network performance. The Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm (PGSA) is used to optimize the RFID networks by determining the optimal adjustable parameters in the model. The main advantages of the proposed approach are that it handles the objective function and the constraints separately and does not require any external control parameters. The simulation results demonstrate well the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with other approaches.

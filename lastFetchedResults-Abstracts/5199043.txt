Grid computing comprises of distributed computer systems which are geographically dispersed to share the combination of resources in a heterogeneous environment. Grid computing is one of the latest technologies to solve very complex problems in scientific applications, using the resource sharing concept in the dynamic virtual organizations. The main problem occurs in most of the organization is that the resources are become idle and underutilized. In some organizations, even the server machines can often be relatively idle. Grid computing provides an approach for exploiting these underutilized resources and thus has the possibility of substantially increasing the efficiency of resource usage. Effective and Efficient Task scheduling is an important aspect of Grid computing. The objective of this paper is that a grid scheduler first allocates the important(high priority) jobs to the resources and then it allocates the low prioritize job so as to achieve the maximum resource utilization rate, minimize the makespan and avoid the load balancing level problem. In this paper, we propose a new framework and QoS(Quality of Service) Priority Based Scheduling Algorithm for effective task scheduling to the resources in the grid environment. The algorithm is simulated using Java. The results show that our proposed QoS priority based scheduling algorithm gives better results in makespan and resource utilization rate than other algorithms such as QoS guided weighted mean time min (QWMTM), Min-Min and Max-Min heuristic algorithms.

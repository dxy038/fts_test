The objective of this paper is to give an overview of some recently developed sum rules and physical bounds in scattering and antenna theory. The sum rules are based on integral identities for Herglotz functions that relate the quantity of interest with its low and high-frequency behavior. The sum rules are transformed to bounds by estimating the integrals and applying variational results to the parameters that appear in the asymptotic expansions. The theoretical findings are exemplified by numerical results for various scattering and antenna configurations.

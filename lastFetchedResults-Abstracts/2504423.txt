Abstract
Background: Using the method “surrogacy”, in which a woman accepts to bear and deliver a child for a married couple, is considered as a subsidiary method in infertility therapy. This method is relatively new in Iran.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the experiences of the women involved in surrogacy and to reveal some issues related to this method.
Materials and Methods: The method of research was analytic–descriptive and causative – comparative type. The 5-item neo - questionnaire and structured interview were used simultaneously. The sample consisted of 15 surrogate mothers, 15 intended mothers, and 30 normal mothers (each with one or more children). The studied data was gathered in the fall and winter of 2009 in Isfahan by the researcher (Monir Pashmi) and data analysis was executed through the use of descriptive data (such as the median, standard deviation) and interpretive data (T- test).
Results: The research revealed that, in terms of social – cultural status, the surrogate and intended mothers were completely different but their psychological characteristics were not significantly varied. Results indicate the satisfaction and consent of both sides involved in the surrogacy. They had a good relationship during the pregnancy period but after delivery the intended mother wanted no further relationship, they found out this method an altruistic experience.
Conclusion: Most surrogate and intended mothers do not consider surrogacy a problematic issue. A number of mothers, however, did mention that they had not been given the appropriate counseling beforehand. It seems plausible, therefore, to endeavour a general rise in the socio – cultural awareness of surrogacy in Iranian society.

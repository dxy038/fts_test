The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori seropositivity in institutionalized patients with severe neurologic impairment. Anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin G antibody in serum was measured in 196 institutionalized Japanese patients using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, taking an antibody level >50 units/ml as evidence of H. pylori seropositivity. Patient age pattern and duration of institutionalization were examined for the relationships with H. pylori seropositivity. We also examined for seroconversion indicating new H. pylori infection in initially negative patients 1 year later. Positivity for H pylori infection among institutionalized patients was also compared with positivity among patients living at home. H. pylori seropositivity was present in 81.1% of subjects. Prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity increased with both age and duration of institutionalization. The serum level of anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin G antibody in patients over 20 years old was consistently high, approximately twice that of subjects less than 10 years of age. Of 38 patients initially negative for H. pylori infection, 18 (47.4%) had become positive at 1 year. H. pylori seropositivity was significantly more prevalent among institutionalized patients than among patients living at home (P<0.0001). This study confirms that high H. pylori seropositivity rates are found among institutionalized patients with severe neurologic impairment. Our observations suggest person to person transmission, with fecal to oral, salivary secretion and respiratory droplet routes possibly being important pathways.

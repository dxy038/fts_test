The applications of energy storage technologies will be more and more important for the security, economic and stability of microgrid. This paper chooses a vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) as a distributed energy storage unit. A multi-objective optimization model for a microgrid which contents VRB is proposed in this paper. It analysis economical benefits model of microgrid VRB bring to. And another model is given special attention to various factors such as operating modes, control strategies and the weight of optimization goals. The numerical solution based on genetic algorithm (GA) is worked out and an illustrative system is calculated with the algorithm proposed.

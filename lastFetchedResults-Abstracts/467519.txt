Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the complications of peripherally inserted central catheter use in an obstetrics population at a single institution over a 5-year period. Study Design: We conducted a descriptive retrospective review of all obstetrics patients with peripherally inserted central catheter insertion during the antepartum period at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, from January 1, 1997, through September 30, 2001. Results: During the 5 years of the study, complete data regarding the primary admission diagnoses for peripherally inserted central catheter placement and associated complications were available for 52 cases. An associated complication rate of 50% (n = 26 cases) was noted. The complications included culture-proved line infection (n = 9/52 complications, 17%), presumed line infection (n = 6/52 complications, 12%), cellulitis (n = 4/52 complications, 8%), mechanical line failure (n = 4/52 complications, 8%), pain that required line discontinuation (n = 2/52 complications, 4%), and superficial thrombophlebitis (n = 1/52 complications, 2%). A Ï‡2 analysis was performed, and preterm labor may be associated with an increased risk for peripherally inserted central catheter complication (P = .012). Conclusion: Patients who receive a peripherally inserted central catheter during pregnancy are at significant risk for infectious complications. Alternative treatment approaches are suggested, where appropriate. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1223-5.)

This paper presents a solution method to the problem of long range optimal expansion planning of an electric power transmission network. The problem is formulated as a discrete-time deterministic optimal control problem. A non linear branch and bound solution method is developed. For a finite planning period, upper and lower bounds of the objective function are computed. Enumeration of the discrete controls is then bounded. The method proceeds by consistently narrowing the bounds until the optimal trajectory is isolated. The method provides a computationally efficient tool for determining an optimal expansion plan. The impact of the economy of scale and cost escalation is readily assessed.

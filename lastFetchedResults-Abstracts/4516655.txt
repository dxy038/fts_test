The objective of this study is to develop new glacial lake inventory to understand existing condition using the optical imageries of the Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) and the Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS, nicknamed "Daichi"). Glacial lakes can be caused outburst flood when natural dams terminated by moraines are broken, and it represents serious hazard damage in downstream regions. Problems of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are that anyone does not know when it will occur and how much damage causes by it. To contribute these problems, new glacial lake inventory is currently developing in the Bhutan Himalayan using ALOS imageries. This paper describes procedure of the inventory development including image processing that introduces pan-sharpened and ortho-rectified images by PRISM and AVNIR-2, glacial lakes extraction, and its validation.

The objective of this paper is to present the compensation scheme for electric arc furnace (EAF) in three-phase three-wire distribution supply system of China. The use of recorded field data to build the EAF model in supply system can really reflect the power quality problems in the EAF system. Firstly, the typical supply system for the EAF of China is introduced. When the EAF is operating in the system without compensation device, it causes power quality problems, such as harmonics, unbalance, voltage fluctuation and flicker. The recorded field data of a steel works at the 35kV bus is used to explain the power quality problems. In order to solve the problems, the compensation scheme is designed for the EAF compensation using static synchronous compensator (DSTATCOM) and passive power filter. The passive power filter is used to mitigate the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the connection bus voltage and supply part of reactive power. Using the transformer-isolated multilevel H-bridges inverter with the instantaneous current control scheme, the DSTATCOM is capable to mitigate the unbalance and voltage fluctuation of the EAF system. Accordingly, the EAF model is built as a current source using the recorded field data with the supply system in EMTDC/PSCAD. With the compensation devices, simulation is done to test the compensation scheme and the results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

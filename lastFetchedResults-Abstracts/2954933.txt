This paper proposes an experimental study of a space-time diversity receiver for DS-CDMA systems. The objective is to obtain a trade-off between space (i.e. the number of antennas) and time (i.e. the length of the filters) diversity for particular signal scenarios. Single and multi-user scenarios are considered involving fading effects and co-channel interference. The antennas array is composed of three antennas and one monopole. The chip rate is equal to 12.5 M chips/s and the spreading factor is fixed at 31

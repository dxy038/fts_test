In this work, we focus on the dynamic modeling of an electromagnetically actuated bidirectional scanner with potential applications in biomedical applications. A 250&#956;m thick magnetic mirror is fabricated by a polymer composite of PDMS and Nd-Fe-B micropowder (MQFP-12-5) and actuated by external spiral coils. The system model consists of three parts: (i) the magnetic field intensity produced by coils; (ii) forces and magnetostatic torsion on the hard-magnetic film; (iii) the dynamic deflection of the mirror under the magnetic torsion. The effectiveness of model is verified by the finite element model (FEM) results and experimental results. This paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of the the steady state value of the deflection angle and transient response of the micromirror.

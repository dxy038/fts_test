Today, in every organization are generated in large volume of data in electronic format that required the safety storage services. Data backup and Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity issues are becoming fundamental in networks since the importance and societal value of digital data is continuously increasing. Every organization requires a business continuity plan (BCP) or disaster recovery plan (DRP) and data backup which falls within the cost constraints while achieving the target recovery requirements in terms of recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO). The organizations must identify the probable consequences that can cause disasters and evaluate their impact. There is an obvious need of supporting data for resilience against major failures; in many situations the process of storing backup data is also enforced by the law. The aim of this paper is to overview of various techniques in data backup and disaster recovery systems in the cloud environment.

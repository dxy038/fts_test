Gender roles are socially constructed, dynamic,
learned, and complex and they differ within and between
cultures. Gender demarcates responsibilities between men
and women in: social and economic activities, access to
resources, services and decision making authority.
Conditions of women differ from one society to another but
generally, women experience subordination from men.
Women are involved in many activities like washing of
clothes, cooking, rearing of children and taking care of farms
among other roles and may prevent them from engaging in
growing of trees as opposed to men. The main objective of
this study was to determine if tree growing in Siaya County is
influenced by gender issues. A cross-sectional survey
research design was used involving 280 respondents drawn
from 20 chiefâ€™s barazas in Bondo and Siaya sub-counties.
They included; 120 household heads, 40 key informants, 4
women groups and Luo council of elders. Qualitative data
generated was analysed using SPSS resulting in tables, and
percentages. A 24hours gender daily calendar was drawn to
confirm the various workloads of men and women. The study
concludes that gender (various roles assigned to different
sexes) has no influence on tree growing. Women should be
capacity built to include aspect of tree growing amongst
other chores they undertake on daily basis.

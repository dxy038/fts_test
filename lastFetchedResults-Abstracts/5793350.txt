Consistency check is avoided in improved analytic hierarchy process due to the character of transfer matrix. Determining the the weights for evaluation factors by using improved AHP and principal component analysis. Then the weights obtained by this way includes not only the experience of researchers, but also the structural features of original data. A new extenics model for risk assessment based on comprehensive weighting of subjective and objective methods is established. Through some examples, this model is proved to be more consistent with the actual and more practical than single subjective and objective method.

Background and Objective: In this research, landfill leachate treatment in Karaj city was investigated by a linked septic tank and aerated lagoon.
Materials and Methods: At first, characteristics of the leachate were determined. Then a pilot plant with anaerobic-aerobic (Septic tank and Aerated lagoon) parts was installed and started.
Results: Results showed that Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal efficiency for septic tank and subsequently to lagoon for influent COD of 19537 mg/L, were 8401 and 432 mg/L, respectively. The septic tank and aerated lagoon also operated with different flow rates and the best results for septic tank and aerated lagoon obtained in 23.6 L/day and 9.3 L/day respectively with maximum COD removal efficiency of 91.2%. Conclusion: According to the obtained results, the hybrid system had 90% COD removal efficiency. Therefore, leachate COD loading could be effectively removed in this system.

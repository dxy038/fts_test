Summary form only given. The main objective of the researches is the structure and features of the formation of thin films of silicon dioxide from ablation plasma formed by a high power ion beam (HPIB) when exposed to micro- and nanosized silica powder is compacted. In researches is used SiO<sub>2</sub> particles obtained in a plasmochemical reactor from the gas phase by exposure to an electron beam of nanosecond duration, along with the particles obtained by the standard methods. Source of HPIB is the upgraded pulsed ion accelerator TEMP- 4M<sup>2</sup> based on diode with magnetic self-isolation. The energy density of the ion beam on the target reached 4 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Methods of analysis which used in the article allow to measure the chemical composition and the ratio of the crystal structure of the target and the substrate. Under certain experimental conditions observed enrichment of silicon deposited film which is determined by the size of the particles in the sputtering target and the energy density of the HPIB. The paper also analyze the results and discusses the possibility of changing the crystal structure of the target and the deposited film with using ablative method.

In order to control microstructure of heavy forgings, a robust parameters control methodology based on Taguchi method and numerical simulation was proposed. Uniform and small microstructure of final forging was considered into the objective function. Optimal parameters were acquired through S/N analysis. The analysis of variance indicates that, for cylinder two-step upsetting, the most significant parameters affecting the microstructure are forging temperature and ingot height to diameter ratio. The virtual experimental result agrees with the predictive value well. This method avoids large number of simulations and can be used to control the microstructure of heavy forgings.

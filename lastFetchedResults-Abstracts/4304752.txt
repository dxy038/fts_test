The prime objective of this paper is to present prompt 8 channel vibration monitoring and analyzing system using prevailing LabVIEW tools. Vibration measurement is very needful in mechanical and electrical industries to check the machine health &amp; to take predictive maintenance steps before failure or major fault occur. A system based on virtual instrument is introduced that can measure vibration signals. The hardware-developing of the system includes vibration sensors, a signal conditioning circuit cum sensor exciter, a data acquisition device and a PC. Here for research, we are implementing vibration sensor on cantilever beam type arrangement and analyzing vibration signal using signal processing technique in LabVIEW. This methodology relies on the use of advanced methods for machine vibration analysis and health monitoring. Because of some issues encountered regarding traditional methods, for Fourier analysis of non stationary rotating machines the use of more advanced method using powerful software is required. FFT is a very powerful tool in frequency domain for analysis of vibration signal and it provides the information at which frequency the fault occurs? And according to that information we also predict the speed of rotating machine. For FFT analysis; it is necessary to convert vibration data (dynamic data 100mv/g) into EUs (Engineering Units) like acceleration, Velocity and displacement. Here we did the same. The main advantage of vibration monitoring with propose system is that it enables simultaneous monitoring of a number of machines of industries located at different places from a common point. The paper presents a scientific direction and development of vibration signals measurement.

Objective
This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of wound disruption after reconstructive posterior vaginal surgery with braided permanent versus absorbable suture.
Study design
A retrospective cohort study of women undergoing posterior vaginal surgery. Outcomes included suture erosion, wound dehiscence, and additional surgical procedures.
Results
Ninety-nine procedures were performed with permanent sutures, followed by 111 with absorbable sutures. There were no differences in demographics or comorbidities between patient groups. Suture erosion/wound dehiscence occurred in 31.3% of the permanent suture group versus 9% of the absorbable suture group (P = .003, odds ratio [OR] = 7.5, 95% CI 2-28). The need for additional surgical intervention was 16.1% among permanent suture group versus no patients with absorbable suture. Performing a concomitant anal sphincteroplasty with permanent sutures significantly increased the incidence of suture erosion (P = .003, OR = 4.7, 95%CI 1.7-13.3).
Conclusion
Permanent sutures increase the incidence in wound disruption and the need for additional surgical intervention in posterior colporrhapy and anal sphincteroplasty.

  At present, with the extreme consuming of nonrenewable energy resources including coal, gas and oil serious, environmental threats such as climate change, ozone depletion and increased pollution have emerged. Hence, the use of new environmentally friendly energy resources is a must. In this regard, biomass energy is introduced which can substitute for at least part of the consumption of fossil fuels and mitigate environmental damages So, the objective of this study is to assess the potential of biomass resources and their energy in Khorasan Razavi as an important region of agricultural, livestock and poultry production in the Iran. For this purpose, the average annual production of agricultural wastes was evaluated for six main crops of the province, using their waste factor. Subsequently, their average potential energy was estimated by using their energy value coefficients. For livestock and poultry wastes, the coefficient of manure production was applied based on the average live weight of animal. Having the biogas yield of manure and its heating value the amount of energy was estimated. The results showed that the agricultural sector of Khorasan Razavi province with average annual production of 3.7 Mega tons of biomass can provide about 42.3PJ energy. Also, according to the wastes potential of livestock and poultry sectors, especially dairy cows, approximately 5PJ energy can be supplied.

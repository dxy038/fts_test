In this paper, we present an energy-aware parameter-passing strategy called on-demand parameter-passing. The objective of this strategy is to eliminate redundant actual parameter evaluations if the corresponding formal parameter in a subroutine is not used during execution. This on-demand parameter-passing is expected to be very successful in reducing energy consumption of large, multi-routine embedded applications at the expense of a slight implementation complexity.

An attribute recognition model with entropy weight has been introduced in the paper, and then the model, combined with GIS, is applied to evaluate the surface sediment quality in Weihai bay. The results show that the overall quality of surface sediment in Weihai bai is good but there also exists a gradual deterioration tendency from outer sea to the west coast. The model, with clear physical meaning and objective determining weights, can not only recognize and classify the evaluation objects, but also score and sort them, which would be useful to improve the resolution of evaluation results and provide more reliable details for environmental management and decision-making.

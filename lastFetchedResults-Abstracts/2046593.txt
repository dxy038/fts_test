
Objective: Early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) or fundamental beliefs that underpin stable and
trait-like psychological disorders are chronic and relapsing. In, active schemas in dysthymic
patients with major depression have been compared with healthy individuals.The purpose
of this study was to compare early maladaptive schemas (Young, 2003, 1990) in dysthymic
patients with major depression and healthy subjects. Method: For this study, 46 patients with major depression and 20 non-hospitalized patients with
dysthymic during the year who referred to medical centers and clinics in Kermanshah (a city in
West of Iran) were selected through structured interviews and the Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI-II), and 66 patients with mild problems who referred to the clinic were considered as
control group. 15 early maladaptive schemas through Young Schema Questionnaire-Short
Form (YSQ-SF) were measured. Results: Analysis of variance showed that maladaptive schemas was different in the three
groups. Maladaptive schemas of emotional deprivation, social isolation, defectiveness/
shame, and failure in patients with dysthymic, and maladaptive schemas of Self-sacrifice, and
unrelenting standards/ hypercriticalness, entitlement/grandiosity, were active in patients with
major depression. Healthy people were not active in any schema incompatibility. Maladaptive
schemas in patients with dysthymic were more than the other two groups. Conclusion: In depression group, all early maladaptive schemas except abandonment and
dependence / incompetence schemas, indicated higher scores. The evidence shows that schemas
of emotional deprivation, social isolation, failure, and defectiveness/shame are specific keys for
dysthymic disorder and emotional inhibition, and unrelenting standards are the keys for major
depressive disorder.

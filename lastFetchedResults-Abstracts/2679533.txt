This paper proposes a new integrative view of manufacturing cell formation and both inter-cell
and intra-cell layout problems. Cells formation and their popular bi-directional linear layout are
determined simultaneously through a Dynamic Programming algorithm (with the objective of
minimizing the inter-cell flow cost under a cell size constraint). This Dynamic Programming
algorithm is implemented in a Simulated Annealing approach with Genetic operators to reach
near optimal solutions. Moreover, within this approach and by using an Ant Colony
Optimization technique, we also solve the intra-cell layout problem, i.e., we also determine how
to lay out machines within relative cells. In contrast with most of the available approaches in
the literature, we consider: (1) An integrated objective function to minimize overall inter-cell
and intra-cell flow costs instead of merely minimizing the number of inter-cell
movements/costs. (2) The integrative and simultaneous determination of cell formation and
their layout instead of using sequential approaches. (3) All three phases of cell formation, intercell
and intra-cell layout design problems, which are all important for overall performance of
the system, and (4) An easy to code and solve integrated procedure through implementing
metaheuristic approaches. Our computational results show that by incorporating intra-cell
decisions in cell formation and inter-cell design process through implementing our proposed
integrated approach, a manufacturer can largely reduce her total material flow cost. Particularly,
our computational tests show good quality solutions in comparison with the most similar
available approach in the literature with an average improvement of 24.97% in total flow cost
for a set of randomly generated test problems.

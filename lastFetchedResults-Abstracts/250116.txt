Much of the work in permeability prediction has so far been done with respect to the in-plane
properties. Guided by Darcyâ€™s law, the in-plane permeabilities (i.e. Kxx and Kyy) have been well
characterized by researchers both experimentally and, to some extent, analytically and numerically.
Work on transverse or through thickness permeability, however, has been sparse. Owing to the fact
that the limited length scale in the through thickness direction of most fibre preforms makes transverse
permeability a difficult value to measure experimentally, the objective of the present development is
to study the feasibility of applying the methodology proposed by the authors in a previous work for
in-plane permeability prediction to the estimation of transverse, as well as the in-plane, permeability
of a typical 3D woven fibre preform. The additional objective of this work is to present a preliminary
study on the effects of fibre mat compression on the fibre preform permeability

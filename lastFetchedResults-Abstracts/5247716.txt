An implicit link adaptation technique based on hybrid automatic repeat request (H-ARQ) and soft-combining is considered for transmission of joint photographic experts group 2000 (JPEG2000) images over wireless channels. Adaptation is carried out utilizing an objective perceptual image quality metric that takes into account the human perception. Retransmissions focus on the region of interest (ROI) part of the JPEG2000 image to efficiently utilize the bandwidth. Numerical results show that the combination of the proposed perceptual image quality metric with link adaptation provides robust link performance while meeting satisfactory quality constraints.

In this paper, a new scheme of a parallel quasi-resonant dc-link inverter (PQRDCLI) for electrical drive applications is described. Principles of the soft-switching inverter operation for bidirectional energy transmission are presented. A PQRDCLI analysis with the aid of simulations and experimental tests is carried out. The circuit features relatively simple topological structure and moderate overcurrent stress of components. A robust control strategy of the quasi-resonant circuit operation with an inverter output voltage dv/dt limitation has been achieved.

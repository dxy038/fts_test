<p><strong>Objective: </strong>It has been recognized that sleep has an important effect on emotion processing. The aim ‎of this study was to investigate the effect of previous night sleep duration on autonomic ‎responses to musical stimuli in different emotional contexts.‎<br /><strong>Method:</strong> A frequency based measure of GSR, PR and ECG signals were examined in 35 healthy ‎students in three groups of oversleeping, lack of sleep and normal sleep.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The results of this study revealed that regardless of the emotional context of the musical ‎stimuli (happy, relax, fear, and sadness), there was an increase in the maximum power of ‎GSR, ECG and PR during the music time compared to the rest time in all the three ‎groups. In addition, the higher value of these measures was achieved while the ‎participants listened to relaxing music. Statistical analysis of the extracted features ‎between each pair of emotional states revealed that the most significant differences ‎were attained for ECG signals. These differences were more obvious in the participants ‎with normal sleeping (p&lt;10-18). The higher value of the indices has been shown, ‎comparing long sleep duration with the normal one.‎<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There was a strong relation between emotion and sleep duration, and this association can ‎be observed by means of the ECG signals.‎</p><p><strong> </strong></p>

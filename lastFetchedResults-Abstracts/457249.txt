Objective
To investigate the association of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) and coronary endothelial function.
Methods and results
In 289 patients with coronary artery disease we assessed coronary endothelium-dependent and -independent vascular responses to intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine, adenosine, and nitroglycerin, respectively, and determined plasma ADMA and l-arginine concentrations by HPLC. After 6 months of treatment with either cerivastatin, nifedipine, cerivastatin + nifedipine, or placebo, coronary vascular function testing as well as ADMA and l-arginine determinations were repeated. We observed no correlation of plasma ADMA or l-arginine concentration and coronary response to acetylcholine, adenosine or nitroglycerin baseline, and no correlation of changes of ADMA or l-arginine plasma concentration with changes in coronary function (all r and œÅ < 0.3, all p > 0.05).
Conclusion
At physiological plasma concentrations ADMA appears to have only little impact on coronary endothelial function.

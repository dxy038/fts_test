Optimal design of hollow cylinder type force transducer with ultra low height is feasible and successful. The force transducer with ultra low height can be used to heavy duty machinery and constructive engineering. It is necessary to optimize force transducer with ultra low height. Choosing inner radius and wall-thick as design variables, maximum strain of cylinder is objective function and the active constraint is suitable. The experiment results show that linearity is improved.

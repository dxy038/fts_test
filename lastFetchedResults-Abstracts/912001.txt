Positive political metatheory based on the naturalistic ontology concerning unity of method in science, implies reducing social and political issues to naturalistic one and study the emperical regularities in a similar methodology.                                                                                 
Therfore, behaviors political fields conciderd to be subjected to a causal order that implies explanation and prediction according to deductive structure of scientific theory or deductive - nomological model of scientific explanations. Positive metatheory results in value  neutrality and nessecity of fact - value distinction.In the logic of positivism, moral values dont have such an objective  ground in empirical reality as facts and therefore shoud be conciderd as subjective and relative.                                                                        
Positive political theories such as rational choise theory and systemic functionalism results in value neutrality, in practice demand some kind of instrumental control in macro policy.Hence,as a result of metatheorical positions enacted,political agency in critique,reform and change is being denied.

An efficient method for fuzzy multi-criteria analysis of economic order quantity(EOQ) is proposed in this paper. The method uses the fuzzy logic for determining the reordering level of inventory, based on the fuzzy and uncertain data.
The process of inventory control is faced with the unavailability and uncertainty of data and needed to be proceeding by the estimation of the data, using linguistic and fuzzy variables. Here a multi-objective method is used to prevent the complexity of the model and also to compare the estimated data. The optimality of the obtained results is examined using the effective elements of the inventory control procedure for changing a weighted fuzzy matrix to a normal fuzzy matrix. A good final result can be gained using the view of decision-maker, near to risk method and the proposed method.

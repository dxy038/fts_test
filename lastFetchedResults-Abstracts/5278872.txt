This paper examines the phase error that can occur in telecommunication systems during exposure of oven controlled crystal oscillators (OCXO) to various airflow scenarios in open-loop or closed-loop operation. The objective is to make system designers aware of largely undocumented and unadvertised OCXO behavioral characteristics. With this knowledge, the designer is better able to anticipate and successfully solve problematic timing issues.

Subjective element, as an essential and inseparable component of the
formation of customary international law rules-besides the objective element
(practice)-has always been one of the most controversial debates in the
international law arena. In spite of the fact that the theoretical contentions
about this topic have progressed densely and different schools have followed
their own approaches, however, it seems that the dominant doctrine, by
relying on the international judicial practice, has successfully clarified it.
Explanation of the subjective element concept and its necessity in the
process of the formation of the rule, alongside the analysis of its nature has
always been an important part of the debates over the customary
international law.

Network coordinates facilitate delay estimation in largescale networks. In particular, they support the creation of peer-to-peer-based desktop grid overlay structures. Landmark-based approaches to computing such coordinates have gained widespread acceptance in recent years. Several of these approaches produce coordinates by solving sequences of nonlinear unconstrained optimization problems. Apparently, Simplex Downhill has been the preferred method for solving such problems in the network coordinates context. In this paper, we propose a replacement for this algorithm. Our method works more accurately than Simplex Downhill and refrains from imposing additional requirements on the objective function.

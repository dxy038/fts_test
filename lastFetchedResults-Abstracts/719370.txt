This research is about the relationship between principals'
personality characteristics and their effectiveness in Sarab
guidance and high schools during 2004 - 2005.
The statistical population consisted of 290 teachers and 27
managers. The sampling metod was random stratified. For data
gathering we used two types of questionnaires with 0.94
reliability.
In this research,7 hypotheses were tested by (t-test), and the
correlation coefficient and the results indicate there is a
meaningful difference between the effectiveness of the
principals with warmhearted and coldhearted personalities, and
also between the effectiveness of the principals with suspicious
and trustful personalities.
But there is no meaningful correlation between the principals'
effectiveness and objective thought and, there is no meaningful
difference between the male and female principals'
effectiveness.

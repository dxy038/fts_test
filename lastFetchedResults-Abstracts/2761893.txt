The objective of this paper is to experimentally determine a relationship between an anode spot formation threshold current <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$I_{rm th}$</tex></formula> and a dynamic solid angle in drawn vacuum arcs subjected to axial magnetic fields (AMFs). Experiments are performed in a demountable vacuum chamber, in which a Helmholtz coil is installed coaxially with a pair of butt type contacts. Dynamic solid angle <formula formulatype="inline"> <tex notation="TeX">$Omega$</tex></formula> is related to arcing process, which is subtended by the anode from the cathode center or by a ratio of the anode diameter <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$D$</tex></formula> to the contact separation length <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$l$</tex></formula> as arc extinguishes <formula formulatype="inline"> <tex notation="TeX">$(D/l)$</tex></formula> in a drawn vacuum arc. Although a traditional definition of solid angle <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$(D/g)$</tex></formula> is related to a fixed full contact gap <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$g$</tex></formula>, no arcing process is considered. In the experiments, butt type contacts are used with contact material CuCr25 (25% Cr), and the contact diameters <formula formulatype="inline"> <tex notation="TeX">$D$</tex></formula> are 12, 25, 40, 60, and 80 mm. The contact separation length <formula formulatype="inline"> <tex notation="TeX">$l$</tex></formula> as arc extinguished is controlled in a range of 12&#8211;24 mm determined by an opening velocity with an arcing time fixed at 10 ms. A dc AMF is applied to the pair of contact with the flux density <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$B_{rm AMF}$</tex></formula> adjusted from 0 to 122 mT. Arc current in the tests is at a range of 0&#8211;30 kA rms at 50 Hz. The results show that anode spot formation threshold current <formula formulatype="inline"><t- notation="TeX" x="">$I_{rm th}$</t-></formula> is linearly dependent on the dynamic solid angle <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$D/l$</tex></formula> adjusted either by <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$D$</tex> </formula> or <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$l$</tex></formula>, respectively. And the threshold current <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$I_{rm th}$</tex></formula> is also linearly dependent on the AMF flux density <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$B_{rm AMF}$</tex></formula> applied. Contact diameter <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$D$</tex></formula> shows more significant influence on the threshold current <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$I_{rm th}$</tex></formula> than the contact separation length <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$l$</tex></formula> as arc extinguished. In a given contact diameter <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$D$</tex></formula> and contact separation length <formula formulatype="inline"> <tex notation="TeX">$l$</tex></formula> as arc extinguished, there is a critical peak arc voltage value, at which an anode spot first formed, regardless of arc current <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$I_{rm arc}$</tex></formula> and AMF flux density <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="TeX">$B_{rm AMF}$</tex></formula> applied.

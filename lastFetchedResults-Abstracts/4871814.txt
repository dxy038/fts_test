The increasing requirements on cloud computing entail building up large numbers of large-scale data centers which require a surprising amount of energy. With the gradual depletion and price escalation of traditional energy, operating data center in an energy efficient way is an emerging urgent problem. However, most existing researches of resource allocation in datacenter did not take into full consideration how to decrease energy consumption. In this paper, we formulate the energy efficiency virtual resource allocation for cloud computing as a multi-objective optimization problem, which is then solved by intelligent optimization algorithm. The simulation results reveal that the strategy can successfully generate schedule scheme of different numbers of servers-VMs with diverse characteristics in a reasonable time period and decrease the total operating energy of data center effectively.

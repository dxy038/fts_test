Experiencing an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may provoke a range of negative emotional responses, including acute distress and fear of dying. The frequency of these emotional states has rarely been assessed. This study examined the presence and severity of the fear of dying and acute distress in 184 patients with ACS and analyzed its correlates and consequences. Intense distress and fear of dying was reported by 40 patients (21.7%) and moderate fear and distress by 95 patients (51.6%). Intense distress and fear was associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR] 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07 to 2.49), lower levels of education (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.02 to 5.87), greater chest pain (OR 5.33, 95% CI 1.40 to 20.4), and emotional upset in the 2 hours before onset of ACS (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.13 to 6.45). Having no acute distress or fear was more common in patients who exercised regularly (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.35 to 8.18) and who did not initially attribute the chest pain to cardiac causes (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.10 to 6.47). No association was found with cardiovascular disease history, objective measures of clinical severity, or with clinical presentation of ACS. Acute distress and fear of dying predicted greater depression and anxiety 1 week after ACS (p = 0.006), and elevated levels of depression at 3 months (p = 0.009), after adjustment for age, gender, and negative affect. In conclusion, distress and fear during the initial stages of an ACS may trigger subsequent depression and anxiety, thereby promoting poorer prognosis and greater morbidity with time.

The objective of this paper is to provide an efficient and yet simple method to encode the prediction error image of video sequences, based on a stochastic vector quantization (SVQ) approach that has been modified to cope with the intrinsic decorrelated nature of the prediction error image of video signals. In the SVQ scheme, the codewords are generated by stochastic techniques instead of being generated by a training set representative of the expected input image as is normal use in VQ. The performance of the scheme is shown for the particular case of segmentation-based video coding although the technique can be also applied to motion-compensated hybrid coding schemes

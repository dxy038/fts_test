The objective is to explore the impact of computer-supported reorganization of oral anticoagulation treatment follow-up in a multi-year, multi-clinic pilot study. The focus is on how changes in workflow, namely in anticoagulation workload distribution between nurses and physicians, interact with the quality of care immediately after initial deployment and then later on during the pilot study. The results show that decreases in the physicianÂ´s time allocation did not result in a lessened quality of care during periods after reorganization.

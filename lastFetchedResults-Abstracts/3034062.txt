MINERVA (Monitoring by Interferometric SAR of Environmental Risk in Volcanic Areas) is a small scale service demonstration project financed by ESA in the Data User Programme framework. The objective of the project is the design, development and assessment of a demonstrative information service based on the interferometric processing of images from the ASAR instruments on board ERS1/2 and ENVISAT-I. The system is based on a new approach for the processing of INSAR data, which allows to optimize the quality of interferograms spanning from 35 days up to several years, and to merge them to generate a single solution describing the temporal evolution of the ground deformations in the examined risk area. The system allows to update this solution each time a new SAR image is available, and constitutes therefore an innovative tool for monitoring of the ground displacements in risk areas.

Multiple targeted agents are now available for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Although targeted agents offer improvements over previous treatments and significantly prolong progression-free survival, most patients eventually experience disease progression. For these patients, sequential treatment with multiple lines of therapy may afford sustained clinical benefit. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFr-TKIs) are recommended as first-line therapy for most patients with mRCC. Current clinical practice guidelines uniformly recommend treatment with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus after initial VEGFr-TKI failure. Recent results of the AXIS phase 3 trial demonstrated improved efficacy with second-line axitinib compared with sorafenib in patients who progressed on a variety of first-line therapies, including the VEGFr-TKI sunitinib. Available clinical evidence, individual patient profile, and toxicity concerns should be carefully evaluated when deciding whether to administer an mTOR inhibitor or a second VEGFr-TKI after progression on a first-line VEGFr-TKI. In patients who progress on a VEGFr-TKI and an mTOR inhibitor, retrospective analyses indicate that treatment with a second VEGFr-TKI in the third-line setting provides additional clinical benefit. Recent results from a prospective phase 1/2 trial indicate that third-line therapy with the investigational TKI, dovitinib, may have promising efficacy in patients who progress on a VEGFr-TKI and an mTOR inhibitor; a phase 3 trial of dovitinib versus sorafenib in this patient population is ongoing. This review discusses and evaluates current clinical evidence for sequential therapy with targeted agents in patients with mRCC.

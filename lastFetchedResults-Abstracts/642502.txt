Objective
Dietary saturated fatty acids are associated with coronary disease. Conversely, dietary monounsaturated polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) seem to exert a protective effect. This study evaluated the lipid profile of rats fed high-fat (HF) diets, with fat added as different sources of PUFA (flaxseed and trout), MUFA (peanut), and saturated fatty acid (chicken skin).
Methods

Adult male Wistar rats were placed into six dietary groups (n = 10): control (normal); high fat, with 1% cholesterol, 10% soy oil, and 5% lard; and four groups fed similar HF diets, with 10% lipid as trout, flaxseed, peanut, or chicken skin. After 28 d the animals were killed. Blood, livers, and adipose tissue samples were collected.
Results

A higher level (P < 0.05) of total serum cholesterol was observed in rats fed the normal diet (93.57 ± 14.95 mg/dL) compared with those fed the HF diet (67.57 ± 12.54 mg/dL). Total cholesterol levels in rats fed the flaxseed diet were lower (P < 0.05) than in rats fed the other fats. No difference was observed in cholesterol levels between groups fed the peanut and chicken skin diets (P > 0.05). Animals fed the peanut diet showed decreased body weight gain than did animals in the other treatment groups. There were large lipid and cholesterol depositions in livers of rats fed the HF diet. Lipid deposition in adipose tissue followed the same dietary fatty acid profile, i.e., high levels of ω-3 PUFA in the flaxseed group, high levels of MUFA in the peanut and chicken skin groups and high levels of ω-6 PUFA in the trout group.
Conclusions

These data indicate that flaxseed is promising for dietary manipulation of hyperlipidemia.

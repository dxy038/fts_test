This paper addresses the problem of the insertion of irregular-shaped objects, such as logos or subtitles, in video signals in the compressed DCT domain. To achieve this objective, a different approach from the usual pixel domain compositing operation is adopted, in order to avoid the presence of undesired semi-transparent regions around the inserted objects. The transposition of this technique to the frequency domain is presented, as well as the inclusion of a logo insertion module in the architecture of a compressed domain video transcoder.

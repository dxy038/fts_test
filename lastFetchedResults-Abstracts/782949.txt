Background Psychiatric epidemiology can
further public health practice and inform mental health
policy through the development of methodologies that
provide rapid and cost efficient estimation of the prevalence
of mental disorders at the local, regional, and population
levels. Objective The aim of this study was to illustrate
an efficient method for the estimation of mental
disorder prevalence in population groups where no direct
prevalence data are available. This study demonstrated
a new method to extrapolate prevalences from a
national calibration survey to a target population where
no observations are available and sociodemographic
differences are prominent. Method We restricted the
ECA sample to full-time employed participants
(~10,500) and used the total active duty U. S.Army population
(~460,000) for illustration. Sociodemographic
data for the Army came from the official military database
(mid-year 2000). Our logistic regression projections
represented an extension of sociodemographicdriven
synthetic methods used among demographers.
Outcomes were lifetime prevalences for 13 DIS/DSM
disorders. Results Compared to the ECA employed population,
extrapolations to the Army revealed lower/similar
estimates for nine of 13 DIS/DSM disorders. Projections
were twice as high for alcohol abuse/dependence
and antisocial personality, and one-third higher for social
phobia and schizophrenia in the Army. Estimates
compared favorably to one other military prevalence
study, and to results derived using traditional standardization/
adjustment methods based on the ECA sample
weighted to the working general population. Conclusions
The synthetic estimation technique using ECA
data to project lifetime prevalences for the U. S. Army
generated sound estimates while illustrating an attractive
method to extrapolate national data to demographically
diverse communities seeking policy-relevant data.

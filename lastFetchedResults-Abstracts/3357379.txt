The objective of this paper is towards reducing the impaired driving effect encountered so as to ensure the safety of passengers in a vehicle and towards ameliorating the security systems in case of vehicular theft action. The current practicing technologies for alcohol detection and theft control systems were discussed and the need for redesigning the alcohol sensor and theft control system was encountered. The choice for sensing material is the most important aspect for designing the alcohol sensor. From studies, Tin oxide was found to satisfy the requirements for alcohol detection in automobiles. Design for MEMS based alcohol sensor using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.4 can be performed. The role of immobilizer in security of in-vehicle communication was studied in depth and the need for mutual authentication between all its modules is required.

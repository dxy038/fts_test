Improving the quality of electric power supplies while controlling costs is the ambitious objective of Electricite de France. To achieve this, a focus on reliability in infrastructure and equipment from the specification stage onwards by EDF and in the manufacturing stage is a precondition. The authors present the new approach adopted by EDF for specifying future equipment in HV/MV substations by the user and manufacturers. This approach is based on methods already employed in other industrial fields, namely value analysis and dependability assessment, methods which require adaptation to the specific features of the MV switchgear

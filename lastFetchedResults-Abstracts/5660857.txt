WiMAX is one of the most familiar broadband wireless access technologies that support multimedia transmission. IEEE802.16 Medium Access Control (MAC) covers a large area for bandwidth allocation and QoS mechanisms for various types of applications. Nevertheless, the standard lacks a MAC scheduling algorithm that has a multi-dimensional objective of satisfying QoS requirements of the users, maximizing system utilization and ensuring fairness among users. So we are proposing a novel Scheduling Algorithm using Fuzzy logic and Artificial neural networks that addresses these aspects simultaneously. The initial results show that a fair amount of fairness is attained while keeping the priority intact. Results also show that maximum channel utilization is achieved with a negligible increment in processing time.

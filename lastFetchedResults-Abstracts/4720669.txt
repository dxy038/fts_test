This paper deals with the minimization of the total system cost in the PCS network using CDMA cellular system standard. The total system cost includes the installation costs of base stations (BS), base station controllers (BSC) and PCS exchanges (PCX), the weighted-distance connection costs between BS and BSC and between BSC and PCX and the hard handoff cost. Our objective is to keep each of these costs at a minimum with guaranteed service performance. However, there exists a tradeoff property between these costs. Therefore, we use an efficient and effective searching technique, hierarchical genetic algorithms (HGA), which has the ability to handle multiobjective functions and various constraints and find multiple different solutions for decision making

We consider a spectrum leasing system in which secondary networks offer offload services to a primary network (PN) in exchange of temporary access to the PN´s spectrum. When the SANs collude and coordinate their prices, forming a cartel, the PN experiences cartel overcharge, which in our scenario implies lower transmission rates for the serviced PUs. To protect the spectrum owner´s interests and possibly enforce market regulation, we propose an intervention framework in which an intervention device or manager (possibly with the authorization and/or supervision of an external regulatory agency) counteracts cartel formation. This framework exploits the specific features that make wireless systems different from conventional markets, enabling the manager to modify the set of achievable outcomes. The intervention capability is limited, so the objective is to design an intervention rule which is maximizes the PN transmission rate within the given constraints.

This paper studies a single-hop wireless multicast network with packet erasure channels. The objective is to evaluate the queuing stability properties in terms of the input rate in a network coded system. The concept of virtual queue is used for each receiver and a packet transmission scheduling algorithm is proposed. Our main goal is to have a stable queuing system with highest possible input rate. Therefore, we analyze queuing stability and find the maximum input rate under different scenarios. Our simulation results validate our analysis for each scenario. Then for delay sensitive data, we compare our proposed method with the case in which each packet has a Hard Deadline constraint.

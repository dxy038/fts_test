This paper presents a novel method for constructing special wavelet filter banks for optimal denoising of ultrasonic signals. It includes parameterisation of filter bank coefficients, design of the objective functions, and optimisation using the genetic algorithm. Using computer simulated ultrasonic signals, the performance of the wavelet filter banks constructed is compared with the classical wavelet filter banks to demonstrate its optimality.

The objective of this article is the development of a novel raw material mix proportion control algorithm for a cement plant raw mill, so as to maintain preset target mix proportion at the raw mill outlet. This algorithm utilizes one of the most basic and important tools of numerical linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD), for calculation of raw mix proportion. The strength of this algorithm has been verified by comparing the results of this method with that of the results of the QCX-software developed by F.L. Smidth of Denmark, a pioneer in cement plant automation, on a 2500 tons-per-day (tpd) dry process cement plant situated at Jayanthipuram, Andhra Pradesh, India

This article deals with a robust control scheme for a pneumatic servo system containing unknown possibly nonlinear uncertainties. Added to neglecting spool valve dynamics, it will be hypothesized that the temperature may vary from its nominal value within the variable volume chamber, resulting in some parameters sensitively changing. Obtained by a simpler feedback linearization, the linear plant is investigated by multi-objective synthesis of a PI controller. The design objective will be a mix of H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance minimization constrained on an appropriate closed-loop pole location. These conditions will be expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). This formulation is therefore numerically tractable via LMI optimization. So, simulation results are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed controller.

During the last couple of years, virtual communities (VCs) have gained worldwide popularity and conquer different domains, from business to medicine to aviation to education to entertainment to technology. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) proves to be a major catalyzer in the creation of software applications due to its rapid development, distributed feature and dynamic adaptability. Mediation systems (MS) on the other hand played a critical role in Service Oriented Computing (SOC) to promote loose coupling between service providers and consumers. Dynamic evolution, monitoring and management of services are critical factors that affect the lifespan of VCs. Moreover, providing the right service to the right user on the right time is an ultimate objective for VCs to achieve. We propose a new model that will serve virtual communities regardless of their types or objectives. The model is built on top of SOA and empowered with MS.

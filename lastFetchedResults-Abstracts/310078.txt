Objectives:
The aim of this study was to the investigate effect of tuberculosis infection on paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity and oxidative status in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).
Design and methods:
Twenty-five active PTB subjects and 33 healthy controls were included in the study. Serum PON1 activity, total oxidant status (TOS), lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) and total free sulfydryl (-SH) groups were determined.
Results:
Serum basal/salt-stimulated paraoxonase activities, arylesterase activity and total -SH group levels were significantly lower in patients with PTB than controls (p < 0.05, p < 0.05, p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively), while TOS and LOOH levels were significantly higher (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). In PTB patients, TOS, LOOH and total -SH group levels were significantly correlated with paraoxonase (r = − 0.371, p < 0.05; r = − 0.286, p < 0.05; r = 0.625 p < 0.01; respectively) and arylesterase (r = − 0.437, p < 0.01; r = − 0.352, p < 0.05; r = 0.653, p < 0.01; respectively).
Conclusions:
Patients with active PTB are exposed to potent oxidative stress and they have decreased PON1 activity. These predisposal factors may, in part, play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in PTB.

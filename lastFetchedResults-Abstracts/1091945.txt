
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Aeroallergens induce exacerbation of chronic urticaria. Skin prick test is a suitable test for detection of immediate reaction. The aim of this study was to detect the incidence of positive skin prick test to aeroallergens in patients with chronic urticaria.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done on patients with chronic urticaria during three years. After  taking history and physical examination of patients, laboratory tests including: CBC-diff, ESR, stool exam, thyroid test, CH50, C3, C4, IgE, ANA, simple urinary test, AST and ALT were done. We used aeroallergens including: Timothy, Bermuda, Maple, Nettle, Feather, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Cockroach, Grass mixed, Ash, Alder, Russian Thistle, Pigweed, Dermatophagoides Farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus with negative and positive tests on the forearm.	 The result was evaluated.
FINDINGS: From 78 cases with chronic urticaria, 23 (30%) were male and 55 (70%) were female. Their age was between 7 to 50 years old and the mean age was 30.43Â±11.27 years. Twelve (15%) patients had positive skin prick test to 9 allergens that 8 (10%) were male and 4 (5%) were female. Among positive skin prick tests, 9 of 25 cases were related to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP) (36%) and 9 cases were related to Dermatophagoides farinae (DF) (36%). 
CONCLUSION: The results showed that mites are more common in chronic urticaria.

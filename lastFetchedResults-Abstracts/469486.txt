Objective
The purpose of this study was to use a decision-analytic approach to explore the best strategy for the timing of the delivery of preterm intrauterine growth-restricted fetuses.
Study design
We constructed a decision-analysis model that compared 4 antenatal fetal testing strategies The fetal/neonatal states that were compared included live in utero pregnancy; fetal death; neonatal death; disabled neonate, and healthy neonate. Probability estimates for these states and sensitivity and specificity for Doppler velocimetry and biophysical profile were derived from literature review. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the baseline assumptions.
Results
Under the baseline assumptions, biophysical profile was the best test to guide decisions on delivery. Sensitivity analyses revealed the model to be sensitive only to the specificity of a biophysical profile <82%.
Conclusion
Compared with the other options, biophysical profile was the best strategy to guide physicians on the timing of the delivery of the preterm growth-restricted fetus.

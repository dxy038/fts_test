Nowadays, the increasing energy demand and the limited reserves of the conventional sources have raised the concerns of the researchers all around the globe to look for alternative resources. In addition to the rising demand concerns, the environmental concerns have led to the emergence of green power technologies in energy sector. Green power technologies include the power generation from clean and inexhaustible sources like solar energy, wind energy, hydro, biomass, etc. Hybrid renewable energy systems comprising of two or more renewable energy sources have been proposed to overcome the limitations of individual energy sources and make the system more reliable and less costly. The main point of consideration, while designing the hybrid system, is the sizing of different components. In this paper, a PV/Wind/Biomass hybrid system has been considered for supplying an electrical load in a remote area. An optimal configuration of different renewable energy system has been obtained. The optimal configuration has been determined by taking the total cost as the objective function. The optimization is then done through optimization software of Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER). The results obtained.

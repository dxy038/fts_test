The main objective of this study is to present new method on the basis of genetic algorithms
for attenuation relationship determination of horizontal peak ground acceleration and spectral
acceleration. The proposed method employs the optimization capabilities of genetic algorithm
to determine the coefficients of attenuation relationships of peak ground and spectral
accelerations. This method has been applied to 361 Iranian earthquake records with
magnitudes between 4.5 and 7.4 obtained from two seismic zones, namely Zagros and
Alborz-Central Iran. The obtained results indicated that the proposed method can be
characterized as a powerful tool for prediction horizontal peak ground and spectral
accelerations.

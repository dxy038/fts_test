Recently, a new advanced service-oriented networked manufacturing model: Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) has been proposed. The optimal allocation of computing resources (OACR) for the whole life-circle of manufacturing is an important part of CMfg. In order to implement optimal allocation, A new model for the computing resources and manufacturing tasks in CMfg is presented in this study, in which both the computation and communication factors are considered, and the formalized description on their dynamic process is given out. Primary constraints were introduced and the optimal objective of the model was proposed. Then the standard genetic algorithm (GA) was introduced to OACR. Experiments illustrated the effect of the constraints on the model and the application of GA on this problem.

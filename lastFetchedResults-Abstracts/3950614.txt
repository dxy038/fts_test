A novel resonant switch and a family of zero-current and zero-voltage mixed-mode switching quasi-resonant converters (QRCs) called single-cycle resonant converters (SCRCs) are proposed to improve the performance of the conventional QRCs. The SCRCs, which include two active switches operated with zero-current switching (ZCS) and zero-voltage switching (ZVS), respectively, show very simple operation and ease of control and analysis, and they overcome the limited load range characteristics of the conventional ZCS QRCs. The SCRCs can be applied even for a high-frequency AC chopper by replacing unidirectional switches with bidirectional ones. Steady-state operation and characteristics of the buck-type SCRCs are analyzed and compared with those of the buck-type full-wave QRC (FW-QRC). Experimental results at a a 200 kHz, 1 kW level are shown to verify the operational principle and characteristics

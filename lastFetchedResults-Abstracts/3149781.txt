Scientific flood operation is great significant for flood resources utilization in the flood season. In the present study, a fuzzy optimization model was proposed to choose the optimum flood dispatch scheme. Thereinto, objective weight was calculated base on entropy coefficient to collect the available data of all alternatives, and subjective weight was also considered by the combination with objective weight linearly. The proposed approach was demonstrated by the application in Huanren reservoir, Hun river, China. The results shows that the approach is feasible and practical. In addition, the optimum alternative is possibly different when the weights of index changes.

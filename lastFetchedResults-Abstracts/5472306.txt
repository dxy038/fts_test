A general method for Grey Fuzzy Robust Optimization Design of High-dimension Multi-objective was presented based on sensitivity of designed variables and based on sensibility analysis to produce fuzzy objective functions, two models for Grey Fuzzy Robust Optimization Design of High-dimension Multi-objective were established. The fuzzy multi-objective optimization design was transformed into the general multiobjective optimization by &#194;&#191;-cut level method and the solutions were found directly with absolute degree of grey correlation. The optimal program was compiled with Genetic Optimization Toolbox of MATLAB7.5. A design example shows that the model constructed in this paper is feasible and practical.

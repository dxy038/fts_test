This paper aims to develop a quantitative and objective method to analyze and evaluate risks related to human factors in flight deck system. Firstly a detailed classification and causing analysis on human errors in flight deck was carried out basing on SHEL Model and IEEAM method; then an integrated risk evaluation solution was proposed out by using fuzzy and Delphi method together and the weight of each index was calculated out meanwhile. Finally it concluded that Operational knowledge and skill, Teamwork skill, Information management, Ergonomic design of equipments and Weather took the five largest weights to the five first-level indices respectively. This risk evaluation method was expected to be used in practice and provide effective support to control risks related to human factors in flight deck system.

This paper presents a creative method for pulse identification. It is based on extension set and dependent function to express the things and their relationship. The correlation between pulse parameters and pulse categories is illustrated through extension set and dependent degree matrix, offering a general means of setting-up of the dependent function in various parameters. The way to identify a pulse category given in this paper is creative and objective. It is of great help to objectify the process of traditional Chinese pulse diagnosis (TCPD).


Objective: Ecstasy, also known as 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), is a psychoactive recreational hallucinogenic substance and a major worldwide recreational drug. There are neurotoxic effects observed in laboratory animals and humans following MDMA use. MDMA causes apoptosis in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). Withdrawal signs are attenuated by treatment with the adenosine receptor (A2A receptor). This study reports the effects of  glutamyl cysteine synthetase (GCS), as an A2A receptor agonist, and succinylcholine (SCH), as an A2A receptor antagonist, on Sprague Dawley rats, both in the presence and absence of MDMA.
Materials and Methods:  In this experimental study, we used seven groups of Sprague Dawley rats (200-250 g each). Each group was treated with daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections
for a period of one week, as follows:
i. MDMA
(10 mg/kg); ii.
GCS (0.3 mg/kg); iii. SCH
(0.3 mg/kg); iv.
GCS + SCH (0.3 mg/kg each); v.
MDMA
(10 mg/kg) + GCS (0.3 mg/
kg);
vi.
MDMA
(10
mg/kg)
+
SCH
(0.3
mg/kg);
and
vi. normal
saline
(1
cc/kg)
as
the
sham

group.
Bax (apoptotic protein) and
Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein)
expressions
were
evaluated
by striatum using RT-PCR
and Western
blot analysis. 
Results: There was a significant increase in Bax protein expression in the MDMA+SCH group and a significant decrease in Bcl-2 protein expression in the MDMA+SCH group (p < 0.05).  
Conclusion: A2A receptors have a role in the apoptotic effects of MDMA via the Bax and Bcl-2 pathways. An agonist of this receptor (GCS) decreases the cytotoxcity of MDMA, while the antagonist of this receptor (SCH) increases its cytotoxcity.

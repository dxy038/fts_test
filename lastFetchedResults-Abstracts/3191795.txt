The main objective of this study is to find relationships among IP management strategies, innovative outputs and firms´ performance. In measuring the effect of IP management strategies, we investigated firms in Korean manufacturing industries focusing on the relationship between IP management strategies and financial performance after categorizing the level of IP management. Our empirical results signify that i) firm´s IP management strategy positively affects their innovative outputs, and ii) patents and trademarks have a positive effect on enhancing the financial performances of firms whilst industrial designs do not have. Large firms showed a noticeably strong linkage between the IP management level and innovative outputs by using robust IP management frameworks.

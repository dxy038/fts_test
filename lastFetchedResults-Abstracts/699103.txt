The objective of this research was to compare enhanced coagulation with anion exchange for removal of disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors (i.e. natural organic matter (NOM) and bromide). Treatment with a magnetic ion exchange resin (MIEXÂ®) was the primary focus of this study. Raw waters from four utilities in California were evaluated. The waters had low turbidity, low to moderate organic carbon concentrations, a wide range of alkalinities, and moderate to high bromide ion concentrations. The treated waters were compared based on removal of ultraviolet (UV) absorbance, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP), and haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP). The results indicated that treatment with MIEX is more effective than coagulation at removing UV-absorbing substances and DOC. Treatment with MIEX and treatment with MIEX followed by coagulation yielded similar results, suggesting that coagulation of MIEX-treated water does not provide additional removal of organic carbon. MIEX treatment reduced the THMFP and HAAFP in all waters, and did so to a greater extent than coagulation. Treatment with MIEX was most effective in raw waters having a high specific UV absorbance and a low anionic strength. Following MIEX treatment, subsequent chlorination resulted in a shift to the more brominated THM and HAA species as compared to chlorination of the raw water. MIEX also removed bromide to varying degrees, depending on the raw water alkalinity and initial bromide ion concentration.

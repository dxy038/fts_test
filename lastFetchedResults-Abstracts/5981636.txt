In-body implanted antennas are surrounded by materials (muscle, fat tissue, skin, etc.), which have special electromagnetic parameters. The effects of these near-field mediums on the implanted antenna are unknown. The objective of this study was to empirically model these effects in case of using monopole or dipole antennas embedded in cylindrically stratified mediums, and to determine the total wavelength shortening and the effective dielectric constant sensed by the antenna. The study connects to biomedical development projects, as well as to RF technique principles.

In this paper, the design of an MIMO antenna system for WIFI gateway application is proposed. 8 printed monopole dual band antennas are placed on a 135&#215;135mm<sup>2</sup> FR-4 PCB. Placement of the elements is optimized to limit coupling effect. The objective of the system is to combine the MIMO technique and antenna diversity to increase data rate performance. S-Parameters and radiation performances are presented. A new measurement method based on EVM and BER criteria is proposed to characterize the antenna system in a realistic environment.

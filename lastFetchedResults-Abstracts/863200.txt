We present a fluid queue model driven by two independent finite state birth–death
processes with the objective to study the buffer occupancy distribution in any intermediate
node in a communication network. In a communication network, at any node, the arrival
and service of the packets are with variable rates. To model this scenario we develop a fluid
queue with an infinite capacity buffer which receives fluid at variable rate and also releases
fluid at variable rates. Because of variable inflow and outflow rates of the fluid, the proposed
fluid queue is driven by the current states of two independent finite state birth–death
processes evolving in the background which on merging give rise to a continuous time
Markov chain which is not a birth–death process. Using the fluid queue model, we obtain
the steady-state distribution of the buffer occupancy at any intermediate node during
packet transmission in a communication network. As a special case, we consider a wireless
network based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. We present the buffer occupancy distribution
at any intermediate node in closed form with a numerical illustration. Along with buffer
occupancy distribution, we also obtain various performance measures such as expected
buffer content, average throughput, server utilization and mean delay which are relevant
to packet transmission in such a communication network. Finally, we present numerical
results to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed model. The results are in accordance
with the expected behavior of these performance measures.

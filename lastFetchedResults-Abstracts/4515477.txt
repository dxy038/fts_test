This paper presents a new formulation for sectionalizing device placement taking into consideration outages, maintenance and investment costs. The formulation of sectionalizing switches is a combinatorial constrained optimization problem with a non-linear, non-differentiable objective function. A solution methodology based on the optimization technique of genetic algorithm, GA is proposed to determine both the number of sectionalizing switches, and the locations of switches. A new form of GA is introduced and called as hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA). HGA can offer a global optimal solution for the sectionalizing device placement problem. The proposed solution is a new structure of generation that guarantee an optimal solution for the output Test results have been presented to support the superiority of the proposed approach.

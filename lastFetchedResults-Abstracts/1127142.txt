The objective of this paper is to study the improvement in the seismic behavior
of concrete gravity dams by optimization of concrete mechanical properties. The criteria to
measure the improvement have been: 1) reduction in the extent of cracks and 2) increase
in the amount of time dams are able to tolerate earthquakes before failure. The mechanical
properties considered have included the density and modulus of elasticity of concrete.
The Pine Flat Dam has been selected for this numerical study. During a high intensity
earthquake, dams enter a nonlinear phase, where the cracks open and close repeatedly.
A smeared crack model has been used for simulation of nonlinearity. For the purpose
of optimization, the dam has been divided into horizontal layers, where the concrete is
assumed to have the same properties at every point within each layer. The results of this
study have shown that by using lower density concrete in upper layers and in the region
of the crest of the Pine Flat Dam, it is possible to both reduce the extent of the induced
cracks and increase the time to failure of the dam. The same methodology can be applied
to other concrete gravity dams.

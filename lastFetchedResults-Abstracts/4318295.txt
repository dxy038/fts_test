The traceability is a means to minimize the size of recalls and the production process. It is an emergent topic of research to improve the production efficiency. Some governments force the traceability on companies like a management tool of the risks in order to protect the public health. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the RFID and WSN on traceability. We presented a categorization of traceability methods in this paper and we simulated a model of cold chain traceability to focus on RFID and WSN efficiency. Results show that these technologies decrease the inventory period and the numbers of recalls by decreasing the number of withdraw of foods.

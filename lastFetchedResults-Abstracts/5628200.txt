A new digital control technique for power factor correction is presented. The main novelty of the method is that there is no current sensor. Instead, the input current is digitally rebuilt, using the estimated input current for the current loop. Apart from that, the ADCs used for the acquisition of the input and output voltages have been designed ad-hoc. Taking advantage of the slow dynamic behavior of these voltages, almost completely digital ADCs have been designed, leaving only a comparator and an RC filter in the analog part. The final objective is obtaining a low cost digital controller which can be easily integrated in an ASIC along with the controller of paralleled and subsequent power sections.

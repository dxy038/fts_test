More "green" power provided by distributed generation will enter into the European electricity network in the near future. In order to control the power flow and to ensure proper and secure operation of this future grid, with an increased level of the renewable power, new power electronic converters for grid connection of renewable sources will be needed. These power converters must be able to provide intelligent power management as well as ancillary services. This paper assesses a control method based on the stationary reference frame with proportional-resonant current controllers for a multi-level cascaded H-bridges power converter used for grid applications. The proposed method is tested in terms of harmonic content in the point of common coupling (PCC), voltage amplitude and frequency excursions as well as system response for bidirectional power flow<i>.</i>

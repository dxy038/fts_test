This paper describes a plan to enhance the dynamic systems and automatic controls component of the mechanical engineering curriculum at Kansas State University. The plan requires modification of existing courses and introduction of new courses and a laboratory. The objective is to prepare our engineering graduates to design dynamic physical systems which include intelligent sensors and actuators and embedded control systems. The planned changes are presented in contrast to our present curriculum. Modification of two courses and the addition of two courses are described. A new integrated control systems laboratory which will serve the two new and modified courses is detailed. Seven experimental systems are being built by teams of undergraduate honors research students. The development plan of the courses and labs is presented. This paper provides the details of the experimental equipment, the nature of the technology being disseminated, and the visions behind the development direction taken to realize the laboratory

A new error concealment method based on optical flow is proposed, as a post-processing tool at the decoder side to recover the lost information during the video transmission. The conventional error concealment methods often result in blocking effects because of inaccurate motion vectors estimation. We use the attractive property of optical flow technique on motion estimation to recover the lost block in pixel wise manner. To increase the convergence, we use fuzzy rule to construct the step size. Simulation results show that the proposed method can recover the higher quality image on both subjective visual evaluation and objective numerical metrics, comparing to the existing error concealment methods.

This paper investigates the dynamic spectrum management (DSM) problem in mixed asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) CO/RT deployments. A new distributed DSM algorithm is developed with an objective of enlarging the achievable rate region. The results show that the new algorithm achieves significant performance gains over the existing distributed DSM algorithm iterative water-filling (IW). Simulation results also show that the proposed algorithm enlarges the rate region in the upstream transmission of very-high bit-rate digital subscriber lines (VDSL) systems

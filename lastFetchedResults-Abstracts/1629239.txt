The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of Aloe vera gel incorporation at different proportions on chitosan-based films. Consequently, the thickness of films was affected significantly by the addition of the gel and decreased from F0 (plain chitosan film) to F50 (the film containing 50% gel). The gel incorporation did not have a considerable effect on water vapor permeability (WVP); however, a significant difference was observed for F50. Addition of the gel significantly improved the water solubility (WS), wherein the F10 (the film with 10% of gel) showed the lowest. All mechanical properties increased by introducing the gel and, after reaching the peak for F20, started to reduce. Color properties were affected by the gel addition as the higher the gel, the darker the films. Overall, the results showed that incorporating the gel into film-forming solution of chitosan up to 20% (F20) was promising.

This study compared emotional intelligence and identity styles of women with major depression disorder and normal women. Therefore 60 women who were diagnosed as major depression were selected from clients of a consultancy center in 2011 (1390s.c.) and also 60 female students of "Islamic Azad University, science and research branch of Tehran" who were not so diagnosed were conveniently selected. Measurement tools consisted of Emotional Intelligence Scale (Bar-On, 1997) and Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status (Bennion & Adams, 1986). Results of Pearson correlation coefficient and MANOVA showed significant differences between depressed and normal women in the levels of emotional intelligence (P < 0.001) and identity styles (P < 0.001). Also, the relationship between emotional intelligence and identity status of each group, separately was significant (P < 0.001). This study suggests the importance and significance of the relationship between emotional intelligence and identity style in explaining depression. The results may be used in prevention and treatment programs.

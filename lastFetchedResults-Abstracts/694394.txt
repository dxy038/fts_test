Rapid oxidation and accretion of iron onto high surface area media has been investigated as a potential passive treatment option for ferruginous, net-alkaline minewaters. Two pilot-scale reactors were installed at a site in County Durham, UK. Each 2.0 m high cylinder contained different high surface area plastic trickling filter media. Ferruginous minewater was fed downwards over the media at various flow-rates with the objective of establishing the efficiency of iron removal at different loading rates. Residence time of water within the reactors was between 70 and 360 s depending on the flow-rate (1 and 12 l/min, respectively). Average influent total iron concentration for the duration of these experiments was 1.43 mg/l (range 1.08–1.84 mg/l; n=16), whilst effluent iron concentrations averaged 0.41 mg/l (range 0.20–1.04 mg/l; n=15) for Reactor A and 0.38 mg/l (range 0.11–0.93 mg/l; n=16) for Reactor B. There is a strong correlation between influent iron load and iron removal rate. Even at the highest loading rates (approximately 31.6 g/day) 43% and 49% of the total iron load was removed in Reactors A and B, respectively. At low manganese loading rates (approximately 0.50–0.90 g/day) over 50% of the manganese was removed in Reactor B. Iron removal rate (g/m3/d) increases linearly with loading rate (g/day) up to 14 g/d and the slope of the line indicates that a mean of 85% of the iron is removed. In conclusion, it appears that the oxidation and accretion of ochre on high surface area media may be a promising alternative passive technology to constructed wetlands at certain sites.

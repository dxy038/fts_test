Two new cell lines from human renal cell carcinoma are reported. Primary cell cultures from 75 consecutive cases of nephrectomy and metastatic surgery due to different stages of RCC during 4 years were studied. Two cell cultures could be propagated for more than 50 passages in vitro. HN4 was derived from a grade III clear cell carcinoma. HN51 originated from a metastatic brain lesion of a clear cell carcinoma grade III. Karyotype analyses of HN4 revealed triploidy with a clonal aberration, der(10)t(3;10)(q13;p12). HN51 also had a triploid pattern with different marker chromosomes but without any clonal aberration. Loss of heterozygosity studies revealed no loss of heterozygosity on 3p or other chromosomal markers in HN4 but LOH was found on one 3p marker and one 14q marker in addition to all 17 p and q markers in HN51. In vitro light microscopy showed distinctly different morphology in the two cell lines although they both had a typical epithelial growth pattern. Doubling times in vitro were low but slightly higher for HN51. Repeated tumorigenenic experiments in athymic mice only gave rise to subcutaneous tumors with HN51. On characterization by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the two cell lines exhibited different polypeptide patterns with higher expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in HN51 and higher expression of glutathione-S-transferase in HN4 constituting the most prominent differences.

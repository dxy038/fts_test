In this paper, the synchronization control problem is considered for the delayed hybrid-coupled heterogeneous networks, i.e., complex networks with nonidentical dynamical nodes. Some effective control schemes are designed under which the whole network is globally asymptotically synchronized to an arbitrary objective trajectory. By imposing the open-loop control on the whole network together with the feedback control only on a small fraction of the nodes, an easy-to-verify sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the asymptotic synchronization of the complex network under study. Furthermore, to decrease the feedback control gains, the idea of adaptive control scheme is combined together, and the verified conditions are further weakened. Finally, by introducing the impulses to the open-loop network and using the improved Halanay inequality, other novel synchronization criteria are developed for the complex network. Comparisons of the obtained theoretical results as well as the detail pinning schemes are also given. Numerical examples of the undirected scale-free network and the directed small-world network are illustrated to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed theoretical results.

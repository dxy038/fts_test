The objective of this paper is to adapt minimal shift counters to frequency division and other applications that require only an indication that a counter has gone through a complete cycle. These applications place no requirement on the coding of the states in the cycle. The indication that a counter has completed a cycle is implemented with a minimum-fan-in AND gate to preserve the high speed and small area that distinguish minimal shift counters.

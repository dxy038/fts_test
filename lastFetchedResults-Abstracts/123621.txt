 Business process reengineering (BPR) is a phenomenon in which through radical process redesign, some companies have achieved large scale improvements. However according to surveys more than 70 percent of firms face failure in BPR movements, due to high degree of risk and lack of coordination among involved peoples including actors, beneficiaries, and victims.
One of the main reasons for that is high degree of resistance among the people those who face the real shock. Most BPR projects follow a top-down approach encouraging the human being across the firm to raise themselves against the project which makes BPR a tough challenge. The aim of this research is to develop a new methodology for BPR using MBO (management by objective) to help BPR overcome the cultural difficulties and resistance among the employees, in accepting the changes.
To bring success to BPR projects, the employee must be thoroughly informed about the mission, objectives and goals of the movement .Organizational goal as well as individual goal must be announced, set and aligned in one direction.
BPR by MBO approach would facilitate employee involvement in change programs and help the BPR methodologies to overcome the weaknesses they face in terms of goal setting programs.
In this research with considering BPR and MBO methodologies, a goal-oriented BPR model will be introduced which mixes both the methodologies to achieve the goals and objectives through BPR in organization using BPR & MBO interface to reduce the degree of resistance among employee and reach the mutual understanding between the top management and employees.

Background and objectives: Withania coagulans Dunal (Solanaceae) fruits are recommended to treat asthma, dyspepsia, biliousness, flatulent colic, liver complaints, intestinal infections, strangury, wounds and as diuretic, emetic and sedative agent in Indian traditional system of medicine. The objective of this study was to describe the systematic fatty acid composition of the petroleum ether extract of W. coagulans fruits. Methods: Petroleum ether extract of W. coagulans fruits was prepared by maceration. Components of the W. coagulans petroleum ether extract were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and their concentrations were determined. Results: The fixed oil of W. coagulans fruits constituted of twenty nine components including unsaturated (52.36%) and saturated (22.15%) fatty acids, alkenes (5.65%), phytosterols (4.39%), fatty alcohols (4.14%), aromatic acid (3.56%), monoterpenes (3.22%), triterpenoids (1.83%) and alkanes (2.7%). Most of the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were identified as their methyl esters. Conclusions: Palmitoleic and 11-eicosenoic acids have been reported for the first time in petroleum ether extract of the W. coagulans fruits. The present study has illustrated the chemical nature of W. coagulans fruit and described its fatty acids composition.

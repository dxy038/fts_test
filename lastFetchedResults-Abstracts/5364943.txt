The electrical stapedius reflex (ESR) threshold, detected by eardrum acoustic impedance change, is strongly correlated with cochlear implant recipientsÂ´ behavioral comfort levels. However reports suggest acoustic impedance changes are not detectable in 30-40% of patients. The goals of this study were to develop an animal model and investigate the characteristics of the stapedius muscle electromyogram (SEMG) elicited by a cochlear implant, as an alternative measure of ESR activation. Bipolar tungsten micro wire electrodes recorded the SEMG signal from the stapedius muscle of 6 rats. The cochlea was implanted with a multichannel intracochlear electrode that delivered biphasic electrical pulses. Maximum SEMG potentials were 20-500 &#956;V (mean: 174 &#956;V) or 8-42 dB SNR (mean: 24 dB). The dynamic range of the responses that reached saturation were approximately 10 dB, with threshold inversely dependent on pulse-width and electrode separation. The electrical brainstem response (EABR) threshold was 5.6 dB lower than the ESR threshold on average, but the standard deviation was relatively high (2.4 dB), suggesting that these two signals could provide independent information for objective cochlear implant fitting. Post-operative SEMGs were recorded in several animals; including one animal for up to 63 days. The results suggest the overall feasibility of the approach for objective cochlear implant fitting.

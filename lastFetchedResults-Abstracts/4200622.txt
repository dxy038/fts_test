This paper presents an optimal power flow (OPF) solution based on maximizing distributed generator (DG) real power output with a restraint on network losses for radial and meshed distribution networks. The multi-objective nonlinear OPF problem with weighting terms for DG real power output and loss is linearized and solved by pure primal-dual interior point method. Besides explaining the basic algorithm, the paper concentrates on the determination of initial points and effective adjustment of barrier parameter to maintain accuracy and speed of convergence. The performance of the method is evaluated on two representative U.K distribution networks: a 12-bus rural upland meshed network where wind is prevalent and an 18-bus semi-urban radial feeder with two fossil fuel DGs. The results confirm that the developed OPF algorithm has the potential for network operation and implementation in an autonomous active network management system due to its ability to optimize different types of distribution network.

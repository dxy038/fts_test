This paper presents the problem of undetected shorts on IEEE 1149.1 compliant self-monitoring pins. Unidirectional and bidirectional self-monitoring pins may contain sufficient series termination resistance and low enough voltage swings such that shorts between two pins become resistively isolated from the receivers and therefore are undetected during wiring interconnect tests. Potential solutions to mitigate the problem are offered.

Most urban planners, especially in the structuralism school believe that different phenomena can not be a separate living space and studied independently of each other. So fundamental coherence theories of urban and regional habitat can be found in "systems theory" made clear. This study convinced that the balance of urban space in the system of Fars and Bushehr situation is what has been done. Considering the nature of the research question is whether the article in Bushehr and Fars regional urban systems, urban hierarchy have a balance of space, so the aim of this thesis research, and enriching the consistency week in studies seeking to obtain evidence objective regarding the balance of the urban system is studied in the range to be the basis to provide a suitable model of spatial organization of urban systems achieved. The research method chosen for theoretical research approach - in which the application of systems theory and methods of descriptive statistics, inferential and planning models are used. Community survey to measure relationships between cities population 8262 persons as research subjects were evaluated. Eventually  was  determined  that  due  to  the  relationship   mentioned  in  the  spatial   relationships  populations  incoming  and  outgoing  urban  centers  in  different   classes   amount  Chi   calculated   smaller   than  the  amount  of  Chi  Table  critical  points  is  likely  in a=0/5(Ho)is  zero  to  accept  and accepting the hypothesis of zero means is a hinge or system elements, and urban centers is not confirmed, but the facilities to operate independently of each other and you have integration and system integrity are not.

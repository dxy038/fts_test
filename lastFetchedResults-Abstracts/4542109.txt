The use of unidirectional constant frequency (CF) DC-DC power converter families based on quasi-resonant, quasi-square-wave (QSW), and multi-resonant topologies for bidirectional power conversion is proposed. The complete analysis and design considerations for bidirectional buck/boost CF-ZVS-QSW power converters are discussed in terms of switching and resonant frequencies, and switching and conduction losses. Experimental results supporting the proposed concept are included

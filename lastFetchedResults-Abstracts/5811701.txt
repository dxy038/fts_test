In this paper, we discuss the reconfiguration of optical WDM networks. The traffic due to the higher layers is dynamic, hence this necessitates reconfiguration of the optical network, in order to maximize the utilization of resources. Reconfiguration is carried out with the aim of minimizing the objective function and the number of lightpath changes. We take up the problem of minimizing the congestion in the network, thereby balancing the network load. Minimization of congestion is carried out with and without average weighted number of hops taken into consideration. It is assumed that wavelength converters are available at the routing nodes.

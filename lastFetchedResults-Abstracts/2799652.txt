The objective of the AccesSim project is to design a wheelchair simulator using Virtual Reality and a robotic platform to detect and illustrate accessibility issues in complex environments. In order to be efficient, the robotic platform must provide haptic and vestibular feedbacks to different profile of end users: urbanists to wheelchair users. It must be modular and adaptable to each one of them. In this paper we focus our robotic platform capable of adapting its configuration and feedback rendering based on the user. The design of the platform is described. The capacity of the platform to reproduce the motion of a wheelchair in a specific study case is tested experimen-tally. Finally the results introduce the possibility of adapting the dynamic feedback rendering based on a specific user and environmental situations.

In this paper, a group elevator scheduling (GES) method based on affinely adjustable robust optimization (AARO) is presented. The uncertain characteristics of elevator traffic flow and objective functions are analyzed. Then an uncertain GES model is established. An affine relationship between the elevator scheduling scheme and the uncertain traffic flow is constructed. And the uncertain GES model is transformed into its affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC). Simulation results show that the scheduling method has better scheduling performance than that of other scheduling methods.

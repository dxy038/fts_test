The paper develop a high performance circuit topology, modulation and control techniques to achieve high-power density, high frequency isolated DC/AC power conversion with single-stage power processing. The proposed bidirectional quasisingle-stage push-pull forward high frequency link inverter consists of a push-pull forward converter, a bidirectional active rectifier, an active clamp branch and a SPWM inverter bridge, and can get a good static performance. To achieve good dynamic response, an output voltage double closed-loop feedback is applied to the whole system. Another unique aspect of the design is the use of the TMS320LF2407A DSP and EPM7128 CPLD to control the inverter system. Theoretical analysis and experimental results referring to a laboratory prototype (1 kW) indicate that the proposed topology and control scheme are promising for the applications of DC/AC power source

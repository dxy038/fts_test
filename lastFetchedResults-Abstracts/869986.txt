In this paper, some new quality metrics concerning the evaluation of performances of biobjective optimization methods relating to the generation of the Pareto frontier are presented. A new metric for the calculation of the running speed of a multiobjective optimization method is also presented.
These metrics are tested on two biobjective scalarization functions (Weighted sum and Tchebychev aggregation of objective functions) handled by a metaheuristic (Simulated Annealing).

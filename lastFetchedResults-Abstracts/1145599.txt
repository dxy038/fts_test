Objective parameters for the evaluation of the Rudolfinum concert hall in Prague, Czech Republic are the focus of the present article. The measured results for Reverberation parameters, Energy parameters, Intelligibility parameters, and Spatial parameters of the buildingâ€™s two halls are presented and discussed including a comparison with recommended values or theory, as well as several unique architectural and acoustical qualities of the halls. The early lateral energy fraction parameter is measured by the intensity probe method discussed in the supplement. The performance is verified by tests in anechoic and reverberant rooms.

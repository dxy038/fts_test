In this paper, a new design methodology for determining the size, location, type and number of capacitors to be placed on a radial distribution system is presented. The objective is to minimize the peak power losses and the energy losses in the distribution system considering the capacitor cost. A sensitivity analysis based method is used to select the candidate locations for the capacitors. A new optimization method using a genetic algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal selection of capacitors. Test results have been presented along with the discussion of the algorithm

This paper presents an optimum design procedure for the coordinated tuning of rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC) controllers of grid connected doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine system. The RSC and GSC controller parameters are determined to optimize the performance indices. The performance indices considered are maximum peak overshoot (MPOS<sub>&#969;r</sub>), settling time (Tss<sub>&#969;r</sub>) of the generator speed and the maximum peak overshoot (MPOS<sub>Vdc</sub>), maximum peak undershoot (MPUS<sub>Vdc</sub>) and settling time (Tss<sub>Vdc</sub>) of DC link voltage. The sum squared error deviation of the dc link voltage and the generator speed is considered as the objective function. The constrained optimization problem is solved using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Simulations are performed on a sample system with DFIG based WECS. The effectiveness of the designed parameters using PSO is then compared with that obtained using simulated annealing (SA).

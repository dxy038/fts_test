Adaptive position control involving an induction motor system is considered in this paper. A small signal model for the induction motor is derived first. Then, a novel adaptive backstepping control design technique is proposed to achieve a position tracking objective under mechanical parameter uncertainties such as large variation of inertia, and disturbance of load torque. The proposed control design is overparameterization and singularity free, and allows a straightforward stability analysis. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the design

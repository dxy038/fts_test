<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate sexual function and its relationship with quality of life, and mental and physical health in pregnant women.<br /><strong>Materials and methods: </strong>Obtained results showed that 59 (39/3%) pregnant women were "very dissatisfied", 25 (16/7%) women were "moderately dissatisfied", 64 (42/7%) women were "both satisfied and unsatisfied", only 2 (1/3%) women were relatively satisfied, and no one was "very satisfied". There is a significantly negative weak correlation between female sexual function with anxiety and depression, while there is a significantly positive weak correlation between female sexual function with the general quality of life, psychological health and environment dimensions. Only depression predicts female sexual function significantly. The women more than 10 years passed of their marriage showed more sexual satisfaction compared to those less than 10 years passed of their marriage (p&lt; 0.05). The roles of predictive variables in sexual dissatisfaction, as well as the limitations for the study are discussed in the article.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Obtained results showed that 59 (39/3%) pregnant women were "very dissatisfied", 25 (16/7%) women were "moderately dissatisfied", 64 (42/7%) women were "both satisfied and unsatisfied", only 2 (1/3%) women were relatively satisfied, and no one was "very satisfied".

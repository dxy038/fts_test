A prototype of an object-oriented system implemented in CProlog is described. Its main objective is to demonstrate system features that would support efficient management of objects and object-oriented databases in a persistent and distributed environment. Mechanisms at the low level of the system were considered to support object distribution, mobility control and configuration management in a simple and uniform way. Objects exist in clusters which are transparent to the applications. The prototype is a framework for a self-organizing object-oriented distributed system

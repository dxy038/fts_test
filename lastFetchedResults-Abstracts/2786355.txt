Contactor pin is commonly used as the test tooling to enable million times of repeatability functional testing in manufacturing. Simulation should be performed before contactor sent for prototyping. The objective is to optimize the design according to device performance and avoid design faulty which may lead to higher testing cost. This paper introduces the methodology on contactor pin characterization specifically the pin inductance that are helpful for high speed tooling engineer to access their contactorÂ´s performances. The impact of the contactor pin design, topology and contactor housing design will be explained in this paper. Indirectly, this is to emphasize the importance of assessing the contactor by considering many design factors instead of assessing in ideal way. It is widely applicable to any electronic devices testing that need contactor.

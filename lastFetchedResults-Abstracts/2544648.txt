<p><strong><em>Background:</em></strong> Leishmaniasis is important vector-borne parasitic disease worldwide, caused by the genus <em>Leishmania</em>. The objective of the current study was to identify genetic polymorphism in <em>L. major</em>, one of the species causing cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), isolated from southeastern Iran, using Permissively Primed Intergenic Polymorphic-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PPIP-PCR) method.</p><p><strong><em>Methods:</em></strong> Overall, 340 patients with suspected CL were examined. They referred to the Central Laboratory in Chabahar, Iran during Apr 2013 to Feb 2014. Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained slides from lesions as well as aspirates cultured in Novy- Mac Neal-Nicolle (NNN) Media was employed in order to diagnose CL in these patients. Our analyses detected 86 suspected subjects as having CL from which 35 isolates were cultured successfully. PPIP-PCR method was performed on extracted genomic DNA from selected isolates in order to determine the genetic polymorphism among <em>L. major</em> isolates.</p><p><strong><em>Results:</em></strong> The electrophoresis patterns demonstrated two genetic profiles including A or A1 patterns between all samples tested. Frequency of A and A1 sub-types were 33 (94.3%) and two (5.7%), respectively.</p><p><strong><em>Conclusion:</em></strong> Both host and parasite factors may contribute to the clinical profile of human leishmaniasis in the endemic foci of the disease. Here we showed that genetic variations pertaining to the <em>Leishmania</em> parasites might determine, in part, the clinical outcomes of human leishmaniasis.Â </p>

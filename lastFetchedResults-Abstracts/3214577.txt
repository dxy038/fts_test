This paper makes an effort to present the major concerns with broadband over power lines technology and implementation roadmap for making the grid smarter. The paper also strives to emphasize upon the need to prepare ourselves for a timed roadmap for this technology which requires no new cabling or infrastructure, instead using the long established power grid provided by electrical companies. The authors have tried to gain attention of the readers, utilities, regulatories and all involved in power sector, IT sector and communication sector to look and analyse the potential of this technology for the future of smart grids. The objective of this paper is also to highlight on the technology in terms of its salient features, working, drawbacks, deployments and future challenges associated in the implementation plans. The suitability of BPL as a smart grid technology has been simulated and studied for an indoor feeder and the results are analyzed.

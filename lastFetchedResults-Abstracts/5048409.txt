This paper introduces and analyses the building of the INC standard with a STEP-NC extension based on the INC system theory. First it s does an introduction of the two sides of INC standard. And then the paper focuses on some important points which are relative to build up the INC standard. They are the building of INC interpreter, extended motion or control expression based on features, how to support bidirectional information flow and application of COM and RTDLL in INC to enhance the real-time performance. Finally it also gives a feasible method to get an INC file which contains the geometric information and machining information.

In contrast to traditional wireless sensor networks, where energy conservation is the main objective, next-generation wireless sensor networks will additionally demand guarantees in terms of delay, reliability and bandwidth. However, current sensor network protocols offer very limited QoS support. Moreover, the current research does not take into account the growing heterogeneous nature of sensor nodes and applications. Therefore, we present in this paper an adaptive modular QoS architecture (AMoQoSA), which uses several QoS techniques that can be activated according to the nodesÂ´ capabilities. This enables the network to dynamically adapt itself to the current network situation in order to continuously deliver optimal QoS guarantees in heterogeneous sensor networks.

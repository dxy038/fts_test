The objective of this study was to develop an educational program for preventing metallic mercury emissions due to the burning of mercury–gold amalgams inside houses. The main participants were adolescents from a school in the city of Poconé, State of Mato Grosso. The program was developed in five stages, including discussions of the methods and exhibition of slides showing people working in activities including the garimpos, planning activities as dramatizations, making posters and preparing a screenplay for the production of a video, discussing how to prevent indoor burning of gold–mercury amalgams, and a final evaluation of the adolescents about what they had learned during the program. The evaluation of the impact was done through a comparison of correct answers from a questionnaire before and after the development of the educational activities and by means of a comparison of urinary mercury in school students and a group of residents (women) at three different times: before the program (2.30 μg/L), 6 months after (2.90 μg/L), and 11 months after (1.49 μg/L).

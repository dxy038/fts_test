A PUBLIC RELATIONS WORKSHOP for Section Representatives was held on Tuesday afternoon. The meeting was opened by Fischer Black, chairman of the Public Relations Committee, and he gave a preview of the principles, so that the Section representatives might carry out good AIEE Public Relations. Attention was drawn to the fact that AIEE activities were both professional and social. The objective or basic philosophy of the Institute, as stated in Article I, Section 2, of the Constitution is the advancement of the theory and practice of electrical engincering and the allied arts and sciences, and the maintenance of a high professional standing. The Public Relations Committee directed its activities toward the students, members of the Institute, business organizations, and the general public; the basic root was considered to be top leadership.

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol used to route InternetÂ´s traffic between different Autonomous Systems. The BGP can control the traffic but it is vulnerable to communication interruptions and failures. This weakness could be the source of a several security attacks which could cause serious damages to the inter-domain network. The objective of this paper is to introduce briefly BGP, to present its vulnerabilities, and also to survey some proposed solutions for securing BGP. The paper introduces three secured versions of BGP, secure-BGP (sBGP), secure-origin BGP (soBGP) and pretty-secure BGP (psBGP). It discusses their advantages and identifies their limitations.

Sheikh Mosleh al-Din Sa’diShirazi is one of the most influential characters of the Persian Literature whose works has been enthusiastically popular since life his time. For centuries, his Golestan and Bostan have been read after the Quran in Iran and outside of Iran in the traditional and modern educational centers. Besides his rhythmic, musical, expressive and effective language, the attention of Sheikh-E Ajal to the social issues and the ethical Dos and Don'ts hasn’t been effective in impressing the educational centers and other Audiences. That should be the reason whySheikh-E Shirazi is considered as a moralist from the viewpoints of many Farsi speakers. Considering that Saadi’s piece of works, particularly Golestan&Boostan are greatly integrated and interconnected to the most central issues, arguments and principals of the ethical science which are‘’to persuade and encourage to the beauties and goodness’’ and ‘’to prevent from the obscenities and evilness’’, the objective of the present study is to evaluate which issues had been persuaded and warned for the audiences by the Sheikh-E Ajal in his valuable Golestan. It is attempted to determine which persuade and warning methods were applied by him to guide the audiences. The results of the present study will indicate that Saadi has invited his audiences to the ethical virtues in 47 different occasions and prevented them from the ethical iniquities in 73 cases. It is important to note that, Saadi has employed various methods for his concepts about ‘’ to prevent & to encourage the audience’’, which will be focused in this research.

Background and objective: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are frequently associated with benign and malignant lesions of the female genital region and male ano-genital tract. Currently the possible role of HPV infections in prostate carcinoma is a subject of great controversy. In this study we aimed to investigate the involvement of HPV infection in prostate carcinoma (PCa).

Materials and methods: The study included formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 104 primary prostate adenocarcinoma cases and 104 control tissues of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). HPV-DNA was purified and amplified through nested PCR and subsequently subjected to sequencing.

Results: HPV-DNA was found in 13 of 104 (12.5%) PCa and 8 of 104 (7.7%) BPH samples. There was not any significant difference between PCa and BPH specimens regarding HPV-NDA presence. High-risk HPVs were detected in 10 of 13 (76.9%) PCa and 5 of 8 (62.5%) BPH samples with positive HPV-DNA. Low-risk HPVs were detected in 3 of 13 (23.1%) PCa and 3 of 8 (37.5%) BPH specimens with positive HPV-DNA. There was not any significant difference between PCa and BPH specimens regarding the presence of high-risk and low-risk HPVs.

Conclusion: Our data do not support the involvement of HPV infection in prostate carcinoma. Further studies are required to elucidate the involvement of HPV infection in human prostate carcinogenesis.

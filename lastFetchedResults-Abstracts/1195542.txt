A field questionnaire survey was carried out simultaneously with weather measurements, in three urban areas in Athens, Greece, focusing on individual thermal sensation and its relationship with the environment in Mediterranean climates. Moreover thermal acceptability by means of thermal sensation votes was assessed based on Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). People's preference for warmer thermal conditions was identified. Women and individuals being at the interview site alone tended to be more sensitive to weather variations. Thermal sensation was defined by weather, personal and psychological factors. Air temperature and wind speed were the most important meteorological factors affecting thermal sensation while irradiation found to be a determining factor in improving thermal sensation in cool environments. The prognostic personal factors were clothing insulation and shading. The objective prevailing psychological factors were season and visit purpose. The estimated values of Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) predicted fairly well thermal sensation votes in the case of the heat stress classes of UTCI assessment scale. The evaluation of thermal sensation is crucial in establishing successful health warning systems and designing public urban spaces that improve the living conditions of the population.

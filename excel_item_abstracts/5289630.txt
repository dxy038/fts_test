A new fuzzy PID-like controller is developed. This controller is basically composed of two independent fuzzy controllers. The proportional and derivative characteristics of the PID controller are mainly performed by the first fuzzy controller, and the second fuzzy controller then displays the integrative characteristic of the PID controller. To demonstrate the advantages of the controller we have developed, several complex nonlinear systems are implemented by using both an ordinary PID controller and our PID-like controller. The PID-like controller we propose has the best control performance

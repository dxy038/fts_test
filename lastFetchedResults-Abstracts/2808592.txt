This paper presents a family of Quasi-Switched-Capacitor (QSC) dc/dc converters which employs a bidirectional QSC circuit. Comparing with half-bridge and full-bridge converters, the QSC converters feature reduced voltage stress on the switches and a reduced transformer turns ratio. In addition, they also feature bidirectional power flow, galvanic isolation, soft switching, resonant operation, and multi-port capability. For demonstration, two prototypes together with their experimental results are presented, including: 1) a 1-kW bidirectional QSC auxiliary power supply utilizing SiC MOSFETs for automotive application. This prototype is also evaluated with the dual-input configuration to combine the Photovoltaic (PV) system with Energy Storage System (ESS) which can be used vehicle batteries; 2) a 90-W QSC resonant converter based on eGaN FETs for ac/dc power adapters.

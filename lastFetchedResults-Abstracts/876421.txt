We consider a production planning problem for a jobshop with unreliable machines producing a number
of products. There are upper and lower bounds on intermediate parts and an upper bound on finished
parts. The machine capacities are modelled as finite state Markov chains. The objective is to choose the
rate of production so as to minimize the total discounted cost of inventory and production. Finding an optimal
control policy for this problem is difficult. Instead, we derive an asymptotic approximation by letting
the rates of change of the machine states approach infinity. The asymptotic analysis leads to a limiting
problem in which the stochastic machine capacities are replaced by their equilibrium mean capacities. The
value function for the original problem is shown to converge to the value function of the limiting problem.
The convergence rate of the value function together with the error estimate for the constructed asymptotic
optimal production policies are established.

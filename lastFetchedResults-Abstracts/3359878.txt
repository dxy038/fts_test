The synthesis of radiating planar arrays for wireless power transmission (WPT) is discussed. The objective is the maximization of the ratio between the power radiated on a target area and the total transmitted power. The optimal tapering is analytically found as the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem whose descriptive matrices are either computed in closed-form or obtained through numerical integration depending on the problem geometry. A set of representative numerical results concerned with different transmitting apertures and target areas is presented.

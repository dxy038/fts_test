Trace element disbalance in animal organism can provoke different disease states in development of some internal organs. Degenerative processes are also related to increase of activity of some enzymes. Therefore the objective of this study was to follow the effect of the supplement of selenium and iodine on activity of some indicator enzymes.The study was conducted with sheep of Karakachan and Tsigai breeds that use mountain and high-mountain pastures of Central Rhodope Mountains. Biochemical status of sheep was studied at the end of grazing period through the analysis of the activities of the following indicator enzymes: Aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Creatine phosphokinase (CpK), Cholesterol and Triglyceride.It was found that the supplement of 0.250 mg Se/kg and 0.10 mg J/kg exerted a positive influence on the biochemical status of Tsigai sheep, during which the activities of indicator enzymes ASAT, ALT, CpK, cholesterol and triglycerides returned to normal from 13% to 29%. Se and J supplementation in Karakachan sheep decreased the ALT and ASAT activity by 18% and 8%, respectively. The Karakachan sheep reacted to a smaller extent to the trace element supplement, as compared to the Tsigai breed.

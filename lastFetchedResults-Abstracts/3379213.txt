We study the problem of multipath routing for double description (DD) video in wireless ad hoc networks. We follow an application-centric cross-layer approach and formulate an optimal routing problem that minimizes the application layer video distortion. We show that the optimization problem has a highly complex objective function and an exact analytic solution is not obtainable. However, we find that a meta-heuristic approach such as genetic algorithms (GAs) is eminently effective in addressing this type of complex cross-layer optimization problems. We provide a detailed solution procedure for the GA-based approach. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the GA-based approach versus several other approaches. Our efforts in this work provide an important methodology for addressing complex cross-layer optimization problems, particularly those involved in the application and network layers

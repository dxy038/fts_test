In order to develop the next generation of gaze tracking system that can operate under visible lighting conditions, the difficulty of estimating limbus circle in real time needs to be solved. The iris model-based approaches excel the feature-based ones, but high computation complexity remains a problem. This paper presents an advanced iris model-based matching algorithm which adopts particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the overall performance. As a result, the developed system achieves high accuracy and the objective of 30 frames.

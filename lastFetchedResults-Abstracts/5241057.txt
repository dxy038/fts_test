The authors consider remote powered data transmission system issues. In the systems under consideration, two stations, one at the beginning and one at the end, provide energy and regenerate the signal; several peripheral stations are serially powered along the line. Particular attention is given to energy problems, cable and operator safety, and noise generation. The objective is to ensure a low BER transmission. The systems examined are well suited for use on roads and highways where they replace traditional devices that can be used to call for emergency assistance. In fact these systems not only send calls for help to the central host but also manage and transmit digital signals (vehicle identification contacts) and analog signals (coming from wind speed meters, ice sensors, or gas density sensors), improving the general control of a highway network

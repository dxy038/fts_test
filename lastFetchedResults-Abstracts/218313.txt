The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of using maize tassel as an alternative
adsorbent for the removal of chromium (VI) and cadmium (II) ions from aqueous solutions. The effect of pH, solution
temperature, contact time, initial metal ion concentration and adsorbent dose on the adsorption of chromium (VI) and
cadmium (II) by tassel was investigated using batch methods. Adsorption for both chromium (VI) and cadmium (II) was
found to be highly pH dependent compared to the other parameters investigated. Obtained results gave an adsorption
capacity of 79.1 % for chromium (VI) at pH 2, exposure time of 1h at 25 ؛C. Maximum capacity of cadmium of 88 %
was obtained in the pH range of 5-6 at 25 ؛C after exposure time of 1 h. The adsorption capacities of tassel for both
chromium (VI) and cadmium (II) were found to be comparable to those of other commercial adsorbents currently in use
for the removal of heavy metals from aqueous wastes. These results have demonstrated the immense potential of maize
tassel as an alternative adsorbent for toxic metal ions remediation in polluted water and wastewater.

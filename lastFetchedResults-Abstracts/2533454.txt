The objective of this study was to investigate the propensity of permethrin (PTN) to induce oxidative stress and changes in enzyme activities in liver of rainbow trout and its possible attenuation by vitamin C. Fortyeight fish were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups and their livers were used for liver perfusion method: control (0 μgL1 permethrin and 0 mgL1 vitamin C), PTN0.16 (0.16 μgL1 permethrin), PTN0.32 (0.32 μgL1 permethrin), PTN0.64 (0.64 μgL1 permethrin), Vit. C (17.2 mgL1 vitamin C), and PTN0.64 + Vit. C (0.64 μgL1 permethrin and 17.2 mgL1 vitamin C). Results obtained showed that permethrin significantly (P<0.05) increased ALT, AST and LDH activities in the liver perfusion medium and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in liver tissue. The values of reduced glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capacity (FRAP) in the liver tissue were significantly decreased due to permethrin administration. Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between MDA concentration and ALT, AST and LDH activities in the permethrin groups, suggesting that the enhanced lipid peroxidation may be linked to hepatic damage caused by permethrin. On the other hand, treatment with vitamin C in the PTN0.64 + Vit. C group increased the values of GSH and FRAP, and decreased the level of MDA and the activities of hepatic enzymes, when compared to the PTN0.64 group. The present study revealed that vitamin C could ameliorate permethrininduced oxidative damage by decreasing lipid peroxidation and altering antioxidant defense system in liver of rainbow trout.

In this paper we suggest a best-effort scheduler for high speed downlink packet access (HSPDA) systems that schedules resources in a way that achieves certain target QoS levels requested by users. Scheduling is based on adjusting the activity of a user such that the farther it is from the target the higher its activity becomes and vice versa. The objective of the algorithm will be to find the activity probabilities that achieve and maintain that target QoS level. The scheduler is based on a best-effort paradigm in a sense that when a requested target cannot be reached for instance in the case of congestion or limited resources in the system, then the algorithm would fall back to some fair scheduler allocating the resources in a fair manner

The types and rates of pollutant emissions from coal-fired power plants depend on plant design, coal characteristics, and environmental control policy. A multiobjective approach to decisionmaking on pollution control standards is discussed which includes the multimedia (air, land, water) effects of the standards. A mix of objective and subjective information is utilized and is obtained by linking an environmental simulation model with a method for eliciting a multipollutant dose-response curve and a subjective assessment of the &#8220; willingness to pay&#8221; to avoid one more unit of various impacts. This study suggests that trade-offs between direct measures of impacts, such as human health effects and control costs, can be made for regulatory standard setting.

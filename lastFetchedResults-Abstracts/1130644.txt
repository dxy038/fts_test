Abstract
Background: Heat stress is one of the agents in the work environment that can create numerous problems for workers. The objective of this research is to study heat stress control in the foundry platform of a steel plant in Tehran, Iran.
Methods: In this experimental study, controlling plans were demonstrated for the work conditions improvement in one of steel plant's foundry platforms. For controlling plans assessment, measurements were performed before and after carrying out the plans and WBGT index was used for the evaluation of the environmental condition. In this study, glass thermometer, wet rotator thermometer, standard glob thermometer, and silvered Kata thermometer with F: 420 and rate of 52-55째C were used respectively for measurement of dry temperature, natural wet temperature, radiant temperature, and air velocity.
Findings: In this factory's foundry platform, after accomplishment of controlling plans, radiant temperature was reduce from 44.04 째C to 35.8 째C and WBGT index was reduced from 28.88 째C to 26.57
Conclusion: Radiant heat from melted materials is the main factor for heat stress in foundry platform workers, and these stresses are reduced by reflective shields.

Composite systems are systems that encompass multiple agents involved in ongoing, interactive activities. The authors study requirements acquisition, specification and design of such systems. The research objective is a model that encompasses this entire design activity, and thereafter, techniques and tools called for by the model, which will serve to provide automated assistance to a skilled designer of composite systems. The authors outline the proposed model that they have established so far, together with the experimental pieces of technology that they are assembling

Harmonics and overvoltage transients are two major system characteristics which can significantly influence system performance. The sources of these undesirable characteristics are many and varied. Nonlinear loads are a major generator of disturbances and their use is expected to increase since they are generally highly efficient. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential for voltage and current harmonics and overvoltage transients in a Canadian Forces aircraft electrical distribution system. The analysis of these characteristics has been conducted during steady-state and dynamic operating conditions and utilizing various switching loads (real and reactive) in the laboratory and on an actual aircraft

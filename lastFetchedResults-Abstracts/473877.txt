Abstract
Objective
Neck circumference (NC), as an upper body obesity index, is a simple screening measure for identifying overweight and obese patients. This study examines a relationship between changes in systolic blood pressure (BP), and diastolic BP and changes in NC, and other components of the metabolic syndrome.
Methods
In a longitudinal cohort study the study group was comprised of 364 subjects (155 men and 209 women) with no known major medical conditions who were not receiving any medication therapy. Main indicators studied included systolic BP, diastolic BP, NC, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), lipoprotein, glucose, and uric acid levels.
Results
Pearson's correlation coefficients indicated a significant association between changes in systolic BP and changes in NC (men, r = 0.54; women, r = 0.56; each, P< .0001), WC men, r = 0.51; women, r = 0.56; each, P< .0001), triglycerides (men, r = 0.41; women, r = 0.44; each, P< .0001), and glucose (men, r = 0.43, P< .001; women, r = 0.48, P< .0001); between changes in diastolic BP and changes in NC (men, r = 0.56; women, r = 0.68; each, P< .0001), WC (men, r = 0.62; women, r = 0.50; each, P< .0001), triglycerides (men, women; each, r = 0.39, P< .0001), and glucose (men, r = 0.45; women, r = 0.49; each, P< .0001).
Conclusions
Changes in systolic BP and diastolic BP correlated positively with changes in NC and other components of the metabolic syndrome.

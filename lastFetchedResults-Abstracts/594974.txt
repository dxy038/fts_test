Objective: Dysfunctional uterine bleeding or DUB are a large number of patients presenting in our OPDs and the problem is a major contributor to anaemia and disease in our society, mostly necessitating hysterectomy.Material and Methods: This was a hospital based prospective study of 100 patients with DUB who were randomly selected, in our out patients (OPDs) between 1st August 2001-31st July 2002. Common presentation was either menorrhagia or poly menorrhagia with ages varying between 35-50 years. 68 (68%) patients were between 35-44 years age group and 32 (32%) patients were 44-50 years old. In addition to Hb gm%, detailed haematological investigations were carried out. Transvaginal ultrasounds were done to specifically look for endometrial thickness or pathology and ovarian screening to exclude any organic cause.Results: 64 out of 100 patients showed increased endometrial thickness or irregularity and 32 out of these who were above 40 years of age had an endometrial biopsy to exclude any premalignant or malignant condition of the endometrium. All patients were put on dydrogesterone 10 mg daily starting from day 14lh to day 28th of the cycle for 3-6 months. Remarkably good cycle control and reduction in the amount of bleeding and days of menstruations, and improvement of Hb gm% levels were seen in 41 patients. 3 were lost to the follow up and 6 patients eventually needed hysterectomy.Conclusion: The study proved that dydrogesterone is an effective agent for medical treatment of Dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Its use savedpatients from hysterectomy thus decreasing exposure to the risk of general anesthesia and surgery, also decreasing workload and economic burden on hospital, staff and the state.

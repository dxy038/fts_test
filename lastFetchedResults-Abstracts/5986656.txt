The paper proposes credit risk assessment model of commercial banks based on fuzzy probabilistic neural network model (FPNN) which combines the relative membership degree in fuzzy mathematics with Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). The model makes up for a deficiency of ANN and BP arithmetic. Finally, an example is used to prove the calculation of this method is succinct rapid, and the evaluative result is objective.

The potential for adopting the relatively simple-to-conduct edge bearing test as a surrogate for direct determination of the critical transverse material properties is investigated. The research explores the effect of through-culm-wall fiber gradation on the edge bearing, or ‘diametric compression’, strength of full-culm bamboo. The test method also utilizes a full culm section cut into two or three concentric annular sections. Tests results for each ‘ring’ provide a measure of through thickness transverse properties. The objective of this work is the development of practical test methods for field assessment of bamboo material properties.

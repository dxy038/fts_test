An analysis and evaluation of power switch losses of three-port bidirectional DC-DC converters to be used in hybrid electric systems is presented in this work. The analysis is carried out considering all the different converter operation modes. The evaluation considers different voltage levels, different switches (IGBT and MOSFET) and different high-frequency transformer leakage inductance. As a result, design considerations for a converter, specially the high-frequency transformer are obtained in order to operate the converter with low losses. Simulation results are presented in order to validate the theoretical analysis.

Objective.  This paper reports a method of using a multi-axis graph to represent the range of rotations at the hip and knee joints during gait for clinical evaluation of a patient's performance.

Design and methods. The multi-axis graph uses 12 symmetrically arranged axes to represent each component of range of rotations at the hip and knee joints of both legs. The range of joint rotations of thirteen normal subjects and two patients were measured using an electromagnetic motion tracking system with four foot switches.

Results. The range of joint rotations of normal subjects shows a symmetrical star in the multi-axis graph. Abnormal function of a patient shows an asymmetrical star.

Conclusions. This representation provides a simple way to examine a patient's performance in a time effective manner.

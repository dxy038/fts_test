The amalgamation of pervasive computing and simulation technology is very useful and important. The HIL (Hardware In Loop) simulation is a specified system and one of simulation system compositions. It will bring more convenience resource sharing and serving to users by amalgamation of pervasive computing and HIL simulation system. Design of HIL simulation system is just finding an approach of reforming and expanding a HIL simulation system to apply to pervasive computing. Such as analysis of designing objective for HIL simulation system research, designing scheme of system, key technologies correlating to system design, and so on.

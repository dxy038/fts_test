Image mosaic is the technology that a large, seamless and high-resolution image, which providing more information than one image can, is made from a set of images. We can not obtain all information from just one image in some forensic examinations such as the cartridge image check, since the surface of the firing pin is with different depth. It is difficult to obtain the clear image entirely (clear firing pin and clear breech face) of the cartridge using microscopy with a fixed focal length. In this paper, we apply image mosaic technology to obtain the whole clear cartridge bottom image. Experiments show the capability of our mosaic approach. Finally we also present evaluation to demonstrate the performance of our method in both objective and visual evaluations.

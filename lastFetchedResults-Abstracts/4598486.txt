The power systems are interested in the Smart Grid for energy efficiency with bi-directional communications between providers and consumers. Adapting Smart Grid, various new devices and systems are launching including energy storage systems and power conversion devices etc. But despite the advantage of Smart Grid, the electromagnetic environments are more complex because of increasing use of power conversion devices and wired and/or wireless communication devices. The objective of this paper is to introduce the change of electromagnetic environment in adapting Smart Grid with investigation data on the Smart Grid real test yard in the Jeju Island. The harmonic generations of power conversion devices are quite a lot and conducted/radiated disturbance levels are high in the low frequency range. The measurement results are meaningful by testing in the big and real test yard.

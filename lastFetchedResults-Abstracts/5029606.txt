Data server replication is a promising technique for improving system performance in a large distributed network. Recently, transparent data replication has been gaining increasing attention due to its low management overheads incurred. However, research on replica placement strategies for transparent data replication thus far focused on read operations only. In this paper, we consider examination for read/write applications of two data replica placement problems (i.e., without and with constraint on the number of replicas respectively) for a single object on the deployed transparent replication proxies. The performance objective is to minimize the total data transfer cost for a target server under a given traffic pattern. Optimal solutions for these two problems are proposed, with complexities of O(N) and O(N+N<sub>o</sub>P <sub>o</sub>M<sup>2</sup>) respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed solutions are very efficient

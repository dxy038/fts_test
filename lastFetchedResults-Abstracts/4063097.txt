Maximum aid in the war effort was the principal objective of the AIEE national technical meeting held in New York, N. Y., January 25&#8211;29, 1943. This is in accord with the wartime policies adopted by the InstituteÂ´s board of directors last August. As stipulated by those policies, all programmed social activities and inspection trips were omitted, leaving the entire week to be devoted to technical sessions and conferences.

In supply chain management, supplier performance is evaluated based on several criteria. In this paper, a fuzzy multi-objective mathematical programming model is presented to consider different qualitative and quantitative factors to choose appropriate suppliers and the optimal order quantity allocated to them. The proposed study uses analytical hierarchy process to rank different suppliers and a fuzzy multi-objective mathematical programming is presented to choose the best suppliers. The study uses NSGAII to solve the resulted problem and the model is analysed using some sample results under various circumstances. The study considers different Pareto solution set obtained by TOPSIS ranking algorithm, and eventually determines the best possible solutions.

We address practical issues which arise in the implementation of optimized cache replenishment algorithms within a &#8220;soft&#8221; caching framework. We study the algorithms that have been proposed for optimized soft caching and simulate them using actual proxy traces. Our objective is to determine what compromises have to be made in order to approximate the desired optimal performance while maintaining a complexity level sufficiently low to enable a real-time implementation

Due to the significant mismatch between existing wirelength models and the congestion objective in placement, considering routability during placement is particularly significant for modern circuit designs. In this paper, a novel routability-driven analytical placement algorithm for large-scale mixed-size circuit designs is proposed. Unlike most existing works which usually optimize routability by reallocating whitespace or net-based congestion removal, the proposed algorithm optimizes routability from three major aspects: (1) Pin density: Most existing works optimize routability based on net distribution, while our work considers both the density of pins and their routing directions; (2) Routing overflow optimization: Unlike most previous works that use white space allocation or net-based congestion removal to improve routability, our work optimizes routing overflow by a novel sigmoid function during global placement; (3) Macro porosity consideration: A virtual macro expansion technique is applied to consider the constrained routing resource incurred by big macros. Routability-driven legalization and detailed placement are also proposed to further optimize routing congestion. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Compared with the participating teams for the 2011 ACM ISPD Routability-Driven Placement Contest, our algorithm achieves the best average overflow and routed wirelength.

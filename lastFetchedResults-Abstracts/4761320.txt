The objective in this study was to develop proper vegetation indices for prediction of soil irrigation demanding under vegetation covering conditions. The four tested winter wheat varieties were under four different irrigation treatment levels at two different growth stages, one at booting stage and another at grain filling stage, the winter wheat canopy and bare soil reflected spectrum, foliar and soil moisture condition were tested in the field at an interval of 7 days from erecting stage to ripening stage. The combined spectral indices of photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were chosen in this study. Regression equations between the ration of NPRI to NDWI and soil water content (SWC) were found to be most appropriate for assessing soil water condition under vegetation covering, and relationship between the ration of PRI to NDWI and soil irrigation demanding conditions were also studied. It indicated that soil irrigation demanding condition under vegetation covering conditions could be evaluated by a pragmatic approach for canopy level estimation with proper combined vegetation index

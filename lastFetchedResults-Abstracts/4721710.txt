In multiuser cognitive radio (CR) network, we address the problem of joint transmit beamforming (BF) and power control (PC) for secondary users (SUs) when they are allowed to transmit simultaneously with primary users (PUs). The objective is to optimize the network sum rate under the interference constraints of PUs. Second-order cone programming approximation (SOCPA) method is proposed as an effective algorithm. Typical network models are approximated to second-order cone programming problems and solved by interior-point method. Finally the network sum rates for different PU and SU numbers are assessed by simulation.

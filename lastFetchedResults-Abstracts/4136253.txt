This paper presents a tabu search based strategy which is applied to optimize the objective function associated with the design of a solenoid system. The strategies used to apply tabu search in a continuous domain are developed without increasing computational effort with respect to the corresponding discrete problem. Algorithms developed for discrete problems used to self-tune tabu search parameters have also been applied, achieving improvements in terms of the quality of the solutions

Over the past several years there has been considerable attention focused on the problem of enhancement and bandwidth compression of speech degraded by additive background noise. This interest is motivated by several factors including a broad set of important applications, the apparent lack of robustness in current speech-compression systems and the development of several potentially promising and practical solutions. One objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the variety of techniques that have been proposed for enhancement and bandwidth compression of speech degraded by additive background noise. A second objective is to suggest a unifying framework in terms of which the relationships between these systems is more visible and which hopefully provides a structure which will suggest fruitful directions for further research.

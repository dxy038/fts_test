The aim of this paper is to propose a new look to MBID, examine some known approaches, and provide a new MC method for restoring blurred and noisy images. First, the direct image restoration problem is briefly revisited. Then a new method based on inverse filtering for perfect image restoration in the noiseless case is proposed. The noisy case is addressed by introducing a regularization term into the objective function in order to avoid noise amplification. Second, the filter identification problem is considered in the MC context. A new robust solution to the degradation matrix filter is then derived and used in conjunction with a total variation approach to restore the original image. Simulation results and performance evaluations using recent image quality metrics are provided to assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

We describe a centimeter-level ground-truth system based on GPS relative positioning. One of the goals of the system is for performance evaluation of automotive radars by creating objective test procedures for the radars. In support of this goal, an effective scheme is used to handle signal attenuation or blockage that leads to the changes of satellite visible map and cycle slip. Multiplatform GPS measurements and low-cost vehicle dynamic sensor data are integrated for vehicle trajectory reconstruction. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the systemÂ´s actual centimeter-level accuracy and superior performance over Kalman smoothing. The effectiveness of the proposed ground-truth system is demonstrated by evaluating mono-pulse short-range radars whose accuracy is about submeter level.

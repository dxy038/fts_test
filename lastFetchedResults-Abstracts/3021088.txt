The objective of this paper is to propose an alternative approach that can be directly used by marketers in order to evaluate an offer with or without the involvement of potential customers. In order to deal with such an uncertain multi-criteria evaluation problem, a modification of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed, based on a fuzzy preference programming method. This method takes into account customerÂ´s uncertain or irrational behavior by dealing with inconsistencies and derives crisp priorities from inconsistent interval pairwise comparison matrices. It is based on interval representations of the comparison judgments, as the prioritization problem is formulated as a fuzzy programming problem for obtaining an optimal crisp priority vector that maximizes the overall degree of satisfaction of the decision-maker.

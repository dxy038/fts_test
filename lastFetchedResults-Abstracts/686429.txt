The objective of this paper is to show the methodology developed to estimate particle emissions from several typical activities of bulk handling in harbours. It is based on several field experiments carried out in the Harbour of Tarragona, where high time resolution monitors were deployed close to different areas of bulk solids handling operations. Monitors recorded particle concentrations and meteorological variables. A high-resolution dispersion model is used to estimate the emission rates that best fits the observations. Results were comparable to those obtained with the AP-42 (EPA). The new emission estimates are used as input for an emission model called EMIPORT. The model also employs AP-42 (EPA) emission factors as a complement. This work is one of the activities of the LIFE project called HADA (Herramienta Automática de Diagnóstico Ambiental or in English Automatic Tool for Environmental Diagnostic).

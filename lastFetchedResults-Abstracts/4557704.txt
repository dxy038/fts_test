The cement manufacturing process is energy intensive. Energy can account for up to 40% of production costs. Energy efficiency initiatives cut these costs by reducing consumption and improving operational output. The objective of this paper is to describe the energy efficiency challenges for the cement industry and present key strategies to tackle these challenges.

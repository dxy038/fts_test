Describes a study applying the concepts and philosophy of total quality management (TQM) in an engineering technology classroom. The objective is to develop a process using TQM to improve teaching effectiveness and the classroom environment, resulting in increased learning by adult engineering technology students. An initial pilot study is conducted in an applied thermodynamics course. Adult students have been chosen for this study because of the additional stresses of life they face that usually interfere with the process of learning. The study is conducted using a series of student questionnaires to define both general and specific areas of teaching and the classroom environment that need improvement. From the results of the student questionnaires, the instructor develops solutions to the selected problem areas. At the conclusion of the course, the success of the process in meeting the objective is by a final student-measured questionnaire, an instructor evaluation and a comparison of present to past student performance in the course. After the initial pilot study is completed, the process is reviewed and refined. It is planned to expand the process voluntarily to other courses in the Department of Engineering Technology at the authorsÂ´ institute. It is further planned that the process would be further refined and expanded in successive semesters. It is expected that this process could be used to improve the learning of adult engineering technology students at other colleges and universities through the improvement of teaching effectiveness and the classroom environment

In the first stage the environment with its circumstances is modeled. The plan of the simulated place, dimensions, blocked and unblocked paths are introduced in this model. Number, age, the position of victims and fire starting point are the other parameters which should be foreseen. Then the fireman is modeled according to this position, possible movement directions and rescue plan. In this environment, the modeled fireman is supposed to search for victims using Fuzzy Logic Search and Neural Networks as two intelligent methods. We use same scenario for the environmental parameters to make the comparison possible. Objective function in this study is the number of people that can be found and survived in restricted time.

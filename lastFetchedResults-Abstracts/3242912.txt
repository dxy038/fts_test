In this paper, a spherical underwater robot uses optimal thrust allocator to determine the magnitude and the direction of thrust required for each water-jetted bilge pump thruster to create force and moment equilibrium. However, in order to ensure safe operation of the underwater robot it is equipped with redundant thruster configuration and therefore is over-actuated. Therefore, the choice of a particular solution for thrust allocation is found using an optimization process. In this work, the thrust allocation problem is formulated as an optimization problem, with an objective to minimize the total power consumption of the spherical underwater robot. The power consumption of underwater robot depends on the thrust generated by each bilge pump. The relationship between the power consumption and the thrust of the bilge pump is established using experimental data. The formulated optimal thrust allocation problem is solved using Mincon (Sequential Quadratic Programming) and SA (Simulated Annealing) optimization algorithm. The percentage savings in total power consumption for thruster system using the SA method as compared to Mincon method is 50.6 %.

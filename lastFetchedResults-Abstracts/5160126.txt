Many DC/DC converters possess current control strategies with average current control. Usually, the currents are filtered with low-pass filters to measure the average current value. However, these low-pass filters have the drawback of adding hardware design effort and causing a time delay of the current signal. Additionally, the switching actions in multi-phase DC/DC converters lead to EMI noise which results in further inaccuracies of the current measurement. Thus, an advanced average current sampling algorithm for multi-phase DC/DC converters with an odd number of phases is proposed which eliminates the disadvantages of low-pass filters and is immune to EMI noise. Furthermore, a novel predictive digital current control for bidirectional operation using the advanced current sampling algorithm is presented in this paper.

The objective of this study is to develop a portable continuous blood pressure monitoring kit using an electrocardiography (ECG) sensor. The method that was used to measure and monitor blood pressure continuously is based on Heart Rate (HR). The method was separately implemented for different techniques to measure systolic blood pressure (SBP). The techniques that were used to model the relationship between the HR data to systolic blood pressure is neural network model. Neural network model gave the smallest value of mean of error and standard deviation of error for continuously monitoring blood pressure based on HR. These errors are acceptable and relatively small compared to the standard accuracy, which should have a minimum mean of error value of 6 mmHg with a standard deviation of error of &#177;10 mmHg. The subjects that were involved in portable BP monitoring kit testing are normal blood pressure subjects, low blood pressure subjects and high blood pressure subjects.

Eastman Kodak has developed a technique called MOSAIC, for Multi-modality Operational Site Analysis and Intelligent Change detection. This technique is based on the application of faceted site models and synthetic image generation (SIG) tools in tandem with material identification using relative reflectance properties derived from imagery and/or feature maps. This presentation will step through key accomplishments in the past two phases of the projects evolution; the technique feasibility demonstration and initial development accomplished under NRO/AS&amp;T charter, and subsequent application of this technique towards the NIMA objective of automatic change detection and update of GIS features including buildings, roads, and river-ways using 3-D volumetric models. Performance examples will be provided, along with a discussion of relationships to other NIMA and Air Force programs.

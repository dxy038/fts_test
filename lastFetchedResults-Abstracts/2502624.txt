Present study describes approach of applying RSM with a Pareto-based multi-objective GA to optimize the deep drawing process. Previous studies, integrated the FEA and optimization technique to find the optimal parameters by transforming multi objective-problem into a single-objective problem. This paper aims to minimize the functions of fracture and wrinkle. Design variables are blank-holding-force and draw-beads geometry. RSM has been used for design of experiment and finding relationships between variables and functions. Proposed approach has been investigated on a fuel-tank drawing part and it has been observed that it is more effective and accurate than traditional ‘trial and error’ procedure.

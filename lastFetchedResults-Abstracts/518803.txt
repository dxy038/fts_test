Background: Sore throat is a common complication after surgery. Application of 10% lidocaine spray on cuff of a tracheal tube maybe associated with decreased risk of postoperative sore throat. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of 10% lidocaine spray on postoperative sore throat.

Methods: This double-blind study was conducted at Rajaei Hospital in Qazvin during 2008-2009. Two hundred ASA I-III surgical patients (except the neck surgery) aged 9-81 years and without signs of common cold, were randomly divided into two groups. The subject group received aerosolized lidocaine (5 puffs) on cuff of the tracheal tube before tracheal intubation. The patients in control group received normal saline instead. Later, the patients underwent a standardized general anesthesia. These patients were interviewed when leaving the recovery room and re-questioned for the presence of sore throat the following day in the wards. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test.

Findings: Sore throat was present in 29% of subject group and 22% of control group while in the recovery room. Sore throat decreased to 16% and 17% on the day after surgery. There was no significant difference in incidence of sore throat between two groups based on duration of surgery and the patient's sex when in the recovery room or wards.

Conclusion: It seems that the application of aerosolized lidocaine on cuff of the tracheal tube before tracheal intubation fails to decrease the incidence of postoperative sore throat.

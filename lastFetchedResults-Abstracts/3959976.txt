In this paper, we propose a framework on planning collision-free walking motion for biped humanoid robots. Our proposed planner is composed of two phases. In the first phase, the constraint condition is generated as a function of time by using the walking pattern generator. In the second phase, the collision-free walking motion is planned. To generate the collision-free motion, we add a time parameter to each milestone of the single-query, bidirectional, lazy collision checking planner in order to explicitly consider the time-parametrized constraint conditions. Further, we smoothen the generated path by using B-spline interpolation. Through experimental results, we show that our planner is effective in realizing collision-free walking motion by real humanoid robots.

A multi-objective operational scheduling model with plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) is proposed to minimize the operation cost and to improve the load characteristic of Micro-grid. In this model, the PEVs charging power and the distribute generations (DGs) output power of each time period are selected as decision variables, the driving behavior of PEVs is also taken into account. Multi-objective evolution algorithm NSGA-II is utilized to solve the multi-objective model and fuzzy clustering method is introduced to help obtaining the best Pareto front. The presented model is tested on the IEEE 34-node test feeder, the results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dispatching approach.

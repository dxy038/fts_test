This study presents a multiobjective tabu search algorithm to solve the multistage planning problem of a distribution system formulated as a multiobjective dynamic mixed integer non-linear programming problem. Multiobjective problems do not have a specific solution, but a set of solutions that allows us to observe the trade-off among the analysed objectives. Taking into account this concept, the objective functions of the model proposed in this study are: costs (investment and operational) and reliability. The actions deemed in this model for each period of the planning horizon are: increase in the capacity of existing substations (or construction of new ones), exchange of cables in existing lines (and construction of new feeders), reconfiguration of the network, allocation of sectionalising switches and construction of tie lines. The systemÂ´s reliability is evaluated by means of the non-supplied energy under contingencies using the <i>n</i> - 1 criterion. By line switching and the use of tie lines, part of the loads affected by a contingency can be restored, thus, the non-supplied energy can be evaluated by solving a distribution network restoration problem. Numerical results are presented for a 54-bus system.

The term "Celestial Kingdom" is used in the Qur'an and in the Gospels as well. In Islam, several interpretations are given to this term; such as, great kingdom, throne, the wonders of the heavens and the earth and treasures. In the mystical Qur'an commentaries, kingdom is always to mean metaphysical world and inner state of the world. Witnessing this kingdom requires knowing the names of the Divine actions and the oneness of God (Tawhid). This objective can be realized by performing voluntary acts, grace and guidance according to Divine Command. Also, realization of the heavenly kingdom is accompanied by changes in the degree of the soul according to the levels of existence. In Christianity too, there are several interpretations of the kingdom, such as the kingdom of Christ in the apocalypse and the kingdom of God. But, in the mysticism of oriental Christianity, "kingdom" is used to mean an inner entity associated with intuition, unity with God and the Trinity. The attainment of this aim requires performing voluntary acts and supported by the grace of the Holy Spirit. If one wants to be prepared for celestial kingdom, one's soul must change through divine grace.

In this work we present a study on the performance of existing state of the art 2D objective image and video quality measures, tested on the new 3D stereoscopic video NAMA3DS1-COSPAD1 database. Different image and video quality measures have been tested on test material affected by different types of degradations. Results show that in some cases, image quality measures give better results than video quality measures. This paradoxical result means that more effort should be devoted to designing new 3D video quality assessment measures. The results presented and accompanying discussion can be used to motivate and guide future research directed towards definition of effective new 3D stereoscopic video quality measures.

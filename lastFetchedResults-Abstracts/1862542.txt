Objective
c visceral fat is accepted to be a new marker for cardiometabolic risk due to its association with increased cardiovascular risk factors. This study aimed to compare the expression of 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSD)-1, glucocorticoid receptor (GCR), and CD68 in mediastinal and subcutaneous adipose tissues (MAT, and SAT, respectively) and to assess their possible relationships with the development of coronary artery disease (CAD).
s and results
sion of 11β-HSD-1, GCR, and CD68 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in MAT and SAT tissues of 37 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting due to CAD (CAD group) and 19 non-CAD patients (controls) undergoing heart valve surgery. 11β-HSD-1 in MAT and SAT and GCR expression in MAT and SAT were found to be significantly increased in CAD group when compared with controls (P&lt;.05, respectively). In CAD group, 11β-HSD-1 mRNA levels were found to be significantly higher in MAT compared to SAT (P&lt;.05). CD68 mRNA levels were significantly higher in MAT of CAD group compared to controls (P&lt;.05). Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated the presence of CD68+ cells and increased 11β-HSD-1 expression in MAT of CAD group compared to SAT.
sion
esent study demonstrate that the mediastinal fat exhibits a pathogenic mRNA profile of 11β-HSD-1, GCR, and CD68. The identification of 11β-HSD-1 expression within the mediastinal fat, along with increased GCR expressions and the presence of CD68+ cells highlight that MAT potentially contributes to the pathogenesis of CAD.

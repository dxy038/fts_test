In order to accurately estimate (build) the radio signal propagation attenuation model, especially inside the gastro-intestine (GI) tract of the human body, the Radio Frequency (RF) absorption characterization in human body is investigated. This characterization provides a criterion to design the Received Signal Strength (RSS) based localization system for the objective inside the human body. In this paper, the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), E-field, H-field of the near and far field are investigated at frequencies of 434MHz, 868MHz, 1.2GHz and 2.4GHz respectively. Then, the numerical electromagnetic analysis with the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) is applied to model the in vivo radio propagation channels by using a dipole antenna. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out in homogenous and heterogeneous mediums. The results show that the electromagnetic (EM) propagation is not only distance and orientation dependent, but also tissue absorption dependent in human body. The proposed model is in agreement with measurements in the simulation experiments.

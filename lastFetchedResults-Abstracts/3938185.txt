Assuming an opportunistic source selection strategy, a tight closed-form approximation for the outage probability of fixed-gain bidirectional cooperative networks is derived. The presented analysis allows for independent, reciprocal Nakagami-<i>m</i> fading channels with distinct fading parameters among the links. Simulation results are presented to corroborate the tightness of the proposed approximations.

In this study, a stochastic multi-objective framework is proposed for energy expansion planning (EEP). The proposed multiobjective framework can concurrently optimise the competing objective functions including total real energy losses, voltage deviation and the total cost of the installation equipments. Also, regarding the uncertainties of the new complicated energy systems, in this study, for the first time, system uncertainties including load uncertainty are explicitly considered in the EEP problem by the use of the probabilistic load flow technique based on the point estimate method. Since the objectives are different and incommensurable, it is difficult to solve the problem by the conventional approaches that may optimise a single objective. Hence, the metaheuristic algorithm is applied to this problem. Here, the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm as a new evolutionary optimisation algorithm is utilised. To improve the total ability of the PSO for global search and exploration, a new modification adaptive process is suggested in such a way that the algorithm will search the total search space globally. To evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, three modified standard distribution systems are used as the case studies.

This paper is centred on the question of objectivity of religious truth-claims in the Wittgensteinian perspective and explains how the evidentialist standard model of rationality leads us nowhere except putting us in a flyglass wherein like distraught flies we hopelessly flutter and flutter without finding the way out. This flyglass was manufactured by the Cartesian epistemology which demanded proofs in order to establish the cognitive validity of a truth-claim. Wittgenstein rejects this standpoint as wholly mistaken and misguided. There is no objectively neutral place from which the philosopher can have a critical look on a particular mode of discourse. The question of true/false depends on forms of life and language games. This line of argument has been followed by D. Z. Phillips, Peter Winch and Norman Malcolm. They also denounced the claim that there must be a common paradigm of rationality for all modes of discourse. Indeed, there are many difficulties in Wittgensteinian criteriology. But it is a fact that evidentialism fails to take account of diversity in modes of discourse. Likewise, the scientism suffers the fallacies of generalization and exclusivism. Rationalist ontology fallaciously promotes the idea of  transcendental truth which Prof. Stuhar rejects as a system of delusion. Taking lead from Wittgensteinianism, postmodernism lays emphasis on equality of different cluster of meaning and affirms that there is no objective point of view that gives us access to a global truth. Hence, what is temporary, immanent and historically particular is accepted.

We propose algorithms to extract groups of meaningful image level lines using Helmholtz perception principle. In this paper, the meaningfulness refers to the segmentation of circular and rectangular shapes in an image. We propose an objective assessment of meaningfulness of an image level line when the level line takes the shape of circle or rectangular segment. We have shown that a logical threshold in the meaningfulness value segments images from a variety of applications.

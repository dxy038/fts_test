A stable model based fuzzy predictive controller based on fuzzy dynamic programming is introduced. The objective of the fuzzy predictive controller is to drive the state of the system to a terminal region where a local stabilizing controller is invoked, leading to a dual mode strategy. The prediction horizon is fixed and specified. The stability of the controlled system is studied using the value function as a Lyapunov function. Guaranteed stability is obtained under conditions on the terminal region, the local control law and the membership functions of fuzzy goal and constraints therein. The solution procedure is based on dynamic programming with branch and bound.

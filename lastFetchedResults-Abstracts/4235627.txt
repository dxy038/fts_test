The objective of the present study is to develop a microwave power transmitting system for a Mars observation airplane. We suggest a phased array antenna composed of "power-variable phase-controlled magnetrons (PVPCM)" for the transmitting system. We confirmed the PVPCM had proper response speed to chase the airplane. We constructed PVPCMs for a phased array antenna through designing an integrator for a phase locked loop in the PVPCM, and we realized a stable power variation of the PVPCM. We confirmed realization of a phased array antenna with PVPCMs and transmitting power control.

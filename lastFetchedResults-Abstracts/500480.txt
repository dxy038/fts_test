
The objective of the present study is to recognize some body organs of the Caspian miniature horse as a native Iranian breed. In this study, five adult Caspian miniature horses were studied in routine anatomical and histological methods. Anatomical study showed than the urethra and penis are similar to that of the ordinary horse. The arteries of urethra and penis were similar to the horse except that the internal pudendal artery in the investigated cases, only gave rise to the bulbar artery. The origin of veins was similar to arteries except the obturator vein. The blood of corpus cavernosum of penis was drained through deep veins into the dorsal plexus of the penis. The blood of corpus spongiosum of penis was drained through dorsal process of penis and lateral veins of penis into the dorsal plexus of penis. The blood of this plexus drained into the external iliac vein through external pudendal and obturator veins.
In the histological study, urethra and penis in Caspian miniature horse were very similar to the ordinary horse. Erectile tissue of the penis was similar to that of the horse but in the capsule of corpus cavernosum of penis smooth muscle fibers were not observed.

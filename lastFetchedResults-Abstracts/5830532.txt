This paper discussed the findings of a preliminary survey on ethnomathematics measurements in the Malay Minangkabau culture. Measurements involve in the study are weight/mass for ordinary items (general weight), weight for valuable metals and volumes to measure rice that represent weight. This study revealed from the literatures that have been looked into five general unit measurements on weight, eleven on weight for valuable metals and seven on weight as measured by volume of rice. Most of the measurements have been quantified since some of them are similar with the terms used in the common Malay culture. By comparing the quantity among the measurements, a system for weight measurements is constructed. The objective of this study is to retain the Malay Minangkabau culture as a historical knowledge and heritage while uplifting the Malay language in the field of mathematical sciences in this country. Nevertheless, there is still room for further studies since the list of measurements is perhaps not comprehensive and emphasis should be placed on the origins of the words being used in the measurement (etymology).

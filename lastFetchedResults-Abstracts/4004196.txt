A novel self-aligned bidirectional Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) diode with transparent junctions is proposed and fabricated. The MIM diode is formed by a combination of Ta/TaO/sub x//ITO/TaO/sub x//Ta. In this structure, both symmetrical and shift-free I-V characteristics are obtained. The symmetrical I-V characteristics are attributed to the excellent symmetry in the diode structure. The significant reduction of the shift in the I-V characteristics is a result of the removal of the charges captured by the traps in the TaO/sub x/ layers and at the interfaces between the TaO, and the electrodes during electrical stress. Only three masks are needed for the fabrication of the MIM diode pixel, which is as simple as the conventional approach. Moreover, the adoption of the lateral junction approach in the structure makes it possible to be used for high density MIM matrix implementation over large area substrates without the need of high-resolution patterning techniques.

A Fully Fuzzy Linear Programming (FFLP) formulation for the reservoir operation of amultipurpose reservoir in presented in the ongoing paper. In the real world, water resourcessystems usually have complexities among social, economic, natural resources andenvironmental aspects, which lead to multi-objective problems of significant uncertainties insystem parameters, objectives and in their interactions. These uncertainties in FFLPreservoir operation model are considered by being treated as fuzzy sets. In the present study,an FFLP reservoir operation model is developed where all parameters and decision variablesare fuzzy numbers. The developed model is demonstrated through a case study of Jayakwadireservoir stageâ€“II, Maharashtra, India with the objectives of maximization of annual releasesfor irrigation and hydropower generation. The FFLP reservoir operation model is solved toobtain a compromised solution by simultaneously optimizing the fuzzified objectives and thecorresponding degree of truthfulness, using linear membership function. The degree ofcorrespondence (Correspondence) obtained is equal to 0.78 and the corresponding annualreleases for irrigation amount of 367 Mm3 and while annual releases for hydropowergeneration being 216 Mm3. the present study clearly demonstrates that, use of FFLP inmultipurpose reservoir system optimization presents a potential alternative to attain anoptimal operating policy.

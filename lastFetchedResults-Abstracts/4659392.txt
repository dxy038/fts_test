The Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and Choquet integral both are well-known information fusion methods, but they contain some natural common characteristics except apparent difference. In this paper we compare the two methods according to their objective function structures, parameter identification, and application. These comparable results are helpful to find the natural relationship of the two methods to each other. Consequently, some effective methods in the Choquet integral tool are promisingly applied to the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory tool to reformulate its performance.

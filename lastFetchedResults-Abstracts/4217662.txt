Recently, we developed a sequence-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator for decoding quantized data transmitted over noisy channels. The method effectively views the encoder and noisy channel tandem as a discrete hidden Markov model (HMM), with transmitted indices the unknown states and received indices the observable symbols. Here, we extend this 1D approach to images, using a Markov mesh random field to model the encoded image. Our decoder is based on an approximate forward/backward algorithm for calculating pixel &#8220;label probabilities&#8221; in Markov meshes which may also have application to image labeling and segmentation. For a DPCM-based image coding system and a high error-rate channel, the new decoder obtains significant performance gains, both objective and visually discernable, over the standard decoder, as well as over several other competing techniques

Research objective of swapping chuck is to manufacture quartz resonators of primary oscillation without any spurious signals due to the finely aligned optical axis. After basic geometry of cylinder and sphere is reviewed, this rallying two chucks was discovered in order completely to match an optical axis of the dual convex lens to two machining axes of front and rear surfaces. We could make an ultra-accurate symmetrical bi-convex quartz resonator, which AT-cut optical axis became identical to two machining geometrical axes, when we used the blank which optical axis was identical to the geometrical axis line

Results of measurements of the bidirectional reflection function of snow for the solar zenith angle close to 54&#176; are compared with a recently developed snow optical model based on the representation of snow grains as fractal particles. The model has a high accuracy out of the principal plane for the observation zenith angles smaller than 60&#176;. However, the accuracy is reduced in the principal plane. Specular light reflection by partially oriented snow plates on the snow surface not accounted for by the model can play a role for measurements in the principal plane. The model discussed can be used for the grain size retrieval using both ground and spaceborne measurements of the snow reflectance. This is supported by a high accuracy of the model in a broad spectral range 545-2120 nm as demonstrated in this work.

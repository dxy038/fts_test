The objective of the paper is to extract and identify the actual spectrum of the ball mill under dynamic conditions using the proposed Synchronized Frequency Estimation method (SFE). Impact statistics in ball mills are nested with complex dynamics, and the identification of the intensity of vibration lack behind the presence of impact dead zone in reference to the data acquisition and its analysis. The selection sample length can change the behavioral pattern for different impact loading cases i.e. the generation of mills natural frequency purely depends on the strength of the impulse excitation strength and the functional characteristics. The unevenness in the impulsive impact dynamics may depict the actual frequency as faux frequency. The improper sample length selection can alter the behavioral pattern for different impact loading. This paper broadly discusses the outcome of the random selection of data sample length and the disciplinary steps in extracting the actual spectrum.

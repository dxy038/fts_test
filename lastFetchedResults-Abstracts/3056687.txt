This paper studies the problem of efficient exploitation of the available bandwidth on the reverse link (RL) of cdma2000 1&#215;EV-DV system. The objective is to maximize user throughput and to minimize packet delay while ensuring that forward link (FL) overhead is as low as possible. Two radio resource management (RRM) mechanisms, the time-scheduled (TS) scheme and the rate-controlled (RC) scheme, which can be used as the RRM schemes for the RL of 1&#215;EV-DV are introduced and compared. It is shown that the RC scheme offers a better sector throughput through higher rise-over-thermal (RoT) utilization with less FL overhead, while the TS scheme outperforms the RC scheme in terms of packet delay through the capability of fast rate adaptation. In addition, a hybrid RRM scheme, namely rate control with quick start (RCQS) is introduced to combine the advantages of the TS and RC schemes. It is shown that the throughput and delay of the RCQS are comparable to those of the RC scheme the TS scheme, respectively.

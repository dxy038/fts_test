Inroduction& Objective: Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthysmolitrix) is one of the most important cultivated warm water fish species. Several factors may play role in the fish health in breeding process. One of these is blood factors based on that fish health can be ensured. On the other hand, blood factors as a health symptom influenced by such factors as age and so on which have been studied in the paper. 
Materials and MethodsIn order to examine the effect of different ages in silver carp on blood cellular and biochemical parameters, blood sampling has been done for 800 pieces of silver carp through puncturing the caudal vessel Method in 12 cooperative reproduction and cultivation center (Kass fish) located in Rasht city so that 100 pieces were at the age of 9-months, +1, +2, +3 years.
Results:The results of statistical analysis indicated that the average hemoglobin concentration and its amount (MCHC) in globules increase by increasing the age and this increase is statistically different significantly in an age group to the other (P < 0.05). Calcium and glucose amount increase in the group with 12-months age rather than other ages with significant difference statistically (P < 0.05). White blood cell number (WBC), Hematocrit amount (HCT), Neutrophil account, cholesterol and protein level in the age group of 24-months shows increasing trend rather than other age groups with statistically significant difference (P < 0.05).  Triglyceride levels, hemoglobin (Hb), mean hemoglobin concentration in blood cells (MCHC), mean weight of blood hemoglobin (MCH) and number of Monocyte was increased in 36-month age group rather than other groups with significant difference (P < 0.05). 
Conclusion: Decreasing in inorganic phosphorus is more in 9-month age group has been seen with a significant difference (P < 0.05).

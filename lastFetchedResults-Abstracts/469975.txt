Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare biochemical androgen profiles in women treated with the contraceptive patch versus an oral contraceptive (OC).
Study design
Twenty-four healthy women were randomly assigned to receive 3 cycles of either the contraceptive patch (ethinyl estradiol [EE] 20 μg/d and norelgestromin 150 μg/d) or OC (EE 35 μg and norgestimate 250 μg). Blood samples were taken at baseline and end of treatment. Serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 3α-androstanediol glucuronide (3α-diol G) were quantified by immunoassay methods; free T was calculated. The paired t and Student t tests were used for statistical analysis.
Results
Nineteen women completed the study (patch, n = 10; OC, n = 9). Despite a 1.6-fold relative increase in SHBG levels with the patch versus OC (449% vs 274%, P = .03), free T decreased equally in both groups (patch 60%, P< .0001; OC 59%, P< .0001). DHEAS decreased by 26% in the patch group (P< .01) and 32% in the OC group (P< .001). 3α-diol G was reduced by 52% in the patch group (P< .0001) and 51% in the OC group (P< .0001). In addition, the OC was associated with significant decreases in A and DHT.
Conclusion
The contraceptive patch had an effect comparable to the OC on several key androgenic markers. Given these biochemical findings, the contraceptive patch has significant potential as a therapeutic agent for disorders of androgen excess.

The paper has as objective to implement, in hardware-making use of FPGA technology, the algorithms that are considered as standard for the comparison and the global and local alignment of the DNA genetic sequences. These algorithms use the dynamic programming technique. These algorithms were implemented in software (C language) and, later, the hardware implementation (using VHDL and FPGAs). We compare our obtained software and hardware results, by the execution time of the algorithms, and it was possible to verify that our hardware implementation is better than our software version and others bioinformatics-platforms.

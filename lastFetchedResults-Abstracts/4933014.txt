In this paper, we first describe a multi-objective supply chain model and the optimization problem in Supply Chain Management (SCM), which includes measurements of cost, customer service fill rates and delivery flexibility. This model incorporates production and delivery. Then, we present an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) application to the solution of some multi-objective optimization problems. We discuss how our approach may be useful for the Multi-Objective supply chain optimization.

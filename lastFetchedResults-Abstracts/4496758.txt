Motor rehabilitation is a process that needs, in most cases, specialists that indicate exercises to do, and, generally, professionals that follow the patient performance most of the time. Moreover, there is a lake of objective measures to evaluate in detail the execution of exercises and the patient evolution. In order to improve the motor rehabilitation process, a new low-cost system is presented here that allows, in a first stage, the use of last generation tools for the development of customizable standing exercises. This new system is being validated in an important rehabilitation center. The first validations that are taking place indicate that this system contributes with promising features, permitting lesser dependence of the patient in relation to the specialist, providing objective measures of evolution of the patients in the realization of exercises, and increasing the patientÂ´s motivation in the rehabilitation process.

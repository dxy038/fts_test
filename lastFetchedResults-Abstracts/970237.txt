A new concept for a monolithic labchip platform to combine standard CMOS-integrated circuit technology and novel solid-state components is presented. The capability to perform laboratory analysis operations on small-scale labchip devices holds exceptional advantages compared to commonly used diagnostic instrumentation. The objective is to improve cost-efficiency, performance and functionality of chemical or biological systems on-a-chip by increasing the level of integration and miniaturization. The integration of hydrogenated amorphous silicon color sensors enables a novel combinatoric labchip-based chemical verification method in a specifically arranged microarray of capillaries and sensors. To test the labchip functionality, results about an electrophoretic separation as well as a pH-sensitive luminescent sensor complex are shown.

In other words, 32.22% of women tended to cosmetic surgery. The variables, social comparison of the body, reference groups, cultural, economic and social capital, had a significant correlation with women's tendency to cosmetic surgery and these variables explained up to 43% of the variance of cosmetic surgery. The variables, age, education, media and social capital had a significant indirect effect and the variables, social comparison of the body, reference groups, cultural and economic capital had a significant direct effect on the women's tendency to cosmetic surgery.

At the present time there are many Peer-to-Peer (P2P) multicasting systems supporting live streaming, i.e. real-time dissemination of various content issued at a source node towards a set of receivers. The objective of content distributing can be twofold: maximization of the system throughput (i.e. the streaming rate) and minimization of the streaming cost while guaranteeing the particular streaming rate. In this we paper we focus on P2P multicasting applied for delivering very important content, which need delivery guarantees, e.g. weather forecast, hurricane warnings, distribution of security updates, stock exchange data, etc. To protect the system against failures several (at least two) multicasting trees are established. We tackle the question of how additional survivability constraints guaranteeing failure-disjoint trees influence the cost and throughput of the P2P multicasting system. We consider failures of the following network elements: overlay link, upstream node and ISP link. To investigate the problem we use both simulations and offline optimization methods. According to our results, the additional requirements necessary for protection do not have a substantial impact on the P2P multicasting system performance.

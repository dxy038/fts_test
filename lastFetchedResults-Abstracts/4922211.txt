This paper presents a new metric for the quality assessment of stereoscopic image. Quality assessment of stereoscopic image has different from 2D image, since stereoscopic image contains depth information. We combine depth saliency map with MSSIM algorithm to assessment JPEG distorted stereoscopic image quality. The experimental results show that the proposed method could accurate and objective evaluation of stereoscopic images quality.

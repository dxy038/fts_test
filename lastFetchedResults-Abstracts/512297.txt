Rewards systems are one of the most significant issues of the human resource management. Throughout the literature, it is obvious that theorists and academics, as well as practitioners and managers emphasize the important factor of rewards. Additionally, job satisfaction is another crucial term within the same body of literature. Job satisfaction is likely to provide employees of all levels with feelings of fulfillment, achievement and even pleasure for their job. Thus, such feelings can make people more productive, creative and therefore more profitable for the organization. Furthermore, feelings of job satisfaction can strengthen the commitment and loyalty of employees with the organization, which is very necessary in present times where all firms are looking for competitive advantage and especially through their people. The objective of this study is to examine the correlation of the rewards systems and job satisfaction, based on a qualitative research. An attempt is also made to identify differences in rewards systems and the extent to which these differences influence job satisfaction among people in different organizational level. Qualitative evidence was found for the aspects of satisfaction in accordance with different kinds of rewards, focusing on the four hierarchical levels of an organization. One of the challenges of the study and its strength is the transitional stage that the organization is in, and the sub-cultures that have been created. Future research should measure crucial factors as behaviors, attitudes, performance and how these results can be linked to contextual elements and to employment performance. This study contributes to increase job satisfaction awareness, which is important for organizational development

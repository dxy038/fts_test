A cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) is excited by a thick ground plane slot, which is fed by a capacitive waveguide junction (CWJ) coupled waveguide end. The objective of using a CWJ is to substantially increase the power coupling to the DRA. The DRA when given an offset along its length and width relative to the slot leads to wide band operation of the DRA. Measurements were carried out to verify the simulations and a reasonable agreement between them is obtained.

The future trend in vehicular design for which environmental concerns is must, for that electric drive is a choice. This study is about the hybrid electric vehicle (REV) with new topology Powered by the bidirectional DC/DC converter with the eco-friendly sources like solar energy and fuel cell. Ecofriendly sources with the integration of bidirectional DC/DC converter have improved efficiency and are making tough competition for fossil fuel driven vehicles. Electric energy generated by these ecofriendly sources is stored in energy storage system (ESS) and used for propulsion. In this paper the discharge of energy during acceleration of vehicle is recharged by braking in vehicle i.e. Propulsion machine and charge is stored in battery by bidirectional converter. The operation of solar with MPPT, fuel cell, bidirectional converter, and electric drive wheels are investigated by simulation in this paper.

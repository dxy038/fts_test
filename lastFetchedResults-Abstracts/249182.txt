The problem of design optimization is of high industrial interest, and has been extensively studied for years,
with excellent results. However, there is the well-known issue of a reasonable balance between the compu-
tational e ort usually required by stochastic methods, and the fact that deterministic optimizers, even though
much more e cient, are not guaranteed to localize a good minimum, as they can remain trapped in the  rst
found local one. To overcome these problems, the authors developed a hybrid strategy, which gave good
results in terms of speed and reliability of the obtained optima, especially when the objective function is
obtained through a  nite element analysis, due, for example, to the absence of an analytical solution of the
problem, and the direct use of a stochastic method would be unfeasible for practical purposes, because of
the intolerable processing time required

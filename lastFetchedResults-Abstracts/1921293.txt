Tissue Doppler imaging measurements could be used to quantitate ventricular function in patients with systemic single ventricles. The objective of the present study was to measure the tissue doppler imaging-derived indexes of function and dyssynchrony in patients with single ventricular physiology and compare these values with those from control patients. Echocardiograms were performed in patients with single left or right ventricular physiology and control patients. Measurements were made of the free walls at the level of the atrioventricular annulus. Differences were assessed with one-way analysis of variance. Post hoc comparisons were performed with a Tukey adjustment. No significant difference was present in age among the control (5.75 ± 1.73 years, n = 16), single left ventricle (7.07 ± 2.81 years, n = 12), or single right ventricle (6.25 ± 2.2 years, n = 14) groups. The single right ventricular free wall peak systolic annular, peak early diastolic annular, and peak late diastolic annular velocities were significantly lower and the myocardial performance index and interval to mechanical activation greater compared to the controls. The single left ventricular free wall peak systolic annular, peak early diastolic annular, and peak late diastolic annular velocities were also significantly lower and the myocardial performance index and interval to mechanical activation greater compared to controls. In conclusion, significant decreases in systolic and diastolic function, as well as differences in dyssynchrony, using tissue doppler imaging exist in patients with single ventricular physiology compared to control patients.

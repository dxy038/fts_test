In this paper, an adaptive video de-interlacing algorithm based on motion characteristics detection jointly considering the advantages of three existing schemes is proposed. In the proposed method, the difference of the previous field pixels and the current field pixels are calculated. The fast or slow of the motion of the current frame is determined by the difference of the previous and the current field pixels. Afterwards, the appropriate scheme such as the weave, line average or edge line average de-interlacing schemes is selected and performed on the selected field. Through the proposed algorithms, the performance of the proposed method in terms of subjective and objective qualities can be significantly improved.

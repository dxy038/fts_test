An antenna system with an objective lens and phase shifters at each output radiating element, combined with a multiple beam feed network, is known to provide a set of overlapped subarrays for broadband beam steering. Such systems require extremely high dynamic range from any T/R module used at the front-face of the feed. Here, it is shown that by displacing the feed array and refocusing the individual subarrays, the dynamic range and power distribution problems can be avoided.

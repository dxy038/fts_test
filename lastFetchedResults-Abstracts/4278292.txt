In this paper we are interested in the MIMO backstepping control technique with acceleration feedback in order to track a trajectory generated by a way-point guidance system. The control objective is to reach the desired waypoints, with a desired surge. Here, the surge controller is designed with an integrator backstepping control that takes the propeller model and the motor model into account. In order to generate a realistic trajectory between two consecutive waypoints, the guidance system takes into consideration the torpedo´s dynamics and kinematics. The numerical simulations in the presence of marine current and of torpedo´s parameters uncertainties show the robustness of the MIMO backstepping control loop associated with the acceleration feedback loop. In the same time, the generation of a realist trajectory, generated from the torpedo´s hydrodynamic model, assures a feasible trajectory tracking. The implementation of a MIMO backstepping control with acceleration feedback, and of an integrator backstepping control in a heavyweight torpedo of type F17 mod2, designed by DCN Armes sous-marines, is the main contribution of this work

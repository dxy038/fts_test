The problem of threat detection in an unstructured environment is considered. Three systems, comprising of robots and sensors, are proposed to form a system of systems (SoS) to find a solution to the problem. System interactions are defined to provide a framework for formulation as an SoS optimization problem. Different cost and objective functions are introduced for optimization of local criteria. Using different weights, a linear combination of the local cost and objective functions is obtained to propose a global objective function. An algorithm is suggested to find an optimum value for the global objective function leading towards optimization of the SoS.

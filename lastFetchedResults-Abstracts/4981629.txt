This paper proposes a new medium-access control (MAC) protocol designed for wireless sensor networks. A wireless sensor network is an array of large number of sensors interconnected by a multi-hop ad-hoc network. The fundamental objective for sensor network is low-power consumption while latency is usually less important. This characteristic of sensor network motivates different MAC layer design from the conventional wireless network to reduce power consumption. In this paper novel algorithm based on distributed mediation device (DMD) protocol has been introduced that utilized distributed node scheduling strategy to dramatically increase energy saving principally in intermediate devices within a multi-hop communication. The simulation results have shown noticeable power consumption improvement compared with Sensor MAC (S-MAC) and 802.11-like protocols especially in the large scales achieved in trade of more latency in the network.

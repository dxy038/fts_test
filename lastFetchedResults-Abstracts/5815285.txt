From system-on-chip (SOC) perspective, memory bandwidth plays an important role in system performance for video coding applications. Owing to the locality of video data, the data reuse scheme is widely applied to reduce the memory bandwidth requirement. For further improvement of performance, frame-based data reuse scheme, single reference frame and multiple current macroblocks (SRMC), can provide more efficient solution; however, the coding efficiency could be sacrificed. For scalable video coding (SVC), the coding efficiency is more precious than it of single layer coding scheme. For this reason, the bidirectional-based SRMC is proposed for hierarchical B frame in SVC. The proposed method efficiently stores temporary backward or forward prediction information for final mode decision. Based on our method, the saved ratio of memory bandwidth is as high as 34% to 65% under various display specifications.

The use of biomarkers such as cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) or metallothionein (MT) for pollution monitoring is based on the assumption that an increased activity or concentration is primarily caused by exposure to contaminants. Previous studies have shown that the response of biomarkers may be affected by factors such as season, temperature, gender, nutritional status or size. The objective of the present study was to identify natural factors that affect the hepatic activity of CYP1A and hepatic concentration of MT in flounder (Platichthys flesus L.). Thirty flounder were sampled at each of two sites in the Hvaler archipelago, southern Norway, monthly through one year. A set of variables were recorded for each sampling and individual including water temperature, salinity, external and internal lesions, intestinal content, sex, size and organ weights. Hepatic CYP1A activity (EROD), MT and metal concentrations were determined for each individual flounder. The influence of environmental and endogenous factors on the response of these two biomarkers was assessed in multiple regression models. For both biomarkers, 50â€“60% of the total variability could be explained from factors directly related to season, gender and maturation. Season contributed significantly in the model for EROD, as did external lesions. Size, condition and diet did not contribute greatly when the above factors were included. The results confirm previous findings that season, gender and maturation must be taken into account in biomarker monitoring, but also indicate that other factors such as external lesions should be considered.

A tuned mass damper with a nonlinear power law viscous damper excited by white noise is considered. The system is analyzed by statistical linearization and stochastic simulation with the objective of minimizing the standard deviation of the response. It is shown that the optimal parameters for the tuned mass damper are unaffected by the magnitude of the structural damping in the linear case. However, in the nonlinear case the structural damping influences the equivalent parameters obtained by statistical linearization and thereby indirectly the optimal values for the damper parameters. Results from stochastic simulation show good agreement with results from statistical linearization in terms of the standard deviation of the response. It is shown that the optimal damping, which can be obtained by the passive device, is the same for the linear and nonlinear damper. However, for the nonlinear tuned mass damper the optimal parameters will depend on both structural damping and excitation intensity (or vibration amplitude). The results are presented in such a way that they can be used directly for the design of a tuned mass damper with damping governed by a nonlinear viscous power law.

Tridentate Schiff base–ruthenium(II) complexes containing soft phosphorus or sulfur donor atoms were prepared, and their bidirectional thermal and photo substitution reactions were investigated. In acetonitrile, the chloro ligands of trans(Cl,Cl)[RuCl2(ppb-etol)(PPh3)] (1, ppb-etol=2-(Ph2P)C6H4CHN(CH2)2OH) were substituted by acetonitrile molecules stepwise to yield [RuCl(CH3CN)(ppb-etol)(PPh3)]Cl (2) (first step) and [Ru(CH3CN)2(ppb-etol)(PPh3)]Cl2 (3) (second step). Complexes 2 and 3 reverted to complex 1 in acetonitrile upon irradiation with UV–Vis light. Similar thermal and photo substitution reactions were also observed for trans(Cl,Cl)[RuCl2(btb-etol)(PPh3)] (4, btb-etol=2-(tBuS)C6H4CHN(CH2)2OH). The substitution rates were measured for the first-step reactions of complexes 1 and 4 over the temperature range of 19.5–29.5 °C in acetonitrile. Kinetic parameters were determined to be kobsd=(1.13±0.04)×10−4 s−1 (25.0 °C), ΔH‡=83.1±1.7 kJ mol−1, and ΔS‡=−41.9±5.6 kJ mol−1 for complex 1, and kobsd=(1.57±0.06)×10−3 s−1 (25.0 °C), ΔH‡=88.8±1.9 kJ mol−1, and ΔS‡=−0.9±6.5 kJ mol−1 for complex 4. Accordingly, the substitution reaction of complex 4 proceeded faster than that of complex 1. The structures of [RuCl2{ppb-(1R,2S)-ephe}(PPh3)] (5, ppb-(1R,2S)-ephe=2-(Ph2P)C6H4CHNCH(Me)CH(Ph)OH), complex 2, and [Ru(CH3CN)2{ppb-(R)-btol}(PPh3)](BF4)2 (6, ppb-(R)-btol=2-(Ph2P)C6H4CHNCH(Et)CH2OH) were determined by X-ray analyses. In each complex, the geometry around the ruthenium atom is distorted octahedral, and the tridentate Schiff base and triphenylphosphine ligands occupy the equatorial positions.

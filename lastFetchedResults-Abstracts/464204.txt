OBJECTIVE: To document the feasibility of a control population for a randomized controlled trial, we report our experience in managing hypertensive pregnancies without seizure prophylaxis.
STUDY DESIGN: An 8-year cross-sectional study in one institution was performed of all hypertensive patients.
RESULTS: Of 467 patients with preeclampsia or superimposed preeclampsia managed without seizure prophylaxis, 18 had seizure activity, 3.9% (95% confidence interval 2.3% to 6.0%). There was no seizure-related maternal mortality or major morbidity, and the perinatal mortality rate after 28 gestational weeks was the same in patients with or without seizures. By logistic regression seizures were 17.4 times more likely in preeclampsia and 8.1 times more likely in chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia, compared with gestational or chronic hypertension alone.
CONCLUSION: The rate of seizures in patients with preeclampsia or superimposed preeclampsia managed without seizure propylaxis was low and unassociated with an increase in maternal or perinatal mortality. A control arm is feasible in a randomized, controlled trial to address the issue of whether antiseizure medication can prevent eclampsia.

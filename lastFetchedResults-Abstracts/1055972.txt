Objective: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of lichenoid reactions to Anti Hyperglycemic Agents.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive and analytic study, we examined the oral mucosa of 411 patients at the age of 29 to 85 in 3 groups who consumed various antihyperglycemic agents.
Results: In overall, 31 patients had lichenoid reactions (12 patients taking glibenclamide, 1 patient taking metformin and 18 patients taking glibenclamide with metformin) and there was a significant difference between the groups (P = 0.013). The most of the lesions were at the age's upper than 60 years. From 31 patients with lichenoid reactions, 14 subjects (45%) were male and 17 subjects (55%) were female.
Conclusion: Prevalence of lichenoid reactions in this study was 7.5% approximately. By considering the significant difference among the groups in the incidence of lesions, the significant effect of glibenclamide in inducing lichenoid reactions can be considared.

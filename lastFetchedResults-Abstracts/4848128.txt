This paper proposes a novel drawing medium developed with the use of rapid-prototyping technology. It presents a medium for enabling the capture of three-dimensional gestural marks and for their subsequent realization in solid form. These proposals are contextualised with an outline of the progress and rationale of an ongoing project which uses the technology to explore objective drawing in three dimensions.

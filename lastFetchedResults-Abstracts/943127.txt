BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the commonest compression neuropathy and surgical decompression is the popular treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of operative treatment of CTS based on physical examination and electrodiagnosis (EDX) in Shahid Yahyanejad and Shahid Beheshti hospitals (Babol; Iran 2001-2007)
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on all patients who were operated for CTS in Shahid Yahyanejad and Shahid Beheshti hospitals of Babol from 2001 to 2007. Patients who were dissatisfied according to their self estimation called self image dissatisfied included in the study and evaluated clinically and electro diagnostically. Patients with positive clinical findings called as clinical dissatisfied and patients with positive clinical and electrophysiological findings called as real dissatisfied patients. Collected data were evaluated.
FINDINGS: Out of 169 patients who participated in the study, 22 (13%) were self image dissatisfied and 147 (73%) were satisfied. Fourteen (8.3%) of self image dissatisfied patients had positive clinical findings (clinical dissatisfied) and 9 (5.3%) had positive clinical and electrodiagnostic findings (real dissatisfied). Electrodiagnostic study in self image dissatisfied, cured and clinical dissatisfied patients was normal in 9 (41%), 6 (75%) and 3 (21.55) patients, and it was abnormal in 13 (59%), 2 (25%) and 11 (78.5%) patients, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: The results showed there was no clear correlation between clinical and electrodiagnostic improvement of CTS and combination of clinical and electrodiagnostic improvement is supposed to be reliable.

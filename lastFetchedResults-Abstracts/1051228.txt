Background and Objective: Multiple sclerosis is the most common neurological diseases that cause disability in the nervous system which reduces quality of life. Stretching exercise is a low-cost and non-invasive method that can be used to improve physical health composite. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of stretching exercises on the physical health composite for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
Materials and Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 90 patients with MS were recruited from Tehran MS association and Sina hospital research center. Subjects were divided into two groups of experimental and control. MSQOL-54 scale was used to evaluate the physical health for both groups at first. Then, the correct way of exercises is taught to patients. Experimental groups did stretching exercise for 12 weeks, three times every week. Subjects in control group did not have any intervention. Quality of life was again measured in both groups after 12 weeks. Collecting method was based on personal information and MSQOL-54. The data were analyzed by SPSS software version 18. 

Results: There were no significant differences regarding physical health at baseline in the two groups (p=0.82). There was a significant result that shows physical health score in experimental group increases as compared to control group (p < 0.001). 

Conclusion: According to the present results, stretching exercise raises quality of life of multiple sclerosis patients. Therefore, this method is safe, simple, non-invasive and low-cost that is recommended

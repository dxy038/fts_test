MIT Lincoln Laboratory sponsored a radar short course at MIT campus during the January 2011 Independent Activities Period (IAP). The objective of this course was to generate student interest in applied electromagnetics, antennas, radio frequency (RF) electronics, analog circuits, and signal processing by building a short-range radar sensor and using it in a series of field tests. Lectures on the fundamentals of radar, modular RF design, antennas, pulse compression and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging were presented. Teams of three students built a radar system from a kit. This kit was developed by the authors and uses a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) architecture. To save costs, empty metal coffee cans are used for antennas, components are mounted on a wood block, the system uses only six coaxial microwave parts, analog circuitry on a solderless breadboard, and runs on eight AA batteries. Analog data is acquired by the audio input port on a laptop computer. The total cost of each kit was $360 which made this radar technology accessible to students. Of the nine student groups, all succeeded in building their radar, acquiring Doppler vs. time and range vs. time plots, seven succeeded in acquiring SAR imagery, and some groups improved the radar system. By presenting these difficult topics at a high level while at the same time making a radar kit and performing field experiments, students became self motivated to explore these topics and much interest in radar design was generated.

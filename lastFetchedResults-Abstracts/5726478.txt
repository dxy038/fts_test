This paper addresses the problem of resource allocation in a general multiple access scenario. Powers are supposed to be fixed and maximization of the bit rate is put as an objective, with a number of fairness constraints that provide each user with individual bit rates in proportion with their needs. Linear programming algorithms give the solution for the matched filter bound. As soon as the channels are frequency-selective, the use of joint detectors is proposed. An adapted allocation algorithm is given, that implies the update of the joint detector performance for each iteration. A fast update algorithm is also proposed. Results are given for a 5-user powerline access network

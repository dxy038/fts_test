The objective of a software system evaluation framework is to assess the quality and sophistication of software from different points of view. The framework explicitly links process and product aspects with the ultimate utility of systems and it provides a basic set of attributes to characterize the important dimensions of software systems. We describe such a framework and its levels of categorization, and we analyze examples of project classifications. Then we draw some conclusions and present ideas for further research. This evaluation framework assesses a software systemÂ´s quality by consolidating the viewpoints of producers, operators, users, managers, and stakeholders

Background & Objective: Evaluating students’ ability in diagnosing and treating patients after graduation has been recognized as a priority for medical education. The aim of this study is to evaluate students’ ability after graduation from Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran, in diagnosing and treating orthopedic problems. 
Methods: This is a retrospective, cross sectional study carried out on 115 graduated general practitioners of 2001-2006 academic year. In this study, to evaluate the competency of general practitioners graduated from KUMS in musculoskeletal medicine, participants were asked to complete a standard questionnaire with 36 questions in 9 domains.
Results: The total competency of the studied people was 65%. The highest competency level was related to the domains of treatment of fractures and dislocation, the initial treatment of open fractures, and diagnosis of fracture and dislocation (80%, 77%, and 73%, respectively). The lowest competency level was related to the domains of congenital deformity of feet, musculoskeletal system tumors, and congenital dislocation of the hip (47%, 50%, and 52%, respectively). No difference was observed between men and women in the mentioned domains. 
Conclusion: The results of our study revealed that in general the competency of graduated physicians was average. Accordingly, it is recommended that universities recognize weaknesses of graduated general practitioners according to a compiled program. Moreover, annual education programs can prevent more problems from occurring in the work setting and higher levels of education of these general practitioners.

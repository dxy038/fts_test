In the aftermath of the Islamic Revolution and due to doubts cast on the usurious character of interests on debenture bonds, the Iranian legislator was led to replace the latters by the so-called profit-sharing securities (ORAGHE MOSHAREKAT).The enactment, of the law and regulation, (in 1997 and 1998) concerning the issuing of profit-sharing securities has given rise to doctrinal discussions regarding the mechanism and legal nature of these kinds of securities.

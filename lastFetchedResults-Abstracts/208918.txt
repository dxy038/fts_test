Oncorhynchus mykiss is said to be first species in family of salmonidae. In servers as one of the cheapest
source of protein for human being from aquaculture in Iran. Against of this background, culture of this
specimen was done at the Shahid Khiani farm, Chuebde under aquaculture division, Azad Islamic university,
Abadan. Main objective of thi pilot project was to study proper utilization of pond water resources in winter
at Choaebdeh to produce cheap protein source. Culture was started from December 2003 and harvested during
March 2004. There earthen ponds of 0.5 ha water spread area of each were stocked with 5000 no of fingerling
of 45 gm ABW at each pond initially. Fish were fed with chine trout feed GFT-1 and GFT-2 by following as
per demand feeding method. Biometry was done once in 15 days. Physico-chemical parameters of water of
these ponds were recorded daily during entire culture period. Finally, after harvesting data were analized to
get lengh-weight relationship as well as one-way ANOVA was done by using MINITAB , EXCEL. In case of
all these three groups, growth rate showed linear and isometrical. (b) Value among all three groups showed
non-significant growth rate.

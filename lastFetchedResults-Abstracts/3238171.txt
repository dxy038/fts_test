In this paper, a sliding mode control based multifunctional power converter is presented for electric vehicles and renewable energy applications. The proposed power converter is a multi-functional converter, which has capabilities of buckboost, bidirectional functions and even fault tolerance. Each mode of operation of the proposed system were analyzed and to validate the system, a prototype test-bed is built and tested using a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The results show that the proposed system could be applicable for energy (fuel cell/wind/solar) and electric vehicle application.

This paper presents alternative architectures for high split and long range bidirectional single mode fiber (SMF) super passive optical networks (SuperPONs). The erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) is introduced to enhance power budget. Three different alternative architectures are studied: 1) using transmission speed of 10 Gbit/s and 2.5 Gbit/s at same wavelength of 1550 nm; 2) using same transmission speed of 10 Gbit/s at wavelength of 1550 nm for downstream and 1530 nm for upstream; 3) using bidirectional EDFA at transmission speed of 10 Gbit/s and 2.5 Gbit/s with same wavelength of 1550 nm. The elaboration of architectures together with their advantages and disadvantages are included. The feasibility of deploying a SuperPON with 512 optical network units (ONUs) at transmission length of 100 km was observed from power budget studies.

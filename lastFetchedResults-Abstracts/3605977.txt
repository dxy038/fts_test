Anisotropic Mn-Al-C (Ni) magnets are potential substitutes for Alnico 5 and 8. The limited machinability of the alloy and the fact that it is cobalt-free made it particularly interesting. The low Curie point and the costly warm extrusion process needed for grain orientation are drawbacks. The objective of this study was a detailed magnetic characterization of the material for possible use in electric machinery. The principal subject of the study were the largest extruded bars presently available, of 31 mm diameter. Easy and hard axis magnetization curves and second-quadrant recoil loop fields were measured at various temperatures ranging from -50&#176;C to +150&#176;C. Property variations over the cross section of a bar were also studied.

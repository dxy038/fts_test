Objective: (1) To determine if there are changes in event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization (ERD/ERS) patterns when the movement is sustained? (2) To determine, from a technical point of view for ERD calculation, if it is possible to take the reference period during muscular activation?
Methods: Eight healthy subjects performed two series of brief and sustained self-paced extensions with their dominant wrist. The end of the sustained movement was externally triggered by the examinator. ERD/ERS was calculated in mu and beta bands from 13 source derivations covering motor areas, computed from 29 scalp electrodes. Movement onset and offset were determined by electromyographic activity (EMG) of wrist extensors.
Results: When the movement was sustained, power in the mu and beta bands returned to baseline values within 4â€“5 s. Movement duration had little effect, if at all, on both pre and post-movement periods. Compared to brief movement, after the onset of the prolonged movement, mu ERD just returned to baseline, without synchronization. In contrast, beta ERS was still present though earlier and much lower.
Conclusions: The reference period for ERD calculation may be taken during muscular activation if its duration is long enough. Beta synchronization may occur despite a non-deactivated motor cortex, suggesting a contribution from afferent somesthetic inputs.

Civil and military applications increasingly require agile antenna devices which respond to wireless telecommunications, radars and electronic warfare requirements. The objective in this paper is to present the design of a new agile antenna system called EBG Matrix antenna which must be controlled by a synthesis algorithm; this algorithm uses in its loop an analysis procedure which evaluates the radiation patterns. The principle of the antenna is explained and constitutes the subject of an accepted CNRS patent, numbered FR 11 62141. The results obtained by this antenna are good and interesting for many important applications. In order to optimize these results and to respond to several radiation targets, an analysis procedure and synthesis algorithms are indispensable. The aim of this paper is to design a new antenna system which will be used for beam forming, beam steering and geographical coverage applications.

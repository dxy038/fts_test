Objective Adolescent children of parents
with schizophrenia are generally overlooked in studies of
family burden. Few published data exist about this
younger cohort compared to adult family members such
as parents, spouses, and siblings.This pilot study aims to
examine the types of burden described by adolescent children
of parents with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.Methods
Thirteen adolescents (9F: 4M) between the ages of 13
and 18 who had at least one parent diagnosed with schizophrenia
were administered a semi-structured interview
as part of a pilot project to examine burden in this group.
Questions asked during the interview were directed at the
subject’s knowledge of the disorder, relationship with the
parent, impact of the disorder on personal life, coping
strategies used, and future concerns. Results Responses
showed that the adolescents were uninformed about their
parent’s illness, had difficulties dealing with symptoms
(positive and negative), were required to assume additional
household responsibilities, and were concerned
about their parent’s future welfare. Conclusion This pilot
study illustrates that children of individuals with schizophrenia
feel their lives are impacted by their parent’s illness.
More research is needed in this area to quantify and
describe the types of burden experienced by this vulnerable
group to ensure availability of adequate support

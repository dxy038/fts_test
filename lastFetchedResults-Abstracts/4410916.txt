In the Criminisi algorithm, the unreliability filling order will influence the inpainting quality. Our objective is to discover a method to mend this defect. An improved Criminisi algorithm was proposed by changing the priority and the confidence. We use (1) addition instead of multiplication in the computing of the priority function and the golden section as the weight ratio; and (2) introduce the logistic equation in the confidence update to avoid its rapid decay. Experiments show that our improved algorithm can obtain a better restore effect than that of the original Criminisi algorithm.

Objective Weight-bearing asymmetry is one of the main causes of balance disturbances in patients with&nbsp;hemiparesis and could cause standing problems and gait abnormalities for them. The purpose of this&nbsp;study was to investigate the immediate effects of wearing unilateral textured insoles on the symmetry of&nbsp;weight bearing during standing and gait parameters of patients with chronic stroke.
Materials & Methods In this quasi-experimental study, 16 patients with hemiparesis were selected by&nbsp;simple non-probability sampling method. These patients had an average age(SD) of 52.12(6.94) years&nbsp;and their average(SD) post-injury duration was 33.12(16.4) months. Symmetry index during standing&nbsp;position (by using 2 equal weighting scales), step length symmetry, step length, and walking velocity (by&nbsp;using NeuroCom Balance Master Device) was measured in 3 conditions: without insole (barefoot), wearing&nbsp;textured insole with shore A-80 hardness, and textured insole with shore A-60 hardness.
Results In this study, we conducted the multivariate analysis of variance for comparing 3 test conditions&nbsp;and Bonferroni test for paired comparing. The symmetry of step length showed a significant difference&nbsp;between no insole condition and using insole with A-80 hardness (P=0.004), as well as using A-80 hardness&nbsp;insole with A-60 hardness insole (P=0.011). However, there was no significant difference between&nbsp;using no insole and using insole with A-60 hardness (P=0.325). The results of symmetry index likened
the step length results. This means that there was a significant difference between not using insole and&nbsp;wearing insole with A-80 hardness (P=0.022), also between the results of wearing 2 different insoles&nbsp;(P=0.019). However, no significant difference was observed between using no insole and using insole&nbsp;with A-60 hardness in spite of improvement in step length (P=0.325). Velocity of walking and step length&nbsp;was not meaningfully improved in any of the conditions.
Conclusion The current study showed that obligatory use of affected limb side could improve symmetry&nbsp;of weight bearing in walking and standing position of patients with chronic stroke by overcoming the&nbsp;phenomenon of learned lack of using and correcting the failure of sending sensory signals to centers of&nbsp;movement controls. The results of this study showed that unilateral use of textured insole with shore&nbsp;A-80 in the unaffected side could immediately improve weight bearing symmetry and step length symmetry&nbsp;in patients with hemiparesis, but it has no effect on their walking speed and step length. Using&nbsp;insole with A-60 hardness did not significantly change any variables of tests. Considering the results of&nbsp;this study, these insoles can be used in balance exercises and walking of hemiparetic patients.

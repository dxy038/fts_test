This paper proposes a low computational method to perform ROI (Region Of Interest) based video encoding and adaptive streaming for remote rendering applications. The main objective of the proposed solution is to minimize the latency in the interactive loop even when facing poor transmission conditions. In order to do that, the knowledge of the depth map information provided by the rendering engine is exploited by the real-time video encoder to adapt the bitrate of the transmitted stream. Especially, thanks to an efficient coupling between the rendering and the video encoding stages, the macroblocks of each video frame are encoded with different quantization steps that follow an ROI partitioning. The details of this partitioning algorithm are provided as well with some implementation considerations. The simulation results demonstrate the benefit of our adaptive approach from the user experience point of view.

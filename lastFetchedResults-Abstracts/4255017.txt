Intra refresh is well-known as a simple technique for eliminating temporal error propagation in a predictive video coding system. However, for surveillance video systems, most of the existing intra refresh methods do not make good use of the properties of surveillance video. This paper proposes an efficient error recovery scheme using a novel intra refresh based on motion affected region tracking (MTIR). For every frame between two successive intra refresh frames, the motion affected regions are statistic analyzed and the error sensitive ones are intra refreshed in an refreshed frame. To suppress the potential spatial and temporal error propagation, constrained intra prediction is used for the intra refreshed macroblocks, and the reference number of an inter predicted frame which behinds an intra refreshed frame is limited. Experimental results show that compared with existing intra refresh methods and flexible macroblock ordering, the proposed method can achieve a considerable improvement on both objective peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) and subjective visual quality at the same bit rate and packet loss rate.

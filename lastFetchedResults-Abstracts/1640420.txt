The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of rejuvenator seal materials (RSM) on performances of hot asphalt mixtures (HMA). Firstly, frequency sweep test is conducted to determine the rejuvenating effect of RSM on aged asphalt binders. Then, high temperature performances of RSM treated HMA are studied by means of wheel tracking test, static creep test and indirect tensile test. Lastly, raveling test and skidding resistance test of RSM treated HMA are also performed in this paper. The results indicate that RSM can effectively soften the aged asphalt binder, and the application of RSM may decrease the high-temperature performance of HMA. Moreover, RSM increase the raveling resistance and decrease the skidding resistance of HMA. The results of this paper help to have a better understanding on the effects of RSM on HMA.

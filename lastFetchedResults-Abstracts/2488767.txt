Background and Objectives: There is evidence suggesting a relationship between flaxseed and NAFLD risk factor management including obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. The objective of present study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with Flaxseed on liver enzymes, hepatic fibrosis and steatosis in patients with NAFLD.

Materials and Methods: A two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 50 patients with NAFLD. The participants were assigned into a lifestyle modification (LM) on the NIH guidelines, or LM + 30 g/d brown milled Flaxseed for 12 weeks. Liver enzymes and hepatic fibrosis and steatosis were assessed at the baseline and at the end of the study. In addition, data were collected on anthropometric measurements and physical activity. The SPSS 20th version was used for data analysis.

Results: Among the 50 volunteers, 24 in the treatment group and 22 in the control group completed the study. At the baseline, no significant differences were seen in the background variables between the two groups. After 12 weeks, flaxseed supplementation was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the liver enzymes of alanin aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and &gamma-glutamyltransferas (P < 0.05). The mean reduction in fibrosis score in the flaxseed group was significantly greater than in the control group (-1.26 vs. -0.78 P = 0.03), similarly as steatosis score (-47 vs. -15.47 P = 0.04).

Conclusion: On the basis of the findings, it can be concluded that flaxseed supplementation can act as a new therapeutic approach in NAFLD management.

Air staging is defined as the supply of inadequate air from the primary stage to the reaction zone, and the completion of the air supply through the next stage or stages. This study is concerned with the optimization of the air staging system of a burner with two air inlets and one fuel (natural gas) inlet with the help of numerical modeling. The equivalence ratio of the primary air (with the assumption of a fixed total air mass flow rate), and the distance between the two air inlets constitute the design variables of the problem. In the previous research works, the air staging technology has been mainly employed as a method to reduce the emission of NO. However, in the current study, in addition to the emission of NO, the emissions of CO and soot, and radiative heat transfer from the flame are considered as the objective functions. The results show that increasing the level of air staging (or the equivalence ratio of the primary air) has contradictory effects on the objective functions so that, as positive influences, it increases the radiative heat transfer from the flame and decreases the emission of NO, and as negative effects, it increases the emission of both CO and soot. The results also indicate that when all the previously mentioned objectives are considered simultaneously, the optimal case, which is selected based on the Pareto front concept, is the case in which the primary air is about 20% of the theoretical air.

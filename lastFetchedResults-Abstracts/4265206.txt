In order to study the Benefit Distribution Mechanism of knowledge outsourcing contract in the technology alliance and the relationship between distribution factors, this paper assumes Alliance members, build the multi-objective optimization model to solve the distribution coefficient of Alliance members. The conclusion is that the income distribution coefficient is an increasing function of effort level and effort cost coefficient. And, with further research and development, the greater the effort level of the contribution coefficient, the greater the effort cost coefficient.

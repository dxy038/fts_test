Two cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) carrying a t(X;1)(p11.2;q21) in a 12-year-old boy and a 14 year-old girl, two cases with a t(X;1)(p11.2;p34) in a 9-year-old boy and a 31-year-old woman, and one case with a t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) in a 15-year-old boy are reported. Two are likely papillary RCC, with clear or slightly eosinophilic cells, and two to a clear cell RCC; one shows a mixture of papillary and clear cell RCC architecture. Renal cell carcinomas with translocations involving Xp11.2 form a specific entity characterized by subtle pathologic features and younger age of occurrence, especially for those with the t(X;17).

The shields of vacuum interrupter play an important role in absorbing the metal vapor and uniforming the electric field distribution. Thus, the breaking and closing performances of vacuum circuit breaker arc much influenced by the shields. In this paper, a 12kV vacuum interrupter has been taken as the investigation object, the E<sub>max</sub> the size, shape, location of the shields have been chosen as the objective function and optimization variables respectively. The optimization design is performed by solving the inverse electric field problem using the simulated annealing optimization strategy. The optimum size, shape and location of the shields to be designed are obtained. By comparing with present 12kV vacuum interrupter, it shows that a modern design technique for the shields of vacuum interrupter is provided in this paper.

The present research was conducted to determine the concepts governing the presence of water in architecture of
courtyard of Fin-e-Kashan Garden in order to link nature and architecture, tenderize human spirit and tranquility,
improve quality of present green spaces and identify urban spaces. Its purpose was to construct stable elements in
designing green spaces, especially water, with an approach toward the mentioned concepts and hidden values of the
Iranian garden. Reduced human-nature contact in recent decades has made different communities react to and consider
this issue. However, psychological need of humans for nature and concepts of water presence in spaces have received
less attention. This research was conducted using a descriptive-analytical method based on library and documentary
research to analyze spiritual and functional concepts of water presence in the courtyard of Fin-e-Kashan Garden. The
objective was to present a comprehensive and broad perspective from different dimensions of the concepts of water
presence in the life of Iranians and culture and history of this land so as to build complexes which are more coordinated
with mental and physical requirements of the contemporary human. Fin-e-Kashan Garden demonstrates the wise
relationship of human and nature. In the courtyard of Fin Garden, water with its deep and linking concepts and all its
fluidity and spacing properties is the most obvious element which, due to the aggregation in one place, induces ability
of creating a harmonic combination as a “concept”. The research results not only indicated wise and perfectionist
presence of this element in courtyard of Fin garden but also demonstrated precision of Iranian garden builders in terms
of water organization to account for spiritual-psychological needs of humans and invention of exquisite manifestation
to identify the garden so that functional and conceptual dimensions of water accounted for humans’ physical and
spiritual needs, respectively.

Background
l genetic alterations have been reported to contribute to the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Methylation of CpG-islands in cancer-related genes may serve as epigenetic biomarkers for oral cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The objective of this study was to analyze methylation profile of MGMT and CDH1 genes and their link with expression activity in patients with oral cavity cancer.
s
er hypermethylation status of MGMT and CDH1 genes were assayed by Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in OSCC (n = 76) tissues kept in paraffin and normal oral tissues (n = 57) served as control. Also, we investigated MGMT and CDH1 mRNA levels by real-time quantities reverse transcripts PCR. Methylation and mRNA expression profiles of these genes and their association with clinical data were determined.
s
nt promoter hypermethylation of CDH1 and MGMT genes were detected in 61.8% (47 of 76) and 73.7% (56 of 76) of the OSCC cases, respectively, with significant difference between cases and controls for MGMT (P = 0.027). CDH1 promoter methylation in cases and healthy controls was not significant. The mRNA expression level results showed statistically significant (P = 0.03) differences between cases and healty controls for the MGMT gene. However, the difference for the CDH1 gene was not significant.
sion
ndings, for the first time, in a South-Eastern Iranian population, indicate that the two genes are aberrantly methylated in OSCC, and that MGMT methylation may be considered as a potential molecular marker for the poor survival in advanced OSCC.

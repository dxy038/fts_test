The development of cloud computing technology has been continuously growing since its invention and has attracted the attention of many researchers in the academia and the industry, particularly during the recent years. The majority of organizations, whether large corporate businesses or typical small companies, are moving towards employing this cutting edge technology. Using private cloud provides low cost and privacy for workflow applications execution. However, an organizationÂ´s requirements to high performance resources and high capacity storage devices lead them to utilize public clouds. Public cloud leases information technology services in the form of small units and in larger scale compared to private cloud, but this model is potentially exposed to the risk of data breach and is less secure in comparison to a pure private cloud environment. The combination of public and private clouds is known as hybrid cloud, where workflow tasks can be executed on resources residing on either public or private clouds. The objective of this paper is to present a scheduling algorithm for maintaining data privacy in workflow applications, such that the budget is minimized, while the makespan limitation imposed by the user is satisfied.

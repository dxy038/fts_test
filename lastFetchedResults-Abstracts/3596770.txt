A new 75 T pulsed magnet design is now in evaluation at the NHMFL Pulsed Field Science Facility. The design incorporates improvements to the engineering template developed for the 65 T pulsed user magnets now at the NHMFL. The development of the 75 T magnet is part of the US-NSF effort to supply insert magnets for the DOE 100 T Multi-shot Pulsed Magnet Program. An important objective of the 75 T project is to gain experience operating insert-like coils at the same temperature, stress, and strain as will be encountered at 100 T. Two coaxially nested solenoid coils comprise the 75 T magnet. The windings are in series electrically. The inner "A" coil is constructed with materials &amp; techniques identical to those planned for the 100 T inserts. We have successfully trained the 75 T prototype to full field over 21 pulses of increasing intensity. The capacitor bank energy for a 75 T pulse is 1.49 MJ. This paper presents a review of the magnet design, operational performance data, and the developments impact on the design of future pulsed field user magnets and inserts for the US-DOE 100 T Multi-shot Pulsed Magnet Program

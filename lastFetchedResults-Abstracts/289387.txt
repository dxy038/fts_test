Objective
To assess the effect of ergot derivatives on cardiac valves in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
Materials and methods
Echocardiography was performed on 46 PD patients who used either pergolide or cabergoline (MonoPD) or both (MixPD) for a minimum of 1 year and 49 age-matched healthy controls. Valvular regurgitation was graded as mild, moderate and severe. MonoPD and MixPD groups were compared with regard to demographic features, drug profile and valvulopathy.
Results
The PD group had a mean age of 63 years, agonist duration of 3.8 years and agonist equivalent dose of 3.5 mg/day. Moderate regurgitation in all three valves was significantly more common in the PD group than the controls. Severe valvular regurgitation was not observed in either group, with the exception of one PD patient. The frequency of valvulopathy and doses of agonists did not differ between MixPD and MonoPD groups.
Conclusion
PD patients on dopamine ergot agonists are prone to moderate valvular regurgitation more than age-matched controls. However, the frequency of valvulopathy was similar in patients who used either one or more agonists.

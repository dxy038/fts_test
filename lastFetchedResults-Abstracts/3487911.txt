A specialized, small cyclotron has been developed for the sole objective of producing the principle isotopes used in positron tomography. The following features make it advantageous for clinical applications: 1) It is capable of producing high activity levels of the proper precursor chemical forms; 2) It is much smaller than other cyclotrons, having only slightly more than half the energy of the next smallest model in general use; 3) It is automated to operate under microprocessor control; 4) Its vertical beam plane design permits the external targetry to be recessed into the floor to minimize the amount of bulky neutron shielding material that must be added to the room; 5) It is a single particle accelerator, which simplifies the design and reduces the operational requirements; and 6) The translation of the cyclotron to various target positions permits the targetry with its many plumbing, gas transfer and electrical connections to remain stationary. The cyclotron is nearly ready for its in-factory acceptance tests, and installation is expected early next year in the Division of Biophysics of the University of California at Los Angeles. Following the installation, there will be a cooperative program between the Division of Biophysics and ORBIT, Inc. in the development of a microprocessor-controlled targetry and radiopharmaceutical synthesis system.

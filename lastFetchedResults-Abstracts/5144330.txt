The use of photonic materials has been driving the relative theory to the propagation of optical waves. The theory PBG (Photonic Band Gap) was developed initially for optical frequencies and can easily be applied to millimeters waves, microwaves and antennas. The presence of photonic materials as a substrate of planar antennas has some desirable characteristics, such as suppression of spontaneous emission and suppression of surface waves, allowing the coupling among the elements of the planar arrangement. The objective of this work is to make an elaborate analysis of these mechanisms using the method of Transverse Transmission Line - TTL, a full-wave method that provides efficient and precise results to arrangements of planar antennas with a PBG substrate.

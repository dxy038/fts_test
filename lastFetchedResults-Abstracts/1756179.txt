Objective
social research in arthritis consistently demonstrates a relationship between depression and disease characteristics such as severity of illness and physical disability. In this study, we examine how a history of clinical depression identified through diagnostic interviews influences disease outcome measures in patients with early inflammatory arthritis (EIA) in the absence of current depression.
s
ts in the early phase (more than 6-weeks, less than 1-year duration) of inflammatory arthritis were recruited from a larger EIA registry, which recorded sociodemographic data, current depressive symptoms and measures of disease severity. Current and history of major depression was assessed by a structured clinical interview. Eighty-one patients without current major depression were divided into two groups: 28 with and 53 without a history of depression.
s
were no significant differences between the two groups in age, sex, education, income, or level of current depressive symptoms. Compared with patients with no history of major depression, those with a history of depressive episodes had higher self-ratings of disease activity and were assessed as having more severe disease and poorer physical functioning by their physicians.
sion
tudy indicates that a history of major depression represents a risk factor for disease severity in EIA. This may reflect an enduring physiological effect of depression that influences subsequent inflammatory arthritis or an underlying shared process between these two disease entities.

Background and objectives: However, attaining this goal is made more complicated by genotype-environment interactions. The genotype by environment interaction is a major problem in the study of quantitative traits because it complicates the interpretation of genetic experiments and makes predictions difficult, also it reduces grain yield stability in different environments. Multi-environment trials are often analyzed to assess the yield stability of genotypes. Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model proved to be a powerful tool in diagnosing genotype × environment interaction patterns. The AMMI statistical model has been widely used to explain complicate G×E interaction, to enhance selection efficiency and to ensure genetic gain from selection. The objective of this research was to investigate the response of the lines in studied locations and to identify lines adapted to the test environments.

Materials and methods: In order to investigate response of wheat lines to different environmental conditions and determination of yield stability, this study was conducted by 76 recombinant inbred lines derived the cross between Roshan×Superhead based on randomized complete block design with two replications in five environments. The trials were performed at five locations in Kerman, Jopar, Mahan, Yazd and Ardakan. In order to evaluate the interaction and determine the stable lines, the stability analysis was done using AMMI methods. 

Results: The results of the combined analysis of variance revealed significant differences of grain yield among lines, environment and also line× environment interaction (P < 0.01). The results of Ammi2 bi-plot showed that the least distance from the center of bi-plot with minimum interaction were identified lines 3, 33, 22, 9, 271, 36, 309, 200, 114, 11, 264, 320, 194, 20, 280, 1, 26, 250, 19, 18, 25, 5, 322, 169, 152, 161 and 32 as stable lines and could be recommended for all location. Lines 258, 218, 176, 48, 82 and 314 for Yazd and line 225 for Ardakan indicated the best response and they had private adaptation to these places.  

Conclusion: Overall, based on the results of this experiment, among evaluated lines, lines number 9, 3 and 22 were introduced as general stable lines based on AMMI1, AMMI2 and AMMI stability value (ASV) parameter. Therefore, the identified promising lines can be recommended to complementary studies for introduce to farmers.

Background: Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is one of the most appropriate and cost-effective methods in infertility treatment.
Objective: We aimed to investigate effect of vaginal misoprostol on pregnancy rate after IUI.
Materials and Methods: Two hundred and ten infertile women who were referred to Infertility Clinic of Alzahra Hospital by an indication of IUI during 2012-2013 were randomly assigned to receive 200 ?g vaginal misoprostol (n=105) or vaginal placebo (n=105) after IUI. For detecting pregnancy, past 2 weeks, beta human chorionic gonadotropin evaluation was made and if positive, transvaginal sonography was done for evaluation of pregnancy 2-3 weeks later and clinical pregnancy was recorded.
Results: Pregnancy had been noted in 24 patients in misoprotol (22.9%) and 27 patients in placebo (25.7%) groups that this difference was not significant (p=0.748). In misoprostol group, 3 case of nausea and vomiting (2.9%) had been observed.
Conclusion: According to the results, administering 200 ?g vaginal misoprostol after IUI doesnâ€™t have significant effect on the success rate of IUI

The problem of determining admission controls and a path for each admitted user pair (session) to satisfy user quality of service (QOS) requirements (required throughput, tolerable average cell delay, and tolerable cell loss probability) is considered. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem. The objective is the maximization of the total reward for the admitted sessions where the reward for each session reflects its priority. The emphasis is on developing a real-time distributed algorithm to determine path assignments and admission controls. In computational experiments, the proposed distributed algorithm is compared with the minimum hop algorithm on test networks with up to 61 nodes and 10000 macro sessions. The proposed algorithm achieved a 36% (on the average) improvement in the total reward over a minimum hop routing algorithm and heuristic admission control scheme in less than 1.5 s of CPU time using distributed computation

The problem of <e1>H</e1><sub>&#8734;</sub> optimization subject to time-domain constraints over a finite horizon is considered. Given &#947;&gt;0 and a set of fixed inputs {<e1>w</e1><sup>i</sup>}, it is required to find a controller such that a closed-loop transfer matrix has an <e1>H</e1><sub>&#8734;</sub> norm less than &#947;, and the time responses to the signals <e1>w</e1><sup>i</sup> belong to some prespecified sets. First, the one-block constrained <e1>H</e1><sub>&#8734;</sub> optimal control problem is reduced to a finite-dimensional convex minimization problem and a standard <e1>H</e1> <sub>&#8734;</sub> optimization problem. Then, the general four-block <e1>H</e1><sub>&#8734;</sub> optimal control problem is solved by reduction to the one-block case. The objective function is constructed via state-space methods, and some properties of <e1>H</e1><sub>&#8734; </sub> optimal constrained controllers are given. It is shown how satisfaction of the constraints over a finite horizon can imply good behavior overall. An efficient computational procedure based on the ellipsoid algorithm is also discussed

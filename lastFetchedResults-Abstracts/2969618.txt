Previously, a two-phase handoff protocol has been proposed to support inter-switch handoff in wireless ATM networks. It employs path extension for each inter-switch handoff, followed by path optimization if necessary. In this paper, we propose a number of path optimization initiation schemes to facilitate the two-phase handoff protocol. The design objective is to determine the time to invoke path optimization such that the average cost per connection is minimized. Three path optimization schemes, namely: periodic, exponential, and Bernoulli, are proposed. A discrete-event simulation model is developed to compare their performance. Simulation results indicate that the Bernoulli path optimization scheme outperforms the other two schemes by providing a lower average cost per connection

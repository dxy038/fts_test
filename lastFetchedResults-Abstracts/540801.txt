The objective of this study was to assess the effect of excess body weight (BW) on blood cholesterol, triacylglycerol (TAG), acute phase proteins, and on urinary F2-Isopros- tane in healthy cats. Seven lean and 20 overweight cats fed ad libitum with the same food were investigated. The results show that excess BW is associated with increased oxidative processes in cats, as indicated by a significantly increased urinary F2-Isopros- tane/creatinine ratio in overweight cats. A significant and positive correlation between BW and urinary F2-Isoprostane/creatinine ratio was also detected, whereas other blood variables were similar in lean and overÂ¬weight cats. An age-effect was also observed on TAG plasma concentration, TAG being higher in older cats, with the difference coming from the overweight group.

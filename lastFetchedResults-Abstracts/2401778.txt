According to theoretical analysis of in-situ stress of coalbed and classic curves of hydraulic fracturing test in coal, this paper obtained typical analytic curves of hydraulic fracturing test. With the tested wells in southern Qinshui basin as research objective, the in-situ stress was measured in coal seam. Analysis and study of the hydraulic fracturing test data by log-log method and square root method were carried out to obtain the accurate in-situ stress of coalbed reservoir. The mutual verification of two methods was applied. The stress test data of coalbed reservoir are of great significance for exploration, test and subsequent extraction of coalbed methane operation..

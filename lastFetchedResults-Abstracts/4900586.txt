The objective of this research effort was to develop and demonstrate an integrated high-gain RF antenna and solar array technology for spacecraft application. The RF antenna technology selected was a printed microstrip reflectarray, which uses a large number of thin crossed dipoles as the radiating elements. A microstrip reflectarray has the capability of integration with a solar array

Detection of blood volume change in the skin by using Photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor is based on the principle that hemoglobin in the blood absorbs infrared light than the other tissue. Favorable optical window is around 990 nm range. The reflectance type photoplethysmographic sensor is designed using two different detectors. Objective is to compare the response of PPG sensor by using Light Dependent resistors (LDR) and OPT101 as a detector. Signal is recorded by placing the sensor on a finger tip for wavelength ranging from visible to near IR (400 to 1000 nm) range. It is observed that the PPG signal captured using LDR is around 660 nm wavelength but for the OPT101 response is 500 nm to 1000 nm. That is OPT 101 can be used to capture PPG in visible and infrared region. Brain mapping using optical sensor OPT101 is preferable for the measurement of blood volume and blood flow. For source of 660 nm, LDR or OPT 101 can be used to detect the peripheral pulse. LDR is not suitable for the measurement in infrared range.

This study uses a deterministic description of the surface, based on the radiosity method, that follows the evolution of a simple vegetation model. The models currently used in remote sensing applications are tested over that artificial surface through an inversion scheme and the evolution of the retrieved parameters evaluated. An attempt is also made to simply rely on parameters of the canopy for bidirectional reflectance model parameters. The results of the inversions and evolution of the parameters are presented and conclusions for remote sensing applications are underlined

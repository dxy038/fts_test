Resource allocation problem in high-speed railway wireless communication networks is one of the key issues to improve the efficiency of resource utilization. However, traditional resource allocation methods cannot be directly applied to this special communication system. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation approach for high-speed railway downlink orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. Sub-carriers, antennas, time slots, and power are jointly considered, which is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. The effect of the moving speed on Doppler shift is analyzed to calculate the inter-carrier interference power. The objective is to maximize the throughput under the constraint of total transmission power. In order to reduce computational complexity, suboptimal solution to the optimization problem is obtained by quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation strategy has a better performance compared with an existing one.

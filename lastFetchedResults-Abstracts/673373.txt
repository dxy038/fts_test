Introduction: One of the most important factors in driving is having a good visual acuity. It has been suggested that over 90% of the sensory information for driving is visual. Recent studies using alternative approaches, have demonstrated a relatively strong relationship between vision and driving performance measures.
Objective: The present study was designed to evaluate the visual impairment in the drivers of car accidents referred to Amiralmomenin Hospital during the research period.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive Cross -Sectional Study, the participants were selected by census sampling model; its content validity was evaluated and approved. All the drivers with accidents within Sep 2010 and Des 2011 were entered into this study. After the initial eye examinations and specific test, a questionnaire consisting of demographic data and history of eye and systemic diseases was completed.
Results: In total, 403 drivers entered into this study, 94% were male and average age was 36.17 Â± 11.38 years. Most accidents occurred on the road (65.8%) and in sunny weather (74.2%) and 96.3% of people had not any history of eye disease .Also, 96.3% of crashes happened for the drivers with normal visual acuity, visual field (1.7%), Stropsis 15.8% and abnormal color vision (5.9%). Besides, 33 drivers (2.8%) had a known eye disease with most of them-9 (2.2%) having Cataract disease 
Conclusion: It seems that visual filed test and color vision must be added to ophthalmologic examination before issuing driving license for the applicants and diabetic patients must undergo specific eye examination .These considerations could reduce car accidents and injuries.

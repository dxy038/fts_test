This paper describes work in progress to extend component models to support master-worker applications and to let them to be executed on grid infrastructures. The proposed approach is generic enough to be applied to existing component models such as the OMG CORBA and the ObjectWeb FRACTAL component models. One objective of our research is to relieve grid application designers of managing low level programming and implementation aspects. With the proposed approach, a designer has only to cope with the description of an abstract view of the application architecture in which he has to specify what the master and the workers have to do while leaving the system environment to manage the low level aspects such as communication between the master and the workers.

This paper develops a new method for minimizing intersection delay based on linear and nonlinear program. On the basis of geometric construction, a new set of formulas are proposed to estimate the steady-and-oversaturation delay. As a dynamic model, it can automatically allocate the green time to obtain the minimal delay. Since the objective function of delay is linear or nonlinear, only the combination of linear and nonlinear program can be applied to random situation. The two objective functions, subject to corresponding constraints, can achieve the best split green ratios by MATLAB. The simulation result shows that green splits got by LP combined with NLP can obtain less delay than using fixed green splits.

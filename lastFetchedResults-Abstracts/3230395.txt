The proposed converter interfaces two unidirectional input power ports and a bidirectional port for a storage element in a unified structure. This converter is interesting for hybridizing alternative energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) source, fuel cell (FC) source, and battery. Supplying the output load, charging or discharging the battery can be made by the PV and the FC power sources individually or simultaneously. The proposed structure utilizes only four power switches that are independently controlled with four different duty ratios. Depending on utilization state of the battery, three different power operation modes are defined for the converter. And also the control for the proposed converter is done using PI and PID controllers. The output of the proposed converter is converted to AC using a single phase inverter. The validity of the proposed converter, its control and AC output are verified by simulation.

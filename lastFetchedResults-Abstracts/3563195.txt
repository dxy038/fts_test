A new generalized average mutual information measure (GAMIM) is introduced in terms of Csiszar <img src="/images/tex/101.gif" alt="\\phi"/> -divergence, and the associated rate distortion function <img src="/images/tex/4915.gif" alt="R_{\\phi}"/> is studied. The main objective is to derive in a unified way a dual representation of <img src="/images/tex/4915.gif" alt="R_{\\phi}"/> , then to use it to generalize classical results (corresponding to <img src="/images/tex/4916.gif" alt="\\phi(t) = t \\log t"/> ) in rate distortion theory and extend results associated with other concepts of GAMIM. Our development uses the methodology of convex programming duality extensively.

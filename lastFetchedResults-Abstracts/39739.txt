The main objective of this study was to determine the optimum composition of a reactive porous medium containing sand and metallic iron, to be used for Fe(0)-assisted hydrogenotrophic denitrification. This determination is important to ensure that the end-product distribution after such treatment is acceptable, i.e., ammonia formation due to abiotic nitrate reduction by metallic iron in such media is minimized, while a reasonable rate of biological denitrification is maintained. Based on a previous study it was established that steel wool, with its relatively low specific surface area, exhibited the least propensity to abiotically reduce nitrate. It was also established that to achieve acceptable end-product distribution, the steel wool concentration in the reactive porous media has to be lowered even below the lowest value, i.e., 4.0  g steel wool/m^3 of sand, used during that study. It was further hypothesized that to counter any detrimental effect of lower steel wool concentration on biological nitrate removal rate, increase of the retention time in porous media to values higher than 13 days, the maximum value investigated in that study, may be necessary. In the present study, experiments were conducted in batch reactors containing denitrifying microorganisms and various concentrations of steel wool and in semibatch reactors containing sand seeded with denitrifying microorganisms and various concentrations of steel wool. Based on the results of the semibatch experiments, it appears that to achieve acceptable end-product distribution, the steel wool concentration in the reactive porous media has to be maintained around 2.0  g steel wool/m^3 sand and the corresponding retention time in the reactive media must be around 26 days.

WHAT IS YOUR DIAGNOSIS?
A 2-monthâ€“old female infant was referred to our center with disseminated lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomagaly. At
birth, she was presented with fever and respiratory distress and underwent sepsis workup . Antibiotic therapy was initiated
for her but the fever continued despite administration of broad spectrum antibiotics. Abdominal sonography was performed
which revealed paraaortic lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Biopsy of para-aortic lymph nodes showed
necrotizing granulomatosis inflammation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) became positive for Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex. (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, bovis, avium, and BCG). Her parents were evaluated for TB for which
the results were negative. She had a history of BCG vaccination at birth. An anti-tuberculosis regimen (INH, RIF, ETB, PZA
and Amikacin) was initiated for her. She showed no improvement during two months and therefore, she was referred to our
center for further evaluation. On arrival her physical examination showed hepatosplenomegaly and cervical
lymphadenopathy. On laboratory tests, CBC and Liver function tests were normal. Tripled gastric aspirate test for
M.tuberculosis was negative. Parahillar lymphadenopathy and parenchymal lung involvement were detected in spiral chest
CT-scan (Figure 1). Her parents were evaluated for tuberculosis for the second time. Their CXR, chest CT-scan, sputum
culture and PPD results were unremarkable. No history of TB was reported in her family and relatives. Her treatment regimen
was altered. After 6 months, she became totally symptom free. Lymphadenopathies were diminished and chest CT-scan
result was normal (Figure 2). During this period her mother developed diarrhea and a month later she was diagnosed with
ascites for which she underwent diagnostic tests.

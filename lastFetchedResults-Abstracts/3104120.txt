We describe an all-SiC 0.25 MHz 5 kW multiphase dc/dc bidirectional boost converter that serves as a charger for the intermediate high-voltage energy storage device (e.g. ultracapacitor) in a plug-in-hybrid vehicle (PHEV). The primary focus of this paper is to report the high-temperature efficiency of the SiC VJFET and SiC Schottky based robust converter and identify the key loss components.

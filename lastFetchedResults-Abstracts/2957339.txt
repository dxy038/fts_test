Summary form only given. Thirty-nine professionals representing 19 countries attended an International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering Accreditation in Salt Lake City, Utah, November 10-11 1996. Some of the findings and conclusions of the workshop are: program accreditation is recognized as an effective mechanism for assisting in quality assurance of academic programs, and enhancing the opportunities for international interchange; there is significant international interest in the expansion and coordination of accreditation of academic programs in computer science and engineering; there is a significant need to exchange information regarding all aspects of the accreditation process; and a &#8220;Salt Lake City Accord&#8221;, for international mutual recognition of accreditation of computer science and engineering should be a long-term objective of all attending the workshop. Since the Workshop, a number of events appears to confirm those findings. The status of computer science and engineering accreditation world wide is reported and, in view of the developments, the ways and means to achieve the &#8220;Salt Lake City Accord&#8221; are discussed

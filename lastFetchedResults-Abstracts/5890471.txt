Mosaic-type combinable flatbed vehicle has multiple axles and all wheels are involved when the vehicle is turning. Through the analysis to certain mosaic-type combinable flatbed vehicle´s four-axle steering mechanism, the simulation model of steering mechanism was built. After this, the simulation optimization and analysis to model was done with ADAMS software. The results of the analysis show that the objective function´s value of the optimal vehicle steering mechanism model is superior to the objective function´s value of the initial model.

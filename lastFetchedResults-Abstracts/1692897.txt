With the objective of detection and identification of explosives, different organic compounds, including aromatic nitrocompounds, RDX, anthracene, 2,4-diaminotoluene (DAT), 4-methyl-3-nitroaniline (MNA) and pentaerythritol (PENT) have been analyzed by laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). To avoid the secondary ionization and to discriminate between the spectral contribution due to air from that of the compound in the plasma generated in air, the emission signatures from atomic lines (C at 247.9 nm, H at 656.3 nm, N at 746.8 nm and O at 777.2 nm) and molecular bands (CN at 388.3 nm and C2 at 516.5 nm) have been investigated in plasmas generated in air and in helium. The different possible pathways leading to the observation of molecular emissions have been studied, together with a discussion of the most useful tools for the explosives discrimination. Moreover, the effect of the laser fluence on the atomic and molecular emissions and their relationship with the oxygen balance of an organic explosive is presented.

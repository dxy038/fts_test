Objective: To explore composing principles of prescriptions for chronic renal failure recorded on the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicines based on the traditional Chinese medicine inheritance support system (TCMISS). Methods: Prescriptions for chronic renal failure recorded on the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicines were entered into the TCMISS. Composing principles of these prescriptions were analyzed by TCMISS-integrated unsupervised data mining algorithms (including Improved Mutual Information, Complex Systems Entropy Clustering, and Unsupervised Entropy Hierarchical Clustering). Results: Eighteen core herbal combinations and 9 new prescriptions were evolved and obtained by analyzing 221 selected prescriptions for chronic renal failure and determining frequencies of occurrence of Chinese medicinal herbs in these prescriptions.

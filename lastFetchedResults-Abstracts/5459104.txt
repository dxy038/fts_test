This paper presents results of parametric studies in enhancing wireless communication system. An objective of the work has been to create a pass band square mesh-patch array Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) onto waveguides attached on/inside walls to increase productivity and efficiency through enhancing received signal power. Using the innovative model as a part of a wall assures signal strength enhancement for all of sensitive systems which work in the same band. Normally, the path loss exponents in the line of sight (LOS) are less than obstructed (OBS) channel. The received power of the OBS path is attenuated significantly as compared with that of the LOS path, thereby requiring an additional link budget margin as well as battery power. The use of an innovative model is suggested under OBS conditions in order to avoid significant propagation loss.

This system captures and analyses the growth of crops based on machine vision technology, controlled by the PLC variables and achieve the objective of saving fertilizer, improving economic efficiency and protecting the environment. It uses shape or texture of the crops and background information contained in the image to classify, builds database algorithms, processes the collecting real-time signal by the internal computer and provides a spray flow rate required by the target area of operation, thus achieves variable spray to the target automatically. As a result, the real-time database of the precision agriculture variable spray is created; the system then receives the target spray flow signals on the intelligent platform and variable sprays with an intelligent spray operation platform speed.

Objective: Gastric cancer is a major health issue worldwide. Using a therapeutic approach,
with minor side-effects, is very essential for the treatment of the gastric cancer.
Shiraia bambusicola is a parasitic fungus which is widely used in China for curing several
diseases with little side-effects. However, the mechanisms are not well understood yet.
The aim of this study was to further understand the pharmacological mechanisms of Shiraia
bambusicola and investigate whether it can be used for curing gastric cancer.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we mainly tested the effect of active
components extracted from Shiraia bambusicola on BGC823, A549 and HepG2 cells. We used
MTT assay to test cell viability. We also analyzed morphologic changes caused by apoptosis
using Hoechst 33342 fluorescence staining, as well as cell cycle status and apoptosis ratio using
flow-cytometer. In addition, protein expression level was tested by Western-blotting assay.
Results: BGC-823 cell proliferation was specifically inhibited by active components of
Shiraia bambusicola. Meanwhile, these active components could induce BGC-823 cells
apoptosis and retard the cell cycle in S/G2 phase. We also determined that two critical
protein markers cleaved Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and FLICE-inhibitory
protein (FLIP), involved in apoptosis process, were regulated by these active components.
Conclusion: These data shed light on the treatment of human gastric cancer and conclude
that Shiraia bambusicola can be a good therapeutic candidate for treatment of this malignancy.

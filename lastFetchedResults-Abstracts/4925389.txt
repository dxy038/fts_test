The generation of useful sensory data from real-world deployments of Ambient Intelligent Environments (AIEs) is challenging because of the high cost, significant groundwork and lack of access to human subjects. This situation can be improved by providing efficient simulators that can produce realistic simulation of the data collection from AIEs. One of the main problems for developing AIE simulators lies in the ability to verify how close the simulated data are to the real world data. In this paper, we present a fuzzy based verification agent for Persim - an event driven simulator for human activities in AIEs. The employed fuzzy based verification agent builds a data model that mimics the operation of Persim which allows for the latterÂ´s objective and subjective verification. We have conducted the verification on real world data captured from an actual smart apartment deployment. The results show the effectiveness of the fuzzy based verification agent in analyzing and comparing the Persim simulated data with the real world collected data. We also demonstrate how the verification agent is able to pinpoint specific changes to the simulation model to increase the realism of the simulation.

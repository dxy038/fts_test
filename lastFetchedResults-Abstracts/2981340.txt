The objective of this paper is to present an installation model for engineers applicable to a new family of power recovery devices: variable frequency drives in the regenerative mode. This type of power recovery device has become an important addition to cryogenic and chemical process industries. Specifications for each plant differ; the basic installation model is the same. These industries share power and safety requirements exceeding that of utility companies, because power is generated in a process environment. The first of this type product was tested summer, 1998. To test this power recovery equipment, a test facility was developed which emulated cryogenic and chemical processes. Customer process requirements and the utility company for the facility dictated power quality, instrumentation and safety of the facility. Final configuration of the facility became an independent power provider. This paper presents the design of this facility as a model for this type of application

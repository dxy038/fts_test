We deal with the application of multiagents algorithm to the information system in a nuclear industry. We develop an original solution algorithm for the automatic core design of boiling water reactor using multiagents. The characteristics of this algorithm are that the coupling structure and the coupling operation suitable for the assigned problem are assumed, and an optimal solution is obtained by mutual interference of multistate transitions using multiagents. We have already proposed an integrated optimization algorithm using a two-stage genetic algorithm for the automatic core design. The objective of this approach is to improve the convergence performance of the optimization in the automatic core design. We compared the results of the proposed technique using multiagents algorithm with the two-stage genetic algorithm that had been proposed before. The proposed technique is shown to be effective in reducing the iteration numbers in the search process.

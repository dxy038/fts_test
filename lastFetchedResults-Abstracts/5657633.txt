This paper presents the simulation of an automated welding process based on an industrial robot KUKA KR16. The main objective is to integrate all devices needed to perform the simulation using Delmia V5 robotics and to avoid any possible mistake when implementing of the real workcell; for example, with physical dimensions, possible collisions, path planning, etc. The feasibility in the implementation can be determined trough 3D simulation of a manufacturing workcell to perform tasks type MIG welding.

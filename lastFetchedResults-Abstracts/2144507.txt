Thirty streams were surveyed in urban and natural settings in the municipality of Manaus in the central Amazon basin (Brazil) with the objective of identifying the species of adult odonates that can be used as bioindicators of environmental quality. The data collected were used to test the hypothesis that species in the suborder Zygoptera are indicators of better-preserved environments due to their smaller body sizes and reduced tolerances to habitat modification, whereas species in the suborder Anisoptera were presumed to be indicators of impacted habitats with no vegetation. The habitats were classified as preserved, intermediate, and degraded, based on their environmental characteristics. A total of 908 specimens were collected, representing 60 species. The results of the indicator value (IndVal) identified 13 species as indicators of environmental quality, of which nine were typical of preserved habitats, two of intermediate habitats, and four of modified habitats (intermediate or degraded). Odonate species richness declined with increasing urbanization, a pattern also presented by the zygopterans, although anisopteran species richness was higher in intermediate habitats. Zygopteran species showed high fidelity/specificity for preserved habitats, although a small number of the species of this suborder showed a similar relationship with intermediate or degraded habitats, whereas anisopterans were associated only with disturbed habitats (intermediate and degraded). Overall, the results indicate that the diagnosis of the adult odonate community can provide a rapid and effective tool for evaluation of environmental quality. As many species are stenotopic, they can be used as indicators of good habitat quality, whereas some of the more eurytopic species can indicate disturbed habitats.

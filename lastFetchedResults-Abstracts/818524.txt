The main objective of this research is the investigation of earning management effect on intangible value of entity using Tobin's Q in accepted companies in Tehran Stock Exchange for time period of 2003 to 2007. For income smoothing measurement, in this research we employed Eckel model (1981) in three levels of gross income, net income and operating income. In the research 60 companies using systematic random sampling selected and to test hypotheses we used from Pearson Correlation and T independent test. Research findings indicate no significant relationship between income smoothing and intangible value using Tobin's Q. in other words, the companies can not produce any intangible value by income smoothing and earning management. On the other hand, the results show there is no significant difference between two groups of companies with income smoothing and no income smoothing in intangible value.

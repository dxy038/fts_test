This paper estimates a class of models which satisfy a monotonicity condition on the conditional quantile function of the response variable. This class includes as a special case the monotonic transformation model with the error term satisfying a conditional quantile restriction, thus allowing for very general forms of conditional heteroscedasticity. A two-stage approach is adopted to estimate the relevant parameters. In the first stage the conditional quantile function is estimated nonparametrically by the local polynomial estimator discussed in Chaudhuri (Journal of Multivariate Analysis 39 (1991a) 246–269; Annals of Statistics 19 (1991b) 760–777) and Cavanagh (1996, Preprint). In the second stage, the monotonicity of the quantile function is exploited to estimate the parameters of interest by maximizing a rank-based objective function. The proposed estimator is shown to have desirable asymptotic properties and can then also be used for dimensionality reduction or to estimate the unknown structural function in the context of a transformation model.

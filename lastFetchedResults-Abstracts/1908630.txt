The objectives of this study were to analyze the association of clinical symptoms with several parameters in patients with organ-confined renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and investigate the difference in biologic characteristics between incidentally detected and symptomatic RCCs. This study included 132 patients who were pathologically diagnosed with organ-confined RCC after radical surgery, and their clinicopathologic features were compared to those in patients with incidentally detected and symptomatic diseases. In this series, 91 patients were incidentally diagnosed with RCC, while the remaining 41 had some clinical symptoms. The cause-specific survival in patients with incidental RCC was significantly higher than that in patients with symptomatic RCC, and the presence of clinical symptoms could be an independent predictor of cause-specific survival in these patients. Immunohistochemical staining of resected specimens from these patients were then performed with Ki-67, Bcl-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies. Despite the lack of differences in Ki-67, Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression between these 2 groups, significantly increased expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in symptomatic RCCs were observed compared with those in incidental RCCs. Moreover, the presence of clinical symptoms in organ-confined RCC was significantly correlated with immunoreactivities of MMP-2 and MMP-9. These findings suggest that clinical symptoms have a significant impact on the prognosis of patients with organ-confined RCC and that the appearance of clinical symptoms may reflect the increased invasive potentials characterized by overexpression of MMPs.

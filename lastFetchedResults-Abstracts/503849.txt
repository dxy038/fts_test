The ingestion and absorption of colostral immunoglobulins are essential for improving immunity of calves. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral supplementation of Vitamin E on IgG absorption from colostrum by newborn calves. The same amount and quality of colostrum with or without Vitamin E addition was fed to paired calves (n = 12) once at birth. Blood samples were collected three-times at 0, 12 and 24 hours after birth from each group. Plasma was obtained and analyzed with HPLC and ELISA for Vitamin E and IgG concentration, respectively. Plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations of calves supplemented with vitamin E were significantly higher than the control calves. Feeding of colostrum containing 1000 IU Vitamin E insignifacantly increased IgG amount in the these of plasma of calves 24 h after birth. This study revealed that Vitamin E supplementation to colostrum did not increase IgG amount in blood plasma, Howevere was found that there was no conflict between Vitamin E supplementation and IgG absorption in newborn calves.

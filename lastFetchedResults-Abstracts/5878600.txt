In order to achieve the optimal choice of staff engaged in coal mine safety evaluation and management and reasonable arrangement of job positions based on comprehensive quality of candidates, the comprehensive evaluation criteria system accompanied by certain marks is established. Then, the subjective weight of the criteria is combined with objective weight for the purpose of adjusting to assure the correctness of calculated results. Finally, the gray statistical method is applied to census the messy background information of candidates and to judge the gray categories to which each candidate belongs. During the analysis process, it can be manifested that the advantage of gray statistical method lies in the flexibility of membership function which permits membership function to adjust according to decision making need. But how to establish reasonable membership function in complex situation should be studied further due to strong subjectivity. The conformity of the calculated results and practical reality demonstrate that the gray cluster theory provides an additional, convenient quantitative method for reasonable management of the human resource of enterprises, as well as for similar problems which are characterized by multiple decisions making.

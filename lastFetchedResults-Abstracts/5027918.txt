The objective of this paper is to implement the Tuple Pruning Search(TPS) based packet classification algorithm in two different mappings namely Parallel mapping and Pipelined mapping for Network Processor(NP) based router to support multimedia applications. The performance is evaluated using Intel IXP2400 NP Simulator. The results demonstrate that, TPS has better classification rate and lesser memory occupancy than Tuple Space Search algorithm. Parallel mapping of TPS based algorithm achieves better performance than the Pipelined mapping and is well suited to achieve high speed packet classification to support multimedia applications.

The design of multi-input DC-DC converters for hybrid energy systems is still a very challenging problem, especially when all input/output ports are required to be bidirectional. In this paper, a compact non-isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed to interface two input DC power sources. The proposed converter is proficient for energy diversification from two energy sources individually or simultaneously. It can be operated bidirectionally in both buck and boost modes. With comparison to traditional double inputs boost converters, only three controllable power switches are needed in the proposed converter, which is much cost effective. The topology is analysed in detail and a control algorithm are proposed to operate the converter. Simulation results are presented to verify the validity of the converter.

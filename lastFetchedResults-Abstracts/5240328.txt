Evaluating the adequacy of a quality image for a given application (image processing applications) is a requisite. However, objective quality assessment is far from being a solved problem. In this paper, a measure for image quality assessment (IQA) is introduced after a brief review of previous work. A metric based on the distance between blocks of distorted and original image is proposed to overcome some of the limitations of existing approaches. Distorted pixel, edge information and visual regions of interest are computed. The obtained results illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested method.

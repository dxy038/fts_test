The multi-phase implementation in the quasi resonant (QR) zero current switching (ZCS) switched capacitor (SC) bidirectional DC-DC converter structure has been proposed to reduce current ripple, switching loss and significantly increase the converter efficiency and power density. This approach provides a more precise output voltage to obtain voltage conversion ratios from the double mode versus half-mode to n-mode versus 1/n mode. This is accomplished by adding a different number of switched capacitors and power MOSFET switches with a small series connected resonant inductor for forward and reverse schemes. The size and cost can be reduced when the proposed converter has designed with the coupled inductors. The simulation and experimental results have been used to demonstrate the performance of the two-phase with and without coupled inductor interleaved QR ZCS SC converters for bidirectional power flow control application, and an extending structure for N-phase is mentioned.

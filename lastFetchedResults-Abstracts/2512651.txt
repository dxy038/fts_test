<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Reporting some biological side effects with special attention to reproductive points which were seen after different experiments in laboratories of the Plasma Physics &amp; Nuclear Fusion in atomic energy organization of Iran.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> Dosimeter analysis and interpretation of biological side effects of research studies in nuclear fusion laboratories.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> In the last 3 decades, neglecting the principles of the radiation protection has been confirmed in laboratories of the plasma physics and nuclear fusion research school of Iran, especially on DAMAVAND and ALVAND Tokamaks and DENA Plasma Focus.Â  Also a series of biological side effects such as alopecia and thyroid function disorders, oligospermia and stomach cancer have been seen in personnel working in related laboratories.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> As in our laboratories transportation of the peripheral components such to further distances from the main devices seems not to be cost effective. The level of the absorbed dose of the personnel must be decreased in other ways such as: lowering the number of attended shots for each person and proper shielding</p>

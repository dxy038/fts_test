Pomegranate juices were assessed after pasteurisation and storage in different packaging materials: transparent and green glass, and paperboard carton with polyethylene layers (Minibrik-200). The main objective was to establish the influence of the container on the stability of colour and bioactive compounds (anthocyanins, ellagic acid and other non-coloured phenols). Results showed that non-coloured phenols and ellagic acid were quite stable during the storage period. In contrast, anthocyanins degraded, to an extent directly proportional to colour loss, less for those juices stored in glass bottles than for those stored in Minibrik. These results indicated that these paperboard carton containers are oxygen permeable, and that oxygen has a greater influence on anthocyanin, and consequently on colour degradation, than light on pomegranate juice during storage. Nevertheless, the antioxidant activity was not influenced by the packaging material employed.

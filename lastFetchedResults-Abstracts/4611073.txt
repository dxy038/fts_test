Video delivery over wireless networks is a great challenge. For this purpose, the latest video coding standard, namely H.264, introduces a network-friendly layer to facilitate interaction between the encoder and the network. In addition, the set of error resilience tools defined by this standard is of great interest, given the need for such mechanisms in the specific context of an error prone link, such as a wireless one. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of some error resilience tools for a video transmission over an imperfect wireless link. Through the analysis of the obtained results, we derive some recommendations regarding the parameters setting rules of some H.264 resilience tools that might significantly reduce the video quality degradation.

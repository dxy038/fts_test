Due to high sensitivity and rapid response, soil biological properties including microbial enzymatic activities are appropriate indicators of soil quality, under different agricultural systems. Hence, a two-year field experiment was performed in 2002 and 2003 hypothesizing that soil microbial activities and P and Zn availability differ under different management practices. The objective was to evaluate the effects of different tillage (T) practices, canola (Brassica napus L.) cultivars (V's) and planting dates (PD's) on the soil enzymatic activities of alkaline and acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase and available P and Zn. Using a split plot design, different T practices (no (NT), minimum (MT) and conventional (CT)) and the combination of different V's (Hyola 401 and PF) and PD's (8th (PD1), 23rd September (PD2) and 7th October (PD3)) were assigned to the main and subplots, respectively. Soil enzymatic activities and P and Zn were measured. The actions and interactions of T, and PD significantly affected the activity of alkaline and acid phosphatase. Although, dehydrogenase activity at 0–10 cm was affected by T, V and PD and the interaction of T and PD, only T and the interaction of T and PD influenced the activity of this enzyme at 10–20 cm. Compared with other tillage practices, NT significantly increased enzymatic activities. The enzymatic activity at the 0–10 cm depth was in the order of PD1 > PD2 > PD3. However, at the 10–20 cm depth MT had a significant effect on dehydrogenase activity. NT reduced soil available P and Zn. NT can significantly influence soil biological properties and hence canola growth, resulting in a sustainable agricultural system.

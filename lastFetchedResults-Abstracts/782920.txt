Background Most epidemiological population
studies have demonstrated that women suffer more
anxiety and depression than men. A higher level of
stress, greater vulnerability to stress, and a non-additive
effect of private/domestic and occupational obligations
on women have been suggested as an explanation. Objective
The objective of this study was to examine if
women’s mental health is more susceptible than men’s to
the influence of surrounding stress. Material and
method A cross-sectional, random sample of the population
resulted in 651 men and 626 women, all of whom
were employed, participating in the study. Participants
were interviewed using face-to-face standardized questionnaires.
Results Younger women experienced more
stressful relationship events, illness events and network
events than men of the same age. Relationship events
were more important for men as they grew older, and interacted
with other stress to increase anxiety and depression
symptoms. Stressful illness events were more
strongly related to anxiety/depression symptoms in
women over 40 than in men of the same age, and interacted
with work stress to increase symptom scores.Conclusion
Stress was more strongly related to symptoms in
women, suggesting that they may have a greater susceptibility
to surrounding stress, and to somatic illness
stress.This might contribute to the sex difference in psychiatric
illness.

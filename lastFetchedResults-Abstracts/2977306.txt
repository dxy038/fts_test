Many optimization problems require the investigation of multiple local extremities and the original genetic algorithms with sharing cannot do this with objective functions with non-uniformly distributed extremities. In this paper, a new sharing method is developed. We use the estimation of the directions of spatial emitters as an example to test the power of our new method. The objective functions are the spectra estimated by the MUSIC method. It is shown by simulation that the new algorithm can find all the local extremities of the objective functions and its computation consumption is at most one-tenth of the conventional MUSIC method

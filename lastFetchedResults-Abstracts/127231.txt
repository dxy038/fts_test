In this study, local yoghurts were collected from Golpayegan and the villages of province Gilan. Samples were transferred to laboratory under standard conditions. Microbial population, pH, acidity and acetaldehyde of each samples were measured. Acetaldehyde content was measured by Gas - chromatography method. After consecutive microbial culturing, the strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated and purified. These strains were identified on the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics.The isolated bacteria were preserved at -70'c in skim milk plus glycerol. The main objective of our study was to isolate, purify and identify of native yoghurt starters. The isolated strains can be used as starter for the production of desirable yoghurts that meet the taste of Iranian consumers.

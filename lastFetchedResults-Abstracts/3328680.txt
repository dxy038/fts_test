Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are gaining lot (lots) of attention by the researchers from worldwide due to application capacities expanded day by day. WSNs are formed by tiny wireless sensor nodes, which are a type of tiny computing devices with resource, constrained in nature. These computing devices are operated by batteries or some kind of ambient energy sources. The objective of this research contribution is to present a glance of an extended version of an energy efficient reactive network layer protocol (EERNLP) for WSNs, titled H-EERNLP, which will be fruitful for a large number of densely deployed environments.

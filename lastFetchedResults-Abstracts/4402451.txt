Cognitive radar architectures offer the community many potential benefits including the potential of improving sensor system performance while simultaneously reducing the cost of future radar systems. However, as with many new technologies, it is important that, in addition to understanding its benefits, the developers of such advanced cognitive radar systems also be fully aware of its potential risks. The objective of this paper is to identify and highlight some of these potential risks so that they can be addressed and resolved as early as possible in the development cycle.

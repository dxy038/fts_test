Background and Objective: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Various factors are associated with survival of patients with breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the survival rate of patients with breast cancer who referred to MRI center of Hamadan and to explore its related factors. 
Materials and Methods: In this historical cohort study, 542 women with breast cancer who had referred to Darol-Aitam-e Mahdieh center of Hamadan were included during 2004-2011. All patients had undergone chemotherapy and radiotherapy after surgery. Data were obtained from the patients’ medical records and were analyzed using time-dependent Cox model. 
Results: The mean (SD) age of patients was 46.06 (±10.82) years. The median of survival time was 109.7 months. 201 (37.1%) patients died during the study period. One, five and ten-year survival of the patients was 96.8%, 68% and 31%, respectively. The results of the current study showed that the tumor size and metastasis status were statistically related to the hazard of death in these patients (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: Age, metastasis status, tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes and the status of progesterone receptor were associated with survival of patients. Since early detection of breast cancer may have an influence on some of these factors, therefore, these results reveals the important role of public education for regular referral to physicians and screening of breast cancer for all women for early detection of breast cancer.

An optimization mathematical model to minimize the costs associated with energy not supplied and investments on the allocation of sectionalizing switches and tie lines between branches and / or feeders in primary distribution systems is presented. This is a mixed integer nonlinear programming model, which considers the power flow constraints and continuity indexes. A set of trade-off solutions between total cost of investments and network reliability is obtained using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II - NSGA II. It is demonstrated that by considering these two elements at the same time, the results are better than when these elements are considered isolated on the mathematical models.

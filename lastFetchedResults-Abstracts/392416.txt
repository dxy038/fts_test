Objective: To examine whether the styloid process can be imaged by three-dimensional computer tomography reconstruction (3-DCT) distinctly enough to be used for diagnosis, and whether the image findings are explanatory of the symptoms. Methods: We performed 3-DCT in four patients suspected to have elongated styloid process in our hospital. The apparatus we used was X-vigor (Toshiba), and the processing software was X-tension; the slicing thickness was 1.0 mm and the shifting speed of CT table was 1.0 mm per rotation. One hundred and twenty images were reconstructed for a view. Results: In all cases, the 3-DCT showed the exact full length of the styloid process. Two cases were diagnosed as elongation of the styloid process by 3-DCT and their image findings were explanatory of the symptoms. In other two cases, the 3-DCT showed no difference between the right and the left styloid processes, and thus the diagnosis of elongation of the styloid process had to be excluded. Conclusion: We suggest that 3-DCT is useful for the diagnosis, explanation to patients and selection of treatment in some cases of elongated styloid process, but further study in more cases is required before we can fully confirm the utility.

The paper presents a unified conceptual derivation of some spectral estimation methods, including the maximum-entropy method and the classical window method. Two reasonable requirements provide the starting point, leading to various mathematical formulations. A data-dependent window method is derived from one of them, and an objective criterion for the selection of the free parameters of the window is outlined.

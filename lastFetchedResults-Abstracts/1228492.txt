The objective of the present research was to compare the effectiveness of three methods direct education, computer assisted teaching and a combination of the two in reducing problems of students with mathematics disorder.The statistical population of this quasi-expermetal research consisted of all students in the third and fourth grades of primary schools in Tehran identited as having mathematics learning disorder and referred to learning disorders rehabilitation centers. Twenty students were identited as having mathematics disorder through a clinical interview. The Wechsler Intelligence test and a standardized test for the diagnosis of mathematics disorder, were selected voluntarily then these students were randomly placed in four groups of five. Three groups received special training for 12 sessions of 45 minutes per week and  the control group received the general training provided routinely at the learning disorder treatment center. From every group pre test and post test was assessments made. Data were analyzed through analysis of variance. Results showed that direct education, computer assisted teaching and a combination of the two were effective in reducing the problems of students with mathematics disorder (p < 0.5). It is concluded that direct training, computer assisted teaching and a combined method are more effective than common conventional methods in reducing the problems of student and the mathematics disorders.

The aim of this paper is to propose an integrated solution to the problem of pilgrimage transportation control while tracking the shuttle-bus from its starting point till its final destination. Our objective is to identify the shuttle-buses and the passengers using advanced communication and information technology. The project if implemented will replace the manual system which is heavy, complex, tedious and difficult to control. This application identifies a particular bus by the RFID tag fixed on it. Passengers boarding or getting down the bus are identified on the basis of RFID cards they have and finger identification. The system could be more elaborately established for all buses and passengers and a complete digital network could be established with the least of its possible errors. The tags are cost efficient and the whole equipment once installed can work without any particular attention. The area of application of RFID is very wide and the technology has already proven its value. Thus the implementation and practice of such a digital system would always be worth. The proposed system is designed to work in an environment where vehicle and passenger identification is required, namely at check points, in order to speed up the checking process with best quality services. As a matter of fact, a complete functional database with Server and security polices for handling the server must be provided. For the purpose of passenger identification, the tags are attached to the pilgrim ID cards and the reader collects the details from them. The confirmation of the data collected could be confirmed only when the finger prints is validated. In this study, we also propose a statistical study of the basic important bus parking and the way they should be organized and controlled to avoid congestion and troubles.

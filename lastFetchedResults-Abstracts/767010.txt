The main objective of this investigation was to
apply friction stir welding technique (FSW) for joining of
2 mm thick copper sheet. The defect free weld was obtained
at a tool rotational and travel speed of 1,000 rpm
and 30 mm/min, respectively. Mechanical and microstructural
analysis has been performed to evaluate the
characteristics of friction stir welded copper. The microstructure
of the weld nugget (WN) consists of fine equiaxed
grains. Similarly, the elongated grains in the thermomechanically
affected zone (TMAZ) and coarse grains in the
heat-affected zone (HAZ) were observed. The hardness
values in the WN were higher than the base material.
Eventually HAZ shows lowest hardness values because of
few coarse grains presence. Friction stir welded copper
joints passes 85% weld efficiency as compared to the
parent metal

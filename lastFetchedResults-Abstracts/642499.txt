Objective
The objective of this study was to investigate the effective dose of plant sterol ester (PSE)-enriched diacylglycerol (DAG) oil for healthy subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia.
Methods

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study was performed in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia; 0.0, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 g of PSE was dissolved in 15 g of a DAG-containing mayonnaise-type product; and 15 g/d of the product was administered 4 wk.
Results

Total serum cholesterol levels were significantly decreased as a result of the ingestion of at least 0.4 g/d of PSE, and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly decreased by the ingestion of at least 0.3 g/d of PSE.
Conclusions

Daily ingestion of 15 g of DAG plus mayonnaise containing at least 0.4 g/d of PSE for 4 wk may significantly decrease cholesterol.

This work describes the research carried out on small microstrip patch antennas for small handsets. The objective is to study the effects of a small ground plane on a planar inverted-F antenna bandwidth and gain. A wide-band antenna, to be used in mobile communication systems and wireless local area networks applications, has been selected. An antenna prototype has been designed, fabricated and tested. Good agreement has been obtained between theoretical and experimental results.

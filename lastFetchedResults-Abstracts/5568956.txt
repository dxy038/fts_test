The operation-sequencing problem in process planning is considered to produce a part with the objective of minimizing the sum of machine, setup and tool change costs. In general, the problem has combinatorial characteristics and complex precedence relations, which makes the problem difficult to solve. In this paper ant colony optimization technique has been used to solve this sequencing problem. Present approach analyses the precedence relationships among features to generate a precedence relationship matrix (PRM).

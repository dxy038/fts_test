Constructors are facing, constantly, complicated problems occasioned by culture, frequent policy changes, and other related factors when conducting Joint Ventures (JVs) in Mainland China. Hoping to decrease the risk of JVs in China for international constructors, this study applies Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Utility Theory to develop a multi-criterion risk assessment model for construction pre-JVs stage and to integrate World Wide Web (WWW) and company Databases. This model demonstrates the advantage of inspiring the evaluators to make more objective and systematic assessment; and more important, its on-line assessment function can demolish regional, spatial and time barriers, which will help the decision-making team use computers to participate in long-distance evaluations of usersâ€™ ends at any time and any place. Moreover, each member of the team can fully participate in the process which lifts efficiency and improves decision-making assessments.

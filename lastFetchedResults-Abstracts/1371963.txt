The objective of this paper is to present a CHE (Channel Hot Electron) and CHISEL (CHannel Initiated Secondary ELectron) characterization procedure for a compact Flash memory cell model. As a core element of the Flash memory model, a Philips MOS Model (MM11) model has been used coupled with the charge neutrality expression in the structure. This pragmatic model takes into account the different injection mechanism (CHE, CHISEL and Fowlerâ€“Nordheim). The characterization procedure developed under ICCAP to extract the full model card including the CHE and CHISEL current parameters are detailed. This model has been successfully implemented in ELDO.

Objective
luate the performance of urine cytology (CYT), the UroVysion test [(fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH)], the uCyt+-test, and the nuclear matrix protein 22 ELISA (NMP22) at different grades of microscopic hematuria (HU) in a cohort of 2,365 patients suspicious for urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC).
ts and methods
rt of 2,365 consecutive patients suspected to have UCC underwent testing of at least 1 of the 4 noninvasive urine markers followed by cystoscopy, upper urinary tract imaging and, in case of suspicious findings, transurethral biopsy and/or resection of suspicious lesions. The grade of microscopic HU was determined by dipstick evaluation and urine microscopy and subdivided into 4 grades. The test results were compared with the HU status by contingency analysis and Cochran-Armitage test for trend separated for patients without evidence of UCC and with histologically proven UCC.
s
e of grade 0, I, II, and III HU, rates of false positive CYT were 13.0, 17.4, 16.3, and 19.5% (P = 0.02), false negative CYT distributed 37.9, 18.5, 20.0, and 15.5% (P = 0.0003). FISH was false positive in 16.7, 19.8, 19.8, and 23.3% (P = 0.051) and false negative in 42.7, 27.5, 25.9, and 25.0% (P = 0.1). The uCyt+ was false positive in 12.5, 16.9, 24.0 and 35.1% (P &lt; 0.0001), and false negative in 57.1, 26.4, 31.5, and 12.7% (P = 0.0003). NMP22 was false positive in 35.3, 55.3, 75.2, and 79.7% (P &lt; 0.0001) and false negative in 50.0, 36.2, 22.6, and 8.2% (P &lt; 0.0001).
sion
tent of microscopic HU significantly influences the performance of noninvasive urine markers for UC. False positive rates of CYT, uCyt+, and NMP22 significantly increase with the degree of HU whereas false negative results of CYT, uCyt+, and NMP22 are less frequent in patients with high grade microscopic HU. These results underline the relevance of the grade of HU for the appropriate interpretation of urine tests.

In modern society, there is a great demand to quickly input large amount of printed and handwritten information into the computer, therefore everyone rely heavily on computers to process huge volumes of data. The primary objective is to allow vocally handicapped people to use the computer or to read documents in an easier way. The system is divided into two parts first is Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and second part is text to speech. In the first part, Virtual Instrument is developed in which a colored image that contains the characters is converted into grayscale image and characters are trained and in the second part; conversion from text to speech is developed. The mean of average inspection time, standard deviation, minimum inspection time and maximum inspection time in ms is measured. There are some variations in time parameters because of factors like number of characters recognized, line profile, histogram, brightness, contrast and gamma correction values.

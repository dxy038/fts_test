In this paper, an efficient multi-objective model is proposed to solve time-cost trade off
problem considering cash flows. The proposed multi-objective meta-heuristic is based on
Ant colony optimization and is called Non Dominated Archiving Ant Colony Optimization
(NAACO). The significant feature of this work is consideration of uncertainties in time, cost
and more importantly interest rate. A fuzzy approach is adopted to account for uncertainties.
Mathematics of cash-flow analysis in a fuzzy environment is described. A case study is done
using the proposed approach and the decision makerâ€™s options to handle the uncertainties are
investigated and discussed.

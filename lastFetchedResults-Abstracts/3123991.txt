Multi-channel communication in a Wireless Mesh Network with routers having multiple radio interfaces significantly enhances the network capacity. Efficient channel assignment is critical for realization of optimal throughput in such networks. This paper addresses the channel assignment problem for multi-channel multi-interface (radio) wireless mesh networks. We focus on static wireless mesh networks where multiple non-overlapping channels are available for each wireless interface. In this network environment, our objective is to find a fixed channel assignment which maximizes the number of bidirectional links that can be activated simultaneously, subject to interference constraints. We present a mixed integer linear programming models for solving the fixed channel assignment problem with multiple radios. Detailed computational results are presented and discussed to validate the algorithm.

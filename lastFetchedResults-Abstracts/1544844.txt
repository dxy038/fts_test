This paper deals with chained form systems with strongly nonlinear disturbances and drift terms. The objective is to design robust nonlinear output feedback laws such that the closed-loop systems are globally exponentially stable. The systematic strategy combines the input-state-scaling technique with the so-called backstepping procedure. A dynamic output feedback controller for general case of uncertain chained system is developed with a filter of observer gain. Furthermore, two special cases are considered which do not use the observer gain filter. In particular, a switching control strategy is employed to get around the smooth stabilization issue (difficulty) associated with nonholonomic systems when the initial state of system is known.

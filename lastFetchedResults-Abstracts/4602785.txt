We present a novel method for developing reconfigurable system targeted at embedded system applications. We show how an existing object oriented design method (MOOSE) has been adapted and enhanced to include reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs). Our work represents a significant advance over current embedded system design methods in that it integrates the use of reconfigurable hardware components with a systematic design method for complete systems. The objective is to produce an object oriented design methodology where system objects can be seamlessly implemented in either software or reconfigurable hardware

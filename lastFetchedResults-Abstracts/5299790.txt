On January 1, 1998, an industrial research chair was established in electromagnetic fields and living systems. The chair is co-funded by the NSERC, BC Hydro, TransAlta Utilities Co., and the University of Victoria. The prime objective is to carry out research on engineering aspects of interaction of electromagnetic fields (EMF) with living systems. These aspects include all areas of theoretical and experimental dosimetry of EMF and exposure assessment. The emphasis of the program has been on fields associated with power lines and electricity in general. However, significant research has also been accomplished in the radio frequency (RF) area related to wireless communication.

We study feedback control laws that enable an aerospace vehicle to perform planar maneuvers. We make several key assumptions including: (1) maneuvers are planar, (2) a complete set of vehicle control forces and moments is available, (3) the vehicle is a rigid body with a single unactuated internal degree of freedom. The control objective is to design a feedback controller so that the controlled vehicle accomplishes a given planar maneuver, that is a change in the translational velocity vector and the attitude of the vehicle, while rapidly attenuating any relative motion of the internal degree of freedom. A time-invariant discontinuous feedback law is constructed that achieves these control objectives with exponential convergence rates. The effectiveness of the proposed feedback law is illustrated through a simulation example

A new analysis method of resource importance based on the improved AHP method is presented to solve the problem of distributed resource evaluation in concurrent product development process. By analyzing the objective information data of resources and defining the resources value index, the objective evaluation model based on information diffusion theory is constructed. According to resources value, scarcity and irreplaceability, the complementary judgement matrixes are constructed by domain experts and project managers, respectively. And these evaluation results are combined to construct triangular fuzzy number complementary judgement matrix. Then its consistency adjustment method is given and its priority is calculated to analyze the resource importance. Finally, its effectiveness is demonstrated by an illustrative example showing the ship design.

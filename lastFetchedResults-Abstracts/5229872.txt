In this paper, performance of location-aided transmit strategy in bidirectional relay networks over Rician fading channel is studied. This work is based on a three node relay system, where on the relay node, multiple antennas are deployed, and single antenna on other nodes. The idea of the location-aided transmit strategy is to acquire angle-of-arrival (AoA) of signal through relative location of devices, and to make use of the AoA in designing transmit beamformers. It is presented in this paper that this practical method for low-cost systems yields good system performance in terms of spectral efficiency when Line-of-Sight components exist in the propagation channel. In addition, the achievable rate performance of such relay network system in the broadcasting phase, which is impacted by Rician K-factor and the relative position between devices, are analyzed.

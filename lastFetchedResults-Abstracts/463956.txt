Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of four-chamber and left ventricular outflow tract views in low-risk patients and comprehensive fetal echocardiographic examinations in high-risk patients to diagnose structural heart disease or thoracic anomalies.
Study design: A prospective outcome study of two cohorts was performed; 1136 low-risk patients and 886 high-risk patients were evaluated during a 2-year period. Low-risk patients had detailed fetal echocardiographic examinations. Accuracy of the ultrasonographic diagnosis was evaluated from neonatal discharge data.
Results: Only 2 of 14 patients with congenital heart disease in the low-risk group were correctly identified (sensitivity 14.3%) whereas 10 of 16 patients with congenital heart disease or thoracic anomalies were correctly identified in the high-risk group (sensitivity 62.5%).
Conclusion: The current study showed poor diagnostic accuracy of the standard four-chamber and left ventricular outflow tract views in low-risk patients for the diagnosis of structural cardiac anomalies. Patients with risk factors for congenital heart disease should be referred for comprehensive fetal echocardiographic examination

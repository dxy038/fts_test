This project intend to solve the problems of propagating news and information, and also alleviate the problem of traditional event managing procedures such as lots of paper work, or long queue at the registration desk. The objective of this project is to develop an android application which provides interesting news and events. Moreover, users will be able to manage their event participation, such as reserving their seats in events, registering at the event site, and so on. More importantly, this application uses QR code to provide an easy way to verify participantsÂ´ identity in an event.

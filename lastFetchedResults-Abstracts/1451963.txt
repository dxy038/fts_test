This work presents three multi-objective heuristic algorithms based on Two-phase Pareto Local Search with VNS (2PPLS-VNS), Multi-objective Variable Neighborhood Search (MOVNS) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The algorithms were applied to the open-pit-mining operational planning problem with dynamic truck allocation (OPMOP). Approximations to Pareto sets generated by the developed algorithms were compared considering the hypervolume and spacing metrics. Computational experiments have shown the superiority of the algorithms based on VNS methods, which were able to find better sets of non-dominated solutions, more diversified and with an improved convergence.

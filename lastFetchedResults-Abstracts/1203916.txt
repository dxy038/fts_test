Improving project performance is an important objective in IS project management. In consultant-assisted IS projects, however, consulting organizations may have additional objectives, such as knowledge acquisition and future business growth. In this study, we examined the relationship between client and consultant objectives and the role of coordination in affecting the achievement of these objectives. A research model was developed and tested using 199 consultant-assisted projects. The results showed that the achievement of consultant objectives was dependent upon the achievement of client objectives and that coordination had a positive impact on both client and consultant objectives.

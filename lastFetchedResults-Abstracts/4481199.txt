Web service (WS) technology has established itself as a key component of enterprise computing for a number of business processes. The mobile devices are expected to become primary internet devices in the near future. The popularity of mobile devices and establishment of WS technology has increased the demand of accessing and hosting web services on mobile devices. Hosting web services on such devices is always challenging because of their limited resources. In this paper, we propose a run time WS partitioning technique with the objective of improving the overall system performance. The proposed WS partitioning technique is devised to offload different sizes of partition on a remote computing node based on the system load. Performance of the proposed WS partitioning technique is analyzed by performing experiments on a simulator.

The benefits of adding fibres to concrete, evidenced in the post-cracking behaviour, are strongly influenced not only by the type and content of fibres but also by their orientation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of the casting/placing procedure on the post-peak behaviour of fibre reinforced self-compacting concrete, and its relationship with the mesostructural characteristics of the material (type, distribution and orientation of fibres). Three concretes were prepared using two types of steel fibres of different lengths (50 mm and 30 mm) and a structural type polymer fibre. Beams of 150 × 150 × 600 mm were cast in three different ways: filling the moulds from the centre in accordance with the EN 14651 Standard, pouring concrete from one end of the mould after a flowing along a 5 m length and 150 mm diameter pipe, and finally, filling the moulds vertically. Flexural tests according to the European Standard indicate that the three types of fibres achieve a preferential orientation along horizontal planes, like in conventional vibrated fibre reinforced concrete. The mechanical response of beams cast with longer steel fibres was strongly affected by the casting procedure while the flexural performance of the other two fibre concretes, was less affected. Such results are well in accordance with the density of fibres measured by fibre counting in different cut planes.

In this work we present some practical guidelines for applying set-oriented methods for the solution of multi-objective optimization problems to high-dimensional real world problems. First we briefly review the main concepts of multi-objective optimization and describe how these problems are related to self-optimizing systems. In addition we give an overview on the basic set-oriented methods. Finally we apply a new variant of these methods to the energy management for an onboard storage system of a tram, where the aim is to reduce both overhead line peak power and energy consumption simultaneously

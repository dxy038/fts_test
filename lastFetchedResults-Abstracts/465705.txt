Objective: Severe fetal anemia is associated with polyhydramnios in both human and ovine fetuses. This study examined the relationship between varying degrees of anemia and amniotic fluid volume in fetal sheep. Study Design: Eleven long-term catheterized ovine fetuses at 126 ± 1 days’ gestation (mean ± SE) were subjected to hemorrhage of 20 to 80 mL daily for 9 consecutive days to produce varying degrees of fetal anemia. Five additional animals served as time control animals. Statistical analysis was by least squares regression and 3-factor analysis of variance. Results: Amniotic fluid volume was 793 ± 147 mL and did not change with time in the control fetuses. In the fetuses that were subjected to hemorrhage the amniotic fluid volume changed little through the hematocrit range of 40% to 25%. As fetal hematocrit fell below approximately 25%, amniotic fluid volume began to increase. With greater degrees of anemia the amniotic fluid volume increased as an exponential function of hematocrit and approached 2000 mL excess fluid as hematocrit dropped to <15%. According to bivariate regression the increase in amniotic fluid volume was related to fetal hematocrit, PaO2, and urinary flow rate as well as to plasma and amniotic fluid lactate concentrations. According to multivariate regression only fetal PO2 and urinary flow rate were significantly related to the increase in amniotic fluid volume. Conclusions: Although mild anemia was not associated with increased amniotic fluid volume, moderate to severe fetal anemia was associated with an exponential rise in amniotic fluid volume. This rise may have been mediated by a hypoxemia-induced diuresis, by a diuresis related to a lactate-induced osmotic accumulation of fetal fluid, or by both mechanisms.

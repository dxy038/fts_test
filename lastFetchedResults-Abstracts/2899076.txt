MANETs are widely used to communicate with each other wireless devices via bidirectional wireless links either directly or indirectly and these functionalities are performed by collection of mobile nodes equipped with both wireless transmitter and a receiver. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. To overcome this problem a new approach for intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK) is proposed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.

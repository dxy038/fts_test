This paper proposes a risk management model for the facility location problems in fuzzy
environment. We investigate the capacitated continuous location allocation problem in continuous
space as a risk model. Two risk types are considered in the proposed model: customer risk and
financial risk. The risks are caused because of unsatisfied demands and budget constraint, respectively.
The introduced model is extension of the continuous location allocation model by adding fixed cost
and customer risk concept. A facility belongs to a zone when is located in a predetermined radius from
center of the zone. Because of uncertain budget and demand, the model is considered in fuzzy
environment. Finally, a risk management model is proposed with presentation of degree satisfaction
concept of each risk as objective function. Also, a numerical example is expressed to illustrate the
proposed model.

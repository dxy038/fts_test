This paper takes the four needs of people for driving, i.e., safety, comfort, reliability and low consuming, as the design objective of the vehicle driving automatic control system, and brings forward a linguistic control model of vehicle driving based on the analysis of the four related factors of vehicle driving, i.e., driver, vehicle, road and environment, which provides a certain basis for further steps taken in designing the autonomous vehicle driving system mimicking human driving.

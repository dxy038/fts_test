Location-based routing has been a critical and efficient routing strategy in large wireless sensor networks (WSN) with mobile sinks. However, the performance of location-based routing highly depends on how position information of mobile sinks are managed and updated. This is typically the task of location service. In this paper, we present the design of a hierarchical location service for WSNs with mobile sinks. The main design objective is to greatly reduce the communication overhead for providing location service while maintaining high routing performance. Detailed simulation results are used to verify the high performance of our designed location service.

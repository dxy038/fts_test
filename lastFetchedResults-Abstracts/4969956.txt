There has been great technological stride in 3D-IC on its design, analysis, and fabrication, with prediction that they will eventually lead to significant advances in multicore, multiprocessor, and network-on-chip (NoC) systems. A dynamic programming (DP) network is well suited for the grid stack architecture, because of its capability to achieve global optimality using only local computational units with short inter-grid communication links. In this paper we extend the transitive closure and shortest path unidirectional networks to bidirectional networks, with the development of an effective simulation tool for such type of DP networks. In addition to helping to construct real DP networks on 3D-IC, ODE (ordinary differential equation) simulation methodology for solving an average shortest path length problem provides new insights for comparative bench-marking very large-scale 2D/3D networks for different design considerations in application.

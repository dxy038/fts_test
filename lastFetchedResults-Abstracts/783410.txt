Objective To study socio-demographic
and functional features related with non-collaboration
in a longitudinal design of mental health within a highrisk
population of individuals 9 and 13 years old.
Method Regression analyses were used to assess factors
affecting the decision to decline participation, and
what characteristics both of children and families increase
the probability of dropping out once the study
had already started. Results Refusal of participation at
the outset is more probable for lower socioeconomic
groups, unemployed families (or with Social Security
benefits), minority cultures and children having low
school performance. The risk of participants dropping
out is higher for adolescents, those who need help at
school, are unhealthy, have more life-events, receive
professional help for mental problems or have had
more psychopathology in previous assessments.
Lengthy interviews or evaluations without the return
of reports to families are also predictive of drop out.
Conclusions This study has practical implications for
reducing the lack of collaboration in the prospective
studies that assess mental health in children and
adolescents. Improvement in the estimation of epidemiological
indices requires the planning of special
measures for research projects carried out on populations
with fewer resources so as to recruit individuals
with lower SES, adolescents, individuals with pathologies
(physical or psychological) and those with lower
levels of school achievement

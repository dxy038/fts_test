Objective: To evaluate Lauge-Hansen classification on the diagnosis and treatment of ankle fractures. Methods: From April 2008 to June 2011, and following ethical approval of our research, patients with ankle fractures admitted at our second orthopaedics department were enrolled. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 8 months (8~46 with a mean of 27 months). Trauma mechanism and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores were analyzed. The position and grade of ankle fracture injury were accessed for making treatment strategies for patients. Results: Thirty-two patients were recruited fulfilling the inclusion criteria and were available for follow-up. After treatment, none of the cases had postoperative infection, cutaneous necrosis, failure in internal fixation or nerve injury. At 12-month follow-up, AOFAS scores were 97.7 at average, among which 30 cases were excellent and 2 cases were good. Conclusion: The Lauge-Hansen classification contributes fully to diagnose ankle fractures, so that surgeons can make correct treatment strategies and achieve good treatment effect. Besides, perfect follow-up records, genial attitude, good communication skill and flexible follow-up time are the key to finish evaluation as schedule.

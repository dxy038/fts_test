The integration optimization model of VFP&amp;VRP with multi- type vehicles, multi-kinds and small scale goods was established considering limit goods, total cost was maximized which were composed of fixed cost, variable cost and loss cost on the condition of considering vehicle capacity, time windows and goods characteristics in the model. Additionally, PSO-TS hybrid algorithm solving the model was proposed according to the characteristics of ACO and PSO. In the integrated frame of hybrid algorithm, the VFP and VRP were related by translating goods filling scheme into initial-solve of TS and adopting total objective function to evaluate particle. Finally, the model and algorithm were successfully proved by a given instance.

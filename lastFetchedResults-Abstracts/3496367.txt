A program for the design of generalized TEM microwave circuits has been written. The optimization process utilizes a simple but effective rationale called direct pattern search to reduce the error between a desired circuit objective and the current value of a chosen response. Lossy transmission line equations are utilized in the program for exactness. As an example of its utility a 2-4-GHz maximally flat magnitude microwave transistor amplifier is designed and fabricated.

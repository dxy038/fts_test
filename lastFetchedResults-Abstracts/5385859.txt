The vertical motion of roped elevator was described. The robust control problem of high rise elevator system based on Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model was studied. T-S fuzzy model was used to solve multi objective control and nonlinear control problems in elevator motion control system. First, the generalized model of system was built, and then system global state controller was designed by parallel-distributed compensation (PDC) method. Second, state feedback robust controller was gained based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) method. The simpleness and effectiveness of the controller were showed by the simulation, and the robustness was satisfied for the system. Multiobjective control and nonlinear control problems have been solved effectively.

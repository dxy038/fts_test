The MiniDisc system was designed with the obvious objective of replacing the conventional Compact Cassette tape recorder system. The MiniDisc format defines two types of optical discs. One is a recordable magneto-optical disc for user recording and another is a conventional read-only disc for music-software publishing. Audio data compression is used to achieve 74 min of playing time on a 64-mm disc. By means of a built-in buffer memory called Shock Resistant Memory, MiniDisc can be used for outdoor portable application with great ease. Furthermore, MiniDisc was evolved to MD Data system and with a data capacity of 140 Mbytes and a very compact size, the MD Data system is expected to become one of the standards for removable data storage systems

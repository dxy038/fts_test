Objective
We hypothesized that thoracic ultrasound (ThorUS) performed by emergency physicians would be a rapid and effective management tool for the evaluation of nontraumatic pleural effusion (PleurEff).
Methods
This is a prospective observational study of symptomatic adults presenting to an urban ED with suspicion of PleurEff. ThorUS was performed bilaterally in the upright position. Measurements included treating physician's procedural time requirements, pre- and posttest likelihood of PleurEff, and management changes.
Results
There were 59 patients who were entered into the study. Investigating physician's actual time to perform ThorUS was 2.19 minutes. After ThorUS, 48 (81%) patients had an increase and 11 (19%) had a reduction in likelihood of PleurEff with average absolute change in likelihood of PleurEff of 34% (P < .02). ThorUS changed management in 41% of cases; thoracentesis occurred most frequently.
Conclusion
ThorUS performed by emergency physicians is a rapid and effective management tool for the evaluation of nontraumatic PleurEff in symptomatic ED patients.

Study objective: To identify the oncology patient population presenting to the emergency department and examine the causes and clinical management of oncology symptoms in the ED. Design: Retrospective review of 5,640 adult patients, with the following variables identified for oncology patients presenting to the ED: age, sex, cancer type, cancer stage, previous cancer treatment, previous hospitalization, presenting symptoms, treatment provided in the ED, admission and discharge data, and day, time, and length of ED visit. Setting: Community teaching hospital with annual ED census of 31,000. Participants:  All adult oncology patients who presented to the ED during the study period. We identified these patients by cross-referencing ED logs and tumor registry records. Results:  Cancer history was identified for 284 of the 5,640 adult ED admissions (5%). Forty-three percent (n=122) of the 284 patients with cancer history had an oncology-related ED visit. The most common symptoms of these patients were gastrointestinal (48%), pain (40%), neurologic (38%), cardiac (25%), and pulmonary (23%). Ten percent of patients with oncology-related ED visits died during the admission, and 48% died within 1 year of the ED visit. Conclusion:  Oncology patients present to the ED with symptoms of undiagnosed malignancy, complications of cancer treatment, and acute disease-related symptoms. Knowledge of an individual's cancer history and ability to recognize oncologic symptoms are important to the management of oncology patients.

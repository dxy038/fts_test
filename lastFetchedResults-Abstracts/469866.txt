Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the demographics, clinical presentation, and maternal and neonatal outcomes in patients who were diagnosed with acute fatty liver of pregnancy over a 10-year period.
Study design
This was a multicenter retrospective study of women with the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Records were reviewed for symptoms, laboratory findings, clinical course, and maternal and perinatal outcomes.
Results
Sixteen cases of acute fatty liver of pregnancy were identified. Three of the 16 cases had multiple gestations (18%). Eleven of the 16 cases were diagnosed in the antepartum period, and 5 cases were diagnosed within 4 days after delivery. Nausea and vomiting were the most common symptoms (75%). There were 2 maternal deaths (12.5%) and 3 fetal deaths (15%).
Conclusion
We recommend that patients with persistent nausea, vomiting, or epigastric pain in the third trimester receive evaluation of liver enzymes, renal function, and a complete blood count to rule out the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy

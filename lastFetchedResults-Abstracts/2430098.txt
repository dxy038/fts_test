Background: It is important to learn how to study for different examinations. The objective of the current study is to explore whether the assessment method selection would significantly affect the studying and learning approaches of students. Methods: This descriptive-analytical research consisted of 191 first-year undergraduate nursing students from three nursing schools and was conducted during two interval semesters. All of students were given examinations with half of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and half of short-answer questions (SAQs) in mid and final term examinations. A structured 12-item questionnaire was designed based on a modified 5-point Likert scale in outline of visual analogue scale. The questionnaire with Cronbach’s alpha of at 0.814 sought information on student’s studying and learning approaches. Results: The students significantly rated agreement with queries of short-answer assessment part of questionnaire higher than in multiple-choice assessment part. Female students performed significantly better in the learning outcomes in SAQ and MCQ examinations grades and total grade of both examinations than male students who participated in the study (p= 0.001, 0.001 and 0.030, respectively). Neither lower-quartile nor higher-quartile of education promotion exposed significance difference on total score of studying and learning approaches questionnaires. Responses frequency to studying and learning approaches questionnaire revealed that most students selected short-answer assessment method.  Conclusion: Therefore, the findings revealed that assessment method may shape and improve students’ studying and learning approaches. Short answer question is hypothesized to enhance the development of deep learning.

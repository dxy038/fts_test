The main objective of our research is to construct a continuous speech recognition system by using knowledge engineering techniques. The system simulates the behavior of a human expert who can recognize continuous speech by inspecting the trajectories of feature parameters such as formant frequencies. The expertise is embedded in the form of production rules. In the current implementation, we have 114 rules which are being updated. The introduction of production system to knowledge representation enables to cope with large amount of heuristics of speech recognition. Recognition rate of 85% was obtained for continuous speech of 30 second long uttered by three male adults. An environment for rule-base construction is also being developed.

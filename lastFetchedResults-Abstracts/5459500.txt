Aiming at the influence of parameter uncertainty on the control system, two design methods of robust controller are presented to design output feedback controllers, regarding the ball grinding mill system to be the research object. One is the reversed-frame normalizing (RFN) method, which is based on the matrix singular value decomposition. Through setting the desirability objective function, the controller is acquired using the least-squares technique. The other is the H-infinite method which is based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Aiming at the specific parameter uncertainty and disturbance, the method to design two independent SISO systems is presented in this paper. The simulation results of the two controllers showed that both of the two control systems have good robustness, the decoupling between control signals and the error tracking between the output and the given variable are realized.

The monolithic integration of a detector stage comprising a photodiode and a field-effect transistor with a load resistor and a wavelength duplexer, realized in the GaInAsP/InP material system, is described. Design considerations, in particular for the wavelength duplexer, but for the complete chip as well, are reported, and details related to the realization of the device are given. Chips were mounted into housings and operated in a 1.3- mu m/1.55- mu m bidirectional transmission link. At 576 Mb/s and 10<sup>-9</sup> bit error rate, the sensitivity of the module is -21 dBm, the intrinsic sensitivity of the receiver is -28 dBm, and the gain-bandwidth product for the lowest noise bias conditions is 3.8 GHz.

The second preparation workshop for the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge (GCDC) was held in Helmond, The Netherlands, in December 2009. Like the first workshop in May, it was organized excellently by TNO, the Dutch research organization which, together with HTAS, has initiated the GCDC. The main objective of the workshop was to discuss the rules and regulations with potential participants starting from a draft document provided by TNO. The workshop was attended by 80 researchers from different universities, knowledge institutes, and manufacturers from eighteen countries spread over four continents.

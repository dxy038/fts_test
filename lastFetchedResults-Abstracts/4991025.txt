The objective of this paper is to demonstrate a fully digital controller for non-isolated-point-of-load converter. For fast dynamic slew rate requirement, peak current mode control is preferred in general for providing fast response and over current protection. However, due to the performance limitation of A/D converter and D/A converter, it is implemented by invoking external analog component. In this paper, an FPGA-based digital controller based upon peak current mode control is realized while not invoking any external analog component. Experimental results derived from the realized digital non-isolated-point-of-load converter with slew rate of 200 A/mus will be presented to confirm the design and implementation

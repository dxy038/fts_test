Energy-efficient communications has attracted much interest in the research of 5G cellular systems. In this paper, we study energy-efficient coordinated beamforming design for heterogeneous multicell multiuser downlink systems. The considered problem is formulated as maximizing the weighted sum per-cell energy efficiencies (WSPEEMax) subject to predefined per-user target rate demands, maximum leakage interference power constraints, and per-BS transmit power constraints. This formulation is more general than the conventional EE optimization problem and provides a unified way to consider the EE of heterogeneous networks. However, it is hard to tackle due to the weighted sum-of-ratios form of the objective function and the non-convex nature of per-user target rate constraints. To address it, we propose to first transform the original problem into a polynomial form optimization by introducing some auxiliary variables and then further reveal their equivalence in finding the solution. Then, an efficient block coordinate ascent optimization algorithm is developed to solve the equivalent problem by exploiting the concave nature of the considered problem with respect to each optimization variable. To further improve the network EE, we also develop an energy-efficient transmission method for each small-cell network. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and show that both the EE and spectral efficiency (SE) of heterogeneous network can be significantly improved by energy-efficient coordinated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission.

We present a new peristaltic micropump offering three key features: (i) a disposable pump body and a re-useable actuator unit, (ii) an intrinsic normally-closed mechanism blocking unintended liquid flows up to a pressure of 100 kPa and (iii) a backpressure independent pump performance up to 40 kPa. The modular concept basing on a re-usable actuator unit and a low-cost disposable microfluidic chip enables an easy and cost-efficient exchange of all contaminated parts after use, which addresses especially the needs in the health care sector. The intrinsic normally-closed feature blocks liquid flow in both directions up to a pressure difference of 100 kPa when the electric power is off. The micropump is actuated in a peristaltic manner by three piezostack actuators. Up to a frequency of 15 Hz the pump rate increases linearly with operation frequency leading to a pump rate of 120 Î¼L/min. This was proved for an operation voltage of 140 V by pumping water. In addition the pump rate is independent on backpressure up to 40 kPa and shows a linear decrease for higher pressure differences. The maximum achievable backpressure at zero flow rate was extrapolated to be 180 kPa. As for all peristaltic micropumps, the pump is bidirectional, e.g. the pump direction can be changed forward to reverse mode.

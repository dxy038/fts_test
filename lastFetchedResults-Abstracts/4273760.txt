The buck-boost dc-dc converters with bidirectional features are mostly inefficient with switching and passive component loss. The multiphase dc-dc converter with interleaving of inductor current reduces the ripple. This paper presents the bidirectional dc-dc converter operating in discontinuous mode to minimize the passive inductor. The turnoff loss due to discontinuous operation is taken care by design of snubber capacitance across the switch to improve the conversion efficiency. The design procedure is presented with an algorithm to optimize the component sizing for the highest efficiency operation from low to full load operating conditions. The operation of this converter is presented with three legged interleaving in simulation. The proposed converter prototype design and its implementation are given with operational results.

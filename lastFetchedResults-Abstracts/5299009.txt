Variations of bidirectional reflectance effects in coastal waters are analyzed based on extensive radiative transfer simulations of remote sensing reflectances and field data, which are compared with existing models. Improved relationships are proposed which better accounts for BRDF effects but should be further verified for a broader range of synthetic data with various sun, viewing and azimuth angles as well as insitu datasets.

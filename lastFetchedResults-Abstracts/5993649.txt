This paper presents a method for designing two-channel hybrid filter banks by solving a minimax and a one-dimensional optimization problems derived from the near perfect reconstruction conditions. The design starts with a power-complementary structure of analog analysis filters with a free parameter. First, with this parameter fixed, digital synthesis filters can be designed in minimax sense by using second order cone programming algorithm. We then obtain the corresponding maximum reconstruction error, which is further regarded as an objective function and minimized by optimizing the free parameter. A design example shows that this method yields much reduced aliasing and amplitude distortion in comparison with a conventional method.

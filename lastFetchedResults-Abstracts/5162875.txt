This paper presents a combined genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic rules to enhance the optimal power flow (OPF) with consideration of multi shunt flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS). The OPF problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained objective optimization problem with both equality and inequality constraints. The problem is decomposed into, the optimal power generation subproblem that is searched by a flexible genetic algorithm which crossover and mutation adjusted by fuzzy expert rules and a simple practical reasoning fuzzy rules designed as a second subproblem to control the reactive power exchanged with the network. The proposed method guarantees the near optimal solution and remarkably reduces the computation time. This proposed approach is implemented with Matlab program and applied to the medium 59 bus of the Algerian network. The optimization results are compared to the solution given by the standard GA and ant colony method (ACO). This comparison confirms the efficiency of the proposed approach which makes it promising to solve the OPF with consideration of FACTS devices.

Digital signal processing techniques have been used to perform an acoustic analysis for vocal quality assessment due to the simplicity and the noninvasive nature of the measurement procedures. Their employment is of special interest, as they can provide an objective diagnosis of pathological voices, and may be used as complementary tool in laryngoscope exams. The acoustic modeling of pathological voices is very important to discriminate normal and pathological voices. The degree of reliability and effectiveness of the discriminating process depends on the appropriate acoustic feature extraction. This paper aims at specifying and evaluating the acoustic features for vocal fold edema through a parametric modeling approach based on the resonant structure of the human speech production mechanism, and a nonparametric approach related to human auditory perception system. For this purpose, LPC and LPC-based cepstral coefficients, and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are used. A vector-quantizing-trained distance classifier is used in the discrimination process.

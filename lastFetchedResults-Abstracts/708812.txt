Background and Objective: Since long-term therapy of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis patients with azol is accompanied with drug resistance and systemic toxicity, thus, researches have returned to non-azole drugs. This research compared clinical response of these patients to boric acid and leukorex (Zataria multiflora).

Materials and Methods: This study was performed as a blind clinical trial in control with positive cases (parallel). Patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis that had a positive culture without any predisposing factors were enrolled in this survey. Vaginal cream of Zataria multiflora 1% and boric acid 3% were given blindly. Signs and symptoms on first visit, and 1 and 6 months after starting treatment was analyzed using chi square, Mann-Whitney and t tests.

Results: In boric acid group, the score of severity signs initially was 9±3.3 that got to 3.48±3.8 and 3.33±5.1 in first and second periods of therapy, respectively. In Zataria multiflora group, the score of severity signs initially was 8.21±3.6 that got to 2.52±2.46 and 3.36±3.7 in first and second periods of therapy, respectively. The reduced scores of two groups were significant (p < /001). The final cure rate was 74/2% and 64/5% in boric acid and Zataria multiflora groups, respectively that there was not a significant difference between the two groups.

Conclusion: Zataria multiflora is considers as an alternative drug in treatment of patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

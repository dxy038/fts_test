A significant problem facing researchers in reinforcement learning, and particularly in multi-objective learning, is the dearth of good benchmarks. In this paper, we present a method and software tool enabling the creation of random problem instances, including multi-objective learning problems, with specific structural properties. This tool, called Merlin (for Multi-objective Environments for Reinforcement LearnINg), provides the ability to control these features in predictable ways, thus allowing researchers to begin to build a more detailed understanding about what features of a problem interact with a given learning algorithm to improve or degrade the algorithmÂ´s performance. We present this method and tool, and briefly discuss the controls provided by the generator, its supported options, and their implications on the generated benchmark instances.

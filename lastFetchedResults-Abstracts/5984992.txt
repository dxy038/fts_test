Since data packet losses and network-induced delays might be potential sources to instability and poor performance of networked control systems, the main objective of this paper is to design an adaptive stabilizing controller for networked systems with time-varying network-induced delay and packet loss. With the continuous-time approach, the case of state feedback is studied in which a new adaptive control model in the presence of network-induced delay and packet dropout is proposed. The problem is to find upper bounds on the sampling period, the network-induced delay, and the transmission packet loss, to guarantee stability of the overall adaptive networked control systems. The resulting upper bounds are time varying and can be estimated online. Rigorous mathematical proofs are established, that relies heavily on LyapunovÂ´s stability criterion and its extensions. Simulation results are given to illustrate the efficacy of our design approach.

This paper elaborates the results of our previous study by delving into time-step multiphysical simulations juxtaposing electromagnetic and thermal characteristics of a high-temperature superconducting (HTS) transformer. This is attainable by using multiphysical coupling of the Kirchhoff laws, the Maxwell equations, and thermal equilibrium. The electrical behavior of the superconductor is described by means of a B-dependent modified E- J power-law relation. Moreover, a precise calculation of the mechanical force components created by the interaction between current and leakage flux density of each winding scheme is the further objective of this paper. The multiphysical processes are carefully scrutinized for normal and fault conditions in an exemplary HTS transformer by analytical and finite-element analyses of 3-D FLUX software in steady-state and transient modes.

The objective of this research was to develop encapsulated phase change materials (EPCMs) that can store thermal energy at temperatures
up to 450  C, suitable for applications in concentrating solar power systems. From initial explorations of candidate media, the two
salts (PCMs) NaNO3 and eutectic NaCl–MgCl2 were selected for further development as storage media with phase change. A specialized
calorimeter with requisite size and temperature capability was designed and built to obtain enthalpy values of the PCMs at temperatures
below and above their melting points. The latent heats of phase change can contribute 57% and 75% to storage capacity of the NaNO3
and NaCl–MgCl2 media, respectively, for a 100  C temperature swing bracketing the salts’ melting points. After calibration, this calorimeter
was then used to determine the actual energy storage capacity achieved by capsules of EPCMs of various dimensions. The calorimeter
tests proved that the salts and the encapsulation methods chosen here can store thermal energy effectively while taking
advantage of the latent heat of phase change. Repeated thermal-cycles showed sustained performance of the EPCMs, with no discernible
diminishment in storage capacity.

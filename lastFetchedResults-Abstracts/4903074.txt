The neuroscience has become more quantitative and information-driven science since emerging implantable and wearable sensors from macro to nano and computational tools facilitate collection and analysis of vast amounts of neural data. Complexity analysis of neural systems provides physiological knowledge for the organization, management and mining of neural data by using advanced computational tools. The neurological data are inherently complex and non-uniform and collected at multiple temporal and spatial scales. The main objective of this talk is to highlight the recent advances in wearable and implantable neural sensors/probes and computational neural science and engineering.

Considering the current forecasting model had limited understanding of watershed hydro meteorological and a single model could hardly reflect the objective laws, by theoretical studying and practicing of combined forecasting method, the hydrological time series forecasting method based on multi-model combination was proposed. This method makes up for the lack of a single model, and makes full use of existing information resources to obtain optimal prediction. In the actual application, combined forecasting method was better than the traditional one.

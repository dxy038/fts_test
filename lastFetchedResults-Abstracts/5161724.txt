Objective-converting methods (OCMs) are commonly used to solve multi-objective reactive power optimization (MRPO) problem. In this paper, contour line, a common concept in geography, is introduced to compare and classify OCMs in MRPO. Firstly, OCMs adopted in MRPO problem are summarized. Then, contour lines of different OCMs are drawn in objective function space and search direction of OCMs is analyzed. Based on the shape and characteristics of contour lines, different OCMs are compared and classified. All of studies are a good reference for the further study in MRPO.

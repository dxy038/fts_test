The main objective of this study is to counterpart numerical model and experimental studies for rotating flows associated with dough kneading, and validate the flow patterns generated. The flows considered are in a complex domain setting. Two types of cylindrical vessels are studied at various rotational speeds; one with one stirrer and a second with two. Laser Doppler anemometry is used to obtain the velocity vectors associated with the flow fields. Close agreement is obtained between numerical and experimental flow fields and the magnitudes of velocity vectors. Both sets of results show maximum shear-rates outside the stirring rods. The rate-of-work done also peaks in this region and this is an important quantity to dictate optimal mixer design.

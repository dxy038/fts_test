This paper studies the joint transmit and receive antennas selection (JTRAS) in bidirectional MIMO communication systems consisting of two full duplex (FD) nodes. We assume that each node is equipped with N antennas which can be used for transmission or reception. For this bidirectional FD system, we select one transmit antenna and one receive antenna from all the possible antenna configurations at each node to achieve the minimum sum symbol-error-rate (Min-SER). The optimal Min-SER based selections is performed by exhaustively searching, so that it is difficult to analyze and has a high complexity. To tackle this problem, we propose a low-complexity near-optimal Serial-Max method which selects the antenna pairs with maximum SINR in a two-step serial way. The performance of the proposed Serial-Max method is analyzed, and the closed-form expression of the average sum SER is derived. The analysis is validated by simulations. It is shown that the diversity order of the Serial-Max method is (N - 1)<sup>2</sup> with perfect self-interference cancelation, or zero with residual self interference. Both analytical and simulation results show that as N increases, the Serial-Max method approaches the optimal performance in terms of average sum SER.

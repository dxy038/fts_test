In this paper, a single-stage isolated bidirectional AC/DC converter is proposed. The converter can achieve high power factor, sinusoidal input currents, adjustable output voltage and high frequency electrical isolation with single-stage structure. The converter is modulated by Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) algorithm in dq rotary two-phase coordinates. Both PI control and deadbeat control method can be applied on this converter. To verify the theoretical analysis, the simulation was done by MATLAB/SIMULINK and a 3kW hardware based on the proposed converter was built in the lab with the digital controller TMS320F2812. The simulation and experimental results show the high power factor and the low harmonic distortion characteristics of the circuit.

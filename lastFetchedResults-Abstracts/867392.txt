Flow shop scheduling problem consists of scheduling given jobs with same order at all machines. The job can be processed on at most one machine; meanwhile one machine can process at most one job. The most common objective for this problem is makespan. However, multi-objective approach for scheduling to reduce the total scheduling cost is important. Hence, in this study, we consider the flow shop scheduling problem with multi-objectives of makespan, total flow time and total machine idle time. Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem which is known as NP-hard type. The proposed algorithm is compared with solution performance obtained by the existing multi-objective heuristics. As a result, computational results show that proposed algorithm is more effective and better than other methods compared.

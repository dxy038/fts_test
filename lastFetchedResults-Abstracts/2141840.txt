During the last decade multimetric indices (MMIs) have been greatly improved by the use of appropriate criteria to define reference conditions and by the use of statistical analysis to select a consistent set of metrics. Among the large number of MMIs developed to assess the ecological status of streams based on fish communities, the emphasis was mainly put on warmwater assemblages. When compared with warmwater fish assemblages, coldwater assemblages present depauperate faunas with a limited suit of traits. Thus, very often the number of metrics used to compute MMIs for coldwater streams is lower than for warmwaters. The objective of this study was to develop new metrics specific to European coldwater assemblages that integrate both the species traits and the body size of fish. Indeed, whereas the use of size or age classes has been highly advocated for developing MMIs, it remains largely underrepresented. Therefore, we used eight biological and ecological traits to characterize species and two size classes: small and large individuals. Among the 96 metrics tested, four were successfully related to environmental gradients and three displayed a significant response to anthropogenic pressures: the number of small rheophilous individuals, the number of small oxygen-intolerant individuals, and the number of small-habitat-intolerant individuals. These results demonstrate that metrics based on size classes could be used in the development of MMIs for coldwater streams and more generally for low-species rivers.

This investigation presents a novel method of practical expectation of the capacity of polynomial bidirectional heterocorrelator (PBHC). This has a higher capacity for pattern pair storage than that of the conventional bidirectional associative memories and fuzzy memories. In this work, the practical capacity of the data processing using PBHC considering fault tolerance in the average case is estimated and simulation results are presented to verify the derived theory

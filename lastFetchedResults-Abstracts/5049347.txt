In this paper we describe an agent-based system for user profiles dynamic share. We address the problem of discovery and construction of distributed user profiles for adapted services recommendation in the context of pervasive applications. The system has to be open and proactive in order to dynamically propose adapted services according to userÂ´s situation and contextual profile, while preserving his/her privacy. The objective of this work is to propose an infrastructure for developing pervasive learning environments to dynamically build the most suitable learner profile for a particular service or interaction in real-time. The implemented prototype is also presented, showing in detail how agents communicate.

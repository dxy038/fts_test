Purpose The implications of increased applications of
high quality cattle manure to agricultural systems in Africa
on N2O emissions are still only partially understood.
Methods A field experiment was carried out in a wetland
in central Zimbabwe to determine the effects of cattle
manure quality on emissions of N2O during the growing
seasons of rape and tomato crops. The static chamber and
gas chromatography techniques were used to capture and
measure fluxes of N2O.
Results The substitution of low N by high N manure
significantly increased N2O fluxes and total N lost through
N2O emission. Emissions of N2O increase with increasing
content of N in applied manure.
Conclusions Given that N2O in agricultural soil is produced predominantly through the microbial transformations of inorganic N, the potential of a soil to emit N2O
increases with the increasing availability of N and consequently the N content in applied manure. The applications of lower rate of high and low N manures were
followed by lower emissions of N2O, a result that is
favorable to the objective of lowering the contribution of
agricultural sources to the global greenhouse gas emissions. The loss of N in emissions of N2O expressed per
unit mass of harvested dry matter yield decreases with
increasing manure application, dry matter yield and N
uptake. Improved agronomic practices for increased crop
productivity can be used as a mitigation factor for
reducing the contribution of agriculture in the global
emissions of N2O

Background and Objective: Failure to thrive (FTT) is a sign that describes a particular problem
rather than a diagnosis and explain growth failure or more advanced failure to gain weight
appropriately. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and type of chromosomal
abnormalities in patients presented with FTT.
Materials and Method: One hundred FTT cases with clinical impression of having chromosomal
abnormality referred for cytogenetic study during a period of 5 years (2007-2011) with age range
from 5 month to 15 years. Chromosomal analysis was carried out for them. The standard protocol
for peripheral blood lymphocyte culture was followed by metaphase chromosome preparation and
conventional analysis of G-banded chromosomes. All analyses were performed using the SPSS soft
ware package, version 18.
Result: Fifteen cases showed karyotypic abnormality. The most common karyotype abnormality
was aneuploidy resulted from monosomy of the chromosome X in girls.
Conclusion: Turner syndrome with various forms of chromosomal complement is the most common
chromosomal abnormality causing growth failure in girls.

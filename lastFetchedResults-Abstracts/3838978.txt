An image coding algorithm for digital video tape recorders (DVTR) must satisfy several requirements which do not arise in other applications of video compression. A key constraint on the data format is satisfied if every frame (or field) of video is partitioned into a small number of subimages, each independently coded with a fixed number of bits. This requirement excludes the use of interframe coding and most variable-rate image coding algorithms. We propose to use a new algorithm that codes a subimage efficiently under this data format constraint and allows virtually lossless reproduction at reasonable low bit rates. Each subimage is partitioned into non-overlapping blocks and each block is coded by one of a finite set of predesigned block quantizers covering a range of bit rates. For the ith block in the subimage, a rate function R<sub>i</sub>(L<sub>i</sub>) and a distortion function D<sub>i</sub>(L<sub>i</sub>) is tabulated for each block quantizer L<sub>i</sub>. A near-optimal quantizer allocation algorithm based on the Lagrange Multiplier method is used to select a particular quantizer for each block. The objective is to minimize the distortion of the entire subimage under the constraint on the total number of bits for the subimage. A system for the compression of HDTV for DVTRÂ´s based on this rate-constrained optimal block-adaptive technique is designed using the DCT and vector quantization with a multistage structure. Simulation results demonstrate that this algorithm has the potential of achieving virtually lossless compression for digital tape recording of HDTV.

A point receptance array is proposed to study behaviors of panel structures with stiffeners. Although the overall objective is intended to develop a general algorithm for large structural members with stiffeners of arbitrary arrangements, the present study focus on an analytical evaluation of the accuracy of the approximation. To simplify the formulations, a thin plate with two diagonally connected beam stiffeners is selected. By solving governing differential equations for the plate and beam, point receptances that represent the interaction and compatibility conditions at the plateâ€“beam interfaces are analytically obtained. Buckling modes of the stiffened plate are obtained by solving an eigenvalue problem. Accuracy of the approach is verified by a comparison of the analytical solution with data obtained from a direct finite element model. A parametric study was also performed. Good agreement indicates that the point receptance is a viable approach for general applications.

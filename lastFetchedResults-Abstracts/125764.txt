Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is the most important metabolic disorder and its prevalence is increasing. There are contradictory reports about the cardiovascular side effects of sulfonylureas which are used for treating diabetes mellitus. The objective of this study was to observe the vascular effects of Glibenclamide, a second generation of sulfonylurea in rats. 
Material & Methods: Male rats were injected intraperitonealy in a dose of 5mg/kg body weight for one month. Animals were killed at the end of study and the response of isolated aortic rings to phenylephrine; Acetylcholine and Isosorbide dinitrate was studied.
Results: There was no significant difference between the responses of aortic rings of treated and control rats to acetylcholine, Isosorbide dinitrate and phenyl ephrine
Conclusion: Intraperitoneal injection of 5mg/kg body weight glibenclamide for one month did not make any changes in the contractile properties of isolated aortic rings. Since glibenclamide acts through closing ATP dependent potassium channels and closing these channels during myocardial Ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease can bring major problems. Further studies are needed to make sure that glibenclamide do not change the contractile properties of vascular smooth muscles.

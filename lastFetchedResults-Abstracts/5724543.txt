Among various algorithms used to diagnose electrical disturbances, the transient detection is considered one of the most important functions. The objective of this paper is to present the ParkÂ´s transformation (Tdq0) as a simple and efficient tool to detect transients in EHV transmission lines. The evaluation of such technique is performed with actual records from a Brazilian power system utility. The results reveal that the Tdq0 can detect accurately the transient occurrence and, thus, may be used to give support to various protective applications based on the detection of travelling waves.

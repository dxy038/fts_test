Objective: Educating families and caregivers of schizophrenic patients on controlling and&nbsp;managing the disorder, has found particular importance in clinical psychology. The present&nbsp;study aims to examine the effect of Psychoeducational interventions on illness management in&nbsp;families of schizophrenic patients.
Methods: The present study is a quasi-experimental research with pretest-posttest design, and&nbsp;two control groups. The study sample consisted of 30 families with a schizophrenic member. The&nbsp;families were selected from referrals to a psychiatric center in Tehran (during a period of 40 days)&nbsp;who met the inclusion criteria, and were randomly placed into three groups: an experimental&nbsp;group, a control group with placebo, and a control group without placebo (10 persons in each&nbsp;group). A researcher-made questionnaire was used to collect data. The experimental group&nbsp;received trainings (a training package) and attended a group discussion on schizophrenia. The&nbsp;placebo group attended similar meetings, but without educational content and group discussion,&nbsp;and the second control group were only assessed in the pretest and posttest. After finishing the&nbsp;training sessions, and following an interval of 3 months, the posttest was conducted for each&nbsp;group. The study data were analyzed using univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). All&nbsp;statistics were carried out using SPSS software, version 11.
Results: According to the results, the experimental group had significantly higher gain scores&nbsp;(&alpha;&le;0.05) than the two control groups, on the following variables: an increase in the adaptability&nbsp;of the patient in daily functioning, from the viewpoint of both a clinical psychologist and the&nbsp;patient&rsquo;s family, an increase in the family&rsquo;s knowledge of the illness, and a reduction in the
adverse effects of the illness on the family&rsquo;s feeling and attitude.
Conclusion: The present study showed that family education is effective in increasing patients&rsquo;&nbsp;adaptability and patients&rsquo; family knowledge, and in reducing the adverse effects of the illness.

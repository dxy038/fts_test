The objective of this work was to investigate the use of the diffusive model, Azuara’s model, Peleg’s model and an exponential (Weibull-type) model on the mathematical modeling of water gain/loss and salt gain by chicken breast cuts immersed in saline solutions. Experimental data allowed to access the effect of NaCl solution concentration (Cs) on the direction of the resulting water flow and to quantify water and salt transfer. For values of Cs up to 10% it was verified that meat samples gained water, while for processes with Cs between 15% and 20%, samples lost water. The considered empirical models were able to represent satisfactorily the transfers of water and salt during all osmotic treatments. The diffusive model was able to represent well salt gain rates, using a single parameter, i.e. an apparent diffusion coefficient of salt through the meat. However, it was not possible to find a characteristic apparent diffusion coefficient for water transfer.

The next generation Internet will be highly diversified in both underlying networking technologies and supported networking applications. The diversified Internet architecture requires effective collaboration among heterogeneous network domains to support various application requirements. One of the challenges to achieve this objective lies in enabling network domain collaboration and network-application interaction without exposing the internal structure and implementation details of each domain. The service-oriented architecture has been successful in the grid computing and Web services areas to address the problem of inter-domain resource sharing to support various applications. In this paper, we explore application of the service-oriented idea in networking area to support the diversified Internet. We specifically investigate service-oriented network abstraction and discovery. We propose an approach for network service description and develop a technique for discovering the appropriate network services that meet performance requirements. We also discuss a system structure for implementing the technologies developed in this paper.

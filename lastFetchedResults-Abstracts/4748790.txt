Large numbers of practices show that software process modeling technique can be effectively used to describe and analyze software process and offer opportunity to discover process improvements. There are many kinds of software process modeling method, so it is significant to make reasonable evaluation of software process modeling methods which can help developers choose the most appropriate modeling method according to specific modeling environment and requirement for achieving the best modeling effect. On the basis of evaluation system of software process modeling methods, comprehensive evaluation method which combines fuzzy evaluation and grey theory is applied to evaluate some modeling methods. It can make full use of fuzziness and grayness of evaluation information by experts which makes the evaluation more objective and accurate. Further, it is proved that the method can estimate modeling methods soundly and have feasibility and engineering value to software development project practice by an example.

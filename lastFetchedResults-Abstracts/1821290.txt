Objective
eukin-6 (IL-6) may be involved in drug-induced gingival overgrowth (GO). The present study was conducted to assess the association between IL-6 (−174 G/C) gene polymorphism and GO in renal transplant recipients under cyclosporine (CsA), tacrolimus (Tcr), or sirolimus (Sir)-based regimens.
s
 an eligible population, 45 unrelated subjects were selected for each CsA, Tcr, and Sir group, totaling a sample of 135 subjects. GO was visually assessed and subjects were assigned as controls (non-responders) or cases (responders) in a post hoc definition. IL-6 gene polymorphism was assessed using the polymerase chain reaction amplification and digestion. The distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies in responders and non-responders were compared using the Chi-squared test.
s
mber of responders was 27 (60.0%), 13 (28.9%), and 7 (15.6%) in the CsA, Tcr, and Sir groups, respectively. No differences could be observed at frequencies of −174GG, −174CG, and −174CC genotypes when comparing responders to non-responders in the CsA, Tcr, and Sir groups. Similar to genotypes, allele frequencies showed no differences between responders and non-responders in all groups.
sions
ociation between IL-6 (−174 G/C) gene polymorphism and gingival overgrowth was observed in renal transplant recipients under CsA, Tcr, or Sir-based immunosuppressive maintenance regimens.

Octahedral cobalt(II) complexes of isonicotinoylhydrazones, which were obtained from the primary antituberculous agent isoniazid, have been synthesised and characterised. Their antimycobacterial in vitro activity has been evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv: they exhibit MIC values ranging from <0.1 to 0.39 Î¼g/mL, showing them to be generally more active than previously reported analogous Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes.

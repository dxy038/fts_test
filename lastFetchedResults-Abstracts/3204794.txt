A control strategy for tracking the trajectory of a time-variant objective function in closed quantum systems is proposed in this paper. The Lyapunov stability theorem is used to design the control law. Meanwhile, the issue of singularity is discussed and the problem of large value of control field occurred during the process of tracking are solved by using an adaptive regulation algorithm of objective function. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the method proposed. We also explore the relationship of effect between control parameters and the error of the control system.

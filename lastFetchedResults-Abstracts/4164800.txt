Statistical neural networks executing soft-decision algorithms have been shown to be very effective in many classification problems. A neural network architecture is developed here that can perform unsupervised joint segmentation and labeling of objects in images. We propose the semi-parametric hierarchical mixture density (HMD) model as a tool for capturing the diversity of real world images and pose the object recognition problem as a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the HMD parameters. We apply the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for this purpose and utilize ideas and techniques from statistical physics to cast the problem as the minimization of a free energy function. We then proceed to regularize the solution thus obtained by adding smoothing terms to the objective function. The resulting recursive scheme for estimating the posterior probabilities of an objectÂ´s presence in an image corresponds to an unsupervised feedback neural network architecture. We present here the results of experiments involving recognition of traffic signs in natural scenes using this technique

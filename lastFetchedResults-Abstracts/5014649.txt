Investigates the use of the Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) in multistage networks. By using SCI switches, many topologies can be implemented, since SCI is a topology-independent communication protocol. We present several approaches for using SCI in different types of multistage networks, including unidirectional and bidirectional links. The CrossSwitch model that we introduce is scalable and of high performance, using 2&#215;2 switch, 4&#215;4 switch and 8&#215;8 switch elements for the connection. A real implementation of a large multistage system must focus on real hardware costs traded off with maximum performance. Simulation provides confidence in our models and the analysis of the results provides otherwise unpredictable guidelines for the design of a real SCI switch fabric

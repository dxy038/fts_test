In the research of physical layer security, it is sometimes needed to analyze the security of network nodes with dependency or adversary relationships, but there is hardly any efficient solution at present. This article analyzes the dependency or adversary situations and proposes that current physical layer security has rational nature and multi-objective optimization need in the new scenes, both of which are meanwhile the fundamental requirements of Game Theory. A new solution is formed by constructing a game description of physical layer security with Game Theory.

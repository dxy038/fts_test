A study that models the possible configurations of a proposed packet-transport-equipment (PTE)-based university campus network is reported. The function of these PTEs is to receive/forward data packets from/to remote LANs or workstations. The objective is to determine whether the traffic capacity of the proposed network can handle the projected university workload, how different applications impact network load, and where the potential system bottlenecks are. The modeling approach taken treats the interconnected LANs as a hierarchy with the fiber (backbone) ring as the apex. Both analytical and simulation models are developed, with simulation being preferred as the workloads approach saturation conditions.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

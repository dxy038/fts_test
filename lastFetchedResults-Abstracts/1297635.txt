Aims: The AIDS epidemic is considerably widespread across the world. It is found that high school students are the most vulnerable group due to their age and some high risk behaviors. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of peer education on AIDS preventive behaviors based on Theory of Planned Behavior conducted on male students of 2nd grade of high school in Zahedan.
Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 280 male students of 2nd grade of high school in Zahedan were randomly selected and divided into two groups, namely the experimental and control. Having verified the validity and reliability of the questionnaire, it was utilized as a means of data collection. The eligible students, as introduced, who were able to communicate well and able to instruct the other peers, were selected, and the researcher instructed them the required skills. The educational intervention lasted for two 45-Min sessions. Forty-five days after the intervention, the questionnaires were completed again. The data was coded. In order to analyze the obtained data t-test and paired t-test were embarked upon. 
Results: The average scores for both groups regarding their knowledge level, their attitudes towards behavior, function or performance, behavior objective, mental norms and perceived behavior control were not meaningfully different from those ones before the study. (p > 0.05)
After education, average scores of all the above-mentioned variables increased meaningfully, in the experimental group (p < 0.05), while the results in the control group did not reach the significance level, and no meaningful differences were observed (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: Education and intervention based on Theory of Planned Behavior among high school students seems quite indispensable in order to boost their understanding and attitudes as well as their avoiding risky behaviors due to their special age conditions.

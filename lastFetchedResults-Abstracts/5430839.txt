Customers are increasingly demanding quality in the power supplied by the electric company. In that way, technology, regulations and customer practices are moving forward in that direction. The most important benchmarks in the suitable technology to be used in the solution of quality problems are marked by the continuous upgrade in the characteristics of the power semiconductor devices, such as IGBTs, GTOs and thyristors. The availability of better and faster electronic devices is followed, with some time delay, with the appearance of commercial equipment that use them. The objective of this paper is to review what can be expected of the current technology in order to solve some of the common quality problems. According to these technological developments, the future electrical power supply systems are also foreseen in the paper in the framework of the FRIENDS (Flexible, Reliable and Intelligent Energy Distribution Systems) and PREMIUM POWER PARK

Objective The aim of the present study
was to estimate the need for psychiatric consultation
services and psychiatric inpatient referral among inpatients
of non-psychiatric hospital departments, and
to assess the actual utilization of these services. Methods
The study was carried out among 728 inpatients of
physical rehabilitation wards, medical, surgical, and
gynecological wards in Austrian hospitals. Psychiatric
case identification was performed by research psychiatrists
using the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS).
Diagnoses were given according to DSM-III-R. The
assessment of need for consultation and inpatient
referral was based on the clinical judgments of research
psychiatrists. Results Overall, 34.2% of the inpatients
were cases according to the CIS-criteria, 51.8% of them
needing either psychiatric consultation or inpatient
referral according to research psychiatrists. In 66.7% of
those for whom research psychiatrists had stated a
need, this need was not met (‘‘unmet need’’), while only
33.3% of them had their need met. In contrast, a psychiatric
consultation was performed among5%of those
patients not needing psychiatric services according to
the research psychiatrists (‘‘overprovision’’). Variables
of the health care system (i.e. department type and
catchment area of the hospital) were among the predictors
for ‘‘met needs’’. Conclusion The rate of actual
psychiatric consultations and admissions to psychiatric
wards was markedly lower than the need according
to research psychiatrists’ judgment.

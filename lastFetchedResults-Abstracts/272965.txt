With the objective of achieving composite material systems that feature high stiffness and high mechanical damping,
consideration is given here to unit cell analysis of particulate composites with high volume fraction of inclusions.
Effective elastic properties of the composite are computed with computational homogenization based on unit cell
analysis. The correspondence principle together with the viscoelastic properties of the indium–tin eutectic matrix are
then used to compute the effective viscoelastic properties of the composite. Comparison is made with parallel experiments
upon composites with an indium–tin eutectic matrix and high volume fractions of silicon-carbide reinforcement.
The analytical techniques indicate that combinations of relatively high stiffness and high damping can be achieved in
particulate composites with high SiC volume fractions. Based on analysis, the tradeoffs between stiffness and damping
characteristics are assessed by changing the volume fraction, size, packing, and gradation of the particulate reinforcement
phases. Practical considerations associated with realization of such composites based on the surface energy
between the SiC and the InSn are discussed

Systematic sampling is a nonbiased method in recruitment selection process since it is a probability sampling. However, due to slow recruitment, we modified the systematic sampling and evaluate this technique in comparison with the conventional approach of systematic sampling. In this study, we compare results derived from analysis of few sub samples, with the true parameter from the population based on modified systematic sampling and conventional systematic sampling. We found that our modified systematic sampling is slightly better than conventional approach in systematic sampling.

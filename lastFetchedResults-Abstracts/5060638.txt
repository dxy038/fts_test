This paper investigates the effects of severe range curvature on range-Doppler SAR processing for systems with centre frequencies in the range of 100-200 MHz. The focus is on airborne, strip-map, side-looking SAR systems without range walk (i.e. imaging geometries with a Doppler centroid of zero). The effects on the focusing of a simulated point target are investigated. The main objective is to provide an indication to users of range-Doppler processors what performance could be expected at VHF frequencies when no Doppler-frequency-dependent secondary range compression (SRC) is performed

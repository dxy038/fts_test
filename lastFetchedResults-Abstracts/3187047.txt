In this paper, the character of the ultra-capacitor was discussed, the charging and discharging characters of super capacitor, the differences of the bidirectional dc/dc converter topologies were also discussed, the non-solution bidirectional dc/dc converter was chosen as the main circuit. This paper also stated the control strategy of bidirectional dc/dc converter, the small signal analysis was also given. At last, a simulation with MATLAB was established to prove the feasibility of this method.

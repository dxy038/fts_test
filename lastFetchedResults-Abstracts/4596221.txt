In this paper, an encoding system is proposed to further reduce the power consumption in parallel video encoding based on difference detection and Hilbert transform based workload estimation (HTWE). The proposed parallel encoding system provides an average of 40% computational complexity reduction for parallel encoding without objective performance loss. For the multi-core platform with frequency and voltage scalability, up to 78% of power reduction can be achieved.

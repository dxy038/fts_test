Objective: Measurement of attention at its origin, i.e. brain, is important because it can eliminate excessive interfaces and has special importance for researchers. This study investigates the relations between visual sustained attention and Event Related Potentials (ERP) using morphological features. Methods: Continuous Performance Test (CPT) was used for evaluating the level of sustained attention. Signals were recorded via 32-channel Walter device which had been synchronized with the onset of stimuli in CPT. Nineteen electrodes mounted in an electrode cap according to international 10-20 standard were applied. Extracted epochs which were time-locked to stimuli onset in each group, were averaged to calculate the ERPs. Four-hundred morphological features in ERPs of different electrodes were computed in 51 subjects. Pearson correlation is calculated between these features and the result of CPT. Results: The P3 peak on target stimuli (X) was clearly observed for all subjects in comparison to non-target stimuli. Calculated correlations indicate that thirty three of these features had significant relation with the result of CPT. Conclusions: Obtained results are in complete agreement with previous studies for producing P3 component according to Oddball paradigm. Most of the significant features are related to the relative amplitude of ERP. Consequently achievements represent a reliable relation between the result of CPT and brain signals in many locations of the scalp which can be used for evaluating the sustained attention level.

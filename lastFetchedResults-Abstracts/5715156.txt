This paper deals with the estimation of the power consumption of embedded system. Recently multithreaded processors have emerged as a viable solution for implementing wireless embedded applications. The main objective of this work is to provide the designer of such system with a fast and reliable method to compare the power consumption of algorithms executing on the multi-threaded Xinc processor. For this purpose, we adapt the existing DSP-dedicated FLPA method to the Xinc processor and devise a model which rapidly provides the power consumption of an algorithm with a maximum error of 2,63x %.

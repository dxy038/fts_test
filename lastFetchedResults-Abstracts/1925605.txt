Saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) are prone to an aggressive atherosclerotic process, and the efficacy of drug-eluting stents (DES) in treating this is still debated. In recent years, second-generation DES have been increasingly used in SVG intervention. The main objective of this study was to compare midterm clinical outcomes between first- and second-generation DES in SVGs because data regarding the use of second-generation DES in SVG are lacking. Patients treated with first-generation DES (127 patients with 143 lesions) and those treated with second-generation DES (84 patients with 100 lesions) were included in the study. Major adverse cardiac events, defined as the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization, as well as target vessel revascularization and target lesion revascularization separately, were evaluated at 30-day, 12-month, and 18-month follow-up. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Older grafts were treated with second-generation DES (11.6 ± 5.3 vs 14.3 ± 6.0 years, p = 0.001). Stent length was longer in the first-generation group (34.1 ± 25.1 vs 30.5 ± 19.4 mm, p = 0.006), and maximum balloon diameter was smaller in the second-generation group (3.42 ± 0.42 vs 3.30 ± 0.41 mm, p = 0.003). Embolic protection device use was higher in the second-generation DES group (55.2% vs 72.0%, p = 0.012). At 18-month follow-up, rates of major adverse cardiac events, target vessel revascularization, and target lesion revascularization for the first- and second-generation groups were 24.4% versus 20.2% (p = 0.479), 18.1% versus 14.2% (p = 0.465), and 15.0% versus 10.7% (p = 0.373), respectively. In conclusion, second-generation DES are at least comparable with first-generation DES with regard to clinical outcomes at midterm follow-up.

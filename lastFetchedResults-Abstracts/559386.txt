Full Load Thermoeconomic and environmental optimization of a hybrid Solid oxide fuel cell-Micro gas turbine system for use in distributed power generation has been investigated in this paper. For this reason, a multi objective optimization approach based on genetic algorithm has been incorporated. The hybrid system has been simulated in a computer code and all performance related results for assumed Decision parameters has been validated using available literature data. Decision parameters are calculated in the optimization procedure with respect to the system constraints, to reach the optimum criteria for both Exergetic and Economic Objective functions while the Environment damage penalty is also added to the system total Cost. Effects of fuel unit cost, capital cost and System output size on optimum results has been considered. it is clear from the results that the most sensitive and important design parameter in this system is the fuel cell's current density which it's careful chose has significant effect on the balance between cost and performance of  the system.

Objective: Patients over 60 years of age have higher mortality and morbidity after major
liver resections. Nitric oxide (NO) derived from the catalytic activity of Nos2 plays a beneficial
role in liver regeneration (LR) after partial hepatectomy (PH). In this experiment, we
evaluated the effect of Nos2 knockout (KO) on LR in aged mice after PH.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 52 two-year-old Nos2 KO and 46 the
same age wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2/3 PH. Liver tissues were
collected at 11 time points after PH. Mice survival ratio and liver coefficient (liver-weight/
body-weight) was calculated. Transcript and protein levels were estimated by reverse
transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot, respectively.
Results: The aged Nos2 KO mice had lower survival ratio (P=0.039) and liver coefficient
(P=0.002) at the termination phase. Nos2 transcript level was obviously increased after
PH in WT mice and undetected in the Nos2 KO mice. During LR, the expression at the
transcript level of Cyclin D1, Cyclin A2 and Cyclin B1 and protein expression level of
proliferation marker Ki67 and proliferation-associated transcription factors JNK1, NF-kB
and STAT3 were decreased or delayed. The expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, CASPASE3,
CASPASE9 and BAX, was increased in the Nos2 KO mice.
Conclusion: Decreased survival ratio and impaired LR in aged Nos2 KO mice is probably
due to decreased liver cell proliferation and increased liver cell apoptosis.

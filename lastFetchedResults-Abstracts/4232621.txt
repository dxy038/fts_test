IPTV services will become key services in the next- generation network (NGN). To provide a high-quality service for users, designing and managing the quality of experience (QoE) appropriately is extremely important. To do this, developing an objective quality-assessment method that estimates subjective quality based on physical characteristics of the IPTV system is desirable. We propose a parametric packet-layer model for monitoring video quality of IPTV services. Our proposed model is useful as a network monitoring tool for assessing several video parameters that affect the quality of IPTV services. For constructing the parametric packet-layer model, we derived a relationship between video quality and quality parameters from a subjective quality assessment. The results indicated that cross- correlation was larger than 0.9, and the evaluation error was smaller than the statistical uncertainty of the value of subjective quality. Therefore, our proposed model could be applied to effective design, implementation, and management of IPTV services.

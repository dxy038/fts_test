Introduction: Natural biomaterials and growth factors are key factors in tissue engineering.&nbsp;The objective of the present study was to evaluate transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-&beta;1)&nbsp;and curcumin on proliferation and differentiation of nasal-derived chondrocyte seeded on the&nbsp;fibrin glue scaffold.
Methods: Chondrocytes were isolated from nasal samples. Nasal-derived chondrocytes&nbsp;were seeded on fibrin glue at chondrogenic induction medium for 2 weeks. In this study, the&nbsp;effects of various concentrations of curcumin and TGF-&beta;1 on the survival and proliferation of&nbsp;chondrocytes seeded on fibrin biomaterial were assessed by MTT assays. Also, chondrocytespecific
gene expression was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Results: There were significant differences among the group treated with curcumin 10 &mu;g&nbsp;compared to other groups with regard to cell viability. Also, gene expression of collagen type&nbsp;II, aggrecan, and SOX9 in the chondrocytes seeded on fibrin biomaterial containing the growth&nbsp;factor TGF-&beta;1 significantly differed from those of curcumin and control group.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that TGF-&beta;1 and natural biomaterial of curcumin can be used&nbsp;effectively in chondrogenic viability and differentiation of nasal-derived chondrocyte.

In this paper, we provide an indoor power monitoring and management system which have monitor real-time power consumption information to achieve effective power management. The system includes indoor power meter, digital information platform and ZigBee conversion device with Bluetooth. We develop a power meter to measure power information which the collected power consumption data transmit to digital information platform by ZigBee module. Moreover, we build an empirical database in the information platform through the stored data to determine the state of household appliances. Users could receive power consumption data by smart mobile via ZigBee and Bluetooth conversion device which could be efficiency for improve energy. The objective of green energy management, energy saving and carbon reduction will be achieved.

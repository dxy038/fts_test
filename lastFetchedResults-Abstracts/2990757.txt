The delay Doppler algorithm, derived originally for radar altimetry over the ocean, provides a direct observation of the reflected signalÂ´s angular scattering function. This function can be the limiting factor in near-vertical radar reflections from ice sheets. Maximum SNR detection of these reflections requires that the angular scattering function be matched by the processor. This paper describes two strategies to help achieve this objective: presumming and zero-padding

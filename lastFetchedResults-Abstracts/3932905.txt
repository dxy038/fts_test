Unsaturated net gain of 51 dB is obtained for 1.551 mu m signal light by using two-stage erbium-doped fibre amplifiers pumped by 1.48 mu m laser diodes. This is achieved by using both an optical bandpass filter to suppress amplified spontaneous emission from the first stage amplifier and a bidirectional pumping scheme in the second amplifier to increase saturation output power.

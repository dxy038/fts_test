Summary form only given. The main objective of the present work was to evaluate the potential of subphthalocyanine compounds for second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) applications. The investigation of the second-order NLO properties was carried out by electric-field-induced second harmonic generation (EFISH) and hyper-Rayleigh light scattering (HLS) experiments. The measurements were performed in chloroform solution at, respectively, 1.064 and 1.340 /spl mu/m fundamental wavelength.

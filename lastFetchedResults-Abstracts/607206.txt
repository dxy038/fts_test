The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of static magnetic field (o, 25, 50 and 75mT) and exposure time (15, 30 and 60 minutes) on Feoniculum vulgare seed germination.  Treatment of Foeniculum vulgare seeds in these magnetic fields increased the germination rat (GR), germination index (GI), germination rate coefficient (GRC), seedling length and seedling dry and fresh weight under laboratory germination tests. In germinating seeds, enzyme activities of ?-amylase, dehydrogenase and protease were significantly higher in treated seeds in contrast to controls. The higher enzyme activity in magnetic-field-treated Feoniculum vulgare seeds could be triggering the fast germination and early vigor of seedlings.

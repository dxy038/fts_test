Very few studies have prospectively examined
sex differences in posttraumatic stress symptoms and
symptom trajectories in youth victimized by childhood
sexual abuse. This study addresses that question in a
relatively large sample of children, drawn from the National
Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, who were
between the ages of 8–16 years and who were reported to
Child Protective Services for alleged sexual abuse. Sex
differences were examined using t tests, logistic regression,
and latent trajectory modeling. Results revealed that there
were not sex differences in victims’ posttraumatic stress
symptoms or trajectories. Whereas caseworkers substantiated
girls’ abuse at higher rates than boys’ abuse and rated
girls significantly higher than boys on level of harm, there
were not sex differences in three more objective measures of
abuse severity characteristics. Overall, higher caseworker
ratings of harm predicted higher initial posttraumatic stress
symptom levels, and substantiation status predicted shallower
decreases in trauma symptoms over time. Implications
for theory and intervention are discussed.

The objective of this study was to compare sociodemographic and symptom profiles between U.S. jail inmates and the U.S. general population with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) alcohol use disorder. Data for the study were derived from two large nationally representative surveys, the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails and the 2001â€“2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. U.S. inmates were significantly more likely (P &lt; .007) to be younger, male, Black or Hispanic, to have lower education, and to be separated/divorced/widowed or never married relative to their U.S. general population counterparts. Inmates were also more likely to have more severe alcohol abuse and dependence. Implications of this study are discussed in terms of meeting the unique alcohol treatment needs of U.S. jail inmates including implementation of more intensive alcohol treatment and intervention programs targeting specific needs of inmates with alcohol use disorder as revealed from unique sociodemographic profiles.

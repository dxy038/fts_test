This paper presents the experimental evaluation of the performance of two-branch base-station diversity systems in the 450 MHz band. Both spatial diversity and polarisation diversity have been taken into account with the objective to identify the optimum antenna configuration, which should be of smaller dimensions and possess greater performance characteristics than a straightforward spatial diversity arrangement.

Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common parasitic infection in human and other warm-blooded animals. Serological methods are reliable techniques actually used for diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Comparison of sensitivity of ELISA and DIG-ELISA for diagnosis of human toxoplasmosis was the main objective of the present work.
68 human serum samples (48 positive sera and 20 negative sera) were tested using ELISA and DIG-ELISA (Diffusion in Gel-ELISA). Among three dilutions of sera (1:1, 1:10 and 1:100) tested for evaluation, the serum dilution 1:100 was selected as cut off. in this dilution, diameter of reaction zone was 6.08mm. In ELISA, 1:200 serum dilution was selected as cut off and at this dilution oD was 0.735.
The sensitivity and specificity of DIG-ELISA for serodiagnosis of toxoplasmosis at 1:100 serum dilution were 93.37% ,100% respectively while the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA (at 1:200 serum dilution) were 91.66% , 85% respectively.
The results of present study indicated that, DIG-ELISA in 1:100 serum dilution, in comparison with ELISA proved higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of toxoplasmosis.

A depth image-based error concealment algorithm for 3-D video transmission is proposed, which utilizes the strong correlations between 2-D video and its corresponding the depth map. We first investigate the internal characteristics of the macroblock in the depth map, and then take advantage of these characteristics to recover accurately the lost motion vector for the corrupted blocks, with the joint consideration of the neighbor information and the corresponding depth. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides significant improvements in terms of both objective and subjective evaluations.

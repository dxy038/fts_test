BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Eye examination for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening is a painful procedure, which may cause changes in the facial expression and behavior of premature neonates. Multi-sensory stimulation is a non-pharmacological and anti-pain formulation known to affect the behavioral norms of neonates during painful procedures. This study aimed to determine the effects of multi-sensory stimulation on the facial expression of premature neonates undergoing eye examination for ROP screening.
METHODS: This single-blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted on 80 premature neonates randomly divided into two groups: The intervention group, who received multi-sensory stimulation including the stimulation of taste, touch, sight and smell, and the control group, who received standard care. The facial expression of each neonate was recorded based on the scoring criteria of Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) before, during and after performing the eye examination (IRCT:1N2014100119359).
FINDINGS: The mean gestational age of the neonates in the intervention and control groups was 30.4±1.7 and 30.6±1.8 weeks, respectively. The mean scores of facial expression changes during the eye examinations were 2.8±2.6 and 6.4±2.5 in the intervention group and control group, respectively (p < 0.001). Immediately after performing the eye examinations, facial expression scores of the studied neonates in the intervention group and control groups were recorded as 2.2±2.1 and 5.2±2.9, respectively.
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, multi-sensory stimulation was able to reduce the manifestations of facial expression in the studied neonates. Therefore, this method could be used to diminish these manifestations in neonates during painful examinations.

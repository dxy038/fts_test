Investigations on implementation of web application with different techniques are essential for developers´ as well as users´ perspective. As such, the authors propose to investigate the same by implementing two prototype research web applications based on two different implementation techniques. One of the web applications has been implemented based on the Microsoft .NET technique and the other based on the Java technique. Our objective is to carry out a detailed comparative study of both the techniques in terms of efficiency, reliability, performance, scalability, stability and time to market features of both the techniques. Load and stress testing are performed for both the web applications using Mercury LoadRunner. The statistical analysis of recorded data for both the applications is carried out to study the feasibility of the work. In this study, the authors present in detail the results of the authors´ comparative study on the two techniques.

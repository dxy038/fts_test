Analysis relevant factors of Military vehicle safety, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model military for vehicle traffic safety evaluation is proposed. On the base of building evaluation system of vehicle security in science, the paper applies the ISM model to draw multi-level hierarchy structure and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is set up. The military vehicle safety evaluation system software is developed by Visual Basic. And this software was applied in some army unit. Evaluation results are 79.17 points; the level of security is the general. Example application shows that the method is reliable, evaluation index is reasonable, evaluation results are objective. Finally, precautions of how to complete evaluation of the military vehicle safety are proposed.

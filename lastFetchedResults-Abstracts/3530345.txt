For designing a land mobile radio system, particularly a small zone high capacity system in the UHF band, various performance degradation causes, such as signal fading, cochannel interference, intermodulation disturbance, and sensitivity suppression, should be inclusively taken into account. The magnitudes of these degradations vary with time, because of field strength variation due to multipath fading, environmental shadowing effect, and the distance of mobile station from the base. Hence the circuit performance objective given in a probablistic form must be allotted for in each one of these causes. Variabilities of these degradations are estimated in terms of desired and undesired signal field strength variations. In the estimation, path diversity effect is considered and a root square sum approximation technique is employed. Also, the process used to determine the allottment is proposed from the viewpoints of efficient frequency utilization and realizability of base and mobile radio equipment.

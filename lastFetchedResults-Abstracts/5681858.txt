The use of kinesiological electromyography is established as an evaluation tool for various kinds of applied research, and surface electromyogram (SEMG) has been widely used as a control source for human interfaces such as in a myoelectric prosthetic hand (we call them &#8220;SEMG interfaces&#8221;). It is desirable to be able to control the SEMG interfaces with the same feeling as body movement. The existing SEMG interface mainly focuses on how to achieve accurate recognition of the intended movement. However, detecting muscular strength and reduced number of electrodes are also an important factor in controlling them. Therefore, our objective in this study is the development of and the estimation method for muscular strength that maintains the accuracy of hand motion recognition to reflect the result of measured power in a controlled object. Although the muscular strength can be evaluated by various methods, in this study a grasp force index was applied to evaluate the muscular strength. In order to achieve our objective, we directed our attention to measuring all valuable information for SEMG. This work proposes an application method of two simple linear models, and the selection method of an optimal electrode configuration to use them effectively. Our system required four SEMG measurement electrodes in which locations differed for every subject depending on the individualÂ´s characteristics, and those were selected from a 96ch multi electrode using the Monte Carlo method. From the experimental results, the performance in six normal subjects indicated that the recognition rate of four motions were perfect and the grasp force estimated result fit well with the actual measurement result.

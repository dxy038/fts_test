AbstractObjectives
lore the potential prognostic significance of the lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) in patients with nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as the LMR has been repeatedly proposed to have a negative effect on patient׳s survival in various hematological and solid cancers. However, findings about LMR׳s prognostic significance in RCC have not been reported yet.
s and materials
rospectively evaluated the prognostic significance of the LMR in a cohort comprising 678 patients with nonmetastatic clear cell RCC, who were operated between 2000 and 2010 with curative radical or partial nephrectomy at a single tertiary academic center. Preoperative LMR was calculated 1 day before surgical intervention. Patients were categorized using an LMR cutoff of 3.0. Cancer-specific survival (CSS), metastasis-free survival, and overall survival were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. To evaluate the independent prognostic significance of the LMR, multivariate Cox regression models were applied. Additionally, the influence of the LMR on the predictive accuracy of the Leibovich prognosis score was determined using the Harrell concordance index (c-index) and decision curve analysis.
s
R was statistically significantly associated with older patients (≥65 y), high tumor grade (G3+G4), advanced pathologic T category (pT3+pT4), the presence of histologic tumor necrosis, and male gender (P&lt;0.05). Multivariate analysis identified a low LMR as an independent prognostic factor for patients׳ CSS (hazard ratio = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.10–4.94; P = 0.027). The estimated c-index was 0.83 using the Leibovich prognosis score and 0.86 when the LMR was added.
sions
ing CSS of patients with RCC, a decreased LMR represents an independent prognostic factor. Adding the LMR to well-established prognostic models, such as the Leibovich prognosis score, might improve their predictive ability.

Leachate recirculation or liquid injection in municipal solid waste landfills offers economic and environmental benefits. The key objective of this study was to carry out numerical evaluation of key design variables for leachate recirculation system consisting of vertical wells. In order to achieve the objective, numerical modeling was carried out using the finite-element model HYDRUS-2D. The following design parameters were evaluated by simulating liquid pressure head on the liner and the wetted width of the waste under steady-state flow conditions: (1) hydraulic conductivities of the waste and vertical well backfill; (2) liquid injection rate and dosing frequency; (3) well diameter, screen height and screen depth; and (4) hydraulic conductivity of the leachate collection system, slope of the leachate collection system and spacing of the leachate collection pipes. The key findings of this study are as follows. The well diameter, hydraulic conductivity of the well drainage pack, and screen height and screen depth of the well have very little effect on the wetted width for a given liquid flux. The wetted width and the injection pressure for a given liquid flux decrease with the increase in the hydraulic conductivity of the waste. The pressure head on the liner increases with the decrease in the vertical distance between the bottom of the well screen and the top of leachate collection system. The liquid injection flux increases with the decrease in hydraulic conductivity of the leachate collection system. Unlike sand (k   10âˆ’4 m/s), pea gravel (k   0.01 m/s) resulted in less than 0.3 m pressure head on the liner for all simulations carried out in this study.

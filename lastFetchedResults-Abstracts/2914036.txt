The ROSe-Hulman ElectroMagnetics software (ROSEM) was developed with support from the Center for Computer Applications in ElectroMagnetics Education (CAEME). Although the main objective was to develop a computer tool to assist in instruction and visualization of electromagnetic phenomena, ROSEM is versatile and useful as a research tool as well. ROSEM software is targeted at IBM compatible 286-class and 386-class personal computers (PCs) with coprocessors, VGA graphics, and pointers. The choice of 286-class and 386-class computers as the target machines and the fact that the software should be intuitive and graphics oriented lead to the selection of two-dimensional (2-D) electromagnetic field problems as the class of problems to be solved by ROSEM. ROSEM employs the finite difference (FD) technique augmented by a unique grid termination algorithm to solve 2-D static and dynamic interior and exterior electromagnetic boundary value problems

Some antennas like bowtie, spiral, log-periodic array and conical spiral are known as frequency independent in context of antenna parameters like input impedance, reflection coefficient, gain and radiation pattern. In this paper, the work is done on bowtie and spiral antenna due to their easy construction and implementation. Although both the antennas are considered as frequency independent but shows some variation in their patterns with wide variation of frequency. Objective of this paper is to find the variation of two and three dimensional radiation pattern of both type of antenna based on RWG (Rao-Wilton-Glisson) element.

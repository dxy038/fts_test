In this paper, we investigate the effect of mobility constraints on epidemic broadcast mechanisms in DTNs (Delay-Tolerant Networks). Major factors affecting epidemic broadcast performances are its forwarding algorithm and node mobility. The impact of forwarding algorithm and node mobility on epidemic broadcast mechanisms has been actively studied in the literature, but those studies generally use unconstrained mobility models. The objective of this paper is therefore to quantitatively investigate the effect of mobility constraints on epidemic broadcast mechanisms. We evaluate the performances of three classes of epidemic broadcast mechanisms - P-BCAST (PUSH-based BroadCast), SA-BCAST (Self-Adaptive BroadCast), and HP-BCAST (History-based P-BCAST) - with a random waypoint mobility model with mobility constraints. Our finding includes that the existence of mobility constraints significantly improves the reach ability and dissemination speed of epidemic broadcast mechanisms while degrading their efficiency.

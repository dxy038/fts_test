Objective: To evaluate the scalp topography of the potentials related to saccades and blinks.
Methods: The scalp topographies of the potentials associated with saccades and blinks were recorded in 60 subjects. The topographies were analyzed using both source components and attenuation factors, with each factor representing the fraction of the potential recorded in peri-ocular electrodes that contributes to the EEG recorded from a particular scalp location.
Results: Blinks and upward saccades generated potentials with very different topographies. Left and right saccades and up and down saccades generated equal but inverted fields except at peri-ocular locations where subtle inequalities occurred. The potentials associated with lateral saccades were consistently larger in female subjects than in male subjects.
Conclusions: The differences in the scalp topographies between blinks and vertical saccades can be explained by the different ways in which they are generated. Blink potentials are caused by the eyelids sliding down over the positively charged cornea, whereas saccade potentials are caused by changes in the orientation of the corneoretinal dipole. Any compensation procedure for ocular artifacts must take into account the topographic differences between blinks and upward saccades.

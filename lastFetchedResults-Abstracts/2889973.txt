The guidance of a launch vehicle with constraints on the impact point of the spent stages is discussed. Guidance equations for a flat Earth based model is studied and an analytical optimization algorithm called FE guidance algorithm is validated for honoring the targeted states even under the circumstances of modified initial conditions. The splash down constraint can be imposed into this existing model through a numerical optimization technique, with objective function of maximizing payload mass. Combining the merits of both these techniques a Numerico Analytical optimization algorithm is proposed that maximizes payload mass with guaranteed splash down constraint. The proposed algorithm could be run in parallel with an existing algorithm for on board guidance.

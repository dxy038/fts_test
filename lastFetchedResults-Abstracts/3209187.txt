This manuscript presents the results achieved after using the Central Force Optimization (CFO) algorithm, proposed by Formato on 2007, for solving a system of nonlinear equations, which represents an electronic circuit operating on dc. At first, a brief theoretical foundation of CFO is shown, as well as a theorem that shows why it is possible to solve this type of systems through an optimization algorithm. Afterwards, its behavior for some standard functions, is commented. Moreover, results with a basic circuit, and a scalable one, are discussed. It was found that CFO does not operate well for nearly plain regions, such as the one between zero volts and the conduction voltage of a diode. This is later demonstrated by using an objective function built with a system of exponential equations. Even after a couple of modifications, CFO was not able to find a valid answer for systems of three or more variables, so it is concluded that this approach should be avoided, at least for the time being, for the solution of equations with a planar or almost planar region and the previously mentioned number of unknowns.

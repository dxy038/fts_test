Bluetooth is a world-wide wireless interface for short range links. The elementary Bluetooth network is a single hop piconet. Many piconets can be connected with in the form of wireless ad hoc network called scatternet. Bridge nodes are responsible for the communication of more than one piconet with in the Scatternet. In particular, many scientists have addressed the issues of Bluetooth scatternet formation in different research papers. In this paper we proposed Least Frequently used Bridge Reduction LFUB Protocol. Main objective of LFUB is unnecessary bridge reduction. According to our proposed protocol we will change the status (Bridge to Slave) of that bridge node which is not most frequently used and is subset of another bridge node, LFUB protocol first gives the priority to that bridge node which is MFU and then gives the priority to bridge degree. Simulation results shows proposed protocol LFUB overcomes the problems of packet loss, delay, and control overheads. Our proposed protocol improves the network throughput and performs better results as compare to the previous protocol Dynamic Relay Reduction DRR Protocol.

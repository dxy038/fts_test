An approach for data fusion in wireless sensor networks involves the use of mobile agents that selectively visit the sensors and incrementally fuse the data, thereby eliminating the unnecessary transmission of irrelevant or non-critical data. The order of sensors visited along the route determines the quality of the fused data and the communication cost. We model the mobile agent routing problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, maximizing the total detected signal energy while minimizing the energy consumption and path loss. Simulation results show that this problem can be solved successfully using evolutionary multi-objective algorithms such as EMOCA and NSGA-II. This approach also enables choosing between two alternative routing algorithms, to determine which one results in higher detection accuracy.

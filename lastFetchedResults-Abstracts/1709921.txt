The development of durable bonds using titanium adherens has been investigated from the point of view of surface energy theoretical models measurements. The traditional Chromium Acid Anodization, which provides excellent durability, has to be phased out due to the use of hazardous Cr (VI) in the bath and as a result, special attention is paid to the sodium hydroxide anodizing and other alkaline chemical etchers. There are hardly any references on the surface free energy of adhesive titanium oxide coatings and therefore the objective of this work was to evaluate the surface and interface energy parameters of the various types of alkaline chromate free surface treatments using Neumann, Fowkes and van Oss–Chaudhury–Good methods in order to determine which method provides greatest differentiation between the coatings. Results show that Fowkes method produced the greatest variance in surface energies of the compared surface treatments and hence can be considered as better suited for more accurate discrimination between the oxide surface treatments on Ti–6Al–4V alloy. Although, in the case of model liquids, i.e. water and diiodomethane, the trends obtained for contact angles, surface energies, works of adhesion and solid/liquid interface energies all correlated between each other, a disagreement between the trends of solid/liquid interface energies calculated using Fowkes and van Oss–Chaudhury–Good methods for surface treatment/adhesive resin was obtained. In case of real adhesive systems, the use of work of adhesion appears more adequate in order to discriminate the surface treatments. Based on these findings the anodization in the tested alkaline bath after a previous alkali etching in the same bath is recommended, although adhesion test has to be still performed.

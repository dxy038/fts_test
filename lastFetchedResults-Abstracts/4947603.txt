In this paper, we explore an application of fuzzy similar relation (FSR) to variable precision rough set (VPRS) model for fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) in service provider (SP) selection of mobile operators. First, we describe the problem of FMOLP for SP selection, where the attribute value of SPs is transformed into a relative membership. Next, we define an FSR, based on which fuzzy similar classes are acquired from the relative membership decision table. Instead of equivalence classes, fuzzy similar classes are used in the VPRS model for quality of classification (QoC). Then, we use the method of attribute reduction to assign weights to multi-objective functions. Thus, we transform multi-objective functions with weights into a single objective function. Finally, a case study on SP selection of a mobile operator is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.

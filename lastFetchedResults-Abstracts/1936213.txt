     In this paper, the dual-resource constrained flexible job-shop scheduling problem (DRCFJSP) with objective of minimizing the makespan is investigated. Under studied problem is NP-hard and mainly includes three sub-problems. The first one is to assign each operation to a machine out of a set of capable machines, the second one is to determine a worker among a set of skilled workers for processing each operation on the selected machine and the third one deals with sequencing the assigned operations on the machines considering workers in order to optimize the performance measure. In this paper, we provide a mathematical model for this problem and then propose a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm for solving the problem. The proposed hybrid algorithm uses variable neighborhood search and simulated annealing algorithms to search in the solution space. Computational study with randomly generated test problems is performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show the proposed algorithms are effective approaches for solving the DRCFJSP.

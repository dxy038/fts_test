The authors address the Government Systems Group (GSG) Software Quality Evaluation´s (SQE´s) plans for applying total quality management to a DOD-STD-2167A software development environment. They describe the software quality processes that are necessary for implementing a total software quality management (TSQM) process. The inclusion of the TSQM process is the next step in expanding GSG´s Software Quality Program (SQP). The objective of the TSQM process is to emphasize process-driven quality that is performed by the development organizations, the types of software metrics that are required, and the role that the software metrics play in achieving higher-quality software products. The TSQM process will expand the DOD-STD-2168 software quality evaluation methodology into the entire software development environment

In ad-hoc networks, the optimal hop size is a trade-off between the transmission errors and the number of hops required. This paper investigates the optimal hop size and transmission strategy in networks with overlaid base stations. The objective is to maximize the minimum throughput any user achieves, excluding traffic that it relays. The optimum depends on the routing algorithm used, and a specific receiver-based algorithm is proposed. Optimal parameters are derived using a simplified model, and are shown by simulation to out-perform systems with the optimal position-invariant hop size. For this choice of objective, improvement is obtained by using one hop size for the base station and another for relays.

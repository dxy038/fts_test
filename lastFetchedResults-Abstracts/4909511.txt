In this paper the problem of texture image analysis in the presence of noise is examined from a higher-order statistical perspective. The objective is to develop analysis techniques through which robust texture characteristics are extracted. The approach taken involves the use of autoregressive models derived from joint second and third order cumulants. The paper describes the fundamental issues of the various components of the approach

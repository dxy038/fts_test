The development of optimization models for energy systems planning has attracted considerable interest over the past decades. However, the uncertainties that are inherent in the planning process and the complex interactions among various uncertain parameters are challenging the capabilities of these developed tools. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a hybrid interval-fuzzy two-stage stochastic energy systems planning model (IFTEM) to deal with various uncertainties that can be expressed as fuzzy numbers, probability distributions and discrete intervals. The developed IFTEM is then applied to a hypothetical regional energy system. The results indicate that the IFTEM has advantages in reflecting complexities of various system uncertainties as well as dealing with two-stage stochastic decision problems within energy systems.

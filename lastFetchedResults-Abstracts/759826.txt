Impulsivity is a hallmark of two of the three
DSM-IV ADHD subtypes and is associated with myriad
adverse outcomes. Limited research, however, is available
concerning the mechanisms and processes that contribute to
impulsive responding by children with ADHD. The current
study tested predictions from two competing models of
ADHD—working memory (WM) and behavioral inhibition
(BI)—to examine the extent to which ADHD-related impulsive
responding was attributable to model-specific mechanisms
and processes. Children with ADHD (n021) and
typically developing children (n020) completed laboratory
tasks that provided WM (domain-general central executive
[CE], phonological/visuospatial storage/rehearsal) and BI
indices (stop-signal reaction time [SSRT], stop-signal delay,
mean reaction time). These indices were examined as potential
mediators of ADHD-related impulsive responding on
two objective and diverse laboratory tasks used commonly
to assess impulsive responding (CPT: continuous performance
test; VMTS: visual match-to-sample). Bias-corrected, bootstrapped
mediation analyses revealed that CE processes significantly
attenuated between-group impulsivity differences,
such that the initial large-magnitude impulsivity differences
were no longer significant on either task after accounting for
ADHD-related CE deficits. In contrast, SSRT partially mediated
ADHD-related impulsive responding on the CPT but not
VMTS. This partial attenuation was no longer significant after
accounting for shared variance between CE and SSRT; CE
continued to attenuate the ADHD-impulsivity relationship
after accounting for SSRT. These findings add to the growing
literature implicating CE deficits in core ADHD behavioral
and functional impairments, and suggest that cognitive interventions
targeting CE rather than storage/rehearsal or BI processes
may hold greater promise for alleviating ADHDrelated
impairments

This paper introduces a SEPIC-derived bidirectional dc-dc converter. The proposed converter utilizes tapped inductor and charge pump techniques to achieve steep voltage conversion ratio and an active lossless regenerative snubber to attain lossless switching and high efficiency. The paper presents the principle of operation, steady-state analyses, and experimental results obtained from a 400-W, 48-V/380-V prototype. The efficiency of the proposed topology is demonstrated to peak at 96.4% for boost mode and 95.0% for buck mode.

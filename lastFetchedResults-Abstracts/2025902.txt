Generation control is an important objective of
power system operation. In modern power system, the
traditional automatic generation control (AGC) is modified
by incorporating the effect of bilateral contracts. This paper
investigates application of chaotic particle swarm
optimization (CPSO) for optimized operation of restructured
AGC system. To obtain optimum gains of controllers,
application of adaptive inertia weight factor and constriction
factors is proposed to improve performance of particle swarm
optimization (PSO) algorithm. It is also observed that chaos
mapping using logistic map sequence increases convergence
rate of traditional PSO algorithm. The hybrid method
presented in this paper gives global optimum gains of
controller with significant improvement in convergence rate
over basic PSO algorithm. The effectiveness and efficiency of
the proposed algorithm have been tested on two area
restructure system

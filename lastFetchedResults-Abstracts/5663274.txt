We report on a novel Thin-Silicon Injector (TSI) selector concept with bidirectional operation for high density resistive switching memory. Model-based analysis shows how the current drive-nonlinearity trade-off can be broken by properly combining physical material properties to enable decoupling control parameters of the current injection from those of selectivity. We demonstrate experimentally structures down to 40nm-size, featuring a high-drive current of ~1MA/cm<sup>2</sup>, high current-voltage half-bias nonlinearity exceeding 6.10<sup>3</sup> at maximum current drive and very good reliability of &gt;10<sup>7</sup>cy endurance, with limited degradation of the selectivity. The selector has below 20nm thickness and it is fully implementable with readily available BEOL CMOS-compatible materials and processes.

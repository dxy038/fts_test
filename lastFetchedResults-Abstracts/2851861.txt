This paper presents a multifunctional bidirectional converter. The proposed converter works as a grid-tied inverter, injecting power coming from a PV subsystem to the AC mains in the daytime hours, but also supplies energy to a LED-based street lighting system at night. The topology is based on the integration of two Flyback converters thus allowing the desired bidirectional energy flux. Each Flyback has a different polarity, making energy flowing in both directions possible. A prototype was built in order to prove the feasibility of the proposed topology and experimental results are shown below. In rectifier mode, an efficiency of 86% was achieved while a 88.9% in inverter mode.

One purpose is to develop and apply a theoretical approach that takes the strategic actions of the firm and its network context into consideration. Empirically, the aim is to identify, describe and categorize various strategic issues when an actor aims to introduce waste recycling activities in its network. The framework is applied to a case describing a food retail chainâ€™s ecological re-positioning in a system for the recycling of waste.

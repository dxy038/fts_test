Efforts have been directed toward production of efficient, large-area, low-cost photovoltaic modules based on the CdS/CdTe heterojunction, with the objective being to develop an improved materials technology and fabrication process for limited volume production of 1-ft<sup>2</sup> and 4-ft<sup>2</sup> CdS/CdTe photovoltaic modules. The present structure of the CdS/CdTe polycrystalline thin-film photovoltaic devices being produced is presented, along with its potential for efficiency improvement. Junction characterization studies are summarized. Module design is described, particularly with regard to encapsulation issue. Future developmental directions are discussed

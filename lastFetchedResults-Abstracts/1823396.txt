Objective
viously demonstrated that the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a nociceptive ion channel receptor, by capsaicin led to the up-regulation of the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) ratio in human periodontal ligament (HPDL) cells. Since TRPV1 is recognised as one of the thermo-sensitive cation channels, this study investigated the response of TRPV1 to thermal stimulation in HPDL cells.
s
ells were incubated at 45 °C for thermal stimulation. The mRNA expression of OPG, RANKL, tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), and interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) was determined by using RT-PCR. OPG secretion and RANKL protein expression were analysed by ELISA and Western blot analysis, respectively. The mechanisms of heat-induced TNFα expression were studied using several TRPV1 inhibitors.
s
trast to capsaicin, thermal stimulation had no effect on OPG or RANKL expression. Interestingly, the mRNA expression of TNFα, but not IL-1β, was increased by heat. Using TRPV1 antagonists, we confirmed that TNFα up-regulation was mediated by TRPV1. Phospholipase C (PLC) was previously shown to be involved in capsaicin-induced OPG expression. However, we found that protein kinase C, not PLC, was required for heat-induced TNFα expression. Additionally, the use of cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerisation, revealed that cytoskeleton rearrangement might be an important mechanism for cellular sensing of thermal stimuli.
sion
sults indicate that TRPV1 plays a multi-functional role in HPDL cells depending on the stimuli. In response to heat, TRPV1 activation leads to the induction of TNFα expression.

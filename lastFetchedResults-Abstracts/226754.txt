We present a system for decorating arbitrary surfaces with bidirectional texture functions (BTF). Our system generates
BTFs in two steps. First, we automatically synthesize a BTF over the target surface from a given BTF sample. Then, we let the user
interactively paint BTF patches onto the surface such that the painted patches seamlessly integrate with the background patterns. Our
system is based on a patch-based texture synthesis approach known as quilting. We present a graphcut algorithm for BTF synthesis
on surfaces and the algorithm works well for a wide variety of BTF samples, including those which present problems for existing
algorithms. We also describe a graphcut texture painting algorithm for creating new surface imperfections (e.g., dirt, cracks, scratches)
from existing imperfections found in input BTF samples. Using these algorithms, we can decorate surfaces with real-world textures that
have spatially-variant reflectance, fine-scale geometry details, and surfaces imperfections. A particularly attractive feature of
BTF painting is that it allows us to capture imperfections of real materials and paint them onto geometry models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our system with examples.

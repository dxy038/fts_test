A generalized optimization problem in which design space is also a design to be found is de9ned
and a numerical implementation method is proposed. In conventional optimization, only a portion of
structural parameters is designated as design variables while the remaining set of other parameters
related to the design space are often taken for granted. A design space is speci9ed by the number
of design variables, and the layout or con9guration. To solve this type of design space problems, a
simple initial design space is selected and gradually improved while the usual design variables are
being optimized. To make the design space evolve into a better one, one may increase the number of
design variables, but, in this transition, there are discontinuities in the objective and constraint functions.
Accordingly, the sensitivity analysis methods based on continuity will not apply to this discontinuous
stage. To overcome the di=culties, a numerical continuation scheme is proposed based on a new concept
of a pivot phase design space. Two new categories of structural optimization problems are formulated
and concrete examples shown

Iran before the present century has owned a relatively modest system, but in the last six decades, the capitalization development within the oil-based economic framework has led to urban system spatial imbalances in the country. On the other hand, the Spatial Equilibrium of the Urban System in National- Regional Levels is in the pledge of Spatial Equilibrium in region. So, the present study, with the objective of examining the Spatial Equilibrium of the Urban System in National- Regional Levels for 1956- 2012, has been performed. This method is descriptive - analytical. The statistical society includes the urban settlements in the past 60 years and data collection method is as evidence. In this study, in order to examine the spatial equilibrium of urban system in Iranian Provinces, the Entropy Model was used. This is evident that considering that the urban system tends to a desirable spatial equilibrium, but because of the difference with normal rate, the imbalance of spatial equilibrium of the urban system in national- regional levels in Iran is remained as in the case of the number of urban settlements, it is more evident.

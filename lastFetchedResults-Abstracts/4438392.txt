This paper proposes an optimization model for the determination of LLC resonant converter design parameters. The optimization model is developed based on the fundamental harmonic approximation (FHA) analysis and variable reluctance control method. The objective of the optimal design is to reach the maximum controllability characteristics by the resonant converter. The reluctance control strategy is used as converter controller because it presents a wide range controllability compared to switching frequency based control methods. To verify the optimization results, an accurate converter model is implemented by PSPICE software; the converter model takes into account the parasitic elements of the power semiconductor switches. Simulation results are presented for the resonant converter with optimal parameters. The results obtained from simulations show acceptable agreement with the theatrical analysis.

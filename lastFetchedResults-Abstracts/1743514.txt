Objective
estigate the influence of workload setting (speed at constant power, method to impose power) on the propulsion technique (i.e. force and timing characteristics) in handrim wheelchair propulsion.

 able-bodied men participated in this study. External forces were measured during handrim wheelchair propulsion on a motor driven treadmill at different velocities and constant power output (to test the forced effect of speed) and at power outputs imposed by incline vs. pulley system (to test the effect of method to impose power). Outcome measures were the force and timing variables of the propulsion technique.
s
d timing variables showed significant differences between the speed conditions when propelling at the same power output (p &lt; 0.01). Push time was reduced while push angle increased. The method to impose power only showed slight differences in the timing variables, however not in the force variables.
sions
chers and clinicians must be aware of testing and evaluation conditions that may differently affect propulsion technique parameters despite an overall constant power output.

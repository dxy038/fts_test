Designers' intent for the form, fit and function of products is expressed by design tolerances the conformance to which is the main objective of manufacturing processes. A methodology for maximizing the adherence to the specified tolerances using an integrated machining and inspection system is presented. Considering the desired tolerance envelope of the part, an error decomposition technique is developed to model machining errors caused by the systematic and non-systematic errors in the machine tool. The model is used to adaptively plan the final machining cuts, based on inspection feedback, to enhance the geometric accuracy of the final product and is illustrated by an example. This approach reduces scrap and rework and their associated costs.

Background: With regard to existence of all conditions for spreading tuberculosis(TB) in prison including overcrowding, HIV, Injection Drug Users (IDU), malnutrition and poverty, and on the other hand as TB is the most important cause of mortality / morbidity in HIV patients and prisoners, so prisons are one of the main sources of transmission of Multi Drug Resistance Tuberculosis (MDRTB) to community. Thus an exhaustive investigation about it seems necessary. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study carried out on all of the volunteer prisoners of Kermanshah city central prison in the first 4 months of 2008.We scored clinical symptoms and sings according to WHO guideline and for the symptoms which were not in the guideline, were separately scored under the title of quot total scorequot . Then the prisoners who had WHO score 5 or total scorege 8 or BMI<20 or a past history of TB treatment, were evaluated for TB. Finally prisoners with diagnosis of TB were tested for HIV and data was statistically analyzed. Results: 2030 (92.27%) from 2200 prisoners have been visited that 469 (23.1%) of them had WHO score (Wge 5) 287 (14.3%) total score (Tge 8) 159 (7/83%) BMI (B<20) and 14 prisoners had a past history of TB treatment. Total acquisition of score cutoff points was915 but after deleting overleaps, the net numbers of patients that could enter into the second stage were 612 (30.14%) and among them, 470 (76.8%) chest Xray and from 198 (32.35%) smears were taken. Finally 5 smears positive pulmonary TB had diagnosed all cases had wge 5,but 4(80%)Tge 8 and 2(20%) had BMI<20 and non of them had no past history of TB treatment.

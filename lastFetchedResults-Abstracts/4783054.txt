The objective of this paper was to develop a complete suitability evaluation index system on brownfield redevelopment using a case study of the Former Huishan Pesticide Factory in Wuxi City, China. In this paper, the Extreme Condition Method, the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) were employed for the case study. The results indicated that (1) the suitability evaluation index system of the Land Suitability Class should be estabilished, which was based on concentrations of soil pollutants from the perspective of human health. The suitability evaluation index system of the Construction Land Suitability Class may be determined based on reusing for residential, entertaining, commercial and industrial sites from the perspective of ecological, social and economic conditions. (2) The result of the suitability evaluation indicates that the Former Huishan Pesticide Factory Brownfield could be redeveloped into a residential site, commercial site and entertaining site, which was entirely consistent with the actual municipal planning. (3) To carry out a rational and efficient layout, the Former Huishan Pesticide Factory Brownfield was suggested to be favorablly reusing as a residential and commercial site first and then entertaining site. In addition, remediation technology could be adjusted according to the planning of land reuse in order to achieve the maximum benefits of the reparation. In conclusion, the suitability evaluation of brownfield redevelopment with combining the Land Suitability Class with the Construction Land Suitability Class was viable and effective.

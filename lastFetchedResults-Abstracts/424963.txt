The objective of this investigation is to consider the role of family food interaction in healthful dietary activity. A theoretical model is proposed in which three sets of determinate variables are specified as leading to interaction in the family on food issues which, in turn, is predicted to have a positive effect on four indicators of dietary quality. 150 married couples from a midwestern US state were randomly selected and interviewed. The findings provide clear evidence of the importance of family food interaction for the quality of marital partners' diet. Also differences found between husbands and wives indicate that wives contribute more to husbands' dietary quality than the reverse, suggesting again the dominant status of wives in family food selection and preparation.

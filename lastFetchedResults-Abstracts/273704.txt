Topology optimization is used to systematically design periodic materials that are optimized for multiple properties and
prescribed symmetries. In particular, mechanical stiffness and fluid transport are considered. The base cell of the periodic
material serves as the design domain and the goal is to determine the optimal distribution of material phases within this
domain. Effective properties of the material are computed from finite element analyses of the base cell using numerical homogenization
techniques. The elasticity and fluid flow inverse homogenization design problems are formulated and existing techniques
for overcoming associated numerical instabilities and difficulties are discussed. These modules are then combined and
solved to maximize bulk modulus and permeability in periodic materials with cubic elastic and isotropic flow symmetries. The
multiphysics problem is formulated such that the final design is dependent on the relative importance, or weights, assigned by
the designer to the competing stiffness and flow terms in the objective function. This allows the designer to tailor the microstructure
according to the materialsâ€™ future application, a feature clearly demonstrated by the presented results. The methodology
can be extended to incorporate other material properties of interest as well as the design of composite materials.

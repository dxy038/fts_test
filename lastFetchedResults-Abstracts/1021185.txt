Background and Objective: Since the effect of self-respect upon the mental hygiene and physical health of man and his social behavior cannot be ignored, it seems necessary to shed light on the standpoint of religion and science in this issue. The importance of this concern is manifested when we choose coexisting relationship exist between both religion and science. In this research, we demonstrate the concomitant relationship between religion and science concerning self-concept and self-respect and their effect on physical and mental health. The word " self-concept " as a social psychological term ,contains this  kind of evaluation along with a  series of oneâ€™s  beliefs  and feelings  about himself or  others about him, and is equal to  the word "Mokhtal" in Quranic terms. 
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, the data were collected from the documents and books and journals in the libraries. 
Results: Quranic emphasis on creation of an objective- based universe especially in the case of human beings causes to understand this fact that man should not miss his valuable pearl of existence very heedlessly. In the Social psychology, this kind of attitude toward the existence and man can be as a reason for "self -esteem", which is considered as the cornerstone for a normal behavior in society.  
Conclusion: Among the findings of this research is illumination of a mutual relationship existing between science and religion and providing some new evidence for the influence of this relationship on health of human beings.

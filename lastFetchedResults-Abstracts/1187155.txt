The objective in this paper is to present some recent developments regarding the subspace iteration method for the solution of frequencies and mode shapes. The developments pertain to speeding up the basic subspace iteration method by choosing an effective number of iteration vectors and by the use of parallel processing. The subspace iteration method lends itself particularly well to shared and distributed memory processing. We present the algorithms used and illustrative sample solutions. The present paper may be regarded as an addendum to the publications presented in the early 1970s, see Refs. , taking into account the changes in computers that have taken place.

Selection of appropriate material is a crucial step in engineering design and manufacturing process. Without a systematic technique, many useful engineering materials may be ignored for selection. The category of multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) methods is an effective set of structured techniques. Having uncomplicated assumptions and mathematics, the MULTIMOORA method as an MADM approach can be effectively utilized for materials selection. In this paper, we developed an extension of MULTIMOORA method based on Shannon entropy concept to tackle materials selection process. The entropy concept was considered to assign relative importance to decision-making attributes. The proposed model consists of two scenarios named the weighted and entropy-weighted MULTIMOORA methods. In the first scenario, subjective weight was considered in the formulation of the approach like most of conventional MADM methods. The general form of entropy weight that is a combination of subjective and objective weighting factors was employed for the second scenario. We examined two popular practical examples concerning materials selection to show the application of the suggested approach and to reveal the effect of entropy weights. Our results were compared with the earlier studies.

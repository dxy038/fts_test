This article examines the use of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to choose a priority for different purposes which have been used in fishery optimal management in the Sea of Oman. There are several stakeholder groups in the multi-objective planning methods. In this study, the AHP is used to determine the preferences (weight) of stakeholder groups for each of the objectives in the fisheries industry. This method is a multicriteria analysis system which is suitable for including the inconsistent opinion of different groups involved in the management. Based on the results, biological targets received higher weights compared to other targets with regard to stakeholder groups. Especially, the minimization of by catch was found to be the most important objective.

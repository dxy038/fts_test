Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is a non-invasive imaging technology that aims at the visualisation of the cross-sectional permittivity distribution of a dielectric object based on the measured capacitance data. Successful applications of ECT depend greatly on the precision and speed of the image reconstruction algorithms. ECT image reconstruction is a typical ill-posed problem, and its solution is unstable, that is, the solution is sensitive to noises in the input data. Methods that ensure the stability of a solution while enhancing the quality of the reconstructed images should be used to obtain a meaningful reconstruction result. An image reconstruction algorithm based on the regularised total least squares (TLS) method that considers the errors in both the sensitivity field matrix and the capacitance data for ECT is presented. The regularised TLS method is extended using a combination robust estimation technique and an extended stabilising functional according to the ill-posed characteristics of ECT, which transforms the image reconstruction problem into an optimisation problem. In addition, the Newton algorithm is employed to solve the objective functional. Numerical simulations indicate that the algorithm is feasible and overcomes the numerical instability of ECT image reconstruction; for the cases of the reconstructed objects considered here, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images obtained using the algorithm is enhanced; as a result, an efficient method for ECT image reconstruction is introduced.

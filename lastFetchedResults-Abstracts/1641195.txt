The main objective of this study was to compare the performance of three kinds of stone matrix asphalt (SMA) mixtures (using basalt coarse and fine aggregates, named B-SMA; limestone coarse and fine aggregates, named L-SMA; basalt coarse aggregates and limestone fine aggregates, named BL-SMA). The results indicated that B-SMA shows the best rutting resistance, followed by BL-SMA and L-SMA comes in last. However, in terms of low temperature performance of resistance to cracking and moisture susceptibility, they have the reverse sequence. The aggregate type has a significant effect on rutting resistance, but no significant difference in low temperature cracking susceptibility or moisture susceptibility was found in SMA mixtures. Also, master curves of dynamic modulus for three SMA mixtures were constructed and B-SMA shows the highest dynamic modulus, while L-SMA shows the smallest dynamic modulus at each frequency.

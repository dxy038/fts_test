Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) has vital and signifcant applications in different medical felds and is used for the primary evaluation of neurological
disorders. Hence, having easy access to suitable and useful signal is very important.
Artifacts are undesirable confusions which are generally originated from inevitable
human activities such as heartbeat, blinking of eyes and facial muscle activities while
receiving EEG signal. It can bring about deformation in these waves though.
Objective: The objective of this study was to fnd a suitable solution to eliminate
the artifacts of Vital Signals.
Methods: In this study, wavelet transform technique was used. This method is
compared with threshold level. The threshold intensity is effciently crucial because
it should not remove the original signal instead of artifacts, and does not hold artifact
signal instead of original ones. In this project, we seek to fnd and implement the algorithm with the ability to automatically remove the artifacts in EEG signals. For this
purpose, the use of adaptive fltering methods such as wavelet analysis is appropriate.
Finally, we observed that Functional Link Neural Network (FLN) performance is better than ANFIS and RBFN to remove such artifacts.
Results: We offer an intelligent method for removing artifacts from vital signals in
neurological disorders.
Conclusion: The proposed method can obtain more accurate results by removing
artifacts of vital signals and can be useful in the early diagnosis of neurological and
cardiovascular disorders.

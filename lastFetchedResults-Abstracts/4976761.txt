The nonlinear control method explored in this paper uses voltage modulation for controlling human quadriceps femoris muscle undergoing non-isometric neuromuscular electrical stimulation. The control objective is to provide computer controlled stimulation to enable the lower limb of a human to either go to a desired constant position or follow a time-varying desired trajectory. An advantage of the developed controller is that it is robust to nonlinear disturbances and does not require a muscle model. Experimental results are provided that illustrate the performance of the controller.

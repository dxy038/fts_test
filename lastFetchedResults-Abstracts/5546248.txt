The present work provides a new approach to solve the well-known multi-robot co-operative box pushing problem as a multi objective optimization problem using modified Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization. The method proposed here allows both turning and translation of the box, during shift to a desired goal position. We have employed local planning scheme to determine the magnitude of the forces applied by the two mobile robots perpendicularly at specific locations on the box to align and translate it in each distinct step of motion of the box, for minimization of both time and energy. Finally the results are compared with the results obtained by solving the same problem using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The proposed scheme is found to give better results compared to NSGA-II.

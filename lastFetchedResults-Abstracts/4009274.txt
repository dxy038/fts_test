The objective of this work was to study interactions in a fine particle system as a function of the dispersion process. Barium ferrite dispersions have been studied in the frozen state so that the microstructure remains unchanged when subject to a magnetic field. The interactions in the dispersions were studied with the well established &#948;M technique and were seen to decrease towards zero as the samples were milled for longer times. We attribute this to the milling process causing the breakdown of stacks in the dispersion

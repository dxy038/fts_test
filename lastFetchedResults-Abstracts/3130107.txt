There is many control strategies used in the inverter. However, which is the most efficient control law in the same condition? So in this paper a novel multi-objective optimal SPWM (MOSPWM) control strategy of the inverter based on genetic algorithm (GA) is presented, which can find the effective one. In this control strategy a multi-objective function was created, which enables a voltage-source type inverter to produce a near standard sine waveform with a minimum switching loss. Through computer simulation different parameters of GA have been selected in order to reach fitness function optimization, and conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the new control technology. Comparative analysis proving superiority of the MOSPWM technique over the existing conventional PWM methods is presented.

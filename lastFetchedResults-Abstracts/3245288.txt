This paper presents implementation of different types of faults in a Microgrid System. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been designed in order to apply and observe the behavior of overall system easily. The objective of the paper is to implement short circuit, load switching and line loss faulty conditions to a microgrid system that run by multiple diesel engine generators successfully and also develop a GUI that helps users on application of all faults individually. User can choose the fault type and faulted bus or line number. Total simulation time, fault starting time and fault duration can be modified anytime with using this user friendly GUI. This GUI lets users change the faulted bus or line and at the same time observe the changes in the system operation under faulty conditions. This interface is developed under MATLAB 7. This paper will report the structure of this current development.

The scope of this paper is to provide a broad survey of methods and applications, already put in practice or just discussed in the scientific literature, whose objective is a more measurement- and intelligence-based operation of power systems, compared to what has traditionally been the case. Application-wise, the paper focuses on real-time security assessment and situation awareness in power system operation. Method-wise, tools and practices taken from the areas of system identification, computational intelligence and signal processing are put into perspective in relation to the specific power system problems which could address or are already addressing.

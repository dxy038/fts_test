Abstract
Background and Objectives
Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV infection has been shown to significantly reduce the transmission of HIV in occupational exposures. Medical students are one of the high risk groups for exposure to patients’ discharge. The objective of the study was to assess the level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices of nursing and midwifery students. 

Materials and Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 129 last year nursing and midwifery students consented to participate entered the study by the census sampling method. The questionnaire-collected data were analyzed with SPSS 16.  

Results
The results showed 45.7% of students having a good level of awareness, 82.2% a positive attitude, and 73.6% the negative practice on PEP.

Conclusions  
This study showed students’ awareness about and practices on PEP were low and negative. Their positive attitude about PEP would not change their practice and  they are still exposed to  high risk discharge; therefore, a certain policy should be formulated to improve students’ practices on PEP. Moreover, the authorities should consider some strategies to improve skills, allocate adequate resourses,  and exert supervision on student practices.

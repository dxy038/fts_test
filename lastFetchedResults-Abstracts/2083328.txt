of Pakistan. Secondary data pertaining from 1980 to 2012 were collected from Economic
surveys of Pakistan, ministry of finance, Federal Bureau of Statistics and planning
commission of Pakistan. Growth Elasticity of Poverty tool was used to estimate the impact.
Head Count Index/Ratio declines and Povcal Net were used to measure poverty and degree
of absolute poverty respectively. The results revealed that the GDP growth elasticity in
terms of poverty was to the current poverty level in Pakistan. Again, rising unemployment
lacks of opportunities for the highly less elastic i.e. a major change in GDP growth rate puts
minor change in poverty. Policy failure of the government, poverty eradication policy,
Global recession found the main factors contributing underprivileged class have created an
alarming situation in the country.

This paper reports progressive work in implementing a power and energy management policy for an Electric Vehicle (EV) sourced by batteries and ultracapacitors. The sequential decision process of determining the power split ratio and reference energy levels of the dual sources has been concisely represented as a state transition mechanism. Experimental results from our test vehicle were used to validate simulation models of tractive power demands and battery behaviour. The overall approach is design oriented, with the objective of contributing towards completeness of the EV power and energy management problem description.

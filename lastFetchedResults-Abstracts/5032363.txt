Discusses the use of genetic algorithms for feature selection for handwriting recognition. Its novelty lies in the use of multi-objective genetic algorithms where sensitivity analysis and neural networks are employed to allow the use of a representative database to evaluate fitness and the use of a validation database to identify the subsets of selected features that provide a good generalization. Comprehensive experiments on the NIST database confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

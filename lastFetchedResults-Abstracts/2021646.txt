Background and Objective:Epilepsy is a long-lasting central nervous system disorder that is accompany with spontaneous seizures and insufficiency in learning and memory. Now drug treatment is the most common therapy but some patients do not research to suitable control of their seizures with current drugs. Hence, new treatment is needed to help those patients that are unaffected to existing drugs. In present study, we evaluate the protective effect of pretreatment with salvianolic acid B in experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy in male rats.
Materials & Methods:In the present study, the effect of intraperitoneal administration of salvianolic acid B (10mg/kg) on induced seizures and learning and memory impairment induced by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid(KA, 4?g) were assessed in rats.
Results:Obtained data showed that the epileptic rats display kainic acid-induced seizures. On the other hand, in epileptic rats, spontaneous alternation score inYmaze tasks lowered (p < 0.001) and retention and recall capability in the passive avoidance test impaired (p < 0.05). Treatment of kainate rats with salvianolic acid B decreased the scale of induced seizures (p < 0.01), improved alternation score (p < 0.005) and retention and recall capability (p < 0.01).
Conclusion:Taken together, this study reveals that treatment of kainate rats with salvianolic acid B could attenuates kainic acid-induced seizures and impairment of short-term spatial memory in rats.

The modern poultry industry is not convinced with the traditional system of handling and processing of eggs, based upon candling and visual inspection of the eggs. Therefore, followed as an objective of this study is to test the feasibility of UV-IR transmission spectroscopy for the non-destructive assessment of the freshness of an individual egg, as an alternative to traditional inspection methods. To detect a considerable variation in freshness, groups consisting of 10 eggs were stored (30±7oC and 25% ±4 RH) for 30 days. Data obtained from non-destructive spectral recordings were compared with those obtained from three destructive freshness parameters namely: Haugh Units (HU), albumen and yolk pH and as well from Yolk Coefficient (YC). Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Principal Component Regression (PCR) models were built to predict HU, pH and YC as based upon the transmission spectra. The correlation coefficients between the predicted values and the measured value are 0.88, 0.86 and 0.78 for HU, YC and pH of the albumen, respectively in the PLSR, whereas 0.64, 0.62 and 0.41 for HU, YC and pH of the albumen, respectively, in the PCR. These results reveal that the light transmission spectrum of an egg provides more dependable quantitative information regarding egg freshness as based upon PLSR method. Dependable information, concerning egg freshness, was found to be restricted to the wavelength interval between 510 and 820 nm.

Sample preparation for phenol analysis using solid-phase extraction (SPE) is reviewed. The scope of the review has been restricted to the literature dealing with the analysis of phenols as the main objective. The use, advantages and disadvantages of silica sorbents, polymeric, functionalised, carbon-based and mixed available sorbents, when applied to the separation and preconcentration of phenols, as well as the available experimental devices, are discussed. Other aspects such as phenol derivatisation prior to SPE, solid-phase microextraction, matrix effects and the storage of phenols in SPE cartridges, have been also discussed.

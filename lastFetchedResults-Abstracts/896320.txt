Objective (s): The purpose of this cross sectional study was to assess quality of life in nurses working in Zanjan, Iran.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in university hospitals in Zanjan. 241 nurses of eight teaching hospitals were selected through cluster sampling with probability proportional to size in 2011. The participants were asked to fill in a demographic and professional data sheet, and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).
Results: There was significant correlation between age, marital statuse, sex, disability and QOL; and 3 work related factors: type of overtime hours, experience, job interest. QOL in the nurses was less optimal in comparison with the general population norms.
Conclusion: The results suggest that nursing job plays a significant role in QOL of the nurses. Accordingly, interventional programs designed to target relieving occupational stress, adjusting behavioral habits and increasing coping resources may be useful to improve QOL among medical professionals.

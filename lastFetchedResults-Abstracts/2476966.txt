This paper describes the development of a method to optimally tune constrained MPC algorithms with model uncertainty. The proposed method is formulated by using the worst-case control scenario, which is characterized by the Morari resiliency index and the condition number, and a given nonlinear multi-objective performance criterion. The resulting constrained mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem is solved on the basis of a modified version of the particle swarm optimization technique, because of its effectiveness in dealing with this kind of problem. The performance of this PSO-based tuning method is evaluated through its application to the well-known Shell heavy oil fractionator process.

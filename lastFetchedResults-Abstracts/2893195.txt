We transferred an insulator inspection robot from Korea Electric Power Corporation. The robot can inspect suspension insulator strings and tension insulator strings. And it can be operated at the highest voltage level of 345kV live-line. It can measure the resistance and the distribution voltage of the insulator, then judge the status of the insulator according to the detection result. We made some improvements on the basis of the Korean insulator inspection robot. We add the electric field measurement, visible inspection, hydrophobicity inspection functions to the robot. So it can be more comprehensive and objective to judge the insulator status. We improve the robot electromagnetic shielding and control system so that it can inspect insulators on highest voltage level of 1000kV. In order to verify the performance of the robot, we carried out a lot of experimental research.

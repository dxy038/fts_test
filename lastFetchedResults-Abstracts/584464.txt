Crop models need more evaluation and study for use in deficit irrigation. The main objective of
this paper was to study the efficiency and accuracy of DSSAT model, in estimating of moisture in
the soil profile under two levels of water application in silage maize field. Two irrigation treatments
including deficit irrigation (0.7 SMD), and a full irrigation (SMD) were considered for two years.
Soil moisture was measured daily in different layers of the soil profile. After the model was
calibrated, the results of the model were compared in soil profile with measured values in the field.
The results indicated that RMSE of model in estimating soil moisture for different treatments,
depending on depth, is between 1.8 and 13.6 percent volumetric moisture. Systematic error of
model in estimating total water in the soil profile was between 1.985 and 5.7. On the other hand, the
greatest error in estimating moisture has always happened in the first layer of the soil profile.
Overall, considering the nature of water movement in the soil, the DSSAT model could be
recommended to be used in deficit irrigation conditions.

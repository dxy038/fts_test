Objective-To preliminarily investigate the clinical value of computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) parameters. Methods 513 male infertile semen samples and 40 male fertile semen samples were analyzed by means of CASA. Results Among the 513 infertile semen samples, 197 were normozoospermia (38.4%), 180 were asthenozoospermia (35.1%), 75 were oligospermia (14.6%) and 61 were azoospermia (11.9%). Compared with fertile control group, VCL, VSL, VAP and BCF in asthenozoospermia group and oligospermia group were significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05), while ALH, MAD, LIN, STR and WOB had no significant difference (P&gt;0.05). VCL, VSL, VAP, ALH, MAD, LIN, STR, WOB and BCF in normozoospermia group had no significant difference compared with fertile control group. Progressive motility rate was successively reduced in fertile control group, normozoospermia group, asthenozoospermia group, aligospermia group and azoospermia group. And it was the only parameter that showed significant difference in all groups (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions progressive motility rate may serve as a key parameter in human semen analysis. It can provide a valuable reference for the diagnosis of male infertility and the evaluation of assisted reproductive technology.

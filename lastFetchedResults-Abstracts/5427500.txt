This paper discusses the optimal design of a pot core rotating transformer to replace wires and slip rings in mechatronic systems by means of contactless energy transfer. Analytic models of the transformer are derived in the electromagnetic and thermal discipline. The models are compared with both 2D/3D FEM simulations and measurements. The analytical models are combined and used in a multi-objective sequential quadratic programming algorithm to find the minimal Pareto front in terms of volume and power loss for comparison of the adjacent and coaxial winding topologies. Finally, the optimization algorithm is used for the design of two prototype rotating transformers for a power transfer of 1kW peak, rotating at 4000 rpm. The prototypes are manufactured and tested in an experimental setup.

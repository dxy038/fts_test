The main objective of this article is to compare the performance of transformers with respect to different core designs based on T-joint configurations of 23<sup>o</sup>, 45<sup>o</sup>, 60<sup>o</sup>, and 90<sup>o</sup>. The quantitative analysis of localized flux distribution and loss calculation is determined through the significant progress of numerical field calculations using the finite element method. The transformer core has been designed and simulated using QuickField software. From the results, it was found that the best core design is a 60<sup>o</sup> T-joint configuration in terms of the no-load losses and flux distribution.

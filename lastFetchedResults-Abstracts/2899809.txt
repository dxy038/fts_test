Main objective of this work is focused primarily on representation and analysis of the new method of filter function approximation by direct implementation of Christoffel-Darboux formula for Gegenbauer orthogonal polynomials. This paper analyzed parameters of new Gegenbauer continuous low pass filters that shows possibility of implementation filters in wireless communication systems.

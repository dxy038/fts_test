In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) framework for concealment of corrupted motion vectors in predictive video coding of packet video systems. The problem of estimating the lost motion vectors is modelled as a kernel construction problem in a Bayesian framework. First, to describe the similarity between the neighboring motion vectors, a kernel function is defined. Then the parameters of the kernel function is estimated as the coefficients of a linear Bayesian estimator. The experimental results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the conventional and state of the art motion vector concealment methods. Moreover, noticeable improvements on both objective and subjective measures, on videos with heavy packet loss rates have been achieved.

Scheduling algorithms have been developed and proposed to improve system performance by taking the benefit of channel variance among users. When the optimization of the system throughput is the main objective for scheduler algorithm designs, the associated algorithms might cause unfairness in user transmission rates. To explore the fairness problem, in this paper, we will focus on the fairness performance by considering different scheduling algorithms in various fading channels. The dynamic target with max/min (DTM) rate controlled scheduler algorithm is proposed to resolve the potential fairness problems and to maintain the minimum transmission rate for all uses in which we believe that most applications require the minimum rate to maintain the application quality. The DTM algorithm includes also the maximum rate control to prevent the resource hogging from users at the good RF conditions.

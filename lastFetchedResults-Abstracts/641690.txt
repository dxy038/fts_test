OBJECTIVE: We compared the metabolic and clinical effects of two lipid emulsions, long-chain triacylglycerols (LCT) and a mixture of medium- and long-chain triacylglycerols (MCT/LCT), in septic patients.

METHODS: Both groups received total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with a solution enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Seventy-two septic patients received TPN with MCT/LCT (group 1) or LCT (group 2). Before starting TPN (basal) and 10 d after (final), various parameters were evaluated.

RESULTS: Twenty-six subjects in each group completed the study. Both groups showed an increase in cholestasis enzymes, with no significant changes in lipid parameters. The rise of retinol-binding protein and the recovery of nitrogen balance were significantly greater in group 1. A multivariate analysis of nutritional markers and catabolic parameters showed a better evolution in group 1 (P = 0.002). The MCT/LCT group exhibited a significant increase of insulin levels. Overall mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit were not affected by the lipid emulsion.

CONCLUSIONS: In septic patients who received TPN with a solution enriched with BCAAs, the use of an emulsion containing MCT provided them with a greater recovery of their nutrition status than the traditional LCT formula, without influencing the outcome.

Local Area Networks (LANs) are a recent technology and are used for the high speed interconnection and networking of computers and terminals in a local environment. As LANs evolved, the need to maintain, troubleshoot, and characterize their performance also evolved. Test tools, measurement techniques, and simulators became necessary entities to achieve this objective. Focusing on this new technology and its application to measurements is extremely interesting and relevant because LAN test tools represent a state-of-the-art method to debug, troubleshoot, and evaluate local area networks and their performance.

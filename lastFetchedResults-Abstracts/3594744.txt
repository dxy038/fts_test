In this paper, a new bridgeless single-phase AC-DC converter with an automatic power factor correction (PFC) is proposed. The proposed rectifier is based on the single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) topology and it utilizes a bidirectional switch and two fast diodes. The absence of an input diode bridge and the presence of only one diode in the flowing-current path during each switching cycle result in less conduction loss and improved thermal management compared to existing PFC rectifiers. Other advantages include simple control circuitry, reduced switch voltage stress, and low electromagnetic-interference noise. Performance comparison between the proposed and the conventional SEPIC PFC rectifier is performed. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technique.

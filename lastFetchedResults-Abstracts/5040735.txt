This study aims at better understanding how information technology (IT) governance supports organizations in their business exchanges with other organizations. Its main objective is to define the various modes of IT governance contributing to successful interorganizational relationships. Borrowing from the network governance area, three major constructs - structure, processes, and participants - are considered to study these modes. The maturity state of the interorganizational relationships is also taken into account to better explain the level of success of each observed relation. Through pilot cases, we want to provide both practitioners and academics with an enriched understanding of the challenges related to the governance of IT during interorganizational relationships.

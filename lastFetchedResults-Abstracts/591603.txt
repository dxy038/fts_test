This study presents an energy-based approach to the performance-based optimization of steel
moment resisting frames at the so-called operational, immediate occupancy, life safety and collapse
prevention performance levels. Two objective criteria are identified for a performance-based seismic
design: minimizing structural cost (interpreted as weight) is one; the other concerns minimizing
earthquake damage with respect to the maximum hysteretic energy capacity of the structure. That is,
the overall objective for the design of a building framework is to have minimum weight and maximum
energy dissipation capacity.

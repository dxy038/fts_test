Changes in the international arena and the increasing role of non-state actors and public opinion have led to the emergence of the new forms of diplomacy distinguished from but related to the traditional diplomacy. Conceptualization of Public Diplomacy has been associated with many ambiguities and confusion both in academia and policy circles in Iran. Concept of Public Diplomacy has been used interchangeably with concepts like soft power, public relations, propaganda, cultural relations and psychological warfare. Though related, these are different concepts that refer to different phenomena. Public Diplomacy, its significance, instruments, goals, audiences, players, communication patterns, evaluation criterions, as well as conditions and prerequisites of its success will be addressed in this paper. Misperceptions and the accompanied conceptual confusion have been instrumental in generating an unnecessary fear among decision makers about anything "soft" or "public" in diplomacy. Clarification of these concepts may facilitate a better understanding and it is hoped, would remove significant impediments for a more objective evaluation of them.

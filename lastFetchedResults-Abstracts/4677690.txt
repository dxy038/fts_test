In this paper an economic criterion based optimal load shedding algorithm has been developed. The objective is to minimize the sum of curtailed load and also the total system interruption cost within the frame-work of system operational and security constraints. The load shedding problem is formulated as a non-linear optimization model that is optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA). A test system designated as the RBTS [30, 31] is used to test the technique. The system includes two generator busbars with eleven generating units, nine transmission lines and five load busbars where six distribution systems are connected.

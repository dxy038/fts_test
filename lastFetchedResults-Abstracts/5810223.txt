This paper presents the design and implementation of a two-axis stand alone rotary sun tracker. The objective is to analyze the effects of introducing both physical sun-tracking and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) on PV systems´ efficiency in the gulf region. A two-axis rotation mechanism is implemented to track the sun over both the azimuth and elevation angles. The position of the sun is determined using the astronomical method. The sun´s azimuth and elevation angles are continuously updated throughout the day using a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The calculated angles are then used as set-points for two closed-loop control systems with PI controllers implemented in the DSP. The panel power is passed through a charger that implements perturb and observe MPPT algorithm to keep the system power operating point at its maximum value.

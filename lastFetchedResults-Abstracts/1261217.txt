Objectives Augmentation of vocal fold with hyaluronic acid (Restylane; Q-Med AB, Uppsala, Sweden) is used as a therapeutic option for insufficient glottic closure in unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVP). Analysis of the optimal glottic width, effectiveness (long-term voice improvement as a consequence of longevity of Restylane), and safety of this new method was made. Study Design/Methods In a prospective clinical cohort study, 19 consecutive patients with UVP who received vocal fold augmentation with hyaluronic acid (Restylane) were examined preoperatively; 6 weeks, 6, and 12 months postoperatively by laryngostroboscopy; and their voice was evaluated by subjective, objective, and self-assessment (Voice Handicap Index). Results In 11 of 19 (58%) patients, a subjectively and objectively acceptable voice quality was observed in a follow-up of 12 months. Eight of 19 (42%) patients had a considerable impairment of the voice after 6 weeks (range: 1â€“24 weeks). Therefore, another intervention (eg, injection laryngoplasty or thyroplasty) was recommended. An impairment of voice was mainly observed if the preoperative glottal gap during phonation was more than 1آ mm. Conclusion A long duration (up to 12 months) of acceptable quality of voice was achieved by augmentation with Restylane, if the glottal gap was 1آ mm or less videolaryngostroboscopically during phonation. The authors recommend this therapy for temporary voice improvement and to augment vocal therapy, if spontaneous recovery of voice is likely. Long-term results remain to be seen.

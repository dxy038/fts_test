In this research, a single batch processing machine scheduling problem with
minimization of total earliness and tardiness as the objective function is
investigated.We first formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear
programming model. Since the research problem is shown to be NP-hard, an
improved memetic algorithmis proposed to efficiently solve the problem. To
further enhance the memetic algorithm and avoid premature convergence, we
hybridize it with a variable neighborhood search procedureas its local search
engine. A dynamic programming approach is also proposed to find optimal
schedule for a given set of batches. Wedesign a Taguchi experiment to
evaluate the effects of different parameters on the performance of the
proposed algorithm. The results of an extensive computational study
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

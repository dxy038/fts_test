The paper focuses on the applicability of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) techniques for solving three &#8220;real-world&#8221; logistical and production problems. The partly intelligent agents (PIAs) we use are equipped with simple algorithms supplemented by knowledge-based components. By comparison with centralized methods we can judge the benefits of our new DAI-approaches. Since we are working on the solution of real-world problems, the paper is not concerned with ivory tower issues emerging in parts of DAI research. It is a central objective of the work to present in detail how to make &#8220;practicable&#8221; agent systems and thereby reduce the gap between theory and practice

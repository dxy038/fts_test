The main objective of the approach outlined in the paper is the development of a real-time knowledge-based system which uses process and control knowledge in the form of rules in conjunction with conventional algorithmic control for the enhanced supervision of fermentation processes. The system has been developed using the G2 Real-Time Expert System toolkit (Gensym Corp.) and runs on a SUN 3/60 workstation which is linked to pilot scale fermenters via an Ethernet connection to a IBM PS/2. The PS/2 carries out local monitoring and control of the fermentation process through an RS232 serial connection to a number of industrial signal processors which are in turn directly linked to the process

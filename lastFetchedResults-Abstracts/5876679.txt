This paper presents an experimental model and a mathematical model with the introduction of a ramp in the channel of the Obenaus model. The objective is to present a better reproduction of the real layer pollution deposited on the HV insulators. This reproduction was obtained from two types of thickness variation: the introduction of a ramp (soft variation) and the introduction of a step (sudden variation)

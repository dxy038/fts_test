
Objective: The present study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of ‘Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy’ (ACT) on reducing social anxiety in students with learning disability.
Method: In this experimental research, pretest-posttest and control group were utilized.
Population of this study included all the middle-school male students with learning disability
in Koohdasht City (2013-2014). The sample included 40 male students with learning disability
who were randomly selected after structured clinical interview. Subjects were randomly
put into experimental group and control group (20 individuals each). Instruments of this
research included structured clinical interview, Raven IQ Test (1962), and Watson & Friend’s
Anxiety Scale (1969). Pretest and posttest were administered for both groups. Experimental
group received acceptance and commitment therapy model for 10 1-hour sessions, while the
control group received no intervention. To analyze the data, Multivariate Analysis of Variance
test (MANOVA) was used. Statistical Package for Social Science 16 (SPSS 16) program was
used for statistical analysis.
Results: the results of MANOVA showed that acceptance and commitment therapy model
training has been effective on decreasing social anxiety in students with learning disability (P <
0.001). The findings also showed that there is a significant difference in social anxiety between
control group and experimental group.
Conclusion: According to the findings of this study, acceptance and commitment therapy
model training reduces social anxiety in students with learning disability and it is possible to
make use of this model as a suitable intervention method.

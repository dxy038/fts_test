Introduction: In Different Studies, diabetes is one of the most important Causes of reactivation of latent tuberculosis.

Objective: Determine the prevalence of tuberculosis infection in diabetic patients in Qazvin. Materials and Methods: This study was performed as per census in the clinic of diabetes of Boo Ali educational hospital from Mar 2004 to Feb2006. PPD test was asseced all patients and if the irresult was Negative, allergy skin test was used with diluted Tetanous-Diphteria Toxoid antigen, for evaluation of CMI (cell-Mediated Immunity). If the result was positive and there was no clinical and radiographic abnormality, patients were reffered for chemoprophylaxis. In patients with clinical or radiographic signs of tuberculosis was performed sputom smear and active cases, and then were reffered for treatment.

Results: PPD test was performed for 571 diabetic patients. The Results was: 415(72.2%) 0 to 5mm, 88 (15/5%) 5-10mm, 47(83%) 10-15mm and 43 (4%) >15mm .Alergy rate calculated as 27, 6 %. Four smear positive polmunary tuberculosis cases were detected (active case finding). In all detected cases were seen abnormal findings in apical regions and in 3 out of 4 cases cavitary were seen in radiologyic report.

Conclusion: In this study 12.3 % of patients had more than 10mm induration in PPD skin test. Rate of alergy was comparable in diabetic patients to general population. Detection of 4 active cases of smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis implicates the high prevalence of tuberculosis in diabetic patients in comparison with general papulation.

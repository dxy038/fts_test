In the last ten years we have been witnesses to import of numerous premixes produced by various producers and of different quality in regard to concentration of ingredients which are their main components. There is relatively few data on the effects of their nutritive value in pigs, so this research was carried out with objective to verify the effects of several different imported premixes and those produced according to domestic concept, in nutrition of sows, suckling piglets and weaned piglets. Research was performed on private farm in the vicinity of Sabac in Serbia. Obtained results showed that there was no significant difference in losses of body masses and food consumption in sows during lactation period. Nutrition of suckling piglets using mixture which contained adequate premix of domestic production improved the growth rate by 7.6%. Cost of food when domestic premixes were used in nutrition of sows and piglets was by 5.3% lower, and value of realized piglets by approx. 26.0% more favourable when domestic premixes were used in nutrition of sows and suckling piglets. Piglets in rearing were fed mixtures containing imported premixes showed no significantly important effect on gain, but had poorer feed conversion by 6.2% compared to animals fed diets containing domestic premix. Domestic premix in mixtures reduced the cost of mixtures by 3.4% and reduced the cost of gain of piglets in rearing by 9.9% compared to nutrition with diets containing imported premixes. In general, obtained results shoed that use of both types of compared premixes can be recommended, but it is more economically efficient to use domestic premixes in nutrition of sows and piglets

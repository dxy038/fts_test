Proposed paper presents the design and development of a set of games intended for the diagnosis of dyslexia in children at the reading stage. Dyslexia is a problem for reading and writing and high rates of academic failure are associated with it if it is not diagnosed and treated correctly. The system proposed here intends to improve and facilitate the task of diagnosis by implementing traditional tests in a set of games, so that the child loses the notion of being under evaluation. Moreover, this platform provides specialists with specific objective information that enables them to produce a correct diagnosis, as well as allowing them to check the childrenÂ´s progress after undergoing therapy.

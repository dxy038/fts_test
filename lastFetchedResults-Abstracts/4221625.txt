In this paper, we present a minimum spanning tree (MST) based topology control algorithm, called local minimum spanning tree (LMST), for wireless multi-hop networks. In this algorithm, each node builds its local minimum spanning tree independently and only keeps on-tree nodes that are one-hop away as its neighbors in the final topology. We analytically prove several important properties of LMST: (1) the topology derived under LMST preserves the network connectivity; (2) the node degree of any node in the resulting topology is bounded by 6; and (3) the topology can be transformed into one with bidirectional links (without impairing the network connectivity) after removal of all uni-directional links. These results are corroborated in the simulation study.

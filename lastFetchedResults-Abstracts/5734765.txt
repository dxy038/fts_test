This work provides a MATLAB-based framework for image and video quality evaluation that integrates test content generation, subjective testing interfaces, objective quality metric evaluation and correlation analysis into a single application. It also provides an HTML-based help system and a Graphical User Interface that makes applications based on the framework user friendly. The framework supports a configurable interface that makes it easy to integrate existing or new quality metrics and to compare them against each other. The framework abstracts the user from underlying details like file format, report generation and test flow control.

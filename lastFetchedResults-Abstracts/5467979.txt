The objective of this research is to develop a set of enabling technologies for Web-based remote machining in a decentralized environment. Particularly, this paper presents our latest development on 3D model-based and sensor-driven remote machining. Once a product design is given, its process plan and NC codes are generated by using a distributed process planning (DPP) system. The NC codes are then used for remote machining via a standard Web browser. In this paper, the focus is given to the concept and prototype implementation of the technology. A case study of a test part machining on a 5-axis milling machine is also completed for testing and validation. It is expected that the developed technology can also be applied to design verification as well as production in a distributed manufacturing environment.

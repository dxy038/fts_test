In the present study, the analysis of the increase of exchange rate on investment and employment in Iran by using a multiregional computable general equilibrium model is conducted. The results confirm the accordance of price with changes of exchange rate. The increase of exchange rate has been accompanied with the decrease of production and employment in agriculture, industry and mineral sectors and it has been accompanied with the increase of  production and employment in services, oil and gas sectors. Furthermore, total investment in Iran is in accordance with the changes of exchange rate. Therefore, according to the objective of the study, positive shocks to exchange rate generally can increase employment. This change is important since the part of employment is higher in services, oil and gas sectors than agriculture, industry and mineral ones. Moreover, positive shock of exchange rate increases investment according to the export and import structure.

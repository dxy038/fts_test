Objective: The aim of the present clinical longitudinal study was to observe, over 10 years, the prognosis of abutment teeth restored with fixed prostheses retained by two glass ionomer luting cements and one conventional zinc phosphate cement.

Methods: Three dentists prepared 135 abutment teeth in 61 patients to retain 81 fixed prostheses. The prostheses were retained by two glass ionomer luting cements (Ketac-Cem, Fuji Ionomer), or a conventional zinc phosphate cement (De Trey Zinc Zement Improved). The patients were examined yearly for 10 years.

Results: Post-operative hypersensitivity occurred in five teeth restored with glass ionomer luting cement. The prevailing reason for abutment tooth failure was secondary caries (n = 21) and pulp necrosis (n = 5). Non-parametric survival estimates indicated that 80–85% of the abutment teeth remained intact after 5 years and 71–81% after 10 years.

Conclusions: The 10-year results indicate that the prognosis of abutment teeth restored with fixed prostheses is good, regardless of whether a glass ionomer or a zinc phosphate luting cement is used.

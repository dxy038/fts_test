Objective:The present study was aimed to determine the effect of psychological immunization on 
pessimistic attribution in Female students with dyslexia. 
Methods:The study was an experimental one, in which 60 Female students with dyslexia were selected 
randomly from Learning Disabilities Centers in Isfahan. Subjects  were  assigned to experimental and 
control groups (15 individuals in each group). All students completed the Children Attributional Style 
Questionnaire before and after training sessions. The experimental group participated in 10 intervention 
sessions (twice a week; 60 minutes per session) and were trained by psychological immunization 
program. Six weeks later, the experimental group answered the questionnaire again. Data were analyzed 
by analysis of covariance. 
Results:The results of the analysis of covariance showed that the intervention program significantly 
decreased the pessimistic attribution style of the experimental group in comparison to the control group 
(p < 0.001). 
Discussion:It seems that the application of a psychological immunization program has influenced 
pessimistic beliefs of Female students with dyslexia and is probably useful as a rehabilitation program for 
modifying the style of attribution (P < 0.001).

Dwelling in cities and city development together with quick increase of population and development of
industrial activities with unplanned consumption of fossil fuel have intensively increased pollutions with
consequences which will cause different diseases in short period, will lead to some climatic oscillations
and its environmental effects such as the change of desirable periods in view of comfort climate in long
period. The objective point of view of this research was to study the climate in Shiraz and its effect on
comfort conditions for human physiology. In this research, using 55 year climatic data (1952-2006), the
relative humidity and temperature through the application Guni comfort climatic model, the desirable
months for the comfort of human physiology have been determined in the five II year periods and the
linear process of these changes have been estimated for the next 11 years. The results of this research
show that the temperature trend in Shiraz station is increasing and most months have heating process in a
way that it is expected that in the coming future, the cold months will have more favoring conditions for
physiological comfort of residents and correspondingly in the warm months, heating tension will have
remarkable increase.

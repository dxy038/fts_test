We propose Kansei retrieval method using the quantitative feature of traditional Japanese crafting object to provide a user with the desired presentation space in digital traditional Japanese crafting system. First, we extract quantitative feature values from the crafting objective by using visual pattern image coding (VPIC). Those values include the total number, the periodicity, the ratio of dispersion and the ratio of variety for edge into the objects. Next, we register the quantitative feature values of traditional Japanese crafting object in the multimedia database. And, we analyzed the relation between Kansei words and the sensitive features of traditional Japanese crafting objects by using the questionnaire. Last, we process the sensitive feature by using the quantitative feature values. The mentioned above, we can realize Kansei retrieval method. We describe the realization for Kansei retrieval method using the quantitative feature of 3D objects.

The objective of this paper is to study metaphorical conceptualizations which are based on two physical postures of STANDING and SITTING, represented in the Holy Quran Language. Following Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), introduced by cognitive linguists, the researchers attempt to find out the abstract concepts which are represented through sitting/standing postures of the human body. In other words, for which abstract domain(s) of the Holy Quran, the source domains of Standing and Sitting have been used. Moreover, how CMT is useful in analyzing the meaning of these concepts. The study of linguistic metaphorical expressions shows that in the conceptualization of religious concepts like Prayer, Jihad, and other recommended affairs, SITTINIG/STANDING metaphors have been used coherently. Weakness in doing religious affairs like Jihad and AVOIDING the recommended religious duties has been conceptualized as SITTING. Performing recommended religious affairs, like Prayer, Jihad and Resistance in the way of God, is motivated through STANDING metaphor. The mappings are based on the experiential correlations between source and target domains, though the culture of the Holy Quran affects the type of target domains.

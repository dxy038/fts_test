The main objective of this study is to analyze the building energy saving effects of different window shading devices in hot summer and cold winter zone. Two typical residential and public buildings were modeled in building energy simulation software DOE-2. The energy saving potential of these two buildings in each direction was calculated. Then the room base temperatures of typical rooms were calculated and used to determine the shading season. Finally 6 kind of shading schemes composed of different shading devices were applied in these two buildings and the heating, cooling and total building energy savings were simulated. The results show that shading devices in west facing have the best energy saving effect, less than which in east and north facing, and least in south facing, and movable shading devices are more effective than fixed ones in the reduction of building energy consumption.

Over the last decade, a large number of e-assessment system and tools were developed. No matter whether they are stand-alone or integrated into learning management systems, they all have two things in common: (1) they do not consider individual aspects and (2) they do not require/encourage students to actively thinking, problem-solving, etc. The work presented in this paper focuses on the second aspect and provides a generic model that enables integrating Interactive Content Objects (ICOs) with established e-assessment systems and specifies the interactions with these objects. ICOs is the generic term for interactive tools, which do not restrict students to be passive recipients, but also engage them with material that is responsive to their actions. This results in more objective assessment findings and deeper learning, because students can learn from mistakes and make sense from unexpected situations.

Noninvasive quantification of regional arterial stiffness, such as measurement of the pulse wave velocity (PWV), has been shown to be of high clinical importance. Pulse wave imaging (PWI) has been previously developed by our group to visualize the propagation of the pulse wave along the aorta and to estimate the regional PWV. The objective of this paper is to determine the feasibility of PWI in the human carotid artery in vivo. The left common carotid arteries of eight (n = 8) healthy volunteers (male, age 27 + 4 years old) were scanned in a long-axis view, with a 10-MHz linear-array transducer. The beam density of the scan was reduced to 16 beams within an imaging width of 38 mm. The frame rate of ultrasound imaging was therefore increased to 1127 Hz at an image depth of 25 mm. The RF ultrasound signals were then acquired at a sampling rate of 40 MHz and used to estimate the velocity of the arterial wall using a 1-D cross-correlation-based speckle tracking method. The sequence of the wall velocity images at different times depicts the propagation of the pulse wave in the carotid artery from the proximal to distal sides. The regional PWV was estimated from the spatiotemporal variation of the wall velocities and ranged from 4.0 to 5.2 m/s in eight (n = 8) normal subjects, in agreement with findings reported in the literature. PWI was thus proven feasible in the human carotid artery, and may be proven useful for detecting vascular disease through mapping the pulse wave and estimating the regional PWV in the carotid artery.

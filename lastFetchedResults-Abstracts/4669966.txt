Automotive steering mechanism is designed applying a theoretical method of robust optimization. A math modal on steering mechanism with clearances based on robust optimization is established. The movement precision in fourteen positions of steering mechanism during steering course is chosen as objective function. Distance between kingpins, axle-base, the bottom angle of trapezoid mechanism and the length of steering arm are chosen as design variable. And clearances in motion joints of steering mechanism are chosen as noise factor. Design variable and noise factor are both considered as random variable with normal distribution. Constraints are included in the minimum transmission angle and the maximum turning angle error, etc. Optimum results are shown that the movement precision of steering mechanism is assured even if clearances are existed in motion joints or clearance size is varied.

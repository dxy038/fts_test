Scan chain insertion can have a large impact on routability, wirelength and timing of the design. We present a routing-driven methodology for scan chain ordering with minimum wirelength objective. A routing-based approach to scan chain ordering, while potentially more accurate, can result in TSP (traveling salesman problem) instances which are asymmetric and highly non-metric; this may require a careful choice of solvers. We evaluate our new methodology on recent industry place-and-route blocks with 1200 to 5000 scan cells. We show substantial wirelength reductions for the routing-based flow, versus the traditional placement-based flow: in a number of our test cases, over 86% of scan routing overhead is saved. Even though our experiments are thus far timing-oblivious, the routing-based flow does also improve evaluated timing, and practical timing-driven extensions appear feasible.

Teleoperating system has been developed for several decades, and many control schemes for it have been suggested. But the implementation for real applications needs a very effective but simple controller. In this paper, an advanced control scheme to achieve this objective is suggested, which is the combination of a modified internal model controller and a variable filter for force reflection. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through experiment. Both responses of unconstrained and contact motions for the testbed-walls with different stiffness are shown

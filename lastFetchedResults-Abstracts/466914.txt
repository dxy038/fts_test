Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare early oral intake and the traditional timing of feeding after major gynecologic surgery and the effects on the length of hospital stay. Study Design: Gynecologic oncology and urogynecology patients who underwent major abdominal gynecologic surgery were prospectively randomized to 1 of 2 groups. The traditional feeding group (group A, 49 patients) received nothing by mouth until documentation of bowel function. They were then advanced slowly to solid diet. The patients allocated to the early feeding regimen (group B, 47 patients) began clear fluids on the first postoperative day. Once 500 mL of clear fluid was tolerated, they received a regular diet. The groups were compared with regard to length of hospital stay, postoperative day that solids were tolerated, and the incidence of adverse effects. Statistical analyses were performed with the Ï‡2 test, the Fisher exact test, the Student t test, and analysis of variance. Results: The demographic characteristics of the 2 groups were similar. There was a statistically significant reduction in the length of hospital stay for those patients on the early feeding regimen. The median length of stay for group A was 6.0 days and for group B was 4.0 days (P = .0001). There was no difference in the incidence of emesis, ileus, or other postoperative complications between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Early postoperative dietary advancement after major abdominal gynecologic surgery results in a decreased length of hospital stay and appears to be safe, with no increased adverse effects.

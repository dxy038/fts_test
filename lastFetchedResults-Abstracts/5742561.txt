This paper describes the methodologies used for manufacturing control of BiCMOS layer processing in the ASM Epsilon reactor at National Semiconductors 200 mm wafer fab in South Portland Maine. Real time monitoring techniques have been developed to control collector epi slip, SiGe layer thickness, Ge concentration and As concentration. These monitors provide objective and low cost monitoring for epi manufacturing processes.

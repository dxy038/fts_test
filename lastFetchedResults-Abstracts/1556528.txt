Bilevel programming has been proposed for dealing with decision processes involving two decision makers with a hierarchical structure. They are characterised by the existence of two optimisation problems in which the constraint region of the upper level problem is implicitly determined by the lower level optimisation problem. In this paper we focus on the class of bilevel problems in which the upper level objective function is linear multiplicative, the lower level one is linear and the common constraint region is a bounded polyhedron. After replacing the lower level problem by its Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, the existence of an extreme point which solves the problem is proved by using a penalty function approach. Besides, an algorithm based on the successive introduction of valid cutting planes is developed obtaining a global optimal solution. Finally, we generalise the problem by including upper level constraints which involve both level variables.

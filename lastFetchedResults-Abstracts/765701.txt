The surface and bulk chemistry of Japanese
cedar (Cryptomeria Japonica), cotton cellulose and
lignin samples carbonized at 500â€“1,000  C was investigated
by elemental analysis, Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) and micro-Raman spectrometry.
The objective was to link the original wood components
to the final carbonized wood microstructures.
The carbonized samples show increasing degrees of
order from cellulose to wood to lignin. The cellulose
component in the wood strongly affects the ordering of
polyaromatic carbons in carbonized wood; this ordering
is attributed primarily to the difference in ratio
between aromatic and aliphatic carbons and to the
amount of cross-linking by ether and carboxylic groups
up to 500  C.

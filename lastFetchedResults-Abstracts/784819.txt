nutritional approach to the deterioration of bone integrity and increased fracture risk
appears to be particularly appropriate in elderly women living in nursing homes. Objective: to investigate the
beneficial effect of the consumption of soft plain cheese on bone resorption markers in institutionalized elderly
women. Design: Prospective, randomized crossover controlled study. Setting: six French nursing homes or other
institutions for elderly. Participants: institutionalized women ≥ 65 years old with low vitamin D status and
calcium intake below 700 mg/day. Intervention: consumption of soft plain cheese made of semi-skimmed milk
which was fortified by both vitamin D3 (+1.25μg/100g) and milk extracted ca, thus achieving a total ca content
of 151 mg/100g as compared to about 118 mg/100g for standard fresh cheese. two servings were taken every
day during the 6 weeks that preceded or followed a period of 6 weeks without soft plain cheese consumption.
Measurements: the primary end point was the change in serum carboxy terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type
i collagen (ctX) selected as a marker of bone resorption. Results: 29 women aged 73-94 yr were selected, 21 of
them with mean age 87.2±6.1 years remained compliant. the intervention increased calcium and protein intakes
by 51% (904±228 vs. 599±122 mg/d) and 33 % (74.2±17.1 vs. 55.6±12.7 g/d, mean±sD), respectively. the
dietary intervention was associated with a statistically significant increase in serum levels of both 25ohD and
iGF-i, while those of Pth, ctX and traP5b were significantly reduced. compliance was 93,4 %. the daily
consumption of two servings of soft plain cheese was well accepted in terms of tastiness and appetite suited
portion size. Conclusion: this randomized crossover controlled trial demonstrates that in elderly women living
in nursing homes, the consumption of soft plain cheese increasing the supply of vitamin D, calcium and proteins,
could reduce bone resorption and thereby reduce the risk of incidental fragility fractures in the long term.

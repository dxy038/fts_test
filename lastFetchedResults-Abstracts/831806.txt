The objective of this paper is to present the application of wavelets in the implementation of the stress model of the hybrid-mixed finite element formulation. Independent wavelet bases are used to approximate the stresses in the domain and the displacements both in the domain and on the boundary of elastostatic finite elements. Except for the kinematic boundary conditions, which are enforced directly, all the remaining equations of elastostatics are enforced in a weighted residual form so designed as to ensure that the discrete model embodies the relevant properties of the continuum fields they represent, namely static-kinematic duality and elastic reciprocity. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the characteristics of the numerical model being presented and to assess its accuracy and efficiency.

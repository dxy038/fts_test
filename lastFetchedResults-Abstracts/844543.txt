In this paper, a class of fuzzy bidirectional associated memory (BAM) neural networks with
time-varying delays are studied. Employing fixed point theorem, matrix theory and
inequality analysis, some sufficient conditions are established for the existence, uniqueness
and global exponential stability of equilibrium point. The sufficient conditions are
easy to verify at pattern recognition and automatic control. Finally, an example is given
to show feasibility and effectiveness of our results.

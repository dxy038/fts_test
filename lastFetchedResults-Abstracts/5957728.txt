This paper deals with the improvement of the voltage quality of the AC/AC choppers delivered to the loads in a way to minimize the harmonics continents and to increase the power factor of the voltage source. Indeed a lot of works were done in this field using several algorithms to fulfill the objective mentioned. In the present work the Swarm Particle Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to achieve the minimization of the harmonic continents of the deliver voltage, to improve the power factor of the voltage source and finally to increase the control range of the outer voltage.

Background
gh the incidence of osteoarticular tuberculosis is increasing, glenohumeral joint tuberculosis is rare and often misdiagnosed in its early stages. Our objective was to study the incidence of the initial misdiagnosis as frozen shoulder and the duration of the prediagnostic period among patients with glenohumeral joint tuberculosis.
s
inical records of 21 patients with tuberculosis of the shoulder joint were retrospectively analyzed.
s
the 16 patients with glenohumeral joint tuberculosis, 14 (87.5%) were initially diagnosed as having frozen shoulder instead of glenohumeral joint tuberculosis at their primary care clinics. Two patients actually showed both shoulder pain and limited range of motion, although they did not have a record of initial diagnosis with frozen shoulder. Consequently, 14 (87.5%) of the patients in our study with glenohumeral joint tuberculosis were likely misdiagnosed as having frozen shoulder. On the other hand, this group accounted for 3.6% (n = 16) of 450 patients who, during the same period, had been initially diagnosed with frozen shoulder at our institution. The mean prediagnostic period to attain the final, correct diagnosis of glenohumeral joint tuberculosis for this group was 14.5 months.
sion
ears that misdiagnosis is common and early diagnosis of tubercular infection in the glenohumeral joint has become increasingly difficult. Glenohumeral joint tuberculosis should be suspected in cases of longstanding pain in the shoulder. It is necessary to re-examine these frozen shoulder patients with repeated plain radiographs followed by further imaging studies, especially magnetic resonance imaging, if conservative therapy fails.

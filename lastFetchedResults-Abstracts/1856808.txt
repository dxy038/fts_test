Background: Capparis spinosa L. belongs to the family Capparidaceae and its dried aerial parts have been used as the flavors, marinades and treatment of rheumatism, liver diseases and gout in traditional medicine.
Objective: This aim of this study was to assess phytochemical and antioxidant properties of Capparis spinosa L. in Khuzestan province.
Methods: This experimental study was carried out in biology laboratory of Lorestan University, 2013. After the plants were collected and were dried in the shade, methanol extracts were prepared by maceration. Antioxidant activities were assessed using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and B-carotene-linoleic acid assays. Flavonoid and phenolic compounds were measured using quercetin and gallic acid as standards. Data were analyzed using Minitab software and Dunnet test.
Findings: In DPPH, the most and the least free radicals scavenging activity were found in stem extract (IC50: 6.86?g/ml) and leaves extract (IC50: 4.83 ?g/ml), respectively. In B-carotene-linoleic acid assays, the most and the least antioxidant activity were related to the leaves (82.57%) and fruit (44.67%), respectively. The highest level of phenols (28.73?g/ml) and flavonoids (5.87?g/ml) were found in the leaves extract.  
Conclusion: With regards to the results and antioxidant activity of Capparis spinosa, it can be used in food and pharmaceutical industries.

The energy storage is a key issue for traction applications like Electric Vehicles (EVs) or Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). Indeed, it needs a higher power and energy density, a right size, a long lifetime and a low cost. A Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) using batteries and supercapacitors seems to be an appropriate device to fulfill these constraints. The objective of the paper is to propose different energy management strategies of HESS using batteries and supercapacitors. Four elaborated control strategies are proposed. Different strategies are compared on different criteria: electric consumption, sizing, and the expected lifetime of the batteries.

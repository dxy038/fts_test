The junctionless device concept for silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs was introduced by Colinge et al. in 2010 [1], demonstrating considerable gains in terms of process simplicity when compared to conventional inversion-mode MOSFETs. The objective of this work is to implement the junctionless device concept in an In<sub>0.53</sub>Ga<sub>0.47</sub>As channel, where the SiO<sub>2</sub> insulator in [1] is replaced by a wide bandgap In<sub>0.52</sub>Al<sub>0.48</sub>As barrier layer. The junctionless device architecture is particularly well suited to III-V channel materials. Firstly, the high doping concentration (N<sub>d</sub>) present in the channel of a junctionless MOSFET is less problematic for In<sub>0.53</sub>Ga<sub>0.47</sub>As than it is for Si. Indeed, the bulk electron mobility in Si is ~100 cm<sup>2</sup>/V.s at N<sub>d</sub> = 1 &#215; 10<sup>19</sup> /cm<sup>3</sup> [2], while that in In<sub>0.53</sub>Ga<sub>0.47</sub>As is ~4,000 cm<sup>2</sup>/V.s at a similar N<sub>d</sub> level [3]. Moreover, the junctionless architecture circumvents the difficulties associated with the implantation [4] or regrowth [5] techniques generally used to form the source/drain (S/D) regions of III-V inversion-mode MOSFETs.

In this paper, a new approach for ad-hoc wireless optical sensor networks is presented. It is based on using simple cameras as receivers for non-addressable, low baud rate sensors. We also propose the use of plenoptic cameras so as to reduce the near-far induced penalty present on this kind of networks. This architecture reduces receiver complexity and simplifies the discovery procedure. This network strategy can be combined with VLC or RF systems so as to be used in conventional-bidirectional networks.

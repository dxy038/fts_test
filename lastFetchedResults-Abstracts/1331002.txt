This paper deals with an experimental study on the tensile properties of hybrid FRP rods. The objective of this study is to identify a suitable material architecture for FRP reinforcing bars for concrete structures. Using carbon and E-glass fibers, three different material architectures were considered for hybrid FRP rods. Using vinylester and unsaturated polyester resins, the hybrid FRP rod samples were pultruded and tested for tension. The effect of hybridization on tensile properties of FRP rods was obtained by comparing the results of tensile test for the hybrid rods with those of the non-hybrid rods. The results of the test program indicated that the ultimate strain of the hybrid rod with dispersed type was increased by up to 33%.

Key issues for smart fields have been discussed in this paper, including the main features, trends, solutions, construction elements and technical differences in China and abroad. Smart fields include three elements: real-time monitoring, modeling, decision-making and implementation. Their main features are real time, integration and continuity. The essence of smart fields is the optimization based on the model system, including 4 levels: single-well optimization, production optimization, reservoir optimization and optimization of the overall assets. And the overall system optimization is the ultimate objective. For smart fields, the smart is a method of constructing smart fields and efficient development is its purpose. Data is the basis and key of smart fields. The essence of smart field decision-making is based on the model. Smart fields can not go without the support of high-tech industry. The difference of smart fields technologies between home and abroad mainly lies in the oil and gas exploration and development mode and management concepts, technical means and research team, the timeliness of decision making, the responsibilities of different professionals and development objects.

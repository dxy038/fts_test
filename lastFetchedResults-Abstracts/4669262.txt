This paper presents a parallel hybrid exact multi-objective approach which combines two metaheuristics - a genetic algorithm (GA) and a memetic algorithm (MA), with an exact method - a branch and bound (B&amp;B) algorithm. Such approach profits from both the exploration power of the GA, the intensification capability of the MA and the ability of the B&amp;B to provide optimal solutions with proof of optimality. To fully exploit the resources of a computational grid, the hybrid method is parallelized according to three well-known parallel models - the island model for the GA, the multi-start model for the MA and the parallel tree exploration model for the B&amp;B. The obtained method has been experimented and validated on a bi-objective flow-shop scheduling problem. The approach allowed to solve exactly for the first time an instance of the problem - 50 jobs on 5 machines. More than 400 processors belonging to 4 administrative domains have contributed to the resolution process during more than 6 days

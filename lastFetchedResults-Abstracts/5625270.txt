A wireless body area network system can be implemented to gather the physiological signals of the objective persons. In the network, some sensor nodes are used to monitor and determine the health status of people, and their signals are transmitted via wireless RF network. In order to maintain good performance of the network, an appropriate communication protocol should be applied. In this paper, we present non-standard wireless communication protocol architecture with star topology based on the NordicÂ´s nRF24L01 chip. Our goal is to find the feasibility of the protocol architecture based on star topology, and provide a solution for our future work on the wireless body area network system.

Most of the organizations especially financial institutions use colored/texture paper for the signature on any text paper for their documentation, but they always keep their original signature record on the white paper. When these signatures are verified electronically, the results are not accurate because of the difference in color intensity. In this paper, a mechanism is proposed that automates the signature verification for the above purpose. The objective of signature verification is to judge whether an input signature of colored paper is a genuine signature or a forgery. The results are also presented, those are compared with the collected signature samples, and the original input signatures carried out. The signature verification of colored paper (SVCP) system can verify the signatures having different background colors, and also convert white paper background through variation of color intensity. The paper highlighted the issues and provides the solutions especially electronic cheque system, having different color background. Cheques play a vital role in todayÂ´s banking but for electronic banking we need digital currency/digital cheque and in this paper we discuss how we recognize conventional cheques as a digital currency.

Due to the large differences in the level of regional economic development and the distribution of primary energy, power supply and demand in the various regions of China can not match validly, trans-regional transactions was adopted to regulate energy resources and, in addition, there is a certain difference between price levels in different regions, trans-regional trade was adopted to promote global economic benefits. with the construction of UHV power grid and the promotion of smart grid, in China ,there is rapid development in trans-regional energy transactions, the scale of trans-regional energy transactions is expanding further . In addition, considering the factors such as the mass access of clean energy, energy saving and emission reduction, the formulation of transactions policy needs to balance economic benefits, social benefits and normative. All various factors above have made the formulation of transactions policy turn to be more complex. It is hard to meet the requirements for the collective operation and the lean management of the inter-regional power trade completely depending on human arrangements. Therefore, it is high important to research aided optimization decision in interregional transactions. In this article, the author submits an energy resources optimization model in large-scale based on aggregate node. In the model, the particular technical and institutional constraints of electric systems and electricity market are considered, and the optimization of economic benefits or comprehensive benefits is the objective of transactions strategy. An example is founded based on actual data for electricity market operation. Optimal strategy in largescale transactions is decided through solving the model ,and the main factors affecting the benefits of transactions are analyzed. The example proves that the model can realize energy resources optimization in large-scale, and the cohere of economic benefits, social benefits and normative.

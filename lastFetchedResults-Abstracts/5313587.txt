In order to provide better field-of-view in elevation and scan the full 3D space, uniform spherical arrays (USA) may be used. This paper presents the analysis of the USA along with an adaptive beamforming algorithm to steer the maximum of the amplitude pattern to the signal-of-interest (SOI) and ideally place s to the signals-not-of-interest (SNOI) in 3D space. The ultimate objective is to evaluate the wireless network performance using USA.

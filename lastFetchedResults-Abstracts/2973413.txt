Within QFT, optimization is understood in the sense of minimization of the cost of feedback subject to satisfaction of some a priori specified stability and performance constraints. In this paper, this notion is made precise in an L<sup>2</sup>/<font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sup>2</sup> setting by use of the Karhunen representation theorem. Optimality here stands in contra distinction to the notion of optimality used in <font face="helvetica"><i>H</i></font><sup>&#8734;</sup> control, and relates to the minimum gain controller for which a solution to the problem is feasible. With this objective, it is shown that the worst case constraint satisfaction problem and the optimization problem are equivalent.

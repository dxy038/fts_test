This study´s objective is to solve discovering knowledge issue from data of brain function image for recognition of Chinese words. The concern is formulated as data mining. In particular, this paper presented an association rules data-mining model based on software architecture. The model is characterized by transparent conversions between heterogeneous data formats using MDI (metadata information), communication models from one to the other sources of data using broadcasting, and united programming interfaces. This model of conducts an access-processing application. The result shows that model is feasible. This study´s conclusions indicate that model could provide a possible thoughtful method of integration on large-scale data mining.

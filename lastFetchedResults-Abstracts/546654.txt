After the 20 shahrivar events in Iran and by the decline of of Pahlavism the political and social forces released from tyranny poured into scene and attempted to reorganize the Iranian Society. In this regard, Iranian Society witnessed the confrontation between nationalist, Political -religious, and Marxist groups. In a situation like this every group was trying to highlight its own discourse and push the OTHHERS into margin. It was in this environment that the Tudeh Party managed to build a powerful base for its discourse. It is the objective of this article to evaluate the image portrayed by pro-Tudeh Party newspapers between 1331-1329 of OTHERS for their readers.
The review of these newspapers shows that Jebheye Melli(national Front) under Mosadeq leadership was the main target for these attacks.
This paper argues that keywords and concepts such as nation, National Government, Law, Progress and development, Democracy, Independent, Security and peace were the most important ones misused and highjack by Tudeh party by which the Party managed to build a positive image of SELF challenging the OTEHRS.

Aims:Renal cell carcinoma is sometimes associated with inferior vena caval tumour thrombus, but occlusion of hepatic veins by the tumour thrombus causing liver dysfunction, the so-called Budd–Chiari syndrome, is relatively uncommon. There are only a few reports in the literature which discuss this condition.Methods:Four cases admitted to our hospital over a 7-year period and eight cases reported in detail in the English and the Japanese literature were included in this study. They are classified into two groups: mild/silent, without liver failure, and severe, with liver failure.Results:Five patients were classified as mild/silent and seven as severe. Clinical manifestations were mild in the former cases and acute in the latter. Surgery was performed in four of the former cases but only in one case of the latter cases.Conclusions:In mild cases, surgical treatment seems to avoid imminent hepatic failure effectively and should be performed as soon as possible. In such cases Budd–Chiari syndrome in itself does not affect the prognosis. In severe cases, however, surgical treatment is very difficult and risky due to the existing hepatic failure.

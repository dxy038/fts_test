Objective:Trunk muscles activity is said to be of the most stabilizing factors of the spine which is affected by lumbar posture and external loads. Some studies suggest the lordotic posture of the spine to favor spine stability and some advocate the kyphotic one.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of external load and lumbar curvature on the trunk muscles activities.
Materials & Methods: Surface EMG activities of selected trunk muscles (RA, IO, EO, ES and LD) were measured in 11 non-LBP young men with the ages of 20-25, under three loads(0, 10 and 20kg) and three lumbar curvatures (Neutral, Hyperlordotic and Hypolordotic). 
Results: The data was analyzed by MANOVA with repeated measure design and Tukeyâ€™s tests. The results indicated that the activity of all selected muscles significantly increased following the increase in external load (p=0.02). Lumbar curvature had a significant effect (p=0.03) on IO and ES muscles activities (p=0.02). The hypothesis about the interaction between external load and lumbar curvature proved to be true for ES. 
Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that the external load magnitude and lumbar posture are both effective on trunk muscles activities and have an interactive behavior in this effect.

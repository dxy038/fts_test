In this paper, a novel approach to impulsive noise detection is proposed for colour image restoration. First, a global adaptive region growing scheme is used to separate uncorrupted clusters of pixels from corrupted clusters. Then, some order statistic vector filters are used to reconstruct the corrupted clusters. Various performance analyses show the detection scheme is more robust for a wide range of impulse noise than some of the state-of-the-art detectors. Thus, the proposed filter outperforms other filters in both objective and subjective image assessments

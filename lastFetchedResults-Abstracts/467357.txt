Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia in subjects who receive continuous norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol combinations versus unopposed ethinyl estradiol. Study design: Nine hundred forty-five postmenopausal women were randomly selected for 12 months of treatment with one of six blinded norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol combinations (milligrams of norethindrone acetate/micrograms of ethinyl estradiol: 0/5, 0.25/5, 1/5, 0/10, 0.5/10, or 1/10) or to open-label 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens/2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate. Endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial proliferation were assessed by biopsy at screening, months 6 and 12. Results: Endometrial hyperplasia developed in 26 subjects: Placebo, 0/5 and 0.25/5 (1 subject each) and 0/10 (23 subjects). Significantly less endometrial proliferation was measured in the 1/5 norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol and other norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol combination groups and in the 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens/2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate group, than in unopposed ethinyl estradiol groups (6 months: P< .004; 12 months: P< .001). Treatment with 1/5 norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol and with other norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol combinations significantly reduced endometrial proliferation compared with 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens/2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (6 and 12 months: P< .02). Conclusion: Norethindrone acetate protects the endometrium from estrogen-induced hyperplasia and changes in proliferative status. In addition, norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol-treated subjects had significantly less endometrial proliferation compared with 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens/2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate-treated subjects.

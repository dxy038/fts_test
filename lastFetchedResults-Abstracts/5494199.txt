In this paper, we present a quantitative study that investigates implementation of a layer-2 switching application on a general purpose processor (GPP). The objective is to better understand the main challenges and tradeoffs in using such processors for packet processing applications. The goal of this study is to identify the architectural guidelines for successful development of an application specific instruction processor (ASIP) for such applications. To asses the performance of switching of packets with various lengths, a LEON2 RISC processor has been chosen as a GPP. The obtained results are compared together based on detailed instruction level profiling of the mentioned application.

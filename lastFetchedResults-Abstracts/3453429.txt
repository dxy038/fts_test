Comprehensive theoretical analysis on the design of a distributed erbium-doped fiber amplifier for long-distance transmission has been carried out, using a highly accurate model. The dispersion of the optical fiber as a function of the numerical aperture and the cutoff wavelength is included. Designs based on a bidirectional pumping scheme are evaluated, taking nonlinearities into account. The optimum value of the numerical aperture will be evaluated for cutoff wavelengths where the propagating pump power is single moded. For distances between each pumping station in the region between 10 and 100 km, the optimum ratio of copropagating and counterpropagating pump power will also be evaluated

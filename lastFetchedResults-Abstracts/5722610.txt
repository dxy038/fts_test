The objective of this paper is to present the design, development, and implementation of a low-cost, compact, and moderately accurate Scalar Network Analyzer (SNA) using two radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) detector-logarithmic (or detector-log) and limiting IF (intermediate frequency) amplifier chips. The AD8309 is one such advanced detector-log and limiting amplifier RFIC chip that is used in this development. The primacy function of a scalar network analyzer is to take the ratio of the incident signal and the transmitted or reflected signal in order to determine the magnitude characteristics of various active and passive microwave devices. Using the detector-log RFIC chip makes it simple because it defects the envelope of the input RF (radio frequency) signal and converts it into a logarithmic dc (direct current) output voltage. This logarithmic transformation makes the ratio calculations much easier because the ratios become the difference of two log type voltages (log A/B=log A-log B). The proposed SNA has an operating frequency of 50 MHz to 520 MHz and has a dynamic range of greater than 50 dB

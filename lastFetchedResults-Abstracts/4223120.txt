The conventional economic dispatch problem of electric power generation mainly concerns minimization of the operating cost. The paper presents a new method to solve the multi-objective power dispatch problem regarding both minimum fuel cost and minimum environmental impact of emission. Both penalty factors are used to consider the emission and transmission loss. A distance index is applied to decide the optimal compromise result. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed method can provide outstanding solutions with reasonable performance.

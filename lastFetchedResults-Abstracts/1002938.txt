Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been broadly applied to analyze high-molecular-weight compound (such as polymer or proteomic research) but seldom used for low-molecular-weight compound analysis. The objective of this study is the development of a simple analytical method for the determination of the concentration of tripeptide glutathione (GSH) by MALDI-TOF MS. Unfortunately, GSH could not be detected directly by MALDI-TOF MS. Our method is based on the derivatization of GSH with 4-bromomethyl-6,7-dimethoxycoumarin (BrDMC) in acetonitrile using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a base catalyst. After simple extraction step, the supernatant is spotted on a target plate, mixed with matrix Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) and then detected by MALDI-TOF MS.

As part of solutions to the technical problem of logistics distribution, vehicle routing problem (VRP) is getting more and more attention in academics and enterprises, it belongs to the NP-hard problem theoretically. VRP with time windows and capacity constraint in stochastic traffic network was studied based on travel time reliability . Firstly, travel time was expressed as a random variable according to previous collected data, and travel time reliability was obtained using the Monte-Carlo method. Then multi-objective optimization model satisfying travel time reliability constrain as well as multi-objective chance-constraints was presented for optimization of distribution routing, and modified genetic algorithm for the model was proposed. At last, numerical results were provided to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed model and algorithm.

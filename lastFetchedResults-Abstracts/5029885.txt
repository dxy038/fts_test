Impairment of upper limb functions such as range of movement, strength, sensation, proprioception and dexterity can lead to severe handicap for people with disabilities and the elderly. The preservation of motor function and joint range of motion plays an important role in maintaining the independence of people with disabilities and powered orthoses for the upper limb have the potential for playing a major part in enabling this independence. A consortium headed by the University of Newcastle upon Tyne with four European partners (University of Abertay Dundee (UK), Scienzia Machinale (Italy), TVI Europe (UK) and the Free University of Berlin (Germany)) and funded by the European Union Technology Initiative for Disabled and Elderly (TIDE) has embarked on a three year project to address the problems outlined above. This project is entitled Motorised Upper Limb Orthotic Systems (MULOS) and will develop modular, lightweight, powered structures for the upper limb, incorporating closed loop force and position feedback control. The main objective of the orthosis is to assist its users in activities of daily living. Secondary objectives are for exercise and continuous passive motion (CPM) modes

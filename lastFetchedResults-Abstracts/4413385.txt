The purpose of this paper is twofold: to depict the patient´s journey in operating block of the hospital and to provide a flexible model that matches the reality. In operating block of Jeanne de Flandres Hospital, a daily meeting is held in order to establish the operations that will occur the next day. Organizing a schedule in these circumstances leads to a loss of time and can often lead to conflictual situations. The overall study objective is therefore to provide an interactive schedule. Hence, we will need to consider parameters such as the type of surgery, patient´s age, and their past history. From model analysis, some operation´s duration will be estimated.

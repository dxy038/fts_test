The objective of this study is to develop an integrated approach to process design for air cargo transportation. This work integrated the methodologies of quality function deployment (QFD), balanced scorecard (BSC), and theory of constraints (TOC) to ensure that the internal process design meets the needs of employees, shareholders, and customers. This integrated approach is constructed by three stages. In the first stage, the strategies, strategic objectives, and key performance indicators (KPIs) of the company are developed through the conceptual framework of BSC. In the second stage, the initiator´ actions are developed through the five logic tools of TOC. Furthermore, in the third stage, through the integration of BSC and TOC with QFD, KPIs and initiator´ actions were transformed into the design requirements and the technical requirements. Finally, the house of quality (HOQ) is built for designing the service process of air cargo transportation based on QFD.

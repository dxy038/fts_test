Objective: The distal-proximal representations of the finger and palm in the first somatosensory cortex (SI) were studied in humans.
Methods: Somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) from 11 subjects were measured, following mechanical stimulation of the skin by using a 122 channel whole head SQUID system. Sensory stimulus comprising of a 10 ms vibration at the frequency of 200 Hz was delivered to 6 successive sites in 3 cm increments, along the distal-proximal direction over the volar surface of the right index finger and palm. Using a single dipole model, the sources of the magnetic fields were estimated and mapped onto magnetic resonance images of each subject. ANOVA was used for statistics.
Results: Source localization was determined on the main peak (M50) of the SEFs. All of the sources were located in the area 3b of SI. Contrary to the well-defined distal-proximal representations in the hand area of simian SI cortex, there was no statistically significant differences between the locations of the dipoles in human SI cortex evoked by stimulation of different sites.
Conclusion: The result, however, should be interpreted with caution, because it cannot be denied that the spatial separation of sources in the distal-proximal somatotopy is beyond the resolving capacity of magnetoencephalography (MEG). In addition, at variance with the discrete distal-proximal gradient in the mechanoreceptor density, there was no statistically significant differences between the signal strengths of the dipoles for stimulation of the different locations.

Background: CA-125 is a glycoprotein and its origin is uncertain during pregnancy. It
arises during the first trimester and return to a non-pregnancy range in late pregnancy.
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare CA-125 level in threatened abortion
and normal pregnancy less than 20 weeks of pregnancy.
Materials and Methods: This was a prospective case study carried out on 50 healthy
pregnant (group 1) and 50 threatened abortion women (group 2). We compared the
levels of CA-125 in these groups and followed them to be informed of the outcome of
pregnancy.
Results: Fifty percent of women were in 20-24 years old group, primigravida and in the
first trimester of pregnancy. The mean level of CA-125 in group 1 was 26.2 ± 3.25
IU/ml and in group 2 was 37.44 ± 2.72 IU/ml. The mean level of CA-125 in finally
aborted patients was 58.17±7.25 IU/ml and in normal pregnant women, who continue to
term, was 26.61±1.76 IU/ml. The CA-125 level in threatened women,whose pregnancy
continued and did not abort, was 30.89 IU/ml. There was statistically significant
difference between mean serum CA-125 levels of two groups (p  <  0.05), while there
was no statistically significant difference between these levels in the patients of both
groups who continued pregnancies (p  >  0.1). In group 2, there was a statistically
significant difference in the level of CA-125 between those who developed abortion and
those whose pregnancy continued but not aborted (p  <  0.05).
Conclusion: Measurement of serum CA-125 may be an inexpensive, easily available,
sensitive and specific predictor of outcome in threatened abortion, which results the loss
of pregnancy.

This article focuses on the application of artificial avolution to the synthesis of analog active filters. The main objective of this research is the achievement of a new class of systems, with advantageous features compared to conventional ones, such as lower power consumption, higher speed and more robustness to noise. The particular problem of designing the amplifier of an AM receiver is examined in this work. Genetic algorithms are employed as our evolutionary tool and two sets of experiments are described. The first set has been carried out using a single objective, the desired frequency response of the circuit. In a second set of experiments, three other objectives have been included in the system. A new multi-objective evaluation methodology was conceived for this second set of experiments. A second approach for evolving active filters, using programmable chips, is also discussed in this paper

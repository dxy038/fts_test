The objective of this research was to screen and isolate fucoidan from Malaysian seaweeds and subsequently determine its antioxidant capacity. A screening test employing a colorimetric method was conducted on five types of Malaysian brown and red seaweeds. It was found that Sargassum binderi contained the highest fucoidan content (6.16 ± 0.08%). Thus, fucoidan was isolated from S. binderi (yield 7.5%, purity 89.63%) for the determination of its antioxidant capacity. The isolated fucoidan was identified using high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infra-red (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The antioxidant assays performed were total phenolic content (TPC), free-radical scavenging activity (DPPH), reducing power, superoxide anion scavenging activity (SOA) and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (OH). The antioxidant capacity of the extracted fucoidan (Fsar) was compared with those of a commercial food-grade fucoidan (Fysk) and of BHA, BHT and ascorbic acid. All the antioxidant assays performed showed either Fsar has significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) or do not differ significantly (p &gt; 0.05) in activities compared to that of Fysk. At the same time, both Fsar and Fysk showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) antioxidant capacity in terms of superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities compared to those of the synthetic antioxidants. This shows that Fsar has the potential to be commercialised as a functional food product or as bioingredients with high antioxidative properties.

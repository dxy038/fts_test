The main objective of the present study is to elaborate the contrasts between
males and females in their use of different strategies of request in English and
Persian and ascertain the degree to which independent variables like gender
and language affect the application of these strategies during informal
communication. Furthermore, it offers comparable corpora which provide a
good basis for cross-linguistic comparison of distribution of this functional
strategy within the context of Persian and English movies. The focus of this
study is on the implementation of different strategies of 'request' by English
and Persian males and females in accordance with Blum-Kulka's framework
of requestive strategies (1989). This research targets at figuring out
differences between English and Persian males and females in relation to the
application of the previously-mentioned strategies. In addition, in order to
gather the most authentic data, four English and four Persian films, dealing
with family and social theme, are analyzed. Concerning gender dyads, both in
Persian and English, some significant differences are detected.

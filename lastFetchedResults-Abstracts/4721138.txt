In this paper, we present a collaborative learning environment mediatized on the Internet. For its design, we take into account all the components intervening in the interaction and collaboration process and we propose an approach guided by ontologies (domain and application). The objective of this work is to allow multiple users (learners, teachers, administrators, managers, etc.) to interact collectively with the environment. In this collaboration model, the learning users are actors of the achievement of a common problem.

This paper deals with the traffic signal control using fuzzy logic controller and multi-object genetic algorithm (MOGA). It is not needed to build the traffic flow model for signal control approach in the intersection using the method based on the fuzzy. Multi-objective genetic algorithms are used to optimize the parameters in the fuzzy logic controller according to different traffic demand. However, this method can effectively solve the problems of stochastic and unknown in this dynamic system. This method has the adaptive signal timing ability, and can make adjustments to signal timing in response to observed changes.

In this work, the computational operation based on Gradient Pattern Analysis - GPA was applied for the first time in MODIS spatial-temporal images over the Amazon region. The study area is located in the Para&#769; State, eastern Brazilian Amazonia. Using MOD09 8-day composite product from 2000 to 2009 was elaborated the EVI2 spatial-temporal series of the study area. For each pixel we performed smooth time-series applying wavelets transform method for noise reduction. The GPA objective was characterizing small symmetry breaking, amplitude and phase disorder due to spatial-temporal fluctuations driven by the deforestation and flooded changes detected by MODIS images. For the characterization of spatial-temporal series the Gradient Pattern Analysis showed a new approach to understand LULC changes in the remote sensing images.

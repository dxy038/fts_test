Two cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a karyotype 46,X,t(X;1)(p11.2;q21) in two female patients aged 9 and 29 years are reported. These observations, and the review of the 17 reported cases with a translocation at band Xp11 confirm that this abnormality delineates a clinico-pathological entity within the classical papillary RCC, characterized by the early age of occurrence and, probably, distinct histological features. Including these two new female cases, the sex ratio in cases with t(X;1) appears similar to that observed in the other papillary RCC.

Introduction & Objective: The usage of nanoparticles is growing in various fields due to their low cost, high efficiency and antimicrobial properties. Therefore, their potential hazards should also be considered and used at concentrations that have not mutagenic or carcinogenic effects. This study aimed to assess the mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of Bismuth nanoparticles with a size of 56nm, and the concentrations of 156.25,78.1, 39.1 ppm .
Materials and Methods: In this study, we utilize the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA100. Firstly, the purity of the strains was confirmed in terms of purity of mutagenic properties. Then the different concentration of Bismuth nanoparticles was separately added to minimal glucose agar medium containing TA100. Subsequently, they were compared against the positive control ( samples containing mutated bacteria and sodium azide ) and negative control ( containing mutated bacteria and distilled water ). In the next phase of this research the rat liver micrsomes was separately added to the minimal glucose agar medium containing the suspected carcinogenic Bismuth nanoparticles , and negative and positive controls and all back colonies were counted.
Results: The number of revertant colonies the treated plates with S9 is decreased and it means mutagenic and carcinogenic effect of Bismuth nanoparticles with S9 is decreased.
Conclusion: The results of the present study shows that the Bismuth nanoparticles at concentrations examined had no mutagenic and carcinogenic effect.

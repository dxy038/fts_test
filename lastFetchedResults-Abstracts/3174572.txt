The paper presents a multi-stage PWM-rectifier control system built up in abc-reference frame. The control algorithm takes into account the peculiarities of converter - machine/mains interactions during an operational cycle of the mining power shovel. The paper concludes by analyzing simulation results that have shown that proposed system ensures both bidirectional energy flow and stabilization of the DC-link voltage under condition that input voltage fluctuates because of weak mains characteristics.

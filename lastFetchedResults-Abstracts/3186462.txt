Smart grids are integrated communications and power system infrastructures to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of power deliveries and its usages. In this paper, Time of Use (TOU) programs in smart grids are studied. In this regard, Real Time Pricing method (RTP) has been developed using multi objective load models. Also, the effects of smart grids on demand curve have been simulated by different scenarios. Elasticity criterion in this method is optimized in two steps, and after that the best elasticity criterion is achieved. Also, IranÂ´s national grid has been selected to analyze the effects of real time pricing in smart grid environments on load curve. Meanwhile, the results have been compared with TOU programs for better presentation of proposed method even by same initial load curve and finally excellent performance of this technique will be shown.

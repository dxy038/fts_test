Applying genetic algorithms to scheduling problems is a powerful technique which has the potential to be used as a multi-objective optimisation tool. Implementations of multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGAs) could provide an innovative and interactive decision making technique for adaptive scheduling in practical manufacturing applications. Justification and implementation of MOGA schemes for scheduling are discussed and compared.

The main objective of this study is to determine agricultural development in Khorasan Razavi townships. For this, we used Numerical Taxonomy with 10 indexes for grade of townships with respect to different agricultural development indexes. The data of this study were obtained from Khorasan Razavi database covering 2003-2007. The results suggested that Chenaran, Fariman and Sabzevar have more priority and Kalat, Neyshabur and Gonabad have the less priority than other studied townships. Finally, various recommendations were offered regarding township potential in agricultural development.

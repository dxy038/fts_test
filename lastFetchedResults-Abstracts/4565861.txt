The objective of this work is the design of simple spectrum analyzer. The microcontroller is the control center of the system, which is achieved DDS, FFT and Frequency Counter by the FPGA chip. And expansion of the AM modulated wave signal source output, expand the output dynamic range and the analysis and shows of spectrum band and so on. Signal output frequency can be up to 5MHz, adjustable amplitude modulation wave, with voltage gain control, to ensure stability of the output signal amplitude. The system is menu-driven function selection mode, better man-machine interface. It reduces the cost and low power consumption. So this technology has broad applications.

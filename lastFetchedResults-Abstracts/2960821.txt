Overhead high voltage lines design has traditionally been subject of controversy because their possible environmental impact. Nevertheless, the benefits derived from the use of electric energy and the need to transport it have finally forced the actual situation. Among the possible risks attached to overhead lines (both high and low voltage), these elements have been often blamed for causing forest fires. The project presented in this paper (IMPACFALTAS) is oriented to investigate the possible relation between forest fires and overhead high voltage lines. In the research completed so far, the effect of medium voltage (MV) lines (up to 33 kV) on the Mediterranean forest species have been studied in detail, being the main objective of the study to help in the diagnosis, prevent their consequences and mitigate the effects of the accidents that are somehow likely to produce this kind of fire

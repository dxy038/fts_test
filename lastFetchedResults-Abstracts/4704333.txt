Some new ways of the reduction of coupling between on-board antennas are considered. It is proposed to use for these objective optimized on geometric and electrophysical parameters a magnetodielectric covering, pin structure and spiral monolayer. It is analyzed physical mechanisms, which is underlying of attenuation characteristics of specified structures.

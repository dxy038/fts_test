
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is associated with alteration in endothelial function mediated through reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and renal injury. Exercise training has been shown to improve endothelial function in animal models of hypertension and in the patients with essential hypertension. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of aerobic exercise against some of proinflammatory cytokines in the renal tissue of rats treated with chronic nitric oxide synthase inhibition. 
METHODS: In this experimental research, 40 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: (1) control (2) sham (3) nitric oxide synthase inhibition (infusion of N?-Nitro-L-Arginine Methyl Ester, intraperitoneally) and (4) aerobic exercise (exercise + nitric oxide synthase inhibition) (n=10 for any group). The exercise consisted of progressive running training on the treadmill for 15 to 22 m/min, 25 to 64 min /day, and 5 days/week for 8 weeks. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) and interlukin-6 (IL-6) levels was measured by ELISA method and the groups were compared.
FINDINGS: Chronic nitric oxide synthase inhibition significantly enhanced renal TNF-? (2.53 ± 0.52 pg/mg) and IL-6 (4.15 ± 0.88 pg/mg) levels (p=0.000). Conversely, aerobic exercise significantly decreased (p=0.045) this proinflammatory cytokines levels (1.97 ± 0.37, 3.46 ± 0.80 pg/mg, respectively) in rat kidney.
CONCLUSION: Regular aerobic exercise with moderate intense may exert protective role against systemic nitric oxide deficiency-induced inflammatory renal injury by down-regulating the proinflammatory cytokines.

As the field of automation is progressing, safer and reliable systems are highly desirable. Any malfunction in the plant result in reduced efficiency of the plant, reduced quality of the product and sometimes may result into fatalities. Therefore fault detection and process monitoring is becoming an integral part of modern control systems. The coupled liquid tank system is an experimental setup with nonlinear dynamics. The objective of this paper is to develop and implement fault detection techniques for coupled liquid tank system. The proposed scheme makes use of observer based residual generation and norm based residual evaluation. First system was linearized by Jacobian linearization and fault diagnosis system has been designed for the linearized system. Then this algorithm has been implemented on real plant and satisfactory results have been obtained.

Objective: Recent studies demonstrate similar survival rates in patients treated with either partial or radical nephrectomy for renal tumors less than 4 cm. We retrospectively compared the hospital based charges for these two procedures in a similar cohort of patients treated at Memorial Sloan-Ketttering Cancer Center. Patients and Methods: A retrospective review of 103 consecutive cases of renal tumors less than 4 cm treated by either radical or partial nephrectomy from 1996 to 1999 was conducted. Overall hospital charges were calculated by analyzing 18 separate departmental charge categories including room and board, pharmacy, radiologic tests, operating room charges, and laboratory services. Results: A total of 66 partial and 37 radical nephrectomies were analyzed. No difference was found in the mean charge per procedure ($16,660, partial and $16,545, radical); (p&gt;.05). The major cost drivers for partial and radical nephrectomy respectively were: 1) room and board, 42% and 44%; 2) operating room charges, 28% and 25%; 3) pathology, 6% and 6%; 4) recovery room, 6% and 7%; and 5) biochemistry, 5% and 5%. Significant increases in charges for partial nephrectomy were noted from the blood bank services and intraoperative surgical supplies. The median length of stay (5 days) was identical for partial and radical nephrectomy. No difference was found in the complication rate for these procedures (p&gt;.05). Conclusion: Hospital-based charges for radical and partial nephrectomy are similar at when performed at a tertiary care referral center.

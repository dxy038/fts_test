and sexual self-schema in body image dissatisfaction. Method: In this study, a correlational design was used and 270 individuals (Male: 135,
Female: 135) with age of 17 to 40, citizens of Tehran, who were selected by the available
random sampling were included. They completed Neo-PI questionnaire, Fisher body image
scale (Fisher, 1970), and Sexual Self-schema Scale (Cyranowski & Andersen, 1998). Results: The results show a meaningful and positive relationship between neuroticism and
body image dissatisfaction; there is also a meaningful and negative relationship between
conscientiousness, openness to experience, extroversion, agreeableness and body image
dissatisfaction. General sexual Self-schema, the personality factors of neuroticism and
agreeableness can predict 26.9 percent of body image dissatisfaction variance. Conclusion: Low scores in positive personality characteristics such as conscientiousness,
openness to experience, extroversion and agreeableness and high scores in the neuroticism
with poor sexual Self-schema make the individuals vulnerable to negative messages about
their body sizes and shapes that finally results in their body image dissatisfaction.

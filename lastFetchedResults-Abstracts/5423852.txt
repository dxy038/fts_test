The objective of the study is to characterise and model the propagation channel of obstructed line-of-sight millimetre wave radio signals in an indoor environment. Experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions obtained from a model based on geometric optics and Fresnel diffraction. Measured and predicted results are given for an experiment undertaken in a bending corridor at 60.4 GHz where the direct component prevailed for a short distance, and was then blocked as the mobile receiver moved into the shadow region

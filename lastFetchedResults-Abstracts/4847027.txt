The use of advanced manufacturing technologies provides a great potential for improving manufacturing performance to compete in the global markets. This paper proposes a decision model based on fuzzy linear regression and fuzzy multiple objective programming for advanced manufacturing technology selection. Fuzzy regression is introduced in the model to assess the vagueness of functional relationships among decision variables and to account for inexact data. A flexible manufacturing system selection problem is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed decision methodology.

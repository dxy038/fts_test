Spasticity is often seen in patients with central nervous system lesion, such as stroke. It hinders functional movement and may induce pain. Current measures for assessing Spasticity are either quantitative but not convenient to use or convenient to use in clinics but lack of objective quantification. We developed a manual spasticity evaluator (MSE) to evaluate the spasticity quantitatively and potentially suitable for a clinical setting. Joint position and torque from 10 subjects with right hemiplegia and 9 healthy subjects were measured conveniently and used to evaluate spasticity and determine the catch angle. EMG signal was obtained from the biceps brachii and triceps brachii to corroborate the mechanical measurement of the MSE. Results showed that the MSE provided a convenient and quantitative measurement of spasticity, including presence of catch angle, increase in joint stiffness, and decrease in joint range of motion in the stroke patients, as compared with healthy subjects. EMG signals corroborated MSE assessment of the catch angle

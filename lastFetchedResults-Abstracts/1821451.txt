Objective
estigate the relationship between salivary stress markers and mental stress states in patients complaining of oral malodour. The utility of the salivary stress markers in assessment of mental conditions of those patients was also investigated.

udy population included 74 patients, aged 20–59 years, who complained of oral malodour and were referred to the Breath Odor Clinic at Tokushima University Hospital. Patients were classified into two groups, genuine halitosis (GH) and psychosomatic halitosis (PH), according to the results of organoleptic rating measurement. All patients were subjected to examination by the Cornell Medical Index (CMI) Health Questionnaire. Resting saliva was collected and levels of salivary IgA, cortisol and chromogranin A were determined by ELISA. Twenty-three volunteers not complaining of halitosis were included as the control group. Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney's U-test were used for statistical analysis.
s
ificant increase was observed in the concentrations of salivary cortisol in the PH group as compared with GH and control groups (p &lt; 0.05). Concentrations of IgA and chromogranin A in saliva were not significantly different among the three groups. In addition, higher salivary cortisol concentrations were found in CMI scale III and IV (tendency towards neurosis) than in scale I and II (normal) (p &lt; 0.05). Since salivary cortisol reflects a status of chronic stress condition, psychosomatic halitosis might be closely related to this state of chronic stress.
sions
ination of cortisol levels in saliva may provide useful information for evaluating the mental status of patients complaining of halitosis.

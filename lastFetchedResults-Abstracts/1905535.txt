Contrary to general image, the disputes between Iran and Britain- Iran Oil Company and Britain itself with regard to the issue of oil did not originated form nationalization of oil and the events followed, but it backs to the days of offering Iran’s oil fields in the market. This paper addresses the financial disputes between Iran and Britain-Iran Oil Company prior to oil nationalization, the parties’ resolutions and its consequences. Our hypothesis is that the failure of Iran’s claims on reforming the structure of the company and adjustment of the framework of 1933 concession with the aim of promotion of Iran’s position provided the objective and subjective context for Iran’s oil nationalization in 1329.

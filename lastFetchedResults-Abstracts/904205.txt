In July 2000 a flood defence embankment protecting abandoned agricultural land in the estuary of the River Torridge, Devon,
UK, was breached as part of a managed realignment (MR) project. The objective was to restore the agricultural land, reclaimed
from saltmarsh some 200 years previously, to its former habitat. Changes to the soil hydrological regime and alteration of the soil
environment at the site were studied. The most significant observed impact at the MR site was the change in flooding regime, with
regular tidal inundation occurring to a maximum depth of 52 cm during spring tides. Prior to the realignment, soil water table
fluctuations were linked to patterns of spring and neap tides. Post-realignment, a change in mean water table height of more than
50 cm was observed at the MR site, and soil redox potential at 5 cm depth was reduced by over 700 mV immediately following
reflooding, changing the soil environment from an oxidised to a reduced environment. Topsoil water (collected from 10 cm depth)
demonstrated large, short-term reductions in pH. Prior to realignment topsoil water pH ranged from 6.6 to 8.7, but following
realignment remained below 5 for approximately nine weeks, reaching a minimum of 3.3. Short-term changes in conductivity and
NH4
+ concentrations in topsoil water also occurred, conductivity rising from !2000 mS to O40,000 mS following realignment,
while NH4-N concentrations rose from 0.10 mg l 1 to 10.05 mg l 1. Cotton tensile strength loss (CTSL) reflected these changes,
exhibiting large decreases in decomposition rates at 5e10 cm depth immediately following the realignment. These results have
implications for the management of MR projects, and for the health and quality of the estuary in general.

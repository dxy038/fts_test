This paper presents a cascoded configuration combining a fuel cell (FC), a battery, and an ultracapacitor module (UCM) to create a hybrid power system. A cascoded configuration is constructed using a modified bidirectional flyback converter, which connects the battery and UCM in cascode to efficiently provide hybrid power. An active FC voltage control strategy is presented to manage the power flows of the proposed cascoded system. In this paper, the simulated hybrid power of the motion of an electric vehicle is illustrated in different situations. The experimental results show that the power flows using the proposed control strategy verify the theoretical analysis. In addition, the overall efficiency of the proposed hybrid power system at overload operation is much higher than the conventional one, and it can achieve 96%.

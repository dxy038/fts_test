BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Medicinal herb of Silybum Marianum usually grows in different parts of Iran. For many years it is experimentally used for treatment of various diseases, such as heal wounds, however, little research has been done on it. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of hydralcoholic extract of Silybum Marianum on cutaneous wound healing. 
METHODS: This study was performed on 36 rats weighting 200-220g that were divided into 6 groups.  All parts of the plant were collected and dried. Hydralcoholic extract of Silybum Marianum was prepared by maceration method. Full thickness wound (2x2) in left flank of the animals was made. The first group was left without treatment, the second was treated with Eucerin, in third group phenytoin cream 1% was used and in the other groups, different concentrations of hydroalcoholic extract of Silybum marianum (20%, 40%, 60% w/w) combined with Eucerin base were administrated 2 times daily. The areas of wounds were measured daily and healing percentage during all the days was compared. For histopathological studies, some biopsies were taken on the 7th and 21st day. 
FINDINGS: In no treatment and Eucerin groups, the healing was completed in 21 days. In Phenytoin %1group, the healing time was 19days and in Silybummarianum groups of 20%, 40% and 60% the complete wound closure was observed in 18, 16 and 14 days respectively. Statistically all the treated groups and the control group had significant difference with negative control and control group (p < 0.05). In histological study the group treated with hydralcoholic extract of Silybum Marianum, symptoms and improvement of skin tissues were more perfect. 
CONCLUSION: Results showed that the extract of Silybum Marianum significantly causes increasing in open wound healing.

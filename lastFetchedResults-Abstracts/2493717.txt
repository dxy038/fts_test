Objective(s): The aim of this study was to determine the important molecules involved in apoptosis induction by opium in Jurkat cell line.
Materials and Methods: Jurkat cells were incubated 48 hrs with2.86×10-5 g/ml concentration of opium and apoptosis as well as expression levels of related molecules weremeasured.
Results: Our results demonstrated that 50.3±0.2 percent of opium treated Jurkat cells were revealed apoptotic features. The levels of mRNA of several pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules were increased and decreased, respectively, in the opium treated cells. The results also demonstrated that expression levels of BCL2, DFFA and NOL3 as anti-apoptotic molecules were increased in the opium treated cells.   
Conclusion: It seems that opium induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Although opium induces apoptosis in the cells but increased expression of some anti-apoptotic molecules may be a normal resistance of the cell for death.

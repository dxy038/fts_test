Pre-partum feeding of 1,3-butanediol to sows has been shown to improve the metabolic status and survival rate of neonatal pigs. To evaluate the efficacy of short-term, pre-partum feeding of 1,3-butanediol on pig and sow productivity on a large scale and low concentration was the focus of the research. The secondary objective was to determine if pre-partum feeding of 1,3-butanediol had any effect on survival rate and weight gain of lesser body weight pigs, sow body weight and subsequent sow reproductive performance. In a large commercial unit, 2537 sows were fed one of two pre-partum diets (0% or 4.55% 1,3-butanediol) on Day 108 ± 3 of pregnancy. 1,3-butanediol provided 8% of the total metabolizable energy. Pigs born live in those litters were equalized by cross-fostering among sows receiving the same pre-partum diet. Pigs were weaned from the sows at 16 ± 3 days post-partum and return of sows to estrus and conception rates were determined. Pre-partum feeding of 1,3-butanediol reduced (P = 0.01) pre-weaning pig mortalities from 1.44 to 1.24 pigs per litter. The reduction in pig mortality was independent of length of 1,3-butanediol feeding (4 to 11 days). In a subset of 750 litters, four lesser birth-weight pigs from each litter were tagged and monitored to determine the effect of 1,3-butanediol on survival rates and pre-weaning weight gain of pigs with the greatest mortality risk. 1,3-butanediol reduced (P = 0.01) pre-weaning mortality of these low birth weight pigs by 5.27%. Based on these data, short-term pre-partum feeding of 1,3-butanediol effectively improves pre-weaning pig productivity at a lower concentration than previously reported.

The difficulties of operating HVDC system into weak AC system can be overcome by using the hybrid inverter. The objective of this paper is to find the best approach to implement the hybrid inverter. Among the various possible approaches, two artificially commutated converters employing the capacitive approach fulfill certain basic performance criteria with minimum cost. Hybrid inverter employing such circuits provides a technically superior and economically competitive alternative for operating HVDC into weak AC systems.

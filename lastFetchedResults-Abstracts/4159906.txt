The objective of the present work is to calculate the profile of the two shock fronts formed by the interaction of two dissimilar isotropic plasma jets. These shocks were found to be approximately hyperboloids of revolution. The plasma flow between the two shocks is considered in the quasi-one-dimensional stream approximation, while in front of the shock a radial expansion model for the jet expansion is assumed. In the region between the two shocks, the plasma flow is transonic, with a plasma velocity varying from zero on the line connecting two point sources to supersonic values at distances several times greater than the plasma sources separation. Calculations were performed for jet velocity ratios of 1.2; 1.5; and 1.8. When the velocity ratio in front of the shock is about 1.2, the plasma density ratio about 1.5, and the distance between two plasma sources about 0.07 m, the distance of the sonic transition point from the source plane is approximately twice the plasma source separation. The thickness of the layer between two shocks is from &#8776;4&#215;10<sup>-3</sup> m near the source plane up to &#8776;4&#215;10<sup>-2</sup> m at 0.2 m from the source plane

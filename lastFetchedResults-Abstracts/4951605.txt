In scalable video coding, inter-layer prediction is used to eliminate the redundancies among layers. Joint Scalable Video Model (JSVM) uses a fixed interpolation scheme to interpolate motion and residual information of the base layer into the enhancement layer. The filter used for luma and chroma information is also the same. In this paper, an adaptive interpolation scheme for inter-layer prediction in scalable video coding is presented. Firstly, the interpolation filter used for luma information is adaptively selected among three filters: bilinear, bicubic, ant 6-tap filter. The selection of interpolation filter is based on the quantization parameter. Secondly, bilinear filter is used for chroma information instead of the 6-tap filter used in JSVM. Experimental results show that, compared with the fixed interpolation scheme used in JSVM, the proposed scheme achieves satisfied results in both subjective and objective quality.

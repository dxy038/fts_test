The objective of this paper is to describe the development of a computationally efficient computer-aided design (CAD) method, which uses a finite element numerical model (FEM) coupled with empirical correlations, to create an optimum heat sink design, subject to multiple constraints. A thermal optimization "challenge" problem, representative of anticipated heat sink requirements in the near future, is solved to demonstrate the proposed methodology. Particular emphasis is placed upon micro-processor central processing unit (CPU) chip cooling applications where, in addition to thermal requirements, the heat sink design specification includes constraints upon size, total mass, and air coolant pressure drop across the heat sink.

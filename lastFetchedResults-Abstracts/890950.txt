In this paper, the Charged System Search (CSS) algorithm and the force method are used for
the simultaneous analysis and design of structures. Supervisor agents are introduced for the optimization
procedure to enhance the exploration ability of the CSS. The presented method is applied to the design and
analysis of some planer and space structures. A new formulation is presented for the objective function,
and the accuracy and efficiency of the presented approach is examined by comparing the resulting design
parameters and structural weight with those of other methods from literature.

A promising solution for achieving highest integration density has been seen in vertical integration of heterogeneous components as a system-in-package (SiP). An important success factor of 2.5/3D SiP is efficiency in physical design. The main content of this article is an introduction to the structuring of physical design, novel classification of 2.5D technologies, and the calculation of a parameter set, which provides key data for an objective comparison and selection of integration technologies for the design process of vertical integrated SiP

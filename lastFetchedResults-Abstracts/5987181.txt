In a "triple resonance network" operating with zero-state response, the network is composed of a transformer powered through a primary capacitor from a voltage source that produces a burst of sine cycles, that has at its output side a shunt capacitor and a third coil, whose other end connects to a capacitive load. The objective is, at the end of a number of cycles, to have all the energy in the system concentrated at the load capacitance. The operation with the zero-state response allows the charging of the output from a much smaller input voltage than what would be required in a capacitor-discharge system, operating with the zero-input response. In the comparison with a similar "double resonance" network, a fundamental limitation in the voltage gain is identified, and alternative solutions are proposed. These networks find applications in high-voltage generators for pulsed power applications, and their design procedure uses curious aspects of the circuit theory of lossless linear circuits.

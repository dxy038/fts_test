The power supply systems for telecommunication plants are scattered through large geographical areas. The need for a reliable monitoring and supervision system that could be easily adapted and that uses infrastructures already existent becomes imperative. The requirements of data networks performance and the availability of Ethernet access points in telecommunications substations demands a new approach for remote supervision applications. The objective of this paper is to present and discuss the implementation and the capabilities of a remote monitoring and supervision system for telecommunications power supplies, using Ethernet network interface and standard protocols (TCP/IP suite). The software, both on servers and embedded systems, relies on open source software, allowing the operator to build global monitoring solutions without the limitations of proprietary software. The user presentation software is a standard Web application allowing any platform with a graphical Web browser to become a management console.

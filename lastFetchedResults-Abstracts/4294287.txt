This paper considers semi-global robust finite time stabilization of non-holonomic chained form systems with perturbed terms. The objective is to design a non-smooth state feedback law such that the controlled chained form system is both Lyapunov stable and finite-time convergent within any given settling time for any given initial states. We propose a novel switching control strategy with help of time-rescaling and Lyapmiov-based method.

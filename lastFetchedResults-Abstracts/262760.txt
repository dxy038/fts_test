The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of clamping force on the interfacial contact resistance and the porosity of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). An optimal rib shape for the bipolar plate is developed to analyze the electrical contact resistance. We found that the electrical contact resistance is determined by both the clamping force and the contact pressure distribution. A minimum contact resistance can be obtained in the case of a constant contact pressure distribution. The porosity of the GDLs underneath the rib of the bipolar plate decreases with increasing the clamping force, and the void volume is changed with the deformation of the GDLs. It is found that there exists an optimal rib width of the bipolar plates to obtain a reasonable combination of low interfacial contact resistance and good porosity for the GDL.

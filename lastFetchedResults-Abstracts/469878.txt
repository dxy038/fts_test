Objective
This study was undertaken to investigate the rates and predictors of follow-up and treatment for postpartum patients with a positive purified protein derivative (PPD).
Study design
Retrospective cohort study of all women delivered at San Francisco General Hospital in 2000. All patients with a positive PPD were identified and their demographic and PPD follow-up and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
Results
Among the 1331 patients delivered, the prevalence of a positive PPD was 32% (n = 425). Of the 393 patients who had not been previously treated, 42% (n = 167) attended a follow-up visit with 42% of these (n = 71) actually completing 6 months of therapy. Among different ethnicities, Asian patients were more likely to follow-up at a rate of 52% (P = .03). Patients who received care from the same physician both antepartum and postpartum were more likely to attend and complete therapy at rates of 67% (P< .001) and 62% (P = .01), respectively.
Conclusion
We found that despite the opportunity given by the interaction with the medical system during pregnancy, only 18% of patients with a positive PPD actually completed therapy

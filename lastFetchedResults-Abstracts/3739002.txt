Semiconductor workbench for integrated modeling (SWIM) is a project that was recently undertaken by SEMATECH in order to support the existing and future operational modeling needs of its semiconductor member companies. The objective of this workbench is to provide an open, integrated modeling framework that will support a number of different operational modeling applications (tools) interfaced to fab (semiconductor fabrication facility) C`2IM systems. The operational models referred to include applications in the following areas: discrete event simulation, flow and queue analysis, cost, capacity, plant layout, and scheduling. Additionally, these applications pertain to either the fab, cell, or equipment levels of abstraction. The objective of this paper is to describe the capabilities and benefits of the recently developed SWIM prototype

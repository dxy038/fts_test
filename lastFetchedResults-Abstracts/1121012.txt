Background & Objective: Streptococcosis is one of the bacterial infections in fish, especially rainbow trout which
infects brain and nervous systems of fish and is caused by S. iniae. Estimation of the impact of disease prevalence
by S. iniae in fish farming in some countries is reported about 100 million dollars per year. Some of the most
effective proteins in pathogenicity of these bacteria are SimA and CpsD. In order to design new and effective
vaccine, in this study cloning of two genes of Streptococcus was performed into pNZ8148 vector and expressed in
Escherichia coli.
Materials and Methods: simA and cpsD genes were subcloned into pNZ8148 vector. Obtained constructs were
transformed to expressing E. coli BL21 strain. After induction with nisin, SDS PAGE electrophoresis and Western
blotting were used to confirm the procedures.
Results: Using PCR with specific and universal primers, the accuracy of cloning was confirmed. Final verification
of expressed protein was carried out by SDS-PAGE and western blotting.
Conclusion: With regard to the obtained results, it seems that the generated gene construct in this study can be
used as a vaccine against Streptococcosis in future researches.

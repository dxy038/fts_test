Objective
et-rich fibrin (PRF) is a platelet and leukocyte rich and platelet preparation that concentrates various growth factors and therefore has the potential to be used as regenerative treatment. The aim of study was to assess the effects of platelet rich fibrin (PRF) on bone augmentation when used in conjunction with titanium barrier a rabbit calvaria model.
design
-four adult male New Zealand rabbits were used in this study. Two titanium barriers were fixed on each rabbit's calvarium. The rabbits were divided into four groups (group one is control and the other three groups are experimental) and each group contains 6 animals. PRF, anorganic bovine bone (ABB), and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) were used with titanium barriers in the experimental groups. Any materials were not used in the control group. Half of the animals were sacrificed after 1 month, and the rest were sacrificed after 3 months. Histomorphometric evaluation was carried out in order to compare new bone formation among the groups.
s
icantly more new bone area was noted in the PRF alone group than in the control group, no statistically significant differences were found among PRF, BCP and ABB groups after 1 month. PRF and ABB also had superior effects in new bone formation area control to the BCP group after 3 months.
sion
y offer the ease of use, simple handling, and enhanced delivery of growth factors during the bone augmentation procedures. When used in conjunction with the titanium barriers, PRF use can increase the quality of the newly formed bone and enhance the rate of bone formation due to the concentration of growth factors.

After restructuring &amp; reformation of Power Utility Sector in India through enactment of Electricity Act 2003, the Power Distribution Utilities are facing tremendous challenges to comply regulatory norms as the distribution networks of Indian Power Utility have grown more than double in size and complexity in the last 10-15 years. It has resulted in increase in volume of workload and the inefficiency in whole distribution system. Continuance with conventional manual systems is going to prove a luxury in terms of cost apart from resulting in consumer dissatisfaction at the quality of service rendered &amp; less control on Aggregated Technical &amp; Commercial (AT&amp;C) Loss. Enactment electricity Act 2003 has been pressurizing the power distribution utility to plan a clear road map towards achieving Distribution Automation without further delay. They need tod start implementation forthwith to meet the objective and begin the dasiaDistribution Automationrdquo starting with urban areas and rolling it out gradually to rural areas. The automation system can be designed using available technology in computer systems, control systems and metering systems and dovetailing the same into the existing power systems. All the tools required such as Computers, Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), breakers, Switched Capacitor Banks, OLTC (On Load Tap Changer) Transformers, Auto Reclosures, Sectionlisers, AMR (Automated Meter Reading) Systems and Communication Systems are available. An integrated Distribution Automation system enables Indian power utilities to have real time control over the costly energy sold. Improved efficiency results in lower costs &amp; energy loss, better reliability in power supply, planned control actions, optimum power factor, and reduction in losses. It enables online or offline energy audit with or without AMR system which is now receiving the focused attention of all power utilities in India.

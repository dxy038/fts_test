&#8220;Internal observation&#8221; means that an agent observes an environment in inseparable mutual interference between the agent and its environment, and similar situations are widely observed in the human communication process and its dynamical interface. However, the conventional framework of system science which is based on separation of observer and observed object can not be applied to these situations. Under this kind of dynamical complexity, since the agent canÂ´t completely identify its environment and internal state of itself, not only objective information but also relational information should be focused on. Thus, we propose the &#8220;dual-center model&#8221; based internal observation agent which is composed of two different dynamics. One is a self-organizing coherent relationship in mutual interference, and the other separates the coherence into two one-sided actions in an internal model. Through mutual constraint between these two dynamics, the agent generates a hypothetical internal model relevant to its own mutual constraint process, and the boundary of the internal model is regarded as an interface of the agent. Using this framework, internal observation is modeled and temporal development between two agents was simulated as a co-generation process of the interface. Furthermore, the interface was realized in cooperative behavior between a human and machine, in particular a walk support robot

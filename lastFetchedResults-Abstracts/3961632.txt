The following article is Part II of a three-part series on the use of polymer insulating materials in outdoor insulation applications. Despite three decades of service history, polymer insulation materials do not have the same level of standardization as porcelain. As with any technology that is not well standardized, misunderstanding and confusion result, which can influence user selection and application. The objective of this series is to review the benefits of polymer insulating materials. Part II discusses the factors that affect the engineering of materials and addresses the validity of some industry perceptions. A future article will explore some of the material science aspects of silicone elastomer materials by using the case of a hybrid insulator design.

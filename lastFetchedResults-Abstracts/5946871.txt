In this paper we study the strategy model of credit loan game based on the leader follower game theory. We consider different default factor on the subjective and objective dual credit risk. We present the leader-follower game model of the enterprise, the non-banking financial institution and the bank under the multi-channel financial mode, and correspondingly give the investment and financing policies under the game equilibrium condition. Then we in detailed explain following problems such as the impact of the enterprisepsilas absolute risk-aversion degree and bankpsilas loan interest rate on enterprisepsilas income, the relationship between the optimal financing structure and the moral hazard, the loan interest rate. We give each of the optimal strategies under the game equilibrium condition. Finally by empirical analysis we explore the root cause for the financing difficult.

Background and Objective: To measure the mental strength and ability of
human and structures that exist in field of positive psychology some instruments
are required. The aim of the present study was to investigate the psychometric
properties of Simpson's Hope Scale in Iranian university students.
Methods: In this descriptive-survey research 1000 students of the 18-34 age
group and the 23.9Â±5.13 mean were selected through categorical cluster
sampling method from among different Iranian universities, and the participant
answered Snyder's Hope Scale, Oxford Happiness Scale, Hardiness Scale, Beck
Hopelessness Inventory, Riff's Psychological Well-being Scale as well as
Simpson's (1999) Hope Scale (with minor changes).
Results: Of meaningful significance (p < 0/01) were Coefficients of
Cronbach's Alpha (0.94), split-half (0.85), convergent validity (with Hardiness,
(0.40), Happiness, (0.64), Psychological Well-being, (0.47), divergent validity

5 Abstract
(with Hopelessness, -0.25). Exploratory factor analysis showed that 40-items
Hope scale for adults had five latent factors that explain 56% of the variance.
Second order confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the five factors had
high factor loadings on one latent factor and therefore six factors model was
fitted with the data (AGFI=0.93, RMSEA= 0.037, NFI=0.98).
Conclusion: The results showed that this test has high reliability and
validity and can be used in other researches as well.

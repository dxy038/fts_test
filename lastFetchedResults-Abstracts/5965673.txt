The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an adaptive optimization based on swarm intelligence. The basic principle and the method of it being used in seismic location were introduced. To get a more accurate result, the objective function is the residual square sum of the observational travel-time and theoretical travel-time of the same earthquake return two stations. Compared with Genetic Algorithm on Seismic Location, PSO, after numerous experiments, proved its distinct superiority to locate the hypocenter more quickly and accurately. PSO is potentially useful for seismic location.

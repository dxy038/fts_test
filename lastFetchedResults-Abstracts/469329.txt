Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the true-positive rates by level of training of the operator and to determine whether the accuracy of the procedure differed by the level of education after formalized training.
Study design
This was a retrospective analysis. The records of patients who underwent surgery for the indication of an abnormal saline sonohysterography were reviewed from January 2001 to April 2003 (n = 73 patients). The nature of the saline sonohysterography abnormality, the intraoperative findings, and the level of training of the provider were recorded. Findings at saline sonohysterography were compared with findings at hysteroscopy or surgery. Statistical significance was determined by Ï‡2 test.
Results
The overall true-positive rate was 86.3% (63/73 patients). The true-positive rates for nurse practitioners, second- and fourth-year residents, and fellows were 84%, 80%, 90%, and 89%, respectively. There was no significant difference among providers (P = .96).
Conclusion
The true-positive rates for saline hysterography were comparable among different provider levels.

Aimed at the problems of delay and uncertain disturbance of the target miss distance signal of optical tracking system, this paper put forward an objective grey prediction filtering algorithm based on combined model. According to gray forecast theory, we establish the grey forecasting model of the target signal directly, based on the analysis of traditional GM(1, 1) model, we has improved it, and combine it with time series method to establish residual error model of objective grey prediction, so as to constitute combined model, improve the target prediction accuracy effectively. Finally, by doing experiments about comparing the simulated target and actual target, it can be concluded that target prediction filtering method which we proposed is feasible and effective.

Objective
This work compared the nutritional efficiency of a recently available enteral formula enriched with arginine, ω-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants and supplied nitrogen as peptides (Crucial, Nestlé Clinical Nutrition) with that of a standard polymeric formula (Sondalis HP, Nestlé Clinical Nutrition) in endotoxemic rats.
Methods

Male Wistar rats (209 ± 2 g) underwent catheter gastrostomy and received Sondalis HP until they recovered their preoperative weight. At that time (day 0), an endotoxemic shock was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli, 8 mg/kg) and rats then received 290 kcal · kg−1 · d−1 and 3.29 g of nitrogen · kg−1 · d−1 in the form of Crucial (IED group, n = 7) or Sondalis HP (S group, n = 6) for 3 d. Another group underwent no treatment and was fed ad libitum (AL group). Rats were killed on day 3. Results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls test).
Results

The endotoxemic shock induced a weight loss in group S on days 1 and 2 and a weight gain in group IED (−3.5 ± 1.3 g in group S versus +6.0 ± 2.2 g in group IED, P < 0.05). In the same way, atrophy of extensor digitorum longus muscle was observed in group S, whereas wasting was limited in group IED (102 ± 4 mg in group IED versus 90 ± 3 mg in group S versus 119 ± 3 mg in group AL, P < 0.05). Muscular atrophy was associated with muscular glutamine depletion and correlated with hyperphenylalaninemia (R = 0.60), with the latter being blunted in group IED (57 ± 1 μM/L in group AL versus 77 ± 4 μM/L in group S versus 66 ± 2 μM/L in group IED, P < 0.05). No difference was observed between the experimental groups of endotoxemic rats with respect to nitrogen balance, urinary excretion of 3-methyl histidine, or total tissue protein content.
Conclusion

Crucial counteracts injury-mediated weight loss, extensor digitorum longus muscle atrophy, and hyperphenylalaninemia in endotoxemic rats.

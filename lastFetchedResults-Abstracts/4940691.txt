During initial stage of disaster relief, real time requirement and limited relief source quantity are the main features of relief work. To improve the efficiency and precision of emergency goods scheduling, a model is established for the multi-depot and multi disaster places, single category material requirement emergency scheduling problem. The objective of the model includes minimizing task complete time and relief participated vehicles. The model is under the constraints of the relief vehicle number and the specified time by disaster places. Genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the routes, to determine the number of participated vehicles and routes of varied emergency relief centers, thus the minimum emergency time and vehicles can be obtained. Finally an example is employed to validate the validity of the model and algorithm.

Bone marrow was assumed with little effect on the bone mechanical property. As a result, there is no simulation model of bone strength considering bone marrow. While, it has been reported that fat marrow content increased in osteoporotic bone. Whether the fat marrow influences the bone mechanical property is unknown yet. Therefore, the objective of this study was to figure out the contribution of bone marrow fat in bone strength. A finite element model was established by using quantitative computed tomographic (QCT) data from a 63-year-old femaleÂ´s L3 vertebrae. With mechanical load applied on the finite element model, a significant higher maximum stress was observed in the model without bone marrow, compared to the one with fat marrow. The results indicated that bone marrow fat diminish the maximum stress on the trabecular bone and may function as a force buffer in a bone.

The Objective of this paper is to design LCC resonant converter with 200W, 250 KHz switching frequency which is used for radar power supply and to verify the results using PSPICE Simulation for wide variation in loading conditions. We have used motor load (R-L-E) and embedded based triggering circuit. The embedded `CÂ´ Program is checked in Keil Software and also triggering circuit is simulated in PSPICE Software. In this paper analysis, simulation and experimental results were presented and compared with theoretical results.

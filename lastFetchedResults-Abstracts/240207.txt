The objective of this paper is to develop an algorithm for tracing the optima of equality and inequality constrained optimal power flow as a function of the load parameter. Although available optimization techniques can determine an optimal power flow solution for a fixed load, often the effects of change in load parameter on the optima for a wide range are required. The optimal continuation power flow approach provides a systematic way to trace the optima for a continuous increase in load in the given direction via continuation techniques. This approach also reveals the voltage stability limited power transfer. Results of the tests on up to 1500-bus networks are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

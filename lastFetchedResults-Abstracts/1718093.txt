Objective
owing insights from neuropsychological research, including within biosocial criminology, have not yet been systematically incorporated into the study of correctional rehabilitation. Given developments in related fields, we argue that moving toward a biosocial theory of offender rehabilitation or neurocriminology will enrich our understanding and effectiveness of these interventions. A particularly promising area to investigate is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). In this regard, we examine research on the neural correlates of skills that are addressed in correctional cognitive skills programs.
s
ew of the literature reveals that social skills, coping skills, and problem-solving skills are consistently associated with activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, insula, and temporo-parietal junction.
sions
ograms that effectively target social skills, coping skills, and problem-solving skills should correspond to increased activity in these regions. The implications of this research are discussed.

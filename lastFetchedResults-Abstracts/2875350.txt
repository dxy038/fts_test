In this paper, we propose task partitioning heuristics for multicore real-time energy harvesting systems. Both timing constraints and energy requirements are considered. Our objective is to determine a partitioning that guarantees absence of both energy starvation and deadline missing under Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling. First, we describe the system model and formalize the assignment problem in real-time energy harvesting systems. Then, we describe and analyze the performance of partitioning heuristics for identical processors. We explore how the task sorting criteria and the energy constraints can favor the heuristics feasibility performance. Moreover, we estimate through simulation a sufficient energy reservoir capacity that guarantees the best performance.

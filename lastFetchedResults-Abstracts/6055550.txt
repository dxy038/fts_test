We present in this article a study of some unsupervised evaluation criteria of an image segmentation result. The goal of this work is to be able to automatically choose the parameters of a segmentation method best fitted for an image or to fuse different segmentation results. We compared six unsupervised evaluation criteria on a database composed of 100 synthetic gray-level images segmented by four methods. Vinet´s measure is used as an objective function to compare the behavior of the different criteria. We finally apply these criteria to evaluate segmentation results of multi-components images. We present in this article some experimental results of evaluation of gray-level and multi-components´ natural images.

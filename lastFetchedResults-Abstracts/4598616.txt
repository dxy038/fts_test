This paper presents a UWB bidirectional elliptical ring antenna excited by circular monopole with curved slot for 5.8 GHz band rejection. High Q operation of band notch is obtained in the simulation. The characteristics of the antenna have many attractive features in both technically and economically, such as bidirectional radiation pattern, wide impedance bandwidth, moderate gain, small size, low cost, and easy fabrication. The antenna is desired for application in conventional narrow and long path service area, where some frequency bands pre-occupied by the WLAN standard IEEE 802.11a.

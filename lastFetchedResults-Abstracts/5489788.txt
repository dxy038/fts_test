At present majority Pressure-Sensor Based TPMS is a simplex communication system. The paper applies the technology of low-frequency wake-up to realize the TPMS bidirectional communication and Low-Power consumption of the sensor module. In the design of TPMS, the character of Atmel low frequency communication ATA5283, ATA5275 are introduced. The corresponding communication system for low frequency Wake-up are described in detail. Furthermore, the application in a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is given; a hardware realization scheme of low frequency Wake-up is proposed; a relevant software process is designed. The system processes many advantages in low power and security.

Summary form only given. In this paper, an approach to radioelectronic apparatus (REA) production efficacy estimation is given. Quantitative estimation of efficacy and quality assurance of REA may be different. Together with the functional reliability, the economical reliability is widely used. The probability of concrete production task performance under minimal cost conditions is the most complete and objective estimation of technological process efficacy.

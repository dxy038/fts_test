A mathematical model of distribution network with several different type DFACTS device was set up to analyze the interaction between each of DFACTS (Distributed Flexible AC Transmission) equipment. Based on this model, taking reactive power and harmonic content as constraint conditions, and minimum of total DFACTS configuration cost as objective function, using genetic algorithm, optimizing models of several joint operating multi-type DFACTS in distributed network were established. An IEEE 14 nodes distribution network model containing several DVR (Dynamic Voltage Restorer) and DSTATCOM (Distributed Static Synchronous Compensator) verified the correctness of the mathematical model and optimization scheme.

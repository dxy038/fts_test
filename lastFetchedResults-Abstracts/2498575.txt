Research and planning to improve the quality of life for elderly seems to be essential, as the population of this age group has shown an increasing trend. Any chronic disease including diabetes has an impact on lifestyle of the patient. The objective of this study was to compare the quality of life between two groups of elderly diabetic patients who were residence of home as well as nursing home. A descriptive-analytical random study was conducted during 2010-2011 on two groups of 93 elderly diabetic patients, who were living in Kahrizak nursing home of Tehran (Iran), and home residents as well by interview for their demographical information and one standard questionnaire provided by world health organization. SPSS 16 was employed for data analysis. Significant differences were found in physical, psychological and social domains between two groups (P<0.05). In physical and social domains the elderly diabetic patients of nursing home had a higher mean score but in psychological domain the result was in contrast. Regarding the difference between scores in two studied groups it is necessary to study the weak points of each group individually and try to resolve the problems.

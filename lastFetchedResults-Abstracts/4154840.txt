Most of automatic blood pressure measurement devices on the market implement an oscillometric method. This paper highlights the need for standardized calibration procedures for these devices in order to reduce logistical difficulties, time-consuming processes, and high costs involved in clinical validations. A critical overview of researchers´ and manufacturers´ proposals to answer this need is presented as a contribution to the IEEE P1721 project for a new standard on Objective Measurement of Systemic Arterial Blood Pressure in Humans.

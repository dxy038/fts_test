The objective of this survey is evaluation of antibacterial effects of Cuminum cyminum L. essential oil on Bacillus cereus morphology with use TEM. Bacillus cereus is a spore-forming food-borne pathogen often associated with food products such as meat, vegetables, soup, rice, and milk and other dairy products. 1-20 % of total outbreaks of food intoxication in the world are caused by Bacillus cereus. There is an increasing interest in the use of plant-derived antimicrobial compounds as natural preservatives for foods. Such as Cuminum cyminum L. essential oils that mechanism of inhibition of the growth of several pathogen's morphology by them have been reported in various articles by electronic microscopy. The essential oil Cuminum cyminum plant were obtained by steam-distillation and analyzed by GC/MS. Then effect of concentration of these essential oils (450 jil/Lit) on morphology of Bacillus cereus were evaluated with TEM after processing and photographs explanation. Electronic microscopy observations revealed that the cell membranes of Bacillus cereus treated by EO were significantly morphological damages, disrupted membranes, abnormality bacterial division, deformity and ... The results showed, the potential inhibitory effects of the Cuminum cyminum essential oil on Bacillus cereus in Brain Heart Infusion broth.

To achieve the high precision measurement of motion parameters, a method based on the vectors of light beams is employed. In this paper, the principle of the measuring method is analyzed, and the relationship between the measuring errors and the variables of the measuring system is established, on the basis of which the objective function for the optimization of the measuring system is given. Then the measuring system based on the vectors of light beams is optimized with genetic algorithm, which guarantees the normal measurement of the motion parameters, and further improves the precision. The experiment results show that the optimization of the measuring system can assure the normal implementation of the measurement, while effectively improve the measuring precision of the motion parameters, especially that of the pitch angle and the position in Z direction.

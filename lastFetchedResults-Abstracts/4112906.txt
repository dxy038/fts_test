Digital video broadcasting for handheld (DVBH) is one of the wireless technologies that provide modern digital television services. The main objective of this paper is to propose a method to evaluate the performance of mobile rebroadcaster in terms of symbol error rate, taking into account antenna effects and the angle of arrival statistics. A correction factor is derived from concepts as the mean effective gain, which joined to a closed-form expression for the symbol error probability, allows predictions about the antenna impact on the broadcaster. The quantitative evaluation of the analysis identifies an important SNR reduction from 4 dB to 10 dB, depending on the environment.

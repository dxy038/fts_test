ackground: explicit and implicit memories are two types of long-term memory which have an important role in our daily life and cognitive activities.  Here, the effect of attention, processing level and learning style on these two memories are in consideration.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of attention, processing level and learning style on explicit and implicit memories. 
Method: The research population comprised 200 university students at Science, Engineering and Human sciences faculties of Ahwaz University. This study was an experimental research which conducted in four stages. At first stage, participants were divided into four groups by taking Learning Style Inventory. At Second stage, The participants were shown a task contain of 20 frequent words, At third stage, participant on Focused or Divided Attention and Shallow or Deep levels of processing situations completed the Recognition Test of Explicit memory. At fourth stage, they completed Word-fragment Completion Test of Implicit Memory. 
Results: Results showed that the highest score of explicit memory belong to Focused attention on deep level of processing situation of Divergent learning styles. The lowest score of explicit memory belong to Divided attention on shallow level of processing situation of accommodate learning styles. The attention and level of processing had no effect on functions of implicit memory and were different on learning styles, but the explicit memory had lowest scores on divided attention and shallow level of processing.
Conclusion: These results suggest some considerations regarding the impacts of attention, processing level and learning style in explicit and implicit memories which will be discussed in this article.

An evolutionary autonomous failure recognition approach is presented using multi-objective genetic programming in this paper. It is compared with the conventional robot failure classification algorithm. Detailed analysis of the evolved feature extractors is tempted on investigated problems. We conclude MOGP is an effective and practical way to automate the process of failure recognition system design with better recognition accuracy and more flexibility via optimizing feature extraction stage

Objective
eraction between the endothelin-1 gene (EDN1), blood pressure (BP) and social determinants has been previously found. Using a well-characterized cohort of participants, the impact of associations between genetic factors and job strain on BP was evaluated.
s
s-sectional analysis of five polymorphisms covering the EDN1, of which 2 were previously reported to be associated with BP, was performed. Study subjects had previously completed a baseline evaluation including 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring and an assessment of job strain. This report presents the findings for 184 subjects who gave DNA samples for genetic analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed between each genetic marker and 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), as well as two-way ANOVAs to test the interaction effect with job strain.
s
 for relationships were observed between SBP and two polymorphisms: rs10478694 and rs5369. An interaction between job strain and those heterozygous for two polymorphisms showed higher SBP (P=.029 and .008) and a tendency for higher DBP. All findings were more significant when analyses were confined to the 139 Caucasian subjects.
sion
s the first study to report an interaction between the EDN1 gene, job strain and BP, supporting previous evidence of a role of this gene in the interaction between environmental stress and ambulatory BP. Given the limited sample size, the results should be considered preliminary, and further studies are required.

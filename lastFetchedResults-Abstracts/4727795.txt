System evaluation is the later stage work of system analysis and also the earlier stage work of decision analysis and itÂ´s in the &#8220;hub&#8221; status of system engineering theory and method. System evaluation has wide application value for application of system engineering theory and practice. The supply chain trust is very important for the performance of supply chain operation. In order to effectively measure the level of supply chain trust, the paper constructs an evaluation index system for complex system of supply chain trust. And then subjective weight based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and objective weight based on entropy weight are integrated by the least square of deviations which is proved the most effective combination method, thus a new model of comprehensive evaluation is offered for the level of supply chain trust. The method makes full use of useful evaluation information and avoids the limitation of single evaluation method. An example was used to reveal the effectiveness and reliability of the combination evaluation method.

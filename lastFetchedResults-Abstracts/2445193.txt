The conceptual design of the ancillary systems of the European Test Blanket Modules (TBMs), namely the PbLi circuit, the Helium Cooling Systems (HCSs), the Coolant Purification Systems and Tritium Extraction Systems (TESs), is proceeding as per time schedule adopted by the European Domestic Agency for ITER (Fusion for Energy (F4E)). A general description of these systems, based on the present baseline, is given in this paper.

ic importance for the conceptual design of the ancillary systems is the definition of the main interfaces with ITER because of the potential impact not only on their design itself but also on their operation and maintenance strategy. The main interfaces and integration issues in ITER involving the ancillary systems are here described and discussed.

er, the most critical future activities and the main milestones, identified to be compliant with the objective to deliver to ITER the European TBS ancillary systems by 2019, are also indicated and discussed in this paper.

Since the seminal work of Saaty (1977), the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been widely applied in a large number of decision problems, that show the potential of this methodology in addressing trade offs among quantitative and qualitative measures. Even if the theoretical basis of the AHP are quite sound, some areas need further research. One of those areas concerns the interaction of tangible and intangible measures. In particular, two major critical points can be evinced: how to use quantitative measures expressed in a standard scale within the AHP framework; and how to compose quantitative and qualitative information in an unbiased way. The objective of this paper is to suggest a reference framework supporting management in correctly using quantitative information and choosing the scale of measure in the pairwise comparison procedure, in order to avoid distortions in the evaluation of alternatives according to both qualitative and quantitative criteria

Despite slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) being one of the most common disorders of the adolescent hip, its early diagnosis is quite difficult. The main objective of this work is to apply an interface damage model to predict the failure of the bone–growth plate–bone interface. This model allows to evaluate the risk of development of SCFE and to investigate the range of mechanical properties of the physis that may cause slippage of the plate. This paper also studies the influence of different geometrical parameters and body weight of the patient on the development of SCFE. We have demonstrated, thanks to the proposed model, that higher physeal sloping and posterior sloping angles are associated to a higher probability of development of SCFE. In a similar way, increasing body weight results in a more probable slippage.

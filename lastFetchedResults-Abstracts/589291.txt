Objective: This paper aims to study the effectiveness of training the preschool
teachers for issues relating to problem solving and anger management,
and its impact on their teaching style, aggression and happiness.
Method: The present study is of a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest
single group design. 48 preschool teachers in Tehran were selected, and asked to
complete the Teaching Style Questionnaire, Redford-Williams Hostility, and
Oxford Happiness Inventory. The subjects were then exposed to problemsolving
and anger management training.
Results: Test results for pre and post tests in all subscales of parenting
styles showed significant differences. Comparison of the effect size for different
subscales of teaching styles suggested that the highest effect size was for
problem solving. Also hostility showed a significant decrease and happiness a
significant increase in the posttest stage.
Conclusion: It is concluded that the interventions applied in the present
study can be used to increase happiness, decrease hostility and improve the
problem solving strategies accordingly.

Objective
The behavior of molten titanium in molds of complicated shape is still insufficiently understood; consequently, definite spruing criteria are not yet available for titanium RPD frameworks. This study investigated the influence of sprue design on porosity in pressure-cast titanium circumferential clasps.
Methods

The patterns of 90 circumferential clasps were sprued with three directions (0, 30 and 60°, as measured between the sprue and the symmetry plane of the clasp assembly) and three sprue diameters (1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mm). CPTi was cast in a one-chamber pressure casting machine. Pore number and size were assessed on radiographs of the castings. Statistical analysis was done by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Fisher's PLSD post hoc test.
Results

The porosity in lingual arms increased significantly with increase of sprue diameter and sprue angle, while the porosity in minor connectors had an inversely proportional distribution. Very low porosity, uninfluenced by sprue design, was found in buccal arms. In conclusion, internal porosity in titanium circumferential clasp arms can be minimized through sprue design: the 0° sprue direction produced the least porosity, while for the 30 and 60° directions, 1.5 mm diameter sprues produced lower porosity than 2.0 and 2.5 mm diameter sprues.
Significance

In this study, the lowest porosity in titanium circumferential clasp arms was obtained with sprues attached perpendicularly to the minor connectors, regardless of sprue diameter. Conventional sprue directions produced significantly higher porosity in clasp lingual arms, the amount of porosity increasing with sprue diameter.

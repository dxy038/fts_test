As terrain provides the only and powerful thrust to a mobile robot, design with consideration to terrain is most important, particularly for the robot in sandlot or the soft soiled environment. A trade-off design based Terramechanics about a reconfigurable mobile robot is proposed based on Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) with respect to Terramechanics. A novel analytic projection method is proposed to build the model of stability, mass of robot and the drive torque respectively with non-linear characteristics. A minimum-maximum method is also applied to obtain the optimal configurations parameters for design synthesis.

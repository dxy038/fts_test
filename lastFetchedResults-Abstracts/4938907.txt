Simulation is a very important tool which has been used for several years in several fields (with computer and non computer systems). The purpose of using simulation is to understand the way in which a system will evolve generally(the future behaviour of a system) to influence this behaviour if possible and make the necessary possible changes in order to have a system that behaves the way we wanted. Given its importance, some thought to use simulation as soon as possible during the design process in order to minimize design costs and eliminate unfit designs as early as possible. This paradigm is called "Simulation Based Design" or SBD. Our objective is to use the SBD to design Adaptive Multi Agent Systems (AMAS) with ADELFE (Atelier de DEveloppement de Logiciels a&#768; Fonctionnalite&#769; Emergente, IRIT, SMAC) which is an agent oriented methodology devoted to design adaptive software with emergent functionality.

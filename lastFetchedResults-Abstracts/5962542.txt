This paper will report on the work performed by BP Solar under NREL Subcontract #ZAX-8-17647-05. The objective of this three-year PVMaT program was to continue the advancement of PV manufacturing technologies in order to reduce cost and increase production capacity of the Frederick, Maryland plant. The program included development efforts in the following technology areas: Solar-grade silicon feedstock; Improving process control in casting; Reducing wire diameter and wafer thickness; Reducing wire saw operating costs; Developing a faster cure encapsulant; Increasing cell efficiency and process robustness; Improving handling and eliminating non-value added handling steps; Improving measurement and control throughout the production line. Results in each area will be discussed.

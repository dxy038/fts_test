Objective
The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for intra-operative cystotomy during TVT and whether this affects surgical outcome and morbidity.
Study design
Charts of 340 women who underwent TVT were reviewed. Those who had a cystotomy during the procedure (cases) were compared with those without (controls) for the variables: age, race, parity, body mass index (BMI), TVT with or without other procedures, previous pelvic surgery, blood loss, length of catheter drainage, UTI, and voiding dysfunction. The t-test and chi-squared test were used and differences resulting in P< .05 were statistically significant.
Results
Cystotomy occurred in 49/340 TVT procedures (14.4%). Only those who had a history of abdominal hysterectomy and BMI greater than 26.5 were more likely to have a cystotomy (P = .05 and P = .001, respectively). Cases were more likely to go home with catheter drainage (P = .005). There was no increased risk of UTI or voiding dysfunction, nor was there a difference in surgical cure rate.
Conclusion
Cystotomy does not seem to negatively affect the outcome of the TVT procedure.

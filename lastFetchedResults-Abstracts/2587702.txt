In the present paper, our objective is to
investigate the accretive operators arising from 2-Banach spaces and to derive not only new but also interesting links between the classes of nonexpansive and of accretive mappings which give rise to a strong
connection between the fixed point theory of nonexpansive mappings and the
mapping theory of accretive maps.

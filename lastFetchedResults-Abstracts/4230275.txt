In this article we described the theory of L-system in a concise. Because of the limited resolution of the fundus camera, small blood vessels do not appear in the retina images. Our objective is to generate these blood vessels with l-system. In the first section we study L-system (Lindenmayer systems). The Parametric of L-systems are formulated to generate branching tree structures that can incorporate the physiological laws of arterial branching. In the second section we present morph metric of blood vessels that allowed us to demonstrate the laws binding the diameters and angles between vessels at bifurcations. This knowledge will further the realization of computer models of bifurcations for automatic location and extraction of bifurcation tree structures. Results show that our used method indicate that this approach has great potential for recognizing natural objects and generate blood vessels are close to reality.

Even though many companies and nations are aware of the need for implementing mobile cloud computing to their business practice, sometimes it is difficult to clarify the objective of cloud computing service. The general trend is to just implement ASP (Active Server Provider) instead. The most noteworthy distributed computing framework in the field of cloud computing is `Hadoop,´ an open source tool developed by `Yahoo´ for large scale data processing and analysis. This research proposes a mobile cloud computing model, which utilizes open source codes from distributed computing frameworks, like Hadoop, in an attempt to improve the efficiency of business processing. We will also be able to study how to process and analyze unstructured data in parallel to this model, so that in the future, providing customized information for individuals may be possible using unstructured data.

This paper investigates the problem of robust stability for a class of uncertain discrete-time stochastic bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with Markovian jumping parameters and time-varying delays. By employing the Lyapunov functional we can get novel robust stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI), which can be easily solved by MATLAB LMI toolbox. Furthermore, we will introduce into some free weighting matrices in order to lead to much less conservative results. At last, one numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

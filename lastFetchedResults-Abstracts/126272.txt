In order to reclamation of plantation purposes in arid lands, it is necessary to select suitable plant species. Success in reclamation depends on identifying the necessities of mentioned plants, on the other hand these species with their
special characteristics have special effects on their surrounding environment and it should be considered. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Haloxylon aphyllum and Calligonum comosum on sand dunes
physico â€“ chemical properties and also establishment in Kashan. At the first stage two main areas of established plants (Mulched and no Mulched) were selected. Then according to status of plant cover 8, 100 square plots were established and in each plot some parameters such as plant diversity and percentage were estimated. At the second stage soil sample were taken from beneath bushes, between bushes and control area from two depths, 0-10 cm and >10cm. Soil samples were analyzed in laboratory and necessary comparisons were carefully made using some computer software such as
Mstatc, SAS and Minitab. The results showed that there are significant differences between treatments. These species increased content of organic matter and N.P.K amounts in sand dunes. Organic matter improves soil structure in long term providing suitable conditions for microorganisms activities and increase pedolozation process.

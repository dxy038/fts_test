Influence maximization problem is to find a set of seeds in social networks such that the cascade influence is maximized. Traditional models assume all nodes are willing to spread the influence once they are influenced, and they ignore the disparity between influence and profit of a product. In this paper by considering the role that price plays in viral marketing, we propose price related (PR) frame that contains PR-I and PR-L models for classic IC and LT models respectively, which is a pioneer work. We find that influence and profit are like two sides of the coin, high price hinders the influence propagation and to enlarge the influence some sacrifice on profit is inevitable. We propose Balanced Influence and Profit (BIP) maximization problem. We prove the NP-hardness of BIP maximization under PR-I and PR-L model. Unlike influence maximization, the BIP objective function is not monotone. Despite the non-monotony, we show BIP objective function is sub modular under certain conditions. Two unbudgeted greedy algorithms separately are devised. We conduct simulations on real-world datasets and evaluate the superiority of our algorithms over existing ones.

Objective: The aim of this study is to found how well one can characterize the location and extent of relatively compact infarcts using electrocardiographic evidence. Method: Here, we address a method base on behavior of some ECGÂ´s features, which are Q, amplitudes and ST dispersion. We call these Q and ST curves. At the first step, by plotting the variability of Q, amplitude and ST dispersion for nodes which lies in lines on torso plane, these curves are obtained. The behavior of the mentioned curves for normal lines both in horizontal and vertical line differ from the abnormal ones. A threshold method is used here to determine the infarcted area. Results and Conclusion: The method is evaluated on Challenge 2007 database. The results are EPD=8, SO=0.944, and CED=1. The method achieved the best EPD and CED scores and the second place for SO and overall ranked the highest scores (first rank) in CinC/PhysioNet Challenge 2007.

Public concerns associated with the electromagnetic field (EMF) exposures from mobile phones on the human body are increased. It is well known that absorbed EMF can be transformed into heat within biological tissues and that thermal effects are related with the specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution. This study was a basic research to measure EMF effects induced in human body and it was the objective of this study to analyze EMF thermal effects induced in a tissue-equivalent phantom exposed to the 835 MHz field quantitatively and thermographically. In addition, this study could be an essential experimental step to investigate electromagnetic field effects and help to understand IMF effects induced in human body.

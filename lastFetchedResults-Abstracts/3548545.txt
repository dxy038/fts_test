In this paper, techniques for machine learning of real-time control strategies are presented and reviewed from a control engineerÂ´s point of view. The objective is to present a consolidated view, both in the context of classical control theory and modern artificial intelligence practice. The review seeks to present the principal contributions to the field and the impact of these contributions on control engineering, particularly from the machine learning point of view

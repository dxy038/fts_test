An indoor simulation study was carried out to evaluate heat and mass transfer relation for a semi-cylindrical metallic (opaque) condensing cover for higher yields at different operating temperatures under free and forced modes of operation. The objective is to design a distillation unit for higher yield for commercialization, particularly in India. Experiments have been conducted for the operating temperature range of 40°C to 80°C in a steady-state condition by using constant temperature bath. Data (temperature and yield) obtained from experimentation have been used to determine the values of coefficient C and n and, consequently, convective as well as evaporative heat transfer coefficients. It is inferred that a higher yield is obtained with an increase of temperature in the forced mode of operation as compared to that in the natural mode of operation due to a fast release of heat from the condensing cover.

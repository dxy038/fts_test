CoFeB amorphous thin films have been prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The objective of the work has been to obtain very soft thin films, and to correlate their domain structure with the induced anisotropy. Tailored anisotropies were induced by either growth under stress, or by post-deposition annealing in the presence of a magnetic field

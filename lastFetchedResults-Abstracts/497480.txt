 Weaning is often associated with post-weaning colibacillosis (PWC), caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). The objective
was to investigate the effects of manipulating dietary protein supply and increasing weaning age on enteric health and ETEC
shedding of newly weaned pigs exposed to an experimental ETEC challenge. The experiment consisted of a complete 23232
factorial combination of weaning age (4 v. 6 weeks), dietary protein content (H, 230 g crude protein (CP)/kg v. L, 130 g CP/kg) and
experimental ETEC challenge (1 v. 2); all foods were free from in-feed antimicrobial growth promoters (AGP). An additional four
treatments were added to allow the effect of protein source (DSMP, dried skimmed milk powder v. SOYA, soybean meal) and AGP
inclusion (yes v. no) to be investigated in challenged pigs of both weaning ages. On day 3 post-weaning challenged pigs were
administered per os with 109 cfu ETEC O149. A subset of pigs was euthanased on days 0 and 6 post weaning to assess enteric
health and small intestine morphology. Both weaning age and dietary protein content affected the consequences of ETEC challenge.
ETEC excretion persisted longer in the 4-week-weaned pigs than those weaned at 6 weeks. Although not significant, the numbers
of ETEC shed in the faeces post infection (days 4 to 14) were higher on the H than L diet, especially in the 4-week-weaned pigs
(P50.093). Lowering CP level led to significantly firmer faeces post challenge (days 3 to 6) and decreased colonic digesta pH.
Protein level had no effect on small intestine villous heights or crypt depths. There was no significant effect of protein source on
ETEC excretion or enteric health. Results suggest that increasing weaning age and decreasing the level of dietary protein, especially
in earlier weaned pigs, may help to maintain enteric health and minimise the effects of PWC

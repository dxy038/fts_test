The author describes a modular design environment called FORS (flexible organizations), which is based on a network representation of the design effort. Each design network consists of tools (programs distributed over the whole network) and aspects (the models to which the tools are applied). The systemÂ´s communication and exchange of data are based on distributed problem-solving techniques. The main objective is to develop mechanisms for collaboration between the different tools. The system provides a self-explanatory icon-based interface that allows for the dynamic reconfiguration of the design network and maintains libraries of records, tools, and aspects. The user can easily add and delete tools and access information and data from old designs. FORS extends object-oriented tool representation and considers the remote effects problem, also known as the simultaneous engineering or concurrent design problem

In this paper, we propose a fuzzy singularly perturbed model with multiple perturbation parameters to approximate the model of flexible-link manipulators. Because of the calculation stiffness in dealing with such a multiple time scale system, singular perturbed strategy is used in the control of flexible-link manipulators, which take more advantages than rigid-link manipulators. To approximate the nonlinear multi-time scale system more precisely, a fuzzy singularly perturbed model with multiple perturbation parameters is adopted, which is an extension of the one with a single perturbation parameter. In the framework of this model, a multi-objective robust controller is developed and its parameter independent solution is derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Some simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach using in the control of flexible-link manipulators.

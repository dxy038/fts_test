The application of green communications to LTE networks is analyzed. An approach to reassign mobile users to different LTE BSs is proposed. The objective is to achieve energy savings by switching off lightly loaded BSs without compromising the tolerable outage rate in the network. The proposed approach takes into account the uplink and downlink directions, intercell interference, and scheduling. The proposed method was studied via simulations under different quality-of-service requirements in the uplink and downlink. The results show that significant savings can be achieved by the proposed approach, without increasing the outage rate in the network.

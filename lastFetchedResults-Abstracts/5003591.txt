In this paper, a hybrid optimization technique is presented to solve the well-known problem of tuning power system stabilizersÂ´ (PSSs) parameters. The hybrid technique is derived from particle swarm optimization (PSO) by adding the passive congregation model. The tuning of the PSS parameters is formulated as the multi-objective function with constraints including the damping ratio and damping factor. Maximizations of the damping factor and the damping ratio of power system modes are taken as the goals or two objective functions, when designing the PSS parameters. The New England 16-unit 68-bus standard power system, under various system configurations and operation conditions, is employed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results are very encouraging and suggest that the proposed PSO with passive Congregation (PSOPC) algorithm is very efficient in damping low frequency oscillations and improving the stability of power system.

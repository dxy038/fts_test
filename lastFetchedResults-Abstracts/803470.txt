Background: Nowadays, one of the methods for treatment of Alzheimer is using of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). Discovering the drugs with better effects and fewer side effects especially from natural sources is the aim of many researchers. 
Objective: In the present investigation, AChEI effects of six Ferula species have been studied.
Methods: Total extracts of six species of Ferula including F. persica var. persica, 
F. hezarlalezarica, F. ovina, F. oopoda, F. hirtella and F. szowitsiana were obtained by using methanol 80% and different fractions of the species were prepared by using hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol, methanol 50% and water, respectively with maceration method. AChEI activity of each extract in concentration of 300 Âµg/ml was determined by Ellman method in 96 -wells plates in 405 nm. 
Results: The results revealed that among examined samples, only F. persica var. persica chloroform fraction showed reasonable AChEI activity (27.3%) while other extracts had trace activity or no effect.
Conclusion: It seems that relatively non-polar components of F. persica var. persica had AChEI activity. Since, sesquiterpene coumarins are the major compounds in Ferula species, they may be considered as AChEI agents in Ferula persica var. persica, but more investigations are necessary to establish the idea.

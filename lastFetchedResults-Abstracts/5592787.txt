In order to overcome the shortages of the conventional bus route generation algorithm which aims to maximize the number of direct travelers on the shortest path, this paper present an improvement route generation algorithm for the design of bus network, which aims to maximize the direct passenger-kilometers per unit length and minimize the average travel time of direct travelers on each route at the same time. At first, the paper analyzed the irrationality of the conventional bus network design model developed by others, revised the objective function appropriately, and built a new model of bus network design. Then a modified algorithm is developed particularly to solve this problem, this design algorithm is heavily guided by the demand matrix and allows the designerÂ´s knowledge to be implemented so as to reduce the search space. Finally, the applications of the new algorithm are illustrated with a numerical example. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm would be efficient in practice.

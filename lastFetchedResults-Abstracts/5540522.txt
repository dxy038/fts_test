The integration of information provided by an a priori landscape analysis as a guiding tool for interactive EMO methods is proposed. For this purpose, a new type of a priori landscape analysis is introduced, namely ellipse enclosure of the feasible solutions set in the solution space. The interaction takes place in the solution space, the user having as visual guiding tools the computed enclosure as well as the set of solutions found at the previous search phase. Furthermore, reference points are specified by the user thus directing the search. The effectiveness and efficiency of the method are supported through statistical experimentation performed on the bi-objective permutation flow shop problem.

This paper presents an optimal power flow (OPF) model which maximizes system security. Loading factor has been chosen as objective function of OPF problem to enhance system security. It is demonstrated that available transfer capability (ATC) is a suitable criterion for evaluation of system security. In addition, this concept is consistent to ISO requirements for system operation. On the other hand, loading factor (LF) is an alternative concept that can evaluate system ATC. Therefore, in this work, the correlation between LF and ATC has been demonstrated. The proposed OPF model formulation has been solved in order to maximize loading factor. By solving this optimization model for normal and contingency conditions, ISO can be ensured about system reliability and security. Finally, the proposed optimal power flow model is applied and tested on the CIGRE 32-bus system for normal and contingency cases.

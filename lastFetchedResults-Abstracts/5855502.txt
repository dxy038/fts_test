A time-domain numerical method to achieve reconstruction of arbitrary convex conductor cylinders was considered in this paper. And the obstacle is characterized by the discrete points. The electric field and magnetic field on the extrapolated boundary are solved by Time-Domain Finite Element Method (TD-FEM), and then the far-field value is obtained from it. Real differential evolution strategy is adopted as the optimization method. Norm of the discrete pointÂ´s radius vector is set as the independent variables for the fitness function. The perimeter range is got by analyzing the far-field value. Imaging results is achieved by minimize the objective function through the real differential evolution strategy (RDE).

The objective of this study was to determine the quicker response of subsoil or
surface soil to minimum tillage (MT) and conventional tillage (CT) and biofertilizers
(Bacillus coagulans, B), Phosphorus fertilization (P) and integrated P and B (PB) under
the wheat (Triticum aestivum L vr. Sardari) growing season. The experimental design
was split plot laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications that
tillage practice systems were in the main plots. The field trial is located in the dryland
semiarid. Three tillage practices were: (i) conventional tillage (CT), with moldboard
ploughing; (ii) reduced tillage (RTC), with ducksfoot cultivator with a springtine harrow,
and (iii) with moldboard ploughing with the moldboard detached (RT). Result showed
that there was no significantly differ in yield and yield component in wheat under MT or
CT. Integrated P and B (PB) significantly (P < 0.05) increased nutrient accumulation
through increasing in N and P uptake of wheat plants. At 5–20 cm, miycorrhizal
colonization value, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzymes and dehydrogenase activity
(DHA) was greater than at 0–5 cm when wheat was under RTC or RT. At 5–20 cm B
inoculant and PB increased ALP and DHA. Result indicated that transition to
conservation tillage is the delay in soil response but subsurface soil can respond quickly
to a cessation in tillage under the semiarid area condition

Objective: To conduct a systematic review, with meta-analysis, of studies assessing the association between night work and the risk of breast cancer, using available epidemiological evidence. Method: Relevant studies were identified by searching several databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles. We combined the relative risks (RR) from individual studies using a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis was carried out as the data showed statistically significant heterogeneity. Results: Thirteen studies consisting of eight case–control studies and five cohort studies were included in the analysis. In the combined analysis of all studies, night work was associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (RR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.08–1.33). The higher-quality studies showed a similar finding with a pooled RR of 1.40 (95%CI = 1.13–1.73). Both case–control studies (RR = 1.32, 95%CI = 1.17–1.50) and cohort studies (RR = 1.08, 95%CI = 0.97–1.21) showed a positive association between night work and the risk of breast cancer. No publication bias was found either from Begg's funnel plot (P = 0.086) or the Egger's test (P = 0.107). Additional well-conducted and large-scale epidemiological studies are needed.

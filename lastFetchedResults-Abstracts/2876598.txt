This paper aims to discuss and analyze the application of remote laboratories in teaching electronics to undergraduate students at the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The application of remote labs is motivated by the fact that in Brazil, a Federal Law (LDB - Lei de Diretrizes Ba&#769;sicas da Educaca&#776;o, No. 9394, from December 20<sup>th</sup>, 1995) establishes in Article 80 that the Higher Education Institutions can offer courses 100% in distance education methodology. Complementary regulation was issued in December 10<sup>th</sup>, 2004 by the Ordinance No. 4059, which allows the Higher Education Institutions to use up to 20% distance education methodology for all established (recognized) classroom courses. Thus, this paper will present the remote labs as an important and efficient distance education resource to implement practical experiments in electronics. To accomplish this objective, an exploratory activity was performed by using a remote laboratory with undergraduate students, and then, via an interview, the perception of them was obtained to discuss the results and gains of the methodology.

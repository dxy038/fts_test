OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the contemporary maternal and neonatal outcome of triplet gestations. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of 57 triplet deliveries between April 1, 1989, and July 31, 1994, was performed. RESULTS: The mean gestational age at delivery was 33.0 ± 2.7 weeks, and the mean birth weight was 1820 ± 513 gm. The most common maternal complications were preterm labor (86.0%), anemia (58.1%), preeclampsia (33.3%), preterm premature rupture of the membranes (17.5%), postpartum hemorrhage (12.3%), and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome (10.5%). Neonatal complications included hyaline membrane disease (29.6%), transient tachypnea of the newborn (20.1%), intraventricular hemorrhage (7.7%), and major congenital anomalies (7.1%). The perinatal mortality was 41 per 1000. Birth order had no significant effect on the incidence of neonatal complications. CONCLUSION: Perinatal mortality rates have improved in recent years but remain higher than for singleton gestations. Despite increasing experience with triplets, the rate of maternal complications is high. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:1551-6.)

The ASTAP-compatible circuit optimization program (AOP) is employed to minimize the access time of a read-only store memory circuit. The design of this circuit provides an example particularly wellsuited to the application of circuit optimization techniques. The design involves finding the optimal values for three design variables. The design objective can be expressed with one simple optimize parameter.

More and more congestions are emerging because of the increasing of air traffic flow in china. in order to facilitate civil-aviation traffic, a flight conflict resolution method based on ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) is surveyed in this paper. the optimization objective function which not only includes trajectory length factor but also passengers comfort factor is constructed. an ACO model for flight conflict resolution is established. the experimental results show that the optimized trajectory achieved by ACO is better than those obtained by GA and PSO.

This paper discusses power flow control in electric power system by use of unified power flow controller (UPFC). A current injection model of the UPFC is used. The contro1 objective is to maintain the line power flow of a controlled line at a desired value. The control objective can be achieved by lincarizing the line power flow equations around the operating point. The paper introduces the criterion for validation of two proposed control methods. The UPFC and power system network model have been developed in Matlab/Simulink environment for the simulations to demonstrate the proposed methods.

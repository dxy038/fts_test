This paper describes the methodology developed for the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) to evaluate and select a commercial simulation package to be used for operational and long-term planning. The project consisted of three distinct phases. The objective of the first phase was to investigate the potential applications of simulation in the CPC environment. A benefit cost analysis was conducted for this purpose. The phase two objective was to benchmark the existing software and to make a recommendation. The accompanying effort is presented herein. The final phase was aimed at developing a complete facility model to serve as a template for the 22 mechanized mail processing plants throughout Canada. This work is ongoing

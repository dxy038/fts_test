Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare a subcutaneous stitch closure and subcutaneous drain placement for the risk of wound disruption after cesarean delivery. Study Design: This was a prospective randomized clinical trial that evaluated subcutaneous stitch closure, placement of a subcutaneous drain, or no closure for subsequent wound disruption risk in women with subcutaneous depth at â‰¥2 cm. Results: The maternal demographics and intrapartum risk factors for postoperative wound disruptions were similar among the 964 study subjects, who were divided into 3 groups. Wound disruptions that required opening of the wound, irrigation, debridement, packing, and/or secondary delayed closure occurred in 9.7% of the women with no closure, 10.4% of the women in the stitch closure group, and 10.3% of the women in the closed drain group (P= .834). Conclusion: There appears to be no difference in the subsequent risk of wound complications when no closure of the subcutaneous tissue layers occurs versus suture closure or a closed drainage system.

Governments all over the world are working on a broad array of e-government-services. As a result, there is need to evaluate e-government services objectively to identify areas of concerns. Recently, researchers have shown interest in IS evaluation and the public value perspective segment taking the lead. Arguably, the prime objective of e-government is to produce public value through effective use of ICT. Moreover, research in the field of public administration are advocating use of paradigm in two-fold; first, it will direct the effort of scholars away from the resolution of pressing administrative problems to the studies of arcane theoretical puzzles. Second, the paradigm dictates the connective taxonomies of the principal subjects of inquiry and forces the scholars, to work and think within the ambits of paradigm. The primary objective of this paper is to carry out a theoritical review and develop a framework of evaluating e-government services for developing countries.

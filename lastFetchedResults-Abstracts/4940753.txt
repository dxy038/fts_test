This paper presents a network model for virtual path (VP) management which considers both the topology and capacity allocation for a set of virtual path connections (VPCs). The objective of the model is to find an optimal VP pool which can be used for on-line network management and control. The solution of the model gives a set of VPCs with assigned capacities which optimise the objective function value for a given network configuration. As an application example, the model is used to find an optimal VP pool for an ATM network which suffers a link failure. A comparison is made between fixed virtual path management (FVPM) and dynamic virtual path management (DVPM), comparing the revenue achieved by each. This illustrates how DVPM adapts the VP pool in a robust fashion to achieve maximum revenue in the face of a link failure

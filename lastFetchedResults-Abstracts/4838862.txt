Cooperative Co-evolutionary (CC) techniques have demonstrated the promising performance in dealing with large-scale optimization problems. However, in many applications, their performance may drop due to the presence of imbalanced contributions to the objective function value from different subsets of decision variables. To remedy this drawback, Contribution-Based Cooperative Co-evolutionary (CBCC) algorithms have been proposed. They have presented significant improvements over traditional CC techniques when the decomposition is accurate and the imbalance level is very high. However, in real-world scenarios, we might not have the knowledge about the ideal decomposition and actual imbalance level of a problem to be solved. Therefore, this study aims at analysing the performance of existing CBCC techniques in more realistic settings, i.e., when the decomposition error is unavoidable and the imbalance level is low or moderate. Our in-depth analysis reveals that even in these situations, CBCC algorithms are superior alternatives to traditional CC techniques. We also observe that the variations of CBCC techniques may lead to the significantly different performance. Thus, we recommend practitioners to carefully choose a competent variant of CBCC which best suits their particular applications.

A model is proposed for the incremental estimation of visual motion fields from image sequences. The authors´ model exploits three standard constraints on image motion within an optimization framework: (1) data conservation-the intensity structure of a surface patch changes gradually over time; (2) spatial coherence-neighboring points have similar motions; and (3) temporal coherence-the image velocity of a surface patch changes gradually. The authors´ formulation takes into account the possibility of multiple motions at a particular location. They present an incremental scheme for the minimization of the objective function, based on simulated annealing. All computations are parallel, local, and incremental, and occlusion and disocclusion boundaries are estimated

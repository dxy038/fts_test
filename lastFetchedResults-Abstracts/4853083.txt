Group companies play an important role in the development of Chinese economy. It has been an important way of strategic management to evaluate the competitiveness of group companies and to find out ways to improve it. This paper constructs a group company competitiveness evaluation indicator system through the selection and rational analysis of indicators. By determining the optimal indicator weights through combining the Coefficient of Variation and G1 method, it establishes a comprehensive evaluation model and does an empirical study on six group companies in China. The contribution characteristics lie in three aspects. Firstly, by scientifically selecting sixteen indicators, one evaluation indicator system adapting to the characteristics of group companies is constructed. Secondly, by determining the combination weight through the multiplicative synthesis method based on G1 method and Coefficient of Variation method, this paper organically combines subjective and objective information. Third, the research results indicate that the competitiveness of the six group companies in Liaoning province of China is still relatively low and need to be improved further.

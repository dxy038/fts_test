The transshipment problem in which the projected demand and supply at different locations on different days are known in fuzzy quantities is presented. The formulation of the model follows that of fuzzy linear programming in that the solution is a shipment schedule which satisfies the objective at a `reasonable costÂ´. Priorities for satisfying requirements at demand points and supply points on selected days are incorporated by multiplying corresponding weights to h, the level of satisfaction. The presentation follows from the general to the specific formulation with an example

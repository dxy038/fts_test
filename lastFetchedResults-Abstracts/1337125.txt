Retained placenta is considered to be a common problem in postpartum mares. The incidence varies from 6% to 54% depending on the breed, with higher incidence in heavy draught mares than in light-weight mares. Retained placenta has been linked to lower postpartum oxytocin concentration, impaired uterine involution, and dystocia. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of early manual removal of placenta immediately postpartum on subsequent fertility parameters (development of free intrauterine fluid, inflammatory status of endometrium, and on pregnancy rates) and to compare them with mares with spontaneous expulsion of placenta. A total of 29 mares, mainly Irish draught, were closely monitored during foaling by closed circuit television and allocated to two groups: (1) mares that expelled the placenta spontaneously within 3 hours of foaling; and (2) mares that were cleansed manually immediately after foal delivery. All mares were examined and scanned 5 and 9 days postpartum, and free intrauterine fluid was recorded; endometrial swabs were taken 9 days postpartum for endometrial cytology and culture. None of the fertility parameters analyzed showed statistical difference between groups 1 and 2. Therefore, it can be concluded that early manual removal of placenta has no detrimental effects on subsequent fertility of mares and, therefore, can be recommended when a veterinarian attends a foaling.

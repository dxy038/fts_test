OBJECTIVE: Pain is one of the most common signs of different diseases relief of which, is the primary aim of treatment. Use of cold is a simple and inexpensive technique. This study was done to investigate the effects of cold on sensory and pain threshold in 1 8-25 year old women.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 35 normal females, none of whom had any sensory psychical problems. By using of electrical stimulator set (50Âµ.s, 100Hz), the pain and sensory threshold were measured at four stages from a point that was 5cm above the radial crease of wrist (Before using of cold , 15 and 30 minutes after using of cold). Ice- pack was used for using of cold. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and paired t-test.
FINDINGS: The results showed that there is a significant difference between the mean of sensory and pain threshold before using of cold, 15 and 30 minutes after using of cold (p< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Application of cold increases sensory and pain threshold significantly.

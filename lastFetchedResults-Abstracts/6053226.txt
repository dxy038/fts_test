Course Scheduling problem is a constrained, multi-objective optimization problem, and has proven to be a NP complete problem, usually resolved by genetic algorithm, but the effect is not satisfactory, the paper presents a genetic algorithm-based, combined with tabu search and the coloring principle to automatically arrange more complete global search using genetic algorithms, tabu search using local optimization, convergence speed and avoid local optimization, the better solution for all hard soft conditions constraints and satisfactory solution by the users.

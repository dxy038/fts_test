ABSTRACT 
Background and objective: Today, the resistance to antibiotics among of pathogen bacteria is one of the main concerns of doctors all around the world, with consideration to different reports about Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria’s sensitivity, this study was done to examine the pattern of sensitivity and antibiotic resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains collected from clinical samples of patients hospitalized in Tehran’s Araad hospital.
Materials and methods: In this descriptive examination, after extracting Klebsiella pneumoniae derivations from clinical samples (urine, catheter, phlegm, blood, wound and bronchial), their sensitivity was measured using standard Kirby-Bauer test, in contract with following antibiotics Amikacin, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin, Imipenem, Sulfametoxazole Trimetoprime, Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime.

Results: Most of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated were from urine samples every three years and the lowest of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from bronchial samples. The most amount of sensibility to Cefotaxime, Imipenem and Amikacin and the most amount of resistant were seen to Gentamicin, Ceftriaxone and Ciprofloxacin. 
Conclusion: The results of this study are indicating that Klebsiella pneumoniae strains resistance has increased against Gentamicin, Ceftriaxone and Ciprofloxacin; presumably it is due to excessive consumption of these antibiotics. It is obvious that, with regard to increasing consumption of antibiotics, and consequently, augmentation of antibacterial resistance, control of this resistance factor is necessary and inevitable, so it is recommended to avoid unnecessary usage of antibiotics.

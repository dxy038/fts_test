The paper shows the practical importance of the failure probability-safety factor method for designing
engineering works. The method provides an automatic design tool by optimizing an objective function
subject to the standard geometric and code constraints, and two more sets of constraints, that guarantee
some given safety factors and failure probability bounds, associated with a given set of failure modes.
Since a direct solution of the optimization problem is not possible, the method proceeds as a sequence
of three steps: (a) an optimal classical design, based on given safety factors, is done, (b) failure
probabilities or bounds of all failure modes are calculated, and (c) safety factors bounds are adjusted.
This implies a double safety check that leads to safer structures and designs less prone to wrong or
unrealistic probability assumptions, and to excessively small (unsafe) or large (costly) safety factors.
Finally, the actual global or combined probabilities of the different failure modes and their correlation
are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed. To
this end, the optimization problems are transformed into another equivalent ones, in which the data
parameters are converted into artificial variables. In this way, some variables of the dual associated
problems become the desired sensitivities. The method is illustrated by its application to the design
of a composite beam

Study objective:  The American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) Longitudinal Study of Emergency Physicians (LSEP) was initiated to describe the development of a new medical specialty through the continuing study of the lives of representative emergency physicians. The study is designed to gather data periodically over many years to come. The primary purpose of this article is to provide a baseline for the information obtained and the methods used to develop the ABEM LSEP. Methods:  Stratified, random sampling was used to select emergency physicians who represent different stages in the development of the specialty. Major data collections are conducted using a comprehensive questionnaire in 5-year intervals. Practice profiles were developed and analyzed. Homogeneous scales were created in 9 survey categories and analyzed. Results:  The survey was returned by 95% (958/1,008) of the emergency physicians. They are primarily middle-aged, family- and community-oriented, satisfied with their careers, and find that work stress is not a serious problem. Those who are trained in emergency medicine are the most likely to be involved in academic emergency medicine. Conclusion:  The LSEP is a broad-reaching investigation of emergency physicians. Over time the study will describe (1) the individuals who move the specialty forward at different stages in the growth of the specialty, (2) the realities of practice in the specialty, (3) the relationship of the specialty to the personal lives and well-being of the specialty physicians, and (4) the changes seen in these factors over time.

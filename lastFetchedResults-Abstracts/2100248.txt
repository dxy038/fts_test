Human patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) commonly exhibit IgE reactivity to cutaneous self-antigens. The presence of serum IgE autoantibodies appears to correlate with disease severity, and it is suspected to reflect or contribute to tissue damage. The objective of this study was to determine whether IgE autoantibodies specific for cutaneous antigens could be detected in the serum of dogs with AD. Serum was collected from 19 dogs with untreated moderate to severe AD and four specific-pathogen free (SPF) dogs. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed using normal canine skin collected at four different locations (concave ear, nose, medial thigh and lateral thorax), while Western immunoblotting was done using normal canine ear pinna epidermal and dermal extracts and reducing conditions. In both methods, IgE was detected using a monoclonal antibody specific for heat stable epitopes of canine IgE. At 1:10 dilution, specific IgE autoantibodies against cutaneous autoantigens were not detected, with either method, in AD and SPF canine sera. Either IgE autoreactivity is not associated with moderate to severe AD in dogs, or the methods employed herein were not sensitive enough to permit IgE autoantibody detection.

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how Open Innovation and Living Labs concepts can support the industrial development of new business ideas. In particular, the adoption of Open Innovation / User Driven concepts contributed to implement effective business development services in the GNSS (Global navigation satellite systems) downstream industry, based on the GNSS Living Lab Prize. This initiative built on validated, modular services from within the existing, outstanding activities represented by the organisations supporting the Prize, the "European Satellite Navigation Competition" (ESNC) also known as "Galileo Masters" for the identification of promising business ideas and the open innovation environments provided by the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL). The focused new contribution of the GNSS Living Lab Prize is the implementation of coordinated Galileo Advanced Innovation Services, the "innovation highway", spanning over three main phases: idea recognition, product and services development, and, eventually, new ventures creation.

Objective: To explore the effects of decreasing blood glucose of extracts of corn and the pupa to diabetic rats induced by STZ. Method: The mixture of corn and the pupa is extracted by water lifting reduction. ICR rats were intraperitoneally injected of STZ 40 mg/Kg, animal model of diabetes was prepared; to observe fasting blood glucose levels (FBG) of mice with glucose oxidase; to observe the serum cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels of all the animals with automatic biochemical analyzer; to observe serum insulin (INS) levels of mice with radioimmunoassay; Results: 1. Multiple low dose Intraperitoneal injection of STZ can lead to the model of diabetic mice close to the features of human disease. After modeling, diabetic mice have appeared typical symptoms of diabetes.2. Corn polysaccharide can alleviate the typical symptoms of diabetic mice, reduce blood sugar, improve lipid metabolism, advance insulin secrete of diabetic mice.

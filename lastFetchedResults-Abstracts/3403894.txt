The author takes an objective look at how telecommunication has been, is, and will probably be used by air transportation. It is recommended that private enterprise implement the communication framework for use jointly by the government and nongovernment agencies. The feasibility of that rrecommendation appears evident; existing land line plant facilities of the nation furnished by private enterprise today handle multitudinous varieties of government and nongovernment services. But, it is conceivable that others may consider that government plant facilities might form this basic communication framework, even though it would be some departure fromm some accepted principles. The cost of any planning and programming is indeed minute in relation to the implementation and operation costs, or in relation to the indirect costs of poor service. How this proposal mentioned here might be modified, or what plan might displace this plan, all remains to be seen.

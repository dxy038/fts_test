In order to obtain the optimal scheme of task allocation problem for multiple mobile robots. Considering task allocation problem is a multi-objective optimization problem in essence, a general multi-objective task allocation model is established. A new method named multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm based on decision preference information (DPIMOGA) is proposed to solve the optimal allocation scheme. Numerical simulations show that DPIMOGA can solve the problem with light decision burden and Real-time interaction, which denotes that the cooperative task allocation problem solved by DPIMOGA is feasible and effective for multiple mobile robots.

In this study, an approach is proposed for supplier selection and allocation taking into account the environmental implications. In that case, the most important purchase items are identified using ABC analysis. Then, in order to evaluate the performance of suppliers accurately, performance evaluation criteria are identified and screened. Next, using Analytic Network Process (ANP), suppliers are ranked. Finally, orders allocation is done to qualified suppliers through implementing a linear multi-objective programming model.

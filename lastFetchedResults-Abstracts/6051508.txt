In this paper, we develop a multi-user cognitive radio sharing network based on opportunistic spectrum access, where primary and secondary users can peacefully coexist in the same system to share the spectrum and improve the utility of licensed spectrum. Under this scenario, we introduce two constraints to guarantee their successful transmission, interference temperature limit at the primary users and SINR limit at the secondary users. The objective of our interest is to obtain the number of secondary users who can coexist peacefully with primary users, at the same time maximize the total goodput under the two constraints. Through analysis and simulation, the new strategy of spectrum sharing does improve the goodput performance as well as guarantee the QoS of primary and secondary users.

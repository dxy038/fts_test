This work provides a solution to a non-planar multi-agent layered sensing and formation control problem using coning graphs. In particular, the problem addressed consists of one agent coordinating the actions of other interacting agents which are operating in a different plane. The objective is for the agents to cooperatively acquire a pre-defined formation shape using a decentralized control law. The proposed control strategy is based on inter-agent distances for single-integrator agent model and consists of formation acquisition term for non-planar agents. The simulation results that support the proposed approach are presented.

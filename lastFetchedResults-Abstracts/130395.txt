Animals: Ten adult male albino rabbits.

Statistical analysis: paired t- test and regression bobgggcgcot. Results: The results indicate that rabbits display a circadian rhythm of feeding behaviour, consuming as much food in the dark phase as in the light phase. The ratio of dark to light feeding was 1.64 and of water intake was I.72. J. Fac. Vet. Med. Univ. Tehran. 58, 1: 21-23, 2003.

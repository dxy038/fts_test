This paper proposes a method for application in dynamic route guidance using travel time reliability. The definition and calculation method of Travel time reliability of road section, road path and road network is given in this paper, and three road impedance functions are design for different layer. Based on the road impedance functions and road network model, the reliable dynamic route guidance method (RDRGM) proposed to give the optimal routes, whose objective is not only fast, but is also reliable. The performance of RDRGM is evaluated using simulation data. The experimental results indicate that the proposed RDRGM is satisfactory.

A bidirectional unrepeatered transmission system using optical fiber amplifiers has been demonstrated over a single optical fiber at 591 Mb/s with 53 dB power budget margin. Two signal lasers at different wavelengths within the erbium-doped fiber amplifier band have been chosen for forward and reverse direction transmission. The erbium-doped fiber optical amplifier is employed in a dual role-as a power booster for the forward direction and as a receiver preamplifier for the reverse direction-to achieve long distance bidirectional transmission over a single fiber. Comparative results for unidirectional transmission are given and the penalty and advantages of bidirectional transmission system are also discussed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

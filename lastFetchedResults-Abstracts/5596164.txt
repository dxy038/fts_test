Prior research and commercial practice have shown that rotating unbalanced masses are highly efficient means of producing cyclic motions in larger mechanical structures. Presented in this paper is the dynamic model of a wheeled vehicle coupled to a rotating unbalance mass. The research objective is to show that the rotating unbalance mass, properly coupled to the vehicle, can produce propulsive force along the longitudinal axis. Numerical studies are presented here to support the hypothesis. The work examines the foundation for developing highly efficient vehicle propulsion schemes using rotating unbalanced masses.

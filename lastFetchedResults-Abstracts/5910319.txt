In the next-generation wireless systems capacity will change dynamically to accommodate changing user patterns. Users will automatically move from congested cell to allow the network to dynamically self-balance. Therefore, there is a critical need for radio resource management (RRM) in order to effectively control resources and maintain the acceptable service quality. RRM algorithms are responsible for efficient utilization of the air interface resources. RRM is needed to guarantee quality of service (QoS), to maintain the planned coverage area, and to offer high capacity. The objective of this research is to propose an adaptive handoff algorithm which can effectively deal with hotspot cells in next-generation wireless systems. Under the proposed algorithm, the signaling burden is evenly distributed and the regional network boundary is dynamically adjusted according to the up-to-date mobility and traffic load for each terminal in advance, before handoff execution. A simulation model is developed to investigate the handoff performance. In the simulation results, we find that these algorithms can reduce call drop rate of handoff calls thus enhance the service quality.

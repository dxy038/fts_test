The problem addressed in this paper is the Job Shop Scheduling problem when the objective is to minimize the total earliness and tardiness from a common due date for a set of jobs. This objective became very significant after the introduction of the Just-in-time manufacturing approach. A multiagents approach is used to solve this difficult problem. The paper presents preliminary work on modeling the problem using agents theory.

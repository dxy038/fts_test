Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) helps organizations to improve software development processes. But it contains very little information on process dynamics. It doesn't address the following issues like Specific tools, methods and technologies to be followed, Issues in Human resource management, People management methodology and cost attached to people manager. In this paper we focus on the real world problem in the systems development life cycle such as Organizations understaffed, Separation of duties. In order to overcome the problem we have suggested a Multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) for minimization of the human resources used. So inturn MOGA has been used to minimize the cost associated, minimize the time involved and to maximize the efficiency by proper usage. The Prioritization of the various constraints involved in the project is also done by the MOGA, which shows a good result over the manual allocation. The results compared with the manual assignment and the comparative results are reported and discussed, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the project planning.

In order to increase the work efficiency of oil pumping system, the key problems in the operation process of oil pumping system are summarized. The experiment system for oil pumping is established, the mathematic models of oil pumping system are analyzed, objective function, boundary condition and calculated method in oil extraction system are discussed, the optimum control strategy in the operation process of oil pumping system is in this paper proposed. The experiment results demonstrate that the strategy proposed can meet the requirement of saving energy and reducing wastage. Therefore, the research work in this paper has important academic research and application value.

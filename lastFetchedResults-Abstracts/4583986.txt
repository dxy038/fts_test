Topology optimization technique is applied to the design of a dielectric waveguide filter. The objective function is defined as a function of reflection coefficient, and the design variable is relative density of dielectric material in each unit cell. To calculate sensitivity information that is needed during topology optimization, adjoint variable method is used. The results of numerical examples show feasibility of the proposed method

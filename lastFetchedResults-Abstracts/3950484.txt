In this paper, a new fuzzy filter for the removal of random impulse noise in color video is presented. By working with different successive filtering steps, a very good tradeoff between detail preservation and noise removal is obtained. One strong filtering step that should remove all noise at once would inevitably also remove a considerable amount of detail. Therefore, the noise is filtered step by step. In each step, noisy pixels are detected by the help of fuzzy rules, which are very useful for the processing of human knowledge where linguistic variables are used. Pixels that are detected as noisy are filtered, the others remain unchanged. Filtering of detected pixels is done by blockmatching based on a noise adaptive mean absolute difference. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art filters both visually and in terms of objective quality measures such as the mean absolute error (MAE), the peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the normalized color difference (NCD).

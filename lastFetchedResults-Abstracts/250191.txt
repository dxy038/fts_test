In the present work, multidisciplinary optimization is formulated in the game theory framework. We
choose a coupled heat transferâ€”thermoelastic system as the case study for which a topology design
approach is developed. The multidisciplinary optimization problem is solved as a non-cooperative
game and we determine a Nash equilibrium. The game has two players and the parameterization of
the design domain is such that the design variables describe the material density and a parameter
which influences the heat flow by convection to the surrounding fluid. The first player controls the
structure and the second player controls the temperature distribution in the structure. For the second
player, we present mathematical proof of existence of a discrete valued optimal solution and it is
concluded that no regularization of the suboptimization problem is needed. We present two numerical
examples which illustrate the proposed methodology. One of the examples is also solved by weighting
the objectives to a scalar valued objective function and the result is compared with the Nash game
solution

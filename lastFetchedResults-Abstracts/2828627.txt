In this paper, the bidirectional three-phase dual-active-bridge DC converter with the hybrid modulation is implemented, to improve the light-load efficiency. Charging and discharging behaviors are controlled by the phase angle and the duty cycle of voltage applied on both sides of the transformer. The hybrid modulation and the experimental results of the converter are presented. A lab-scaled converter prototype with 48V/20AH LiFePO<sub>4</sub> battery was established to validate effectiveness of the proposed modulation method.

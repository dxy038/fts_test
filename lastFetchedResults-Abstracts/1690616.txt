Abstract:
Objective: In present study, the effects of intra-dorsal hippocampal (intra-CA1) injection of cannabinoid receptor agents on memory formation have been investigated in 5-days  physositigmine-treated rats. Method: Passive avoidance task of memory has been used to examine for retrieval of memory formation, 24 h after training. Physositigmine was injected subcutaneously (S.C.), once daily for 5-days followed by 10 days free of the nicotine before training. Results: Post-training intra–CA1 administration of cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN55, 212-2 (0.25 and 0.5 µg/rat) and CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251 (25 and 50 ng/rat, intra–CA1) decreased memory retrieval. Administration of AM251 (25, 50 and 100 ng/rat, intra – CA1), 2 min before injection of effective dose of WIN55, 212-2 (0.25 µg/rat) could not alter the response induced by WIN55, 212-2. Repeated administration of different doses of physostigmine (0.12, 0.25 and 0.5 mg /kg) for 5-days have no effect on memory retrieval. However, repeated administration of different doses of physostigmine (0.12, 0.25 and 0.5 mg /kg)  for 5-days reversed amnesia induced by WIN55, 212-2 or AM251 . Conclusion: The results suggest that WIN55,212-2 and AM251 influence on memory formation and subchronic physostigmine pre-treatement may restore memory  through a possible cholinergic receptor sensitization.

Objective: To find out the frequency, clinical presentation, type, extent and treatment modalities of Gestational trophoblastic disease. Material and Methods: This was a descriptive study of 45 patient with Gestational trophoblastic disease admitted in Gynae "B" unit of Lady Reading Hospital over a period of one year from first of August 1992 to thirty first July 1993. The case records of all these patients were analyzed regarding their clinical presentation, investigation, treatment and follow up. Results: The frequency of Gestational trophoblastic disease was 11.8/1000 pregnancies or 17.6/1000 deliveries. Out of 45 cases of Gestational trophoblastic disease, 38 were hydatidiform mole (H. Mole) and 7 were choriocarcinoma. The commonest age group was 21-39 yrs (68.5%). The disease was common in multigravida and grand multigravida (44%-40%). Variable period of amenorrhea associated with vaginal bleeding was the main presenting symptom (99.5%). Seventy three percent (73.3%) of patient had suction evacuation. Eighty percent (80%) of the patient did come for follow up. One patient died in case of choriocarcinoma due to complication. Conclusion: Frequency of trophoblastic disease was high in this study compared to world and national literature. Regular follow up and counseling is essential to decrease the mortality and morbidity from this condition.

Objective: the present study evaluated the executive functions of organization, decision making-planning, and inhibition in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Method: For this cross- sectional/ analytical study, 60 primary school students were recruited by random sampling into 2 groups: 30 children with DCD (based on DSM-IV criteria), with mean age of 8.2 years; 30 normal children with the mean age of 8.5 years. Data were collected using Basic Motor Ability Tests and Coolidge Personality and Neuropsychological Inventory, and the Ravon Test of Intelligence. Data were analyzed using t-test. Results: Children with DCD differ from the normal children in executive functions of organization and decision making; however there was no significant difference in their function of inhibition from normal. Conclusion: In regard with these findings, the following strategies are suggested to overcome the executive function deficits: emphasizing the individual work after school; using organizational tools like the alarm clock, calendar, and computer; emphasizing learning thinking and problem solving skills; prescribing psychostimul ants.

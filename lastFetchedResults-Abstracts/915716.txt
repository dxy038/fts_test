Glucoconjugates of (±)-ibuprofen, (±)-α-tocopherol (vitamin E), gentisic acid, gallic acid, 2,6-bis(tert-butyl)-4-thiophenol, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine were prepared with the objective of increasing the bioavailability of such antioxidant and anti-inflammatory drugs. The O-glucosides were synthesized using benzylated α-d-glucopyranosyl trichloracetimidate as glycosyl donor. For the synthesis of the S-glucosides, the glycosyl donor 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranose provided higher yields than the corresponding O-acetylated imidate.

The objective of the study was to explain the role of academic optimism, academic emotions and school wellbeing on the mathematical performance of girl and boy students. The research method was descriptive and correlation. A sample of 440 (109 boys and 331 girls) students was selected by cluster random sampling. The research instruments were Student Academic Optimism Scale (TschannenMoran, Bankole, Mitchell amp; Moore), Academic Emotions Questionnaire (Pekrun, Goetz amp; Frenzel), and School Wellbeing Questionnaire (Konu, Alanen, Lintonen, amp; Rimpela). A teacher made questionnaire was also used to evaluate math scores. The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, stepwise multiple regression analysis and independent t test. Findings showed that academic optimism, academic emotions and school wellbeing had significant positive correlation with math performance (0.20, 0.23, 0.16). The results showed academic wellbeing had significant positive relationship whit mathematic performance of girls and boys and predicts mathematic performance, too. Also, the results showed academic emotions had significant positive relationship with students mathematic performance in the girls and in combination with academic wellbeing explained %16 mathematic performance; but it was not the case in the boys. Academic optimism with academic wellbeing could explain %17 of boys mathematic performance, while in the girls there were not such explanation power.

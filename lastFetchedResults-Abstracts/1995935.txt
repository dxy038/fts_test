The objective of this work was to obtain and stabilize natural vitamins from red pepper by-products. The method of obtainment was supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, studying different parameters that affect the yield. The highest extraction yield was found at 60 °C, 24 MPa extraction, with no modifier added and 0.2–0.5 mm particle size. The recovered extract was a red-coloured oil. The extract was subsequently microencapsulated by spray-drying using gum arabic as wall material to avoid the degradation of vitamin over the storage time. The thermal stability of microcapsules was analysed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), while size, shape and morphology of microcapsules were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The microcapsules containing pepper extract were particles of spherical shape with dents on the surface, the average size of these particles was 5.46 μm.

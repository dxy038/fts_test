With increase of urban population, the cities have an impact more and more important on environment. Because of artificial surface, building morphology, economical activities, traffic several natural ecosystem are modified. To analyze this impact, the land covers/land uses have to be identified exactly in an urban area. To reach this objective, remote sensing represents an important and complete source of information. Joint use of radar and optical data allows improving results of classical classification to identify the cover mode. Re-sampled to 1m resolution, the difference between the two classifications is analyzed to detect the confusion in each class corresponding to a land cover/land use. Finally, a vector process allowed to transform the geometry of the results: a polygon aggregates several pixels. Combination of results is also possible with GIS functionalities like contains, intersect, cut, and permits to propose a land cover/ land use description on the study area.

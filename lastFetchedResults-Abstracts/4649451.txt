The process of selecting which virtual machines should be located (i.e. executed) at each physical machine of a Data center is known as Virtual Machine Placement - VMP. This work proposes for the first time a multi-objective formulation of the VMP considering Service Level Agreement. A novel multiobjective memetic algorithm is also proposed to solve the formulated multi-objective problem. This proposal is validated comparing experimental results of the proposed algorithm with a brute force exhaustive search algorithm. Simulations prove the correctness of the proposed memetic algorithm and its scalability considering different experimental scenarios.

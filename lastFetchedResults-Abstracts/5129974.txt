When it comes to software engineering technologies, enthusiastic boasts about production efficiencies are more common than sober discussions about technical difficulties - that is the nature of marketing. However, understanding potential technical difficulties in new technologies is essential, particularly, when it comes to using these technologies in safety-critical systems. Such is the case with object oriented technology (OOT). In 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) started the object oriented technology in aviation (OOTiA) project to facilitate safe use of OOT in aviation applications. A primary objective of the project was to identify and document safety and certification concerns about using OOT in compliance with RTCA/DO-178B software considerations in aircraft equipment and system certification. This work provides a brief survey of the technical challenges that have been identified so far.

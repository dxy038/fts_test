The objective of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of ovarian tumors over a 20-year period and the age distribution of these tumors. A retrospective study was performed on ovarian tumors which were diagnosed in Shariati Hospital between 1976-1995, and had pathologic report. Frequency and age distribution of tumors were then evaluated. Of 493 evaluated ovarian neoplasia, surface epithelial tumors seen in 283 cases (57.4%) were the most frequent tumors. After that there were germ cell tumors in 152 cases (30.83%) and then sex-cord stromal tumors in 31 cases (6.28%). Metastatic tumors were in 24 cases (4.86%) and the 3 remaining cases were 2 cases of luteoma and I case of chondroma. The most frequent benign neoplasia of ovary was dermoid cyst (mature cystic tratoma) (39.53%) and after that scrocystadenoma (29.24%) and mucinous cyst adenoma (14.82%). The most frequent malignant neoplasia of ovary was malignant scrous tumors (53.69%) and after that there were metastatic tumors (16.1%) and mucinous cyst adenocarcinoma (14.09%). The greatest number of patients (111 cases) were in 21-30 age group and after that 99 patients were in 51-60 age group and 96 patients were 31-40 years old. In our study, surface epithelial tumors were less than the other world statistics and germ cell tumors were more than other studies which was probably due to younger age of our patients (the most frequent number of patients were in 21-30 age group). Metastatic tumors were more frequent in this study and it is probably because of late diagnosis of malignancies. In sex-cord stromal tumors the most frequent number of tumors was fibrothecoma in this study, whereas in the other studies, the most prevalent sex-cord stromal tumor is granulosa-theca cell tumors. Racial factors may have a role in these differences.

Objective
To develop burn prevention strategies for the elderly population in Hong Kong using a novel epidemiological approach.
Methods
Medical records of all patients aged 60 or above who were admitted to our hospital in a 6-year period were reviewed and demographic data, injury characteristics, details of management and outcome were obtained. Selected interviews were undertaken to determine the exact mechanisms of injury and further details of the medical and social background.
Results
Fifty-nine elderly patients were identified from the medical records with under half (42%) aged 75 and above. Male to female ratio was 1:1.68. Three-quarters of the injuries occurred at home, principally in the kitchen and bathroom. Two-thirds of the burns were scalds. Forty-eight percent of the admitted patients had surgery. Thirty-seven patients (or next of kin) were interviewed further. Of the subgroup only 12% had received appropriate first aid and 27% had treatment delayed for over 24 h before seeking medical help. The majority of patients had little or no formal education and one quarter were living alone.
Conclusion
We identified common scenarios of elderly burns which could be used to focus prevention strategies.

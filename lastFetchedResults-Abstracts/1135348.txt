The paper focuses on CMSX-4 and two experimental alloys, LDSX-5 and LDSX-6, developed to provide alternative performance attributes. The specific objective in this work was an exploration of the low cycle fatigue (LCF) characteristics of these three alloy variants and the assessment of methods for predicting the observed lives. A comparison of the alloys is presented in relation to their strain control fatigue response and notch fatigue behaviour. Predictions of notch lives are made from the plain specimen data but found to be extremely pessimistic at the lower temperature studied, 650 °C. The inaccuracies are attributed to the presence of casting pores. Using measured crack growth data and pore sizes, it is shown that fracture mechanics calculations of residual lives are more appropriate. At 800 °C, the higher temperature studied, Walker strain predictions of notch lives are more meaningful. This is explained in terms of the relaxation of stresses at the defects.

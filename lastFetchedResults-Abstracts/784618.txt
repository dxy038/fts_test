Background: An increasing number of people over 60 years of age living world-wide undertake
appropriate actions in order to identify factors to optimize their health. Objective: The study was aimed at
evaluating nutritional patterns, biochemical parameters (TC, HDL, LDL, TG, glucose) and anthropometric
parameters (BMI, waist circumference, arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness) of 220 subjects over 60
years of age originating from an urban environment. Methods: Nutritional patterns were evaluated by means of a
24-h dietary recall, whereas nutritional status of the subjects was assessed based on anthropometric parameters
and selected biochemical assays linked with lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Results: The study demonstrated
a low energy value of food rations of the analyzed seniors from Wrocław, an improper proportion of energy
supply from particular nutrients: SFA (saturated fatty acid) - 14% and carbohydrates - 52%, as well as low intake
of fruits and vegetables, cereal products and dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals. 70% of the women and in 50%
of the men were characterized by a high concentration of total cholesterol in blood serum. In turn, ca. 15% of the
subjects were shown to have an elevated concentration of glucose. A statistically significant difference was
demonstrated between waist circumference of the women and men examined (91.0±11.8 vs. 100.4±10.5; p<0.05)
as well as between their glucose concentration in blood (respectively: 88.0±28.4 vs. 103.5± 24.3; p<0.05). In 25
women, skinfold thickness was over 25 mm and mean BMI reached 30. In 40 seniors, skinfold thickness
exceeded 11 mm, whereas BMI was lower and reached 25. Conclusion: In most of the examined seniors
analyses demonstrated deficient nutritional patterns and disturbed processes of lipid metabolism. The study
indicates the need for further extensive investigations of factors that determine the health status of the seniors.

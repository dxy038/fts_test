With the objective of carrying out an Inverse Free Electron Laser (IFEL) electron accelerator experiment, an iron dominated (Vanadium Permandur) fast excitation, laminated (variable period length) planar wiggler, making use of copper field reflectors, has been constructed and has been measured in several period length tapering configurations. This report presents an analysis and experimental results of this wiggler, typically of which the parameters are &#955;(w)=3.7 cm, B(max)=1.8 T

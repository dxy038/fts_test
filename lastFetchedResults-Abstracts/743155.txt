Objective: To examine the relationship of the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and endothelial function and their associations with coronary artery calcification, lipid profile and cardiac changes. Methods: The analyses for serum lipids and CRP, echocardiography, spiral computed tomography scans and endothelial function assay were performed in 53 participants with a history of chronic cocaine use. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics and drug use between CRP normal (<1.9 mg/l) and abnormal groups. The brachial artery diameter percentage changes in the third scan (immediately after deflation of cuff) and the fourth scan (90 s after deflation of cuff) were significantly associated with the CRP levels (the third: β=−0.054, S.E.=0.027; P=0.028; the fourth: β=−0.065, S.E.=0.026; P=0.016). The multiple regression models showed that CRP was the only significant predictor of artery diameter changes (%) in these two scans. The CRP abnormal group had more coronary artery calcification (calcium scores >5, 16.7 vs. 0%; P=0.036) and more cardiac diastolic dysfunction expressed as deceleration time >240 ms (16.7 vs. 0%; P=0.036). Conclusions: Elevated serum CRP levels are associated with endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery calcification and cardiac diastolic dysfunction in chronic cocaine users.

Objective(s): To compare the effects of honey dressing versus saline-soaked dressing on healing of Pilonidal Sinus surgical wound.
Methods: In a randomized controlled clinical trials we compared topical application of honey with saline- soaked gauze of 24 patients with surgical wound of Pilonidal Sinuses.
Results: The group treated with honey (n=12) had infection eradicated and achieved complete healing compared with the control group(n=12). The findings showed that honey gave better control of infection but there was no difference between the average duration of hospitalizations with the honey treatment and control group but response to treatment and alleviation of morbidity in intervention group were faster. Conclusion: This RCT indicate the effectiveness of honey in rapidly clearing infection from wounds, with no adverse effects to slow the healing process; there is also some evidence to suggest that honey may actively promote healing. However, further research is needed to optimise the effective use of this agent in clinical practice.

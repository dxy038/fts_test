Background.The objective of this study was to gain insight into the determinants of dietary fat and fiber consumption in American rural energy workers. Main determinants in this study were knowledge, efficacy expectations, and outcome expectations. The determinants will be ordered in a model, assuming that efficacy and outcome expectations predict intention.Methods.The study consisted of a cross-sectional survey. The questionnaires on food behavior and the determinants of fat and fiber consumption were administered to the subjects at the same time. Models of determinants of fat and fiber consumption were derived from the correlation and regression analyses.Results.There were 211 questionnaires analyzed. The scales were shown to be valid and reliable. In the models of determinants of fat and fiber consumption the following determinants were generated: gender, education, knowledge, interest, efficacy expectations, outcome expectations, and intention. In this study efficacy expectations were important to determine fat and fiber consumption.Conclusions.Efficacy expectations can be considered an important variable of an intervention program aiming at the decrease of fat consumption and at the increase of fiber consumption in rural energy workers.

This paper presents a utility frequency AC (UFAC) to high frequency AC (HFAC) direct power frequency conversion pulse modulated conditioning circuit using bidirectional power switches. This power converter can efficiently operate under a principle of active zero voltage clamped soft commutation for consumer induction heating (IH) fixing roller for copy machine and printer. This HFAC direct power frequency converter defined as resonant high frequency PWM controlled power frequency converter using bidirectional switches is developed and evaluated in this paper for consumer IH fixing heat roller using industrial HFAC power supply. Its operating principle is described on the basis of switching mode equivalent circuits during switching one cycle period. It is evaluated on the basis of its simulation and experimental results on the performances of HFAC direct power frequency converter treated here including various duty factor control variable vs. HFAC power regulation characteristics as well as zero voltage soft switching ranges.

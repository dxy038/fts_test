Historically, the load management, and now demand-side management (DSM), literature has been dominated by system economic and end user analyses of system peaks such as [1], [2], and [3]. Much of this work has not considered the impacts DSM will have on the T&amp;D system loads and losses. Recently, there has been more attention paid to this aspect. Davis, et al [4] quantified the impact on the T&amp;D system with actual distribution impacts, and Willis, et al [5] with detailed modeling. The work performed by the authors was the result of a research project that had the objective to evaluate the impact of certain state-of-the-art and future technologies on improving T&amp;D system efficiency. Load management, which was evaluated as demand-side management in the study, was one of many evaluated. This paper describes the method used to evaluate the impacts of DSM on T&amp;D system loads and losses. The paper also includes a discussion of its application to a sample system.

Wet agglomeration mechanisms developing in low shear mixers have been described considering a fractal morphogenesis process that links the median size of the agglomerates with their solid volume fraction via a fractal dimension. It appears fundamental to integrate the polydispersity of the generated structures (nuclei, agglomerates, dough pieces) in the analysis of the agglomeration process in order to approach the industrial problems. The objective of this study is to correlate the influence of the physicochemical characteristics of several liquid binders, on the fractal agglomeration mechanisms. To do so, we considered the values of the fractal model parameters. The obtained results confirmed that semolina wet agglomeration follows a fractal morphogenesis for the different applied liquid binders. Our results also showed a marked influence of the studied physicochemical properties of the liquid binder on the value of the fractal model parameters. During wet agglomeration in low shear mixers, the mechanisms implied during agglomeration (wetting, nucleation and growth) do not occur consecutively, but they coexist throughout at each water contents.

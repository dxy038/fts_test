The wind energy generation is the huge driver behind the push for supergrids and cross-border infrastructure for renewable energy systems into smart grids. To provide balance supply, demand, and storage of energy over a region in a much more efficient manner than it is done today, smart grids will need to use an advanced communication infrastructure into a robust control system. Towards this objective, it is proposed in this paper a wireless coding power control employing low density parity check coding to improve system robustness and reliability. For variable speed operation, the wind energy system uses a doubly-fed induction generator and a neuro-fuzzy controller. The performance improvements of the proposed system are investigated in different propagation conditions.

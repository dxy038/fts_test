The formulation of a wide variety of image recovery
problems leads to the minimization of a convex objective over
a convex set representing the constraints derived from a priori
knowledge and consistency with the observed signals. In recent
years, nondifferentiable objectives have become popular due in
part to their ability to capture certain features such as sharp edges.
They also arise naturally in minimax inconsistent set theoretic
recovery problems. At the same time, the issue of developing
reliable numerical algorithms to solve such convex programs
in the context of image recovery applications has received little
attention. In this paper, we address this issue and propose an
adaptive level set method for nondifferentiable constrained image
recovery. The asymptotic properties of the method are analyzed
and its implementation is discussed. Numerical experiments
illustrate applications to total variation and minimax set theoretic
image restoration and denoising problems.

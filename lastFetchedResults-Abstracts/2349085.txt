Heating control of an ice-free anemometer can be challenging especially when the objective of the control is to minimize the power consumption. The novel meteorological probe presented in this paper is a first step towards a fully integrated probe for anemometer heating control purposes. This proof of concept is a heating cylinder that, when used in conjunction with a wind sensor, an outside temperature probe and a computing unit, can provide accurate information on the presence of conditions prone to icing. This information can then be used to turn on the heating power required by the anemometer to stay ice free and/or to monitor the risk of icing at a given site.

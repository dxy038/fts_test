This study addresses a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) generation system. In order to make the PV generation system more flexible and expandable, the backstage power circuit is composed of a high step-up converter and a pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) inverter. In the dc-dc power conversion, the high step-up converter is introduced to improve the conversion efficiency of conventional boost converters and to allow the parallel operation of low-voltage PV modules. Moreover, an adaptive total sliding-mode control system is designed for the current control of the PWM inverter to maintain the output current with a higher power factor and less variation under load changes. In addition, an adaptive step-perturbation method is proposed to achieve the objective of maximum power point tracking, and an active sun tracking scheme without any light sensors is investigated to make PV plates face the sun directly in order to capture maximum irradiation and enhance system efficiency. Experimental results are given to verify the validity of the high step-up converter, the PWM inverter control, the ASP method, and the active sun tracker for a grid-connected PV generation system.

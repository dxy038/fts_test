Summary form only given. The objective of our research is to introduce a second-order optical nonlinearity (/spl chi//sup (2)/) in phosphate glasses via the thermal poling technique, in order to enable the fabrication of integrated waveguide frequency-doubled lasers. The induced second order nonlinearities were measured via second harmonic generation using a fundamental beam from a 1064 nm mode locked Nd:YAG laser. We measure the phase-mismatch for SHG in phosphate glasses at 1064 nm.

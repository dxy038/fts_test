Local government of Khanate of Yerevan (1160-1243AH.) was formed at the geopolitical zone of former Chokhur Saad of Safavi government. The political life of this Khanate was always under the threat of neighboring governments such as Georgian government. Undoubtedly, this situation diverted the governor of Yerevan, Hossein Ali Khan towards the third power so that his political independence can be maintained. In fact, the formation of relations between Khanate of Yerevan and peripheral powers was due to political considerations and mutual interests. However, relations of Khan of Yerevan with neighboring governments were not always stable, since the only recognized objective for the Khanate of Yerevan was to preserve its domain and governance over a limited and localized region through utilization of any measures or means. The aim of present research is to study the political and military relations of Khanate of Yerevan and Georgians and the role of peripheral powers about the conflict of Khanate of Yerevan and Georgians in the south Caucasus region on the rule of Hossein Ali Khan Ziyad Oglu Qajar Yerevani. The findings show that the causes of political and military interference of peripheral governments in the internal affairs of Khanate of Yerevan were emerged due to the commercial and strategic characteristics of Yerevan and its unique geopolitical configuration in the commercial routes and crossways of south Caucasus region. The main objective of Khanate of Yerevan was to exploit dissension of local powers of Caucasus region in favor of preserving its local governance.

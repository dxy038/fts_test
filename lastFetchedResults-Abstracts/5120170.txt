Demand Response (DR) has gained importance in the recent years. The prime objective of DR is to reduce the maximum demand. There are various DR schemes. This study focuses on price based DR schemes in which consumer is motivated to change his load demand pattern by pricing based incentives. The paper presents an algorithm to solve the load scheduling problem under variable pricing scheme. To this end the paper formulates the load scheduling problem as a singe stage decision making problem and solves it using Pursuit Algorithm, which maintains an agreeable balance between exploration and exploitation. An algorithm to generate realistic loads is also presented. Simulation experiments were conducted considering different types of loads and pricing.

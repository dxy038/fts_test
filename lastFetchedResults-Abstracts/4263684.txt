The continuous proliferation in modern communication technologies towards a pervasive composite environment prescribes a profound shift in telecommunication management and poses new challenges, in terms of proposing key solutions for the management and support of legacy as well as emerging systems. Driven by these advances, a direct requirement lies in providing an advanced configuration system that will embrace the demands for optimal and adaptive configuration and reconfiguration of the underlying layers. This objective can be achieved by upgrading the capabilities of mobile equipment with the introduction of a configuration system that incorporates advanced features such as policy-based decision making mechanisms and protocol layer adaptation and reconfiguration procedures. This contribution exploits protocol reconfiguration schemes for policy-based equipment management as addressed in the E<sup>2</sup>R environment.

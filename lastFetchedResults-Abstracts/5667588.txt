The objective of this paper is to contribute with the researchs on the mapping of the electric fields in transmission lines using the Charge Simulation Method in a 500 kV transmission line. The modulus of the electric field is calculated at a 1 meter height for all the Right-of-Way. The mapping is performed for a space between towers and considers that the arrow of the conductors occurs in the middle of this distance, what provides a computacional result in which the profile of the electric field can be analysed.

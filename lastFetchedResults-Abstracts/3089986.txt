Pilling segmentation is a key step in fabric pilling objective evaluation. Existed image processing based pilling segmentation methods often use certain information and can be used in relevant kind fabric. So the systemÂ´s practicability is not good. We use EdgeFlow algorithm for pilling segmentation, which integrates several kinds of information. Experiment results show that the segmentation effect is satisfactory. It can improve the practicability of fabric pilling objective evaluation system.

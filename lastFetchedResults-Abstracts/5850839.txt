Direct supply chain logistics is an essential part in all industries to acquire raw materials and deliver products to customer at the optimal time and at minimal cost to ensure customersÂ´ satisfaction. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the importance of reverse logistics, logistics management system products recovered by the company, with regard to recycling, recovery and other forms of product returns from customer to producer and its integration into the direct supply chain. And as such, the objective of this paper will be to create a mathematical model to measure the minimal rates of return for a beneficial introduction of reverse logistics in a direct chain. The first part of the article presents the problems studied. The second part describes the literature review of reverse logistics. The third part highlights the interest of this study in the industrial field. The fourth part shows the different steps of the proposed mathematical model and its application to a case study followed by an analysis of the results obtained. The latter represent the conclusion and the research opportunities of this paper.

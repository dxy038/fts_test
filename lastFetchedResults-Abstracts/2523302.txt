Holographic organization design according to the five elements of capacity building dynamic, holistic environment, efficient human capital, Increasing selfmanagement and smart structure is intended to crystallize the quality of the learning abilities in all components so that the selfregulation system and the ability to recontinuously be used.In this paper the main causes of holographic depth theoretical principles derived and then using the Delphi technique and scoring twentythree factors extracted by exploratory factor analysis identified five new components and were named. These components could cover 87% of the factors affecting the holographic design. However, due to the combination (quantity and quality) of research methodology, statistical population of teachers and administrators of Payam Noor University were selected. This study of exploratory nature, the fundamental objective is applied and descriptive survey method to verify the validity of the experts and a comprehensive table of explained variance was used. Cronbach alpha reliability of the instrument to "0.964" was approved. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the hypotheses. The findings show that Payam Noor Universityexcept dynamic capacity building in other components compatible with the organization's Holographic and in this case it is recommended that Android owners mechanisms such as doubleloop learning, develop work teams, systems thinking and dynamic synergies for increased capacitybuilding component in Payam Noor University use.

Multi-channel neural signal recordings need high data compression and efficient data transmission. Our previous work has shown a practical data compression solution based on discrete wavelet transform, multi-level thresholding and run length encoding. This paper presents a custom designed communication protocol for bidirectional data telemetry to and from the implanted module. A global controller is also presented which configures, operates and unites all the modules together effectively and efficiently into a 32-channel system. Performance of the communication protocol and the compression engine is analyzed.

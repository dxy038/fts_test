An emerging requirement to sift through the increasing flood of multilingual text available electronically has led to the pressing demand for effective multilingual information filtering. In this paper, a content-based approach to multilingual information filtering is proposed. This approach is capable of screening and evaluating multilingual documents based on their semantic content. As such, relevant multilingual documents are disseminated according to their corresponding themes/topics to facilitate both efficient and effective content-based information access. The objective of alleviating usersÂ´ burden of information overload is thus achieved. This approach is realized by incorporating fuzzy clustering and fuzzy inference techniques.

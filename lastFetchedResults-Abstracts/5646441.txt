The objective of this paper is to provide a mathematical framework for building reliable control using less reliable controllers. The new ingredient in the design is the multiple control system which provides the necessary redundancy for reliability enhancement in control systems subject to controller failures. The proposed reliability design is based upon the decentralized control schemes used so far for synthesizing reliable control systems subject to perturbations in the plant interconnection structure.

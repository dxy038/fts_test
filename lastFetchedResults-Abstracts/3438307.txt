A refined ray system based on the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) for an object embedded in soil for a monostatic transmitter-receiver alignment is presented. Apart from the investigation of the ldquoclassicalrdquo reflections from the target, creeping waves are also taken into account, and their formalism is presented. The objective of such a ray set is to better understand the different scattering mechanisms, which are presented in the complex scattering framework. In electromagnetic modeling based on GTD, the complex shape of a target is replaced by simpler canonical objects, e.g., facets, cones, wedges, spheres, or cylinders. Here, a cylinder is located in parallel and closely to the plane interface of two dielectric half-spaces. The example of air-soil is taken into account. The numerical results obtained for various directions of incidence are employed to describe the polarimetric characteristics of the diffracted field from grazing to perpendicular incidence to the surface. By representing the diffracted GTD field on the Poincare sphere, the location on the sphere has a one-to-one relationship to the dielectric properties of the soil. The relation can be employed to extract information as the soil moisture.

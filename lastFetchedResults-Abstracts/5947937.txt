Future mobile multimedia devices require higher playback levels. Conventional approaches to loudspeaker compensation based on the Volterra model improve the sound quality only at low playback levels and may introduce more distortion at high sound levels. This paper presents a new Volterra-Wiener-Hammerstein model that is a better match to the loudspeaker response and lends itself to having an exact nonlinear inverse. Simulations and real measurements show that compensation based on the new model greatly reduces the linear and nonlinear distortions of small loudspeakers mounted in cell phones. Objective and subjective evaluations show drastic improvements (0.8 PESQ) in the sound quality

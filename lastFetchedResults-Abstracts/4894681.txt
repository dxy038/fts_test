Design of cyber-physical systems poses new challenges. Design at the level of a whole cyber-physical system includes design issues such as formal and abstract specification, design space exploration, optimization, and verification. A particular challenge is the formal and abstract representation of whole cyber-physical systems including both physical and cyber components. The objective of this paper is to show ways to unify process networks in order to enable representation of cyber-physical systems within the above mentioned design issues.

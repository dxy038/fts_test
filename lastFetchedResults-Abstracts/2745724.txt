Hybrid ac/dc microgrids usually utilize an active front-end (AFE) converter between the ac microgrid and the dc microgrid. The advantages of the AFE converter are bidirectional power flow and low total harmonic distortion of the line current. However, the reliability of the AFE converter is rarely respected. This paper proposes a diode rectifier with auxiliary converter for hybrid ac/dc microgrids. The diode rectifier with auxiliary converter realizes the same functionality as the AFE converter with high reliability and low cost. The simulation and test results are presented to validate the performances of the proposed scheme.

Phonetic segmentation plays a key role in developing various speech applications. In this work, we propose to use various features for automatic phonetic segmentation task for forced Viterbi alignment and compare their effectiveness. We propose to use novel multiscale fractal dimension-based features concatenated with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). The novel features are expected to capture additional nonlinearities in speech production which should improve the performance of segmentation task. However, to evaluate effectiveness of these segmentation algorithms, we require manual accurate phoneme-level labeled data which is not available for low resource languages such as Gujarati (a low resource language and one of the official languages of India). In order to measure effectiveness of various segmentation algorithms, HMM-based speech synthesis system (HTS) for Gujarati have been built. From the subjective and objective evaluations, it is observed that FD-based features for segmentation work moderately better than other state-of-the-art features such as MFCC, Perceptual Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (PLP-CC), Cochlear Filter Cepstral Coefficients (CFCC), and RelAtive SpecTrAl (RASTA)-based PLP-CC. The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and the Degraded-MOS, which are the measures of naturalness indicate an improvement of 9.69% with the proposed features from the MFCC (which is found to be the best among the other features) based features.

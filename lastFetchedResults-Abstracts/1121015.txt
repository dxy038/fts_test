Background & Objective To assess the extent of L. monocytogenes in causation of human spontaneous abortions by isolation methods and PCR analysis for the presence of actA and InlB genes.

Methods : In this descriptive study, vaginal swabs were collected from 96 women with spontaneous abortions who referred to Tehran`s hospitals. The samples were cultured in to Listeria specific media (PALCAM agar). Then , the Listeria genus was verified by differentiation  biochemical tests, such as, haemolysis on Blood agar, Catalase and Oxidase reaction, motility at room temperature. PCR test was performed on all samples and detected the actA and InlB genes of L. monocytogenes.

Results : In culture, 7 of 96 samples were positive for L.monocytogenes.                                     in PCR technique, actA and InlB genes were detected from 12 and 2 vaginal samples,  respectively.

Conclusions : The occurrence of pathogenic L. monocytogenes in cases of spontaneous abortions was 12.5%. It seems that the actA and InlB genes have an important roles as essential virulences determinant in pathogenic L.monocytogenes. The results show the PCR method is more sensitive, easier and faster than culture to detect L.monocytogenes.

In this thesis, the visual information processing systems design and efficiency criteria are discussed. The visual information processing systems (VIPS) are the component of the automatizated control and inspection systems. The important direction in the development of VIPS is a design of the adaptive systems, which are capable of changing its parameters depending on varied inspection conditions. At such approach there is an objective necessity in designing of the automatizated systems which uses image processing and technical vision system.

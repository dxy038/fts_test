In this paper the impact of distributed generation and adverse weather on distribution network reliability is studied. This paper illustrates a distribution network reliability calculation model that considering act of weather and DG, and the maximum economic benefits was used as objective function to determine the island. Then improves the minimal path method of the traditional reliability calculation and makes it suit to calculate the distribution network with weather and DG. Program was divided into four types: without DG and weather, only DG, Only weather, both DG and weather, calculated and compared load points, feeders and system reliability indices of the four types. The calculating results indicate that the reliability of distribution network was reduced when considering weather factors, especially in adverse weather conditions, and improved in the island when DG connected. Considering both of DG and weather, the reliability of distribution network were more accurate response actual and proved the validity of the model.

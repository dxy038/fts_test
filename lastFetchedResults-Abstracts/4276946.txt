Iron and steel enterprises must carry on the positive innovations, organize production reasonably, in order to further reduce costs and enhance the competitive advantages of enterprises. Taken Steel Corporation as the background and in view of the reality of iron and steel enterprises that flow of raw materials is big and logistics organization of raw materials is inefficient, the article puts forward the management model of logistics equilibrium early warning. With the objective of logistics equilibrium and regarding the inventory of raw materials of industrial port as coupling points of internal raw materials supply logistics, introduce early warning method to implement early warning for inventory of raw materials. Through a high-limit warning to promote the priority of mixing ratio and a low -limit warning to draw the front ship unloaded, interior logistics organization of Steel Corporation Industrial Port is optimized, which makes the interior logistics of the industrial port operate smoothly.

In the Parisi theory of spin glasses, the limiting free energy of the system is computed by
optimizing over a “functional order parameter”. In mathematical terms this amounts to construct
certain functions F( ) of a probability measure   on [0, 1] and to compute the infimum over
 . The study of the maps    → F( ) is a challenging problem of functional analysis. Progress
on this problem seems required for further advances in the theory of spin glasses. The main
objective of this paper is to explain the functional analysis part of the problems to the reader
with no background (or interest) in spin glasses. As a first step in the study of these functions
F( ), we prove certain differentiability properties, that allow in certain cases to interpret (as
conjectured by physicists) the Parisi measure (i.e. the probability   at which F( ) is minimum)
in terms of spin glasses.

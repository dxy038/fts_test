Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) constitutes the platform of a broad range of applications related to surveillance such as military, and environmental monitoring. In these fields, the deployment of WSN to support optimal coverage is obviously a fastidious task, especially when a multiple coverage is needed. In this paper, we present a multi-objective constraints optimization approach for solving the above issue. Therefore, we investigate two main ideas: First, a pre-processing step with field analysis in three dimensions (3D) environment. Second, a robust based-constraint modeling approach with multi-objective function. Experimental results are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

Generally, planning and configuring cellular radio networks lead to multi-objective optimization problems with conflicting objectives, e.g., coverage and cost. In this paper, we present an approach to combine those opponents in a closed-form objective for maximization of operator profit by means of joint base station and relay station placement in 4G multi-hop relay networks. The corresponding optimization model is formulated as mixed-integer linear program and particularly considers allocation of limited bandwidth for downlink data transmission in non-cooperative relaying mode. We suggest two economically motivated options how to choose appropriate weights for combining the conflicting objectives linearly. Furthermore, we apply the proposed optimization model to an exemplary planning scenario to analyze sensitivity to weight modifications numerically.

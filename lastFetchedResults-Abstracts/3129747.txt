For multi-objective optimization problems, we introduced IPAGA (Improved Parallel Adaptive Genetic Algorithm) in this paper, a new parallel genetic algorithm which is based on Pareto Front. In this Algorithm, the non-dominated-set is constructed by the method of exclusion. The evolution population adopts the adaptive-crossover and adaptive-mutation probability, which can adjust the search scope according to solution quality. The results show that the parallel genetic algorithm developed in this paper is efficient.

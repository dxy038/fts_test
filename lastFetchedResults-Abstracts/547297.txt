The fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis begins to function by midgestation and is matured in the term infant at delivery. If fetal hypothyroidism develops effects may be demonstrated in certain organ systems, including the central nervous system and skeleton.neonatal screening of hypothyroidism is one of the preventive programs that cost-benifit is positive.
Methods: In this study, we analized the data obtained retrospectively from CH screening from all of the health centers in Kurdistan, Iran from January 2006 to June 2008.
Results: From the 50539 neonates referred for CH screening 122 neonates were diagnosed with CH, showing an overall incidence of 1/414 live birth.
In 50539 screened neonate 24806 were girls (49.1%) and 25733 (50.9%) were boys. Over all 49576 neonate have TSH<5 and 777 neonate have 5<TSH<9.9 and 175 neonate have TSH>10. Screening coverage was 97% of live birth and 122 neonate recognized with CH. Of these, 118 were treated before 28th day of bith, 4 neonates were treated in 28-40. Positive predictive value of this screening test was overall 13.3%. Conclusion: The incidence of CH in Kurdistan province seems high.

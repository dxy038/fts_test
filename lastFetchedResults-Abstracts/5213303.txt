A matrix converter to directly connect a three-phase load to a three-phase power source using eighteen IGBTs and eighteen fast diodes is presented in this paper. The IGBTs are connected in a common-emitter (CE) configuration by versatile blocks, able to be used in other topologies such as sparse matrix converters and conventional matrix converters. The matrix converter allows many advantages compared to the conventional voltage or current source inverters. It does not require energy storage components as a bulky capacitor or an inductance in the DC-link and enables the bidirectional power flow between the power supply and load. The indirect modulation technique is adopted, since a dc-link without capacitive elements is established. The modulation technique adopted is able to provide practically sinusoidal waveforms of the input and output currents with negligible harmonics amplitude, with input displacement factor control. Some design and implementation details of a 1 kW three-phase to three-phase, as well, a complete theoretical description with simulation results of the design implementation are offered.

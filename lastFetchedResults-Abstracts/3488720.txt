A pilot-aided scheme is proposed for the joint estimation and tracking of channel impulse response (CIR), carrier frequency offset (CFO) and sampling frequency offset (SFO) in burst mode, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing(OFDM) systems. First, a received signal model that takes into account nonlinear CFO/SFO effects is formulated. Then, based on the derived signal model and the received multicarrier signal samples containing the pilot tones in the frequency domain, an objective function that includes MIMO CIR, CFO, and SFO is introduced to develop a vector recursive-least-square (RLS)-based joint channel estimation and synchronization algorithm. The analysis and simulation results show that, over the large ranges of the CFO and SFO values, the proposed estimation and tracking scheme offers fast convergence, high stability, and a near-optimum receiver performance that is remarkably close to the ideal performance in the case of perfect channel estimation and synchronization over quasi-static Rayleigh multipath fading channels.

For the past few decades, Chinese cheap goods have occupied a substantial share of consumption markets in different countries such as Iran. In this regard, one of challenging questions is what are the causes and factors responsible for Chinese goods to be so cheap?
A possible answer to this question is that china's exploitation of its labor comparative advantage in production as well as exports of labor_ intensive goods. In this study, rapid growth of Chinese exports during the last three decades is explained by using Heckscher- Ohlin Theory. To achieve this objective, china's input-output table, which is compiled in the year 2000 is used to compute the production factor content of exports and imports of Chinese goods. Then, Using Leontief and Learner tests, it is shown that china has comparative advantage in labor- intensive exporting goods.

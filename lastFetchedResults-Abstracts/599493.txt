The objective of this paper is to investigate the best solution such that on which decision should be made to forward a wireless packet. The decision should be made in such a way to keep the node alive by choosing an alternate path, through those nodes that have more power reserve. Minimizing the consumption of the reserve power will results in an increase in the number of hops the packet must travel. A hybrid solution can be utilized which is a combination of power-aware and minimizing the number of hops to be traveled. Recent research suggests that it should select the node with high power reserve than based on the shortest path. A question arises which is more critical for ad hoc networks the power-aware solution or the shortest path based on the number of hops. This research will investigate these solutions aiming on minimizing power consumption for wireless packets networks and the number of hops to be traveled. Through rigorous empirical analysis based on the p-method and box-space method, we were able to derive critical global properties with respect to end-to-end minimum power consumption routes. Finally, a simulation results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms.

Background and Objective: Due to progress in treatment, the average survival rate of the colorectal cancer (CRC) patients has been steady increasing in recent decades.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival rate and affecting demographic factors in the Iranian patients with colorectal cancer.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 243 cases of CRC patients, whom were referred to the registration center of Namazi Hospital in Shiraz (2003-2008), were included to the study.  Collected data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier, Log rank, and Cox regression models using the SPSS version 16 software.
Results: The mean follow up time of the patients was 35.4 Â±37.49 months.  The overall 1, 3, and 5-year survival rates were estimated as 93.9%, 50.3%, and 27.2%, respectively.  The Cox regression model revealed that there were some significant correlations between the income status, initial detection method, alcohol consumption, initial treatment strategy, and metastases and the overall survival rate.
Conclusion: Despite the progress in treatment, the average CRC survival rate in Iran is lower than developed countries.

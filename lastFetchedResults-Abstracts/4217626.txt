The application of Switched Ethernet is becoming more and more popular on the platforms of ships and aircrafts. On such specific platforms, Switched Ethernet is greatly appreciated by its low-cost and flexibility, meanwhile, its real-time performance is greatly challenged. Therefore, evaluation of Switched EthernetÂ´s performance, that is, a reliable analysis on its real-time performance, plays a very important role in the network designing. The objective of this paper is to conduct a modelling and simulation on the Switched Ethernet, combining with the characteristics of the application on such platforms. The paper presents an evalutaion of the performance by the method of modelling and a comparison between the modelling dimensions and the collected data from the real network. Also this paper conduct a analysis on the real-time quality of the Switched Ethernet.

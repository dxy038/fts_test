Fungal conidia are disseminated, often in the air, for a certain period of time, prior to contaminating food products. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of the relative humidity, RH (%), time (day), and temperature (°C) during this period of time, called “storage”, on the germination time, τ (h), of Aspergillus carbonarius and Penicillium chrysogenum. A Doehlert design was used in the range, 20–100% RH, 2–28 days, and 5–25 °C. As compared to un-stored conidia, the germination time of conidia stored at 60% RH, 15 days, 5 °C was increased by 23 and 28%, for A. carbonarius and P. chrysogenum, respectively. Stored conidia exhibited a minimum τ value at 60% RH, and 100% RH for A. carbonarius and P. chrysogenum, respectively. For these species, τ was minimum for 2 days of storage. The effect of temperature was RH dependent for A. carbonarius. The germination time of stored conidia was clearly greater than that of fresh conidia obtained in the laboratory. This result should be taken into account to determine the mould free shelf-life of food products.

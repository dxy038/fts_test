In this work, we focus on the problem of virtual machines (VMs) placement in geographically distributed data centers, where tenants may require a set of networking VMs. The aim of the present work is to plan and optimize the placement of tenantÂ´s VMs in a distributed Cloud environment while considering location and system performance constraints. Thus, we propose ILP formulations which have as objective the minimization of traffic generated by networking VMs and circulating on the backbone network. The different experiments conducted on the proposed formulations show the effectiveness of our model for large-scale Cloud systems in terms of running time and computational resources.

This paper reports the results of employing an artificial bee colony search algorithm for synthesizing a mutually coupled lumped-parameter ladder-network representation of a transformer winding, starting from its measured magnitude frequency response. The existing bee colony algorithm is suitably adopted by appropriately defining constraints, inequalities, and bounds to restrict the search space and thereby ensure synthesis of a nearly unique ladder network corresponding to each frequency response. Ensuring near-uniqueness while constructing the reference circuit (i.e., representation of healthy winding) is the objective. Furthermore, the synthesized circuits must exhibit physical realizability. The proposed method is easy to implement, time efficient, and problems associated with the supply of initial guess in existing methods are circumvented. Experimental results are reported on two types of actual, single, and isolated transformer windings (continuous disc and interleaved disc).

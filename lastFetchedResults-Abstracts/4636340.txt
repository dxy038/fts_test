A genetic algorithm to find the optimal location and sizing of shunt FACTS devices is used to optimize a multi-objective problem, which is formed by first swing stability margin and voltage stability margin. The first swing stability margin is determined by analyzing the output results of the conventional time domain simulation method, basically, machine angles and speeds. On the other hand, the voltage stability margin or loading margin is calculated using continuous power flow. The analysis is done for critical contingencies that cause problems both for voltage stability and first swing stability margin. In order to achieve the objective proposed, the location and sizing of shunt FACTS devices are optimized simultaneously. The method is tested on a 68 bus system.

Synchronous elastic circuits help synchronous designs tolerate computation or communication latencies, in a way similar to the asynchronous design style. The datapath is made elastic by turning registers into elastic buffers and adding a control layer that uses handshake signals and join/fork controllers. Join elements are the objective of two improvements discussed in this paper. The first one is an elegant implementation of input by passable queues obtained by retiming one of the latches of the elastic buffer which follows the join controller. The second one enlarges the set of cases in which unneeded input tokens are discarded in join controllers with early evaluation. Their impact on throughput are discussed by means of examples representative of typical topologies and of a realistic processor datapath. Their area and power costs are evaluated on a 45 nm CMOS technology.

The objective of this work is to investigate the spray characteristics of a fuel injection nozzle. The analysis is performed by means of a framework which exploits different image processing techniques to provide spray-related data to the operator. Innovative metrics are introduced to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme. Experimental results show that it is possible to automatically get useful information about the spray distribution, asymmetries and key properties together with the capability to measure significant angles and other information to detect anomalies in the injection system.

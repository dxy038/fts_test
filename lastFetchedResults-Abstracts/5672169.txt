Images taken with wide-angle cameras tend to have severe distortions which pull points towards the optical center. This paper proposes a method for recovering the distortion parameters without the use of any calibration objects. The distortions cause straight lines in the scene to appear as curves in the image. Our algorithm seeks to find the distortion parameters that would map the image curves to straight lines. The user selects a small set of points along the image curves. Recovery of the parameters is formulated as the minimization of an objective function which is designed to explicitly account for noise in the selected image points. Experimental results are presented for synthetic data with different noise levels as well as for real images. Once calibrated, the image streams from these cameras can be undistorted in real time using look up tables. We also present an application of this calibration method for wide-angle camera clusters, which we call polycameras. We apply our distortion correction technique to a polycamera with four wide-angle cameras to create a high resolution 360 degree panorama in real-time

In recent years several attempts were undertaken to repair damaged reinforced concrete structures. Studies on the effectiveness of repaired and strengthened reinforced concrete elements which fail primarily due to formation of major flexural cracks are somewhat limited [1]. The overall objective of the present work is to investigate the effect of tension reinforcement percentage on flexural behavior of repaired beams. The method of repair is conventional &amp; steel fiber. From the results obtained, it was found that the percentage of tension reinforcement appeared to have effect on the flexural behavior of repaired beams. The results indicated that the repairing efficiencies of the beams decrease within the range (135.2% to 129.2%) as &#961; increases within the range (0.59% to 1.191%). The repaired beams had higher strength than the original beams.

The precision of traditional power system state estimation (SE) based on supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) is low. This paper aims to construct a SE objective function combined with the constraints of zero-injection nodes and wide area measurement system (WAMS) in order to improve the precision of SE, in the WAMS/SCADA hybrid system. The optimal estimation can be derived from the SE objective function with double constraints by the optimization theory of Lagrange multipliers method. A standard test system has been used to prove the efficiency and the real-time performance of the proposed method, the precision is improved and the real-time performance is similar in the certain scope comparing with the traditional SE method.

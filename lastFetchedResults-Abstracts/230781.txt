An optimization procedure based on the tabu search (TS) method was developed for the design of radial enrichment and gadolinia distributions for boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel lattices. The procedure was coded in a computing system in which the optimization code uses the tabu search method to select potential solutions and the HELIOS code to evaluate them. The goal of the procedure is to search for an optimal fuel utilization, looking for a lattice with minimum average enrichment, with minimum deviation of reactivity targets and with a local power peaking factor (PPF) lower than a limit value. Time-dependent-depletion (TDD) effects were considered in the optimization process. The additive utility function method was used to convert the multiobjective optimization problem into a single objective problem. A strategy to reduce the computing time employed by the optimization was developed and is explained in this paper. An example is presented for a 10Ã—10 fuel lattice with 10 different fuel compositions. The main contribution of this study is the development of a practical TDD optimization procedure for BWR fuel lattice design, using TS with a multiobjective function, and a strategy to economize computing time.

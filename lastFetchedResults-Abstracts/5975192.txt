A versatile cardiovascular analysis system based on a Macintosh II personal computer is described. The use of a framegrabber makes it available to a wide range of clinical image acquisition equipment. The clinician is offered a powerful tool for diagnosis of coronary artery diseases. Morphologic studies and objective quantitative analysis of coronary occlusions and assessment of their functional severity can be of great help in the stratification of patients at risk. An almost real-time environment will make it possible for the cardiologist to quickly respond to the impact of such interventions as PTCA or angiopyroplasty while the patient is still in the catheterization room

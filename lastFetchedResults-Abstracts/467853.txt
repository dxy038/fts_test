OBJECTIVE: We sought to construct an ultrasonography-based growth curve in a Chinese population. STUDY DESIGN: Routine ultrasonographic examination was performed in 5496 normal pregnancies (>95% first births) in five obstetric ultrasonography laboratories in Central-South China from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 1993. RESULTS: All the fetal growth measures increased with gestational age, whereas the ratios either decreased or remained constant across gestation. Biparietal diameter and cerebral hemispheric width were higher at early gestational ages, whereas femur length, thoracic circumference, and abdominal circumference were lower at later gestational ages in our study than in previous studies. The ratio of lateral ventricular width/cerebral hemispheric width was lower at an early gestational age but higher in later gestational ages in our study. CONCLUSIONS: A different standard of ultrasonography-based fetal growth is needed for different populations. The ultrasonography-based growth curve constructed in this large Chinese population provides an additional tool for the evaluation of fetal growth and development.

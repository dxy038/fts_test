Objective
The objective of the study was to characterize the vascular anatomy over the superior pubic ramus.
Study design
Detailed dissections of the retropubic space were performed in 15 fresh female cadavers. Vessels crossing the superior pubic rami were inspected for width, course, communications, and relationship to the midline of the pubic symphysis and the obturator canal.
Results
Vessels 1 mm or greater in width connecting the obturator vessels and inferior epigastric or external iliac vessels were noted in 10 of 15 (66.7%) cadavers: 9 (60%) had veins, 5 (33.3 %) had arteries, and 4 (26.7%) had both. In all specimens, the vessels crossed over the superior pubic rami lateral to or at the level of the obturator canal, which was on average 5.4 cm from the midline of the pubic symphysis.
Conclusion
Communicating vessels crossing the superior pubic rami were present in the majority of specimens. Understanding this anatomy should aid the surgeon in avoiding vascular complications.

This article presents an application of the methodology for the task-based optimal design of drive-train of industrial robots used in a novel mechanism for press tending robot application in press line automation. The methodology is based on task-based robot Mechatronic system simulation and analysis as well as multi-objective optimization. To further improve the cycle time performance of the system to achieve superior press line performance, a quantitative relationship between the press line performance and the drive-train design of the industrial robots as function of weight of the crossbar, is investigated using task-based design and robot Mechatronic system simulation as well as multi-objective optimization. Results of this work have clearly demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of this approach and the insight obtained on how the weight of the crossbar affects the relationship between the robot performance requirement and robot drive-train design.

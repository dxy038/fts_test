Analysis of video codecs is one of the most relevant tasks for development of video codecs, video quality control from customer side, choice of codecs and for many other areas. A new method of analysis based on objective quality measures is proposed in this article. The testing of real video codecs carried out in this study confirms that the proposed technique can be used for analysis of both video codecs as a whole and separate algorithms of bitrate management. The second part of the article is devoted to one of directions for development of video codecs, namely videoconferencing and effective application of them by outsourcing companies.

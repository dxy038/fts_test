The objective of this effort is to further the fundamental understanding of radiated noise emissions from consumer electronic products. A phase and time coherent method for measuring the near-fields of a device given wideband-radiating sources is used. Site sources normally used to verify chambers are chosen for this research. The design and characterization of near-field probes to perform simultaneous E-and H-field measurements is presented. A fast Fourier transform based near-field to far-field transformation of the planar near-field data is implemented. HFSS<sup>TM</sup> (High Frequency Structure Simulator) simulations are used as benchmark for this study.

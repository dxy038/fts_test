Objective: Foeniculum vulgare seed (F. vulgare) is a herbal plant which is used with phytoestrogene compounds for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treatment. In this research, renoprotective effect of the aqueous extract of Foeniculum vulgare (AEF) in experimental PCOS female rats is studied. Materials and Methods: Forty female rats were randomly divided into five groups. The first group served as control,was injected with an equivalent volume (0.2 ml) of normal saline, and received normal diet. Animals in the second group were non poly cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) rats which were treated with intragastric administration of aqueous extract of F. vulgare (150 mg/kg b.w.). In the third group, the rats were treated with intraperitoneal injection of estradiolvalerate (EV) (4 mg in 0.2 ml of sesame oil). The fourth groups were treated with EV and AEF (150mg/kg bw) with the same route. Â The fifth groups were treated with EV and AEF (100mg/kg bw). After 4 weeks of study, all of the rats were sacrificed, their kidneys tissues were processed for light microscopy, and some biochemical parameters of serum were measured. Results: The mean values of blood urea nitrogen in PCOS rats treated with low dose of AEF and EV and non-treated, was significantly (p<0.05) increased compared with non-PCOS and PCOS rats treated with high dose of AEF. Moreover, histopathological changes of kidney samples were comparable in PCOS rats with respect to treated groups with AEF. Conclusion: Aqueous extract of fennel seed showed the beneficial effect (especially at dose of 150 mg/kg b.w.) on renal function in PCOS rats.

Objective
To assess primary school educator knowledge and opinions regarding fire-setting behaviors and burn-injury prevention education.
Design and setting
A written survey, consisting of 24 questions, was distributed to 8 primary schools. The survey was designed by our burn center personnel to assess basic knowledge and opinions. It was distributed to teachers by the school principals and completed surveys were collected by our staff.
Results
Twenty percent of elementary school educators surveyed had experience teaching burned children (mean age: 7 ± 3; range: 2–17); 8% had experience with children that were injured due to fire-play. Fire experimentation begins at 6.1 ± 2 years of age (range: 2–13). Educators believe students can benefit from a fire prevention curriculum beginning at 7.3 ± 1.8 years (range: 5–12). The average time requested for an elementary school burn-injury prevention program was 4 ± 3 h. Kindergarten teachers requested 8 h and fifth grade teachers asked for 3.3 h. Over 97% of elementary school teachers agree that discussions about the medical and social consequences of burns will reduce fire-play behavior in children.
Conclusions
Nearly all primary school educators surveyed agreed that burn injuries and attempting to curb fire-play are important societal issues. There was wide agreement that including a description of the medical and social consequences of burns in a preventive curriculum would enhance its efficacy. The younger students are, the more time teachers require to adequately convey fire safety instruction.

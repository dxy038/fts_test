Up to now, it has become a big problem for most institutions of higher learning in the experimental teaching of Industrial Engineering specialty for many apparent reasons, such as too expensive to buy logistics devices, update speed of devices getting faster and faster, too large bulk of devices to find an indoor place to settle them and so on. Therefore, a three-dimensional interactive storage laboratory system (TISLS) based on interactive virtual reality environment was built through taking the actual logistics lab as a background, which includes most useful modules such as teaching system, storage management teaching, sorting system teaching, RFID tally system and lab platform and so forth. The virtual logistics equipments are built by 3S software. These equipments are loaded to VimIPad and optimized. The files of the equipments are leaded into Java 3D scene via the loader interface. The interactive virtual assembly and the bidirectional drive between the virtual scene animation and the stocks are implemented by using the Java event-handling model, combined with the database technology. This method not only increased the modeling effective but also boosted up the verisimilitude of model. The instance indicates that the system is excellent in immersion and interaction.

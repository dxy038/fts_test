The objective of this paper is to quantify the microstructurally small fatigue crack growth of an extruded AZ61 magnesium alloy. Fully reversed and interrupted load-controlled tests were conducted on notched specimens that were taken from the material in the longitudinal and transverse orientations with respect to the extrusion direction. In order to measure crack growth, replicas of the notch surface were made using a dual-step silicon-rubber compound at periodic cyclic intervals. By using microscopic analysis of the replica surfaces, crack initiation sites from numerous locations and crack growth rates were determined. A marked acceleration/deceleration was observed to occur in cracks of smaller length scales due to local microheterogeneities consistent with prior observations of small fatigue crack interaction with the native microstructure and texture. Finally, a microstructure-sensitive multistage fatigue model was employed to estimate the observed crack growth behavior and fatigue life with respect to the microstructure with the most notable item being the grain orientation. The crack growth rate and fatigue life estimates are shown to compare well to published findings for pure magnesium single crystal atomistic simulations.

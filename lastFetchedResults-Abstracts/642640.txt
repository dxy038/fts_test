Objective
We evaluated whether insulin hypophagia and hypothalamic signaling are affected in adult rats exposed to intrauterine undernutrition.
Methods

Pregnant rats ate ad libitum throughout pregnancy and lactation (control, C) or 50% of control intake in the first 2 wk of pregnancy (restricted, R). Four-month-old C and R progeny received insulin or vehicle intracerebroventricular injections for evaluation of 24-h food intake, hypothalamic insulin receptor (IR), and IR substrate-1 (IRS-1) protein content and tyrosine phosphorylation, pp185 phosphorylation, and IRS-1 association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K).
Results

With respect to males, R males had normal body composition and insulin-induced hypophagia. IR protein levels were lower but IR phosphorylation was higher in R than in C males. IRS-1 levels and phosphorylation were similar between C and R males, insulin stimulated an IRS-1/PI3-K association in C but not in R males, and pp185 phosphorylation was higher in R than in C males. For females, body fat and serum leptin were elevated in R females. Insulin inhibited food intake in C but not in R females. Insulin-induced IR phosphorylation and protein levels of IR and IRS-1 were higher in R than in C females. However, IRS-1 and pp185 phosphorylation and IRS-1/PI3-K association were significantly stimulated by insulin in C but not in R females.
Conclusions

Female adult rats exposed to intrauterine undernutrition had increased adiposity, marked impairment of hypothalamic insulin signaling, and loss of insulin-induced hypophagia. These disturbances were less severe or even absent in male progeny. The findings show that female progeny are more susceptible than their male siblings to the effects of maternal malnutrition.

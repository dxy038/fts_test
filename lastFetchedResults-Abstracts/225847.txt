This paper presents an interactive fuzzy satisfying method for solving a general multi-objective single-tuned harmonic-filter planning problem by assuming that the decision-maker (DM) has imprecise or fuzzy goals for each of the objective functions. Through the interaction with DM, the fuzzy goals of the DM are quantified by eliciting corresponding membership functions. If the DM specifies a reference membership values, the mini-max problem is solved for generating a corresponding global noninferior solution for the DM's reference membership values. Then by considering the current values of the membership functions as well as the objectives, the DM acts on this solution by updating the reference membership values. The interactive procedure continues until the satisfying solution for the DM is obtained.

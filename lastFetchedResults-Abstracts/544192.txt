The main objective of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of group training based on transactional analysis affecting the aggressive behaviors of the girl students of grade one in high school in the city of Rasht. This experimental research was carried out on 40 individuals from those students who were rated "high" in aggression test(AGQ).this sample was selected through the phased random selection and it was divided in two equal groups(experiment and control group),randomly, Subsequently, the group training program was represented to the experiment group. The method of transactional analysis based on the assembly of concepts within 8 ninety- minute sessions for twice a week was used. During this period, no interference was imposed on the control group. Then after the end of training, the AGQ-test( post-test) was applied to both experi¬ment and control groups, simultaneously and under the identical circumstances, the obtained infor¬mation from the pre-test and post-test were analyzed using the statistical. T-test for the independent group and multivariable variance analysis of MANOVA. The additional obtained results suggested that there was a significant difference between the experiment and control groups(P=0.0001). In other words, the experimental interference(group training based on the transactional analysis has given rise to reduce the aggression and its components in experimental group.

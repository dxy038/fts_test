Background: Extraction of blood genomic DNA is one of the main approaches for clinical and molecular
biology studies. Although several methods have been developed for extraction of blood genomic DNA, most of
these methods consume long time and use expensive chemicals such as proteinase K and toxic organic solvent
such as phenol and chloroform. The objective of this study was to developed easy and safe method for DNA
extraction from clotted and frozen whole blood. This method has many advantages: time reducing, using
inexpensive materials, without phenol and chloroform, achieving of high molecular weight and good quality
genomic DNA.
Materials and Methods: DNA extraction was performed by two methods (new and phenol-chloroform
method). Then quantity and quality parameters were evaluated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, Nano drop
analysis and efficiency of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
Results: Extracted DNA from 500?L of blood samples were 457.7ng/?l and 212ng/?L and their purity
(OD260/OD280) were 1.8 and 1.81 for new recommended and phenolâ€“chloroform methods respectively.
The PCR results indicated that D16S539 and CSF1PO loci were amplified.
Conclusion: These results shown that this method is simple, fast, safe and most economical

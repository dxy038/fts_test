In this paper, the business model of a kind of parallel-series HHV(Hydraulic Hybrid Vehicle), analyzes the efficiency model of hybrid system on the basis of the charging and discharging mode, and puts forward the engine efficiency map, motor/generator and accumulator map shows the efficiency. Maximum efficiency of the system as the optimal objective of discharge the operation mode of the operation mode of charging, according to the different charge accumulator, to maximize the efficiency of the system and the largest between products system and charging power charging efficiency as optimal objective respectively the energy management strategy, hybrid system optimization and research drive, the result of is the best control torque and speed of the engine, motor vehicles and generator in different operating condition. The simulation results show that fuel economy fuel consumption the driver hybrid system under the cycle operation NEDC mode reduce 33.12%.

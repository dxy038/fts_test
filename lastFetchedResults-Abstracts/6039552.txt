This paper presents a particle swarm - pattern search optimization (PS<sup>2</sup>) algorithm with graphics hardware acceleration for bound constrained nonlinear optimization problems. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using graphics processing units (GPU) as a hardware platform for particle swarm optimization (PSO). GPU, the common graphics hardware which can be found in many personal computers, can be used for desktop data-parallel computing. The classical PSO is adapted in the data-parallel GPU computing platform featuring dasiasingle instruction - multiple threadpsila (SIMT). PSO is also enhanced by adding a local pattern search (PS) improvement. The hybrid PS<sup>2</sup> optimization method is implemented in the GPU environment and with a central processing unit (CPU) in a PC. Computational results indicate that GPU-accelerated SIMT-PS<sup>2</sup> method is orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding CPU implementation. The main contribution of this paper is the parallelization analysis and performance analysis of the hybrid PS<sup>2</sup> with GPU acceleration.

Objective: Our purpose was to determine in a randomized, placebo-controlled manner whether multiple antenatal doses of betamethasone affect long-term growth and development of exposed mouse offspring. Study Design: Sixty pregnant CD-1 mice received either two, four, or eight antepartum doses of 0.1 mg betamethasone or placebo. Perinatal outcomes, growth, and development of the offspring were compared in a blinded manner. Variables were compared by analysis of variance or Ï‡2 testing. Results: Betamethasone-exposed subjects gained less weight during pregnancy and were delivered of fewer live pups, with fewer male survivors and lower birth weights. These trends were dose related. Growth measurements were similar after the neonatal period. No differences in functional development and physical maturation in the offspring were noted. The reproductive capability, perinatal outcomes, and growth and development of the second-generation offspring were unaffected by betamethasone exposure. Conclusion: Multiple antenatal dosings of betamethasone, reaching toxic levels, did not have an impact on the long-term growth and development of the surviving mouse offspring.

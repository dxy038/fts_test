A monitored power pre-checking scheme has been proposed and implemented for an effective optical amplification management in IP-over-CWDM networks with ROADMs. In the scheme, lightpaths are selected first to be checked whether the lightwaves should be amplified or not, before the lightpath reconfiguration, and the optical powers to be received by the optical transceivers for the lightpaths without amplification are monitored to be used for the determination. The performance of the implemented system was evaluated in an experimental network with 2 bidirectional amplifiers, and it was found that the lightpaths were reconfigured successfully by using the function for the lightpaths requiring the optical amplification.

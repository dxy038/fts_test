We study the performance of greedy scheduling in multihop wireless networks where the objective is aggregate utility maximization. Following standard approaches, we consider the dual of the original optimization problem. Optimal scheduling requires selecting independent sets of maximum aggregate price, but this problem is known to be NP-hard. We propose and evaluate a simple greedy heuristic. Analytical bounds on performance are provided and simulations indicate that the greedy heuristic performs well in practice.

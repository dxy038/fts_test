In today´s rapidly changing business environment a company´s business and related information systems underlie constant change. The field of evolutionary business information systems deals with applications that can be modified partially by stakeholders regarding content and behavior with the objective to align to new business requirements. A possibility to change the behavior of an application could be achieved by modification of the underlying business processes. Subject-oriented business process management (S-BPM) realizes an approach where process models can be interpreted by an appropriate workflow engine and directly executed by stakeholders using a generic application working on it. In that way the generic application can be seen as a primary system on which a secondary design can be performed by editing the process models. In this paper we compare evolutionary business information systems with subject-oriented business process management with the objective to infer software requirements for implementing an evolutionary business information system on the basis of S-BPM, where the system behavior is a result of the continuous evolution of the underlying business processes.

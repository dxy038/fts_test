This study is proposed to solve the compliant mechanism de facto hinge (point flexure) issue by developing a new problem formulation. The main idea is to introduce an additional objective function which is to minimize the distance between the outputs of two types finite element analysis (FEA). A ratio formed formulation is developed based on the method and examined within the continuum type topology optimization framework. Numerical examples are provided to confirm the validity of the proposed method. It is shown that the proposed method gives compliant mechanisms that completely free of one-node connected hinges.

Objective: To investigate the value of cortical current density (CCD) reconstruction in localizing intracranial generators of interictal epileptiform activity in mesial and lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
Methods: Non-linear minimum L1-norm CCD reconstruction (with current sources restricted to the individual cortical surface and a realistic boundary element method (BEM) head model) was used to localize and to study the propagation of interictal epileptiform EEG activity in 13 pre-surgical patients with TLE.
Results: In all but one patient with mesial temporal lesions, an initial activation maximum corresponding to the ascending part of averaged sharp waves was found in the ipsilateral anterior basolateral temporal lobe, mostly extending up to the affected mesial structures whose resection rendered the patients seizure-free. In all 3 patients with lateral temporal lesions, the activation was initially confined to temporal neocortex immediately adjacent to the epileptogenic lesion. Towards the peak of sharp waves, two patients showed a propagation of interictal activity to anterior and posterior and partly contralateral temporal regions. A conventional EEG analysis based on amplitude maxima or phase reversal would have missed the initial onset zone.
Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that CCD reconstruction can be a valuable additional non-invasive component in the multimodal pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy patients.

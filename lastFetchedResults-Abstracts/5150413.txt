Onboard vehicular power conditioners have to perform three major functionalities. They have to operate as a bidirectional utility interface to charge the vehicle´s battery or inject power to the grid during vehicle to grid mode. Additionally, stand alone loads may be supplied. Deadbeat controller is a model predictive controller that applies to the averaged signals and has a short horizon. This controller can simply be implemented as the current controller in distributed generation inverters. The controller fast response time and its accordance with pulse width modulation techniques are appealing for this application. On the other hand, the deadbeat controller is sensitive to parameter variations. In this paper, a method is proposed that modifies the deadbeat controller´s time constant in order to overcome this shortcoming without extending the controller´s horizon. The proposed method is verified through case studies. Moreover, the controller is adopted for all three major functionalities of the vehicular power conditioner.

The Reactive Power Dispatch (RPD) problem is a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. This paper presents a multi-objective solution set for RPD problem. The objective functions are minimization of real power loss and minimization of control variable adjustment costs. This paper has considered the setting of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) device as additional control parameter in the RPD formulation. In this paper, a Modified Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm version II (MNSGA-II) is proposed for solving RPD problem. For maintaining good diversity in the performance of NSGA-II, the concepts of Dynamic Crowding Distance (DCD) is implemented in NSGA-II algorithm and given name as MNSGA-II. The standard IEEE 30-bus test system is used. The results obtained by MNSGA-II are compared with NSGA-II and validated with conventional weighted sum method using Real-coded Genetic Algorithm (RGA). The performance of NSGA-II and MNSGA-II is compared with various multi-objective performance measures namely gamma, spread, minimum spacing and Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) metrics with respect to reference pareto-front and the results show the effectiveness of MNSGA-II and confirm its potential to solve the multi-objective RPD problem.

The objective of this research was to measure the effects of different cellulase and hemicellulase mixtures on fermentable sugar production from two different perennial biomasses – switchgrass and a low-impact, high-diversity prairie biomass mixture (LIHD). Each was subjected to NaOH pretreatment, followed by hydrolysis with a commercial cellulase and β-glucosidase mixture [CB] supplemented with either of two hemicellulases. For both biomasses, there was little gain in sugar yield when using CB alone beyond 20–25 mg/g TS; further gain in yield was possible only through hemicellulase supplementation. An equation that modeled CB and hemicellulase effects as occurring independently fit the data reasonably well, except at the lowest of cellulase loadings with hemicellulase, where synergistic interactions were evident. Examination of the marginal effectiveness of enzyme loadings (incremental grams sugar per incremental mg enzyme) over a broad range of loadings suggests that there is no need to customize enzymatic hydrolysis for NaOH-pretreated switchgrass and LIHD.

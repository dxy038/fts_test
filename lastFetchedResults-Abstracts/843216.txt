The objective of this paper is to investigate an algebraic method to construct an analytic solutions for the nonlinear coupled Korteweg–de Vries system. We use Jacobian and rational methods to calculate new solitary wave solutions for the nonlinear coupled Korteweg–de Vries system of partial differential equations using symbolic software like Mathematica or Maple. These studies reveal that the nonlinear coupled Korteweg–de Vries system has a rich variety of solutions.

Virtualization, in telecommunication, has been given great interest over the 20 past years. Migrating operating system instances between physical hosts is one of the most important features of this technology. It allows network administrators to resolve serious problem such us hardware failure, lack in server capacity, while facilitates the management and the upgrade of their systems. With the strong use of Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) by most of third Generation (3G) network operators as a common infrastructure, live migration may be useful to resolve the overload problem that affects Call Session Control Function (CSCF) components. Our objective is to propose a High availability solution in order to avoid performance degradation. Thus, we aim to proof that when introducing the migration technique within the IMS architecture, we resolve the overload problem and guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) for IMS client. Based on previous work on high availability using virtualization, we describe, in this paper, our methodology and implementation of an experimental scenario using live migration. Then, we evaluate the registration and the session setup delays. The use of migration reduces considerably the delays by 40% for registration and by 38% for session setup. So, we obtain acceptable values compared to the thresholds.

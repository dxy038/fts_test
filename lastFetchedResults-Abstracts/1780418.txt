Introduction
ng evidence suggest that microRNAs could serve as non-invasive biomarker for cancer patients. Our study was designed to analyze circulating serum microRNAs in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
als and methods
RNA was isolated from patients with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and non-malignant disease; an artificial microRNA (cel-miR-39) was spiked-in prior the isolation procedure to control isolation efficiency. The levels of miR-26a-2*, miR-191, miR-337-3p and miR-378 in serum were determined using quantitative real-time PCR; the microRNA levels were normalized to cel-miR-39.
s
 miR-26a-2*, miR-191, miR-337-3p and miR-378 were quantified in serum of each 25 patients with ccRCC and non-malignant disease. The level of miR-378 was significantly increased in ccRCC patients, and thus chosen for validation. The analysis of miR-378 in the validation cohort with 117 RCC patients and 123 control subjects did not confirm a different level of miR-378. Also, miR-378 was not correlated to pT-stage, lymph node/distant metastasis, vascular invasion and Fuhrman grade.
sions
alysis of circulating serum levels of miR-26a-2*, miR-191, miR-337-3p and miR-378 is unlikely to provide helpful diagnostic/prognostic information in RCC patients.

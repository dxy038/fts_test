In the resent periods of research heat transfer of Nano fluids in different applications have been develop. The utilization of Nanofluids as coolant in heat exchangers of various applications is increased now a days. The major objective of this analysis is to study Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling and simulation of heat transfer and friction factor characteristics of Nanofluids in a circulartube under constant heatflux of both laminar as well as turbulent flow. The circular tube was designed by using GAMBIT software and the work has been simulated using FLUENT software. In this augmentation study, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CuO and SiO<sub>2</sub> Nano particles in water at 0.2%, 0.4 and 0.6% concentrations has been used as a heat transfer medium for the simulation. All the thermo physical properties of Nanofluids are temperature dependent. The Nanoparticles dispersed in distilled water to form stable suspension containing 0.2%, 0.4 and 0.6% volume concentrations of Nano particles.

Following the theories of Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobson and formation of new literary approaches such as Structuralism, there existed a modern poetics which didn’t consider Literature as an imitation of Reality but introduces it as reconstruction of a world absolutely different from real world, a world in which the elements, through a dialectic interactive relationship, consist whole literary text.  In present article, The authors have tried, on theoretical basis of linguistic and structural approaches, to analyze the differences between Aristotelian poetics and what known as Modern poetics (depended on Saussure theory) in “An Indian in Astara”, one of the stories of a collection titled “Again from those Streets” written by Bizhan Najdi. They want to explain how Modern poetics can show that a literary text belongs to the present time not the past history.

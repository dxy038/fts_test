One of the key issues of next generation mobile communications is compatibility with other wireless standards to further enhance ubiquity. The 2500-2690 MHz band has been identified as extension band for IMT-2000 systems such as UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System). The 2.4 GHz ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) band is available for all kinds of unlicensed technologies such as Bluetooth (BT) and wireless LAN (WLAN). The combination of BT and GSM within one mobile phone has become widely accepted, and therefore the same combination is required to work for UMTS mobile phones operating in the 2.5 GHz extension band as well. Radio network simulations are performed for a variety of scenarios in order to analyze the performance of the integrated BT receiver while the UMTS uplink signal for frequency division duplex (FDD) mode is present. The objective of this work is to analyze the performance of the BT receive mode in terms of user satisfaction and outage probabilities for indoor use as worst case scenario

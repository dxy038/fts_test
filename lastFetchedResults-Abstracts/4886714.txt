Study of radar echoes from the targets in environmental clutters has been of great interest in many applications. In this paper, research works on theoretical modeling and numerical simulations of composite electromagnetic scattering from target and rough surface are briefly reported. It includes GFBM/SAA, Hybrid KA-MoM, FEM with CMPL-DDM-TLQST, FDTD, and BART, developed in this Lab during recent years. GFBM/SAA: generalized forward backward method with spectral accelerate algorithm Hybrid KA-MoM: hybrid analytic Kirchhoff approximation and numerical method of moment FEM with CMPL, DDM and TLQST: finite element method with conformal perfectly matched layer, domain decomposition method, and two level quasistationary algorithm FDTD: finite difference time domain BART: bidirectional analytic ray tracing.

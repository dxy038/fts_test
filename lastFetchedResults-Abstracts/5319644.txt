The common two parameter `tau-omegaÂ´ model for emission by vegetation assumes a uniform attenuating canopy with some darkening due to scattering. As a result, the structural features of the canopy are dismissed, rendering the model insensitive to the azimuthal dependence of brightness temperature. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effects of canopy structure on the L-band emission by employing a full-wave approach in conjunction with Monte-carlo (MC) averaging. The simulations are performed on corn canopies consisting of only stalks.

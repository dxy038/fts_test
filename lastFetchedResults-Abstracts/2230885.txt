Cyclic loading can significantly alter the monotonic deformation resistance of a material. Knowledge of the cyclic deformation behavior of a material is essential for reliable life calculations of cyclically loaded structures. As monotonic tensile properties are commonly available or easily obtainable from a simple tension test, the objective of this study was to derive a method for estimating the cyclic deformation properties of steels from common tensile properties and hardness. A variety of correlations and relationships among hardness, tensile properties, and cyclic deformation properties were developed for fifty-seven steels included in this study. Several correlations and relations from the literature among the aforementioned properties were also examined and compared to the correlations and relationships proposed in this study using a different set of data from sixty-six steels. Implications of the proposed cyclic deformation behavior estimation method on fatigue life predictions are also discussed.

Background: Physalis alkekengi (P. alkekengi)has been used as an abortive plant in Iranian
traditional medicine for many years.
Objective: To investigate the effects of P.alkekengi on the fertility rate in female rats.
Material and Methods: In this experimental study, 40 female albino rats were divided
randomly into two groups; group l/for investigating the implantation sites and group 2/ for
investigating the number and weight of neonates. In both groups, treated animals received
plant extract at dose of 150 mg/kg on days 1-5 of pregnancy. In group 1, treated animals were
euthanized at 7th days of pregnancy and number of implantation sites were counted. In group
2, treated animals maintained till delivery time and after delivery, the number and weight of
neonates were investigated.
Results: Data showed that administration of P. alkekengi extract on days 1-5 of pregnancy
significantly decreased the number of implantation sites, number and weight of neonates.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the extract produced anti- fertility effect probably by
inhibiting implantation.

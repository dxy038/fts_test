We propose QoS-aware mesh deterministic access opportunities (MDAOPs) assignment algorithm for the IEEE 802.11s wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The WMNs can benefit from the mesh deterministic access (MDA) in terms of guaranteeing the QoS of the delay bounded traffic, mitigating the exposed node problem, and providing the fairness among best effort traffic flows. However, it is not considered that how much size of MDAOPs is assigned to each mesh link. In order to search the mesh links which need an additional duration of MDAOPs, we focus on the packet link delay and the required data rate of traffic flows. Based on these measures, the QoS-related objective function is designed. MRs periodically decide the duration of MDAOPs to minimize the value of the objective function. And MRs update the MDAOPs by the MDA request/reply packet exchange. By using simulation, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed scheme guarantees the QoS of various traffic flows and provides the fair transmission among TCP traffic flows.

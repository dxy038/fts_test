Background: Benzene is one of the important occupational pollutants. There are some reports
about the leukemogenic effects related to low-level exposure to benzene.
Objective: To study the frequency of micronucleus (MN), nucleoplasmic bridge (NB), and
nuclear budding (NBUD) in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of petrochemical workers with
low level exposure to benzene.
Methods: We enrolled 50 workers exposed to low-level benzene and 31 unexposed workers
of a petrochemical industry. After exclusion of 3 samples, peripheral blood lymphocytes of the
remaining 47 exposed and 31 unexposed workers were analyzed for the frequency of MN, NB,
and NBUD by cytochalasin-blocked MN technique.
Results: MN was present in 28 (60%) exposed and 18 (58%) unexposed workers. NB was
observed in 6 (13%), and 2 (7%) exposed and unexposed workers, respectively; the frequency
for NBUD was 20 (43%), and 13 (42%), respectively. No significant difference was
found in the observed frequencies of MN, NB, and NBUD in the peripheral blood lymphocytes
between the exposed and unexposed group workers.
Conclusion: Occupational exposure to low-level benzene does not increase the frequency of
MN, NB, and NBUD in the peripheral blood lymphocytes, biomarkers for DNA damage.

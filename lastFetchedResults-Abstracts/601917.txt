Background and Objective: Vaspin (visceral adipose tissue-derived serpin) was identified as a potential insulin sensitizing adipokine. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of resistance training intensity and volume on serum vaspin concentration and insulin resistance index. 

Materials and Methods: Thirty two male Wister rats (287 Â± 24 g) were randomly divided into four groups: (1) control, (2) trained with low intensity, (3) trained with moderate intensity, and (4) trained with high volume in moderate intensity. The resistance training consisted of climbing a ladder carrying a load suspended from the tail. After 4 weeks resistance training, serum glucose, insulin, and vaspin concentrations were measured, and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) was calculated. 

Results: Serum vaspin concentrations were lower in trained groups compared with control group. Trained groups had lower serum insulin concentrations and insulin resistance index than control group. The lowest serum insulin concentration and insulin resistance index were found in high volume in moderate intensity group.

Conclusion: This study indicated that resistance training could decrease serum vaspin and insulin concentrations as well as insulin resistance index. The volume of resistance training is an effective factor to improve insulin sensitivity.

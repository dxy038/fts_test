This paper proposes a technique for evaluating the availability of
substations and switching stations including the average cost of
repairs of darnaged equipment (corrective maintenance), the impact
of disturbances on equipment availability, and the impact of
disturbances on the continuity of the service provided by the
substation. The approach is based on the concept of disruptive
events, sequence-based processes, state graphs and Merkov
techniques. The paper illustrates the technique by comparing the
availability of two possible station layouts. The results clearly
show the benefit that can be obtained using this objective method
of comparison.

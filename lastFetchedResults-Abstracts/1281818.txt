Introduction & Objective: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of diabetes mellitus. In addition to known factors such as hyperglycemia, other factors may also be in-volved in the development of this complication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of testosterone in diabetic peripheral neuropathy by comparing its level in two groups of diabetic men with and without diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
Materials & Methods: This study was a case - control study and patients were selected from diabetic men attending the Hamadan Diabetes Center. The patients were divided in two groups of diabetic men with and without diabetic peripheral neuropathy, (35 patients in each case and control groups).NSS and NDS criteria and nerve conduction study were used for the diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
Results: The two groups had not significant difference in age, BMI, duration of diabetes and glycemic control. Testosterone level had not significant difference in the case and control groups (5±2.3 vs 4.5±2.2 ng/ml) (P=0.42).
Conclusion: While the effect of testosterone was demonstrated on the nervous system, neuro-genesis, cognitive function and alzheimer disease, this study could not prove any difference between serum level of testosterone in diabetic men with and without peripheral neuropathy.

Correlations and regression between fatness and carcass conformation measurements and carcass tissue composition has been studied for both sexes in suckling lambs, with slaughter weights between 9 and 15 kg. Objective fat measurements showed higher correlations than subjective fat measurements, mainly with carcass fat. Conformation measurements presented greater correlations with tissues weight than with tissues proportion (r⩽0.50). CCW was highly correlated with total muscle in the carcass (R2=0.961). Two fatness measurements (KKCF proportion and dorsal fat thickness) were included for the prediction of the muscle proportion. Furthermore, the model included other measurements, such as fore cannon bone weight and internal carcass length although they displayed very low correlation coefficients. This equation explained 64.1% of the variation of carcass muscle proportion (r.s.d.=1.532). CCW was included in the prediction equations of tissue weights, although in the fat tissue equation it appeared in the form of the carcass compactness index (CCW/L). CCW was a good predictor of the weight of carcass tissues in suckling lambs, especially for muscle. Prediction equations for tissue composition in grams were more accurate (R2⩾0.91) than those for tissue proportion. When gender was included in all models it did not improve either accuracy or precision of the prediction.

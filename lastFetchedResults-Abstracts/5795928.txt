The approach currently being taken by ETSI (BSM) in defining future open standards for network management architecture for IP-based broadband multimedia satellite systems is described. This work has recently begun and the final objective is to arrive at a consensus for an architecture which meets the requirements of compatibility and interworking with external networks (e.g. within the NGN) and is flexible enough to meet different operators needs.

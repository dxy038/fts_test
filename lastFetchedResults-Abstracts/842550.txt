A delay-differential equation modelling a bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks is investigated. An asymptotic stability of the BAM neural networks with time delays is considered by constructing a new suitable Lyapunov functional and some matrix inequality technique. A novel delay-dependent stability criterion is given in terms of matrix inequalities, which can be solved easily by various optimization algorithms.

We report on a full-duplex bidirectional spectrally interleaved optical code-division multiple access/dense wavelength-division-multiplexing demonstration based on 16-b 20-Gb/s quarternary phase coding gratings. Eight 622-Mb/s coded channels are transmitted in each direction and error-free performance obtained over a transmission distance of 44 km of nonzero dispersion shifted fiber.

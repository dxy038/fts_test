Background: Vitamin D deficiency is an unrecognized epidemic and a common health problem worldwide. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its relationship with overall and abdominal obesity in adolescent girls. 
Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted on girls aged 14-17 years whom were selected by multistage random sampling from four districts of Boukan. Questionnaires about general characteristics, dietary intake and physical activity were completed by interviewing with the subjects. Anthropometric measurements were performed. Fasting blood samples were collected for determining of serum of 25 (OH) D levels. Data was analyzed by using SPSS software and descriptive statistics tests and partial correlation test.
Results: The Mean of serum 25(OH) D was 7.26 (SD 2.81) ng/ml and 100% of subjects had vitamin D insufficiency. According to CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) criteria the prevalence of overweight, obesity and abdominal obesity were 18.5%, 1.4% and 26.4% respectively. There were significant reverse correlation between serum 25(OH) D and WC (r= -0.112, p=0.047).
Conclusion: The Results of this study indicate that vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem among studied adolescents. Given the reverse association between vitamin D status and abdominal obesity; appropriate approaches are needed to improve vitamin D status and lowering the prevalence of obesity among adolescents. Such conditions may prevent prevalence of chronic disease in adolescents' lives over the coming years.

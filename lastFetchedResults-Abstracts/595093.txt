Objective: The objective of this study was to find out the role of citrosoda sachet in the chemical dissolution of Urinary uric acid stones.Material and Methods: This study was conducted from Aug 2000 to Aug: 2002. All patients with urinary uric acid stones were included in the study. Citro soda was used as one sachet in half glass of cold water three times a day for ten to sixty days.

Out of 30 cases 22 (73%) were kidney stones and 8 (27%) were Ureteric Stones. Out of 30 stones 28 (93%) were completely dissolved and two were partially dissolved. Duration of treatment was 10 days to 2 months. The partially dissolved stones were managed by ESWL.Twenty Eight out of Thirty stones were completely dissolved and two partially which were managed by ESWL making 93.4% and 6.6% respectively.Conclusion: This Study concludes that Urinary Uric acid stones can be dissolved by the use of citrosoda sachet and can also be prevented by the use of this sachet.

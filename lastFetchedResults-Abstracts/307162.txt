Objective: Effects of metamizol and magnesium sulfate on erythrocyte glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme activity were investigated in in vitro and in vivo conditions.
Methods: For in vitro studies, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase was purified from human erythrocyte and rats were used for in vivo studies. Enzyme activity was determined according to the Beutler method by using a spectrophotometer at 340 nm.
Results: The results of in vitro study showed that their mean Ki values were 6.35 × 10−3 M for metamizol and 1.32 × 10−2 M for magnesium sulfate and their inhibition types were uncompetitive. I50 value was 17 mM for metamizol and 50 mM for magnesium sulfate in in vitro study. In the case of in vivo studies, 200 mg/kg metamizol inhibited the enzyme activity by 40% during the first 1.5 h (p< 0.05), and 225 mg/kg magnesium sulfate significantly inhibited the enzyme activity throughout 24 h (p< 0.01).
Conclusion: The results of this study suggested that metamizol and magnesium sulfate have significant inhibition effect on the activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme in both in vivo and in vitro.

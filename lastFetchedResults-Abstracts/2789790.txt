The local supply of power using micro-grids, to the consumer provides an effective way for reducing the stress on the grid. However, in connecting the micro-grids to the utility grid problems, such as power quality, load sharing, etc. arises. This paper presents a converter based interfacing approach for power sharing between the utility grid and the AC micro-grid. The proposed approach provides accurate real and reactive power sharing by adjusting two independent quantities, namely, phase angle and magnitude of the voltage. The interfacing converter provides the bidirectional power sharing between the existing and micro-grids. It protects the grid from the frequent load changes, along with keeping the power quality. In comparison to the existing approach, the proposed approach allows a) Current injection by different phases, b) different phase voltage control, and c) immunity from frequent load variations. The results show the suitability of the proposed method for interfacing the micro-grid with the utility grid.

Technical analysis explores forecasting of future price trends with the objective of identifying the best moment to buy and sell shares. Tail consists of a Java open-source library that abstracts the basic components of technical analysis, supplying tools for creation, manipulation and evaluation of techniques to buy and sell shares. We developed TailÂ´s structure in a extensible and adaptable way, allowing its use as an environment for simulation and study of new techniques of chart analysis. This paper presents the Tail library, its architecture and results obtained with its use. We validate the library through an experimental section with several post-mortem experiments.

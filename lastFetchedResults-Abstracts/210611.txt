The aim of the present paper is to offer a new approach 10 the study of 'equivalence' In
translation. It assumes that different contemporary theories of translation equivalence can
be substantially divided into three major groups. In the first there are those translation
scholars who adopt an idealistic abstract notion of equivalence and use it in their own
definitions, criticism and the teaching of translation. The members of the second group do
1".01 believe in the concept of 'equivalence' and avoid using it in their writing. Finally, There
are ather translation scholars who seem to stand in the middle and borrow the concept of
'equivalence' from the First group ond claim to study it from an objective perspective.
Having reviewed the theory of equivalence as interpreted by some of the mast innovative
theorists of the above mentioned groups, the paper applies the principles and concepts of
the theory of language as a soctol semiotics (Halliday, 19781 ta the study of the prablem of
equivalence in translation and drows the conclusion thot the term 'equivalence' seems to be
a misleading concept and should therefore be reploced by the concept 'translation loss'
unless, according fo Hatim and Mason (1990), the gap between the discourse of SL
(English) and TL (Persicn] cuilures is bridged

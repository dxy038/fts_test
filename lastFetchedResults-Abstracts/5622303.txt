This article describes the results of one of the ten pilot programmes under the integrated manufacturing and service systems (IMSS) initiative pursued by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A* STAR) in Singapore. The objective of this particular programme is to investigate how design, analysis, enhancement and implementation of critical business processes in a manufacturing and service network can be realised using one single simulation/application framework. The overall architecture of the framework outlines how commercial simulation packages and Web-service based business process application components would have to be connected through a commercial application framework to achieve maximum leverage and re-usability of the applications involved. In the pilot phase of this programme, research issues were also addressed with regard to mechanisms for interoperation between commercial simulation packages, symbiotic interaction between simulation-based decision support components and physical systems, and simulation speed-up through multi-objective optimal computing budget allocation techniques on a grid infrastructure.

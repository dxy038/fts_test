An efficient and useful robust optimization approach, design for multi-objective six sigma (DFMOSS), has been developed. The DFMOSS couples the ideas of design for six sigma (DFSS) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to solve drawbacks of DFSS; DFMOSS obtains trade-off solutions between optimality and robustness in one optimization. In addition, it does not need careful parameter tuning. Robust optimizations of a test function and welded beam design problem demonstrated that DFMOSS is more effective and more useful than DFSS

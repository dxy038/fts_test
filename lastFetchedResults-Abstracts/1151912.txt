Punching/blanking is among the oldest and most frequently used sheet metal forming processes. In spite of this, the definition of process parameters as a function of key characteristics of the process and blank material properties is in practise usually still done in an empirical manner. This paper reports an investigation into the behaviour of the blank material during the process through finite element simulations, analytical modelling and experimental work. The objective is to contribute towards the development of a system for the on-line characterisation of the blank material properties during the punching/blanking process. The finite element method was applied through the use of ABAQUS code.

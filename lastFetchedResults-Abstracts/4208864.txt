The paper presents a novel AC and DC stabilization scheme system for a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) using Permanent Magnet Linear Generator PMLG connected to a six pulse diode rectifier. The proposed dynamic controller of the WEC-Battery renewable energy system is based on Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) technique. The optimization search algorithm is implemented to control a novel low cost dynamic AC side dynamic filter/capacitor compensation green plug filter and PMDC speed controller scheme. The Dynamic Modulated Filter Capacitor Compensation scheme (MPFC) serves as an AC side voltage stabilization regulator for wave energy utilization enhancement. The objective is to extract available power from the wave energy system (WES) and transfer this power efficiency to the local isolated stabilized DC side electric load while dynamically controlling the speed of the PMDC motors.

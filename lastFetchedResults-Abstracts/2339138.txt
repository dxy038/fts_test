Objective
To determine the prevalence of associated behavioral problems and prognosis
with Benign Childhood Epilepsy with CentroTemporal Spikes (BCECTS).
Descriptive, Cross Sectional study that was conducted from October 2009 to
April 2013 in the Department of Pediatric Neurology, the Children’s Hospital
Taif, KSA.
Material & Methods
This study was conducted after approval from the Ethics Committee of the
Children’s Hospital Taif, Saudi Arabia. Thirty-two patients from the age of
3 to 10 years old were recruited from the pediatric neurology clinic over a
period of 4 years. All the patients were selected based on history, EEGs, and
neuropsychological and neurological examinations.
EEGs were performed for all the patients while in awake and sleep states. Those
who had centrotemporal discharges were included in the study. All the patients
also underwent a brain MRI. Only two patients had mild cortical atrophy but
developmentally they were normal.
Results
In our study, prevalence of BRE is 32/430 (7.44%). Among the 32 cases, 24
were male and eight were female. Six cases out of 32 indicated a family history
of BRE. Twenty-eight cases had unilateral right sided centrotemporal discharges
and four had bilateral discharges.
Conclusion
It is possible that for BECTS, a high number of seizures might play an
important role in the development of mild cognitive impairment and/or behavior
disturbances.

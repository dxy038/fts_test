Coal fly ash agent (CF, coal fly ash mixed with 30 wt% cement clinker) was added to MSWI fly ash at 25% and 35% dry weight, portions. Then, Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> was added to the mix in amounts of 0, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0% and 1.25% dry weight, respectively. Compressive strength tests and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) results show that using Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> combined with coal fly ash agent, the solidified MSWI fly ash sample can meet the landfill standard after 28 days of curing. Therefore, this method provides a possibility to achieve a cheap and effective solution for MSWI fly ash treatment before land filling.

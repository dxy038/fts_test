Abstract
Background and Objective: The impact of thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia and their associated complications on quality of life (QOL) is largely unknown. Determining the degree of health impairment as perceived by the patient is essential information needed to recommend suitable therapy. The impact of thalassemia and its complications on the quality of life of these patients and their parents has been little studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to comparison of quality of life in children with thalassemia and their parents. Subjects and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, the quality of life of 110 children less than 18 years with thalassemia referred to Shafa hospital of Ahvaz in 2007-2008 was studied using a demographic and quality of life questionnaire (COOP). The samples were chosen on the basis of a non-randomized sampling. The data was analyzed using descriptive and t-tests. Results: The mean QOL in patients less than 18 years was 72.98 Â±11.67 and in their parents was 65.1+13.32. In social activity (P=0.004), pain (P=0.002), emotion and affects (P=.000), quality of life (P= 0.047) and mean QOL (P=0.000) aspects, there were significant differences between the two points of view.
Conclusion: Presented data suggest that all patients with thalassemia need to undergo QOL assessment so that interventions focused on affected domains can be implemented to improved QOL.

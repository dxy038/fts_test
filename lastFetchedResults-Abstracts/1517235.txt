The main objective of this research was computational designing of an imprinted polymer for selective solid phase extraction (SPE) of methadone from plasma and saliva samples analyzed by gas chromatography-flam ionization detector (GC-FID). The density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-31G+ (d, p) level and Gaussian 2003 package was used to calculate the interaction energy of template–monomers (ΔE). The effect of polymerization solvent was also studied using polarizable continuum model (PCM). It was shown that, methacrylic acid (MAA) gave the largest ΔE in acetonitrile as a polymerization solvent. To examine the validity of this approach, two MIP were synthesized for methadone as template molecule and methacrylic acid as functional monomer in acetonitrile (AN) and methanol (MeOH), respectively. The performance of each polymer was evaluated by using imprinting effect. As it is expected, the best results were obtained for the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) which was prepared in AN. For the optimized method, the linearity between responses (peak areas) and concentration of methadone in plasma and saliva samples were found over the range of 3.6–40,000 ng mL−1 (R2 = 0.997) and 3.0–40,000 ng mL−1 (R2 = 0.998), respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for methadone in plasma were calculated to be 2.45 and 3.6 ng mL−1, respectively. The LOD and LOQ for methadone in saliva were 2.14 and 3.0 ng mL−1, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD; n = 4) for plasma samples containing 10, 100, 500, 1000 ng mL−1of methadone were 5.98, 5.78, 5.52, 4.78, 4.74, and the RSD (n = 4) for saliva sample containing 5, 20, 100, 1000 ng mL−1 of methadone were 4.74, 5.1, 5.9, 5.6, respectively.

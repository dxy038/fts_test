Wind farms located in SC (Southern China) are often with more complex terrains than in the north, such as onshore or hilly areas, which challenges the performance of wind power forecast system (WPFS) greatly. The flexibility issue is the task for WPFS to be adapted to the variable and complex onsite conditions and remain applicable for different objective wind farms over the whole area, which is crucial for adjustments of WPFS to keep the forecasting precision and satisfy the needs requested by the users. This paper presents the solution to flexibility of WPFS based on the analysis of typical wind resource and wind power characteristics over SC, and the actual arrangements and user requirements for WPFS as well. Then the framework of forecasting flexibility is proposed according to the three main technical links of WPFS: multiple data inputs, forecasting modelling and forecasting resultsÂ´ forms, providing guidance for the building of WPFS and forecasting precision improvement in view of engineering. To illustrate the idea in detail, historical data of wind farms in SC is used as displaying samples for discussion.

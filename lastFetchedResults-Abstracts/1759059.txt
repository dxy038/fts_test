Objective
ess the validity of parental report for seasonal and monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccinations among children 6 months to &lt;18 years who were recommended to receive both vaccines in 2009–2010.

en with fever or respiratory symptoms were prospectively enrolled in both emergency departments in Forsyth County, North Carolina, and the only pediatric hospital in the region. Enrollment occurred from September 1, 2009, through April 12, 2010, during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. A parental questionnaire was administered by trained interviewers to ascertain the status of seasonal and monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccines. Parental report was compared with that documented in the medical record and/or the North Carolina immunization registry.
s
297 enrolled children 6 months to &lt;18 years of age, 174 (59%) were 6 months to 4 years, 67 (23%) were 5–8 years, and 56 (19%) were 9 to &lt;18 years. Parents reported that 140 (47%) children had received ≥1 dose of 2009–2010 influenza vaccine—128 (43%) for seasonal vaccine and 63 (21%) for H1N1 vaccine. Confirmed vaccination data indicated that 156 (53%) children had received ≥1 dose of any 2009–2010 vaccine—120 (40%) for seasonal vaccine and 53 (18%) for H1N1 vaccine.

This work aims at designing a fuzzy matching algorithm that would automatically recognize an unknown ballet posture from seventeen fundamental ballet dance primitives. A novel and simple 7-stage system is proposed to achieve the desired objective. Minimized skeletons of the dance postures are generated after performing skin color segmentation on them. Straight line approximation on the minimized skeletons with the help of chain code and sampling generate their equivalent stick figure diagrams. Significant straight lines from the stick figure diagrams are considered, their fuzzy membership with respect to the 4 quadrants are evaluated. Finally with the help of the evaluated data, a fuzzy T-norm operator determines the proximity of a generated dance posture with the seventeen fundamental dance primitives.

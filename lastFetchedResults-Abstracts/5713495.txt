The need for survivability in optical networks is becoming more and more important because of the huge amount of aggregated traffic that is carried in an optical network. A number of protection schemes have been proposed for mesh networks, where their main objective is to provide a network that can restore a failure quickly and efficiently via a simple automated system. In this paper, we review and compare the protection schemes suitable for multicast traffic in optical networks with mesh topology. The schemes are compared with respect to mesh topology and blocking probability.

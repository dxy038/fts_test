Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an information and support telephone intervention for reducing anxiety in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery and their partners. Design: The study is a randomized controlled trial. Intervention began at discharge; 6 telephone calls were made to patients and partners over 7 weeks. Primary outcome was Beck Anxiety Inventory measured at baseline in hospital, at home on day 3, week 4, and week 8. Sample: The subjects were 131 patients who have undergone elective coronary arterty bypass graft surgery and their partners. Results: Patients' anxiety was moderate to severe the day before discharge. It was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group at day 2 at home. Partners always had lower anxiety than patients. A more sustained decrease in anxiety in the partner treatment group was found at both day 2 and week 4. Conclusion: Intervention effect is in the early period after discharge- the time most affected by reduced lengths of stay. (Heart LungÂ® 2002;31:199-206.)

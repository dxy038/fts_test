Preconditioning methods can accelerate the convergence of gradient-based iterative methods for tomographic image reconstruction and image restoration. Circulant preconditioners have been used extensively for shift-invariant problems. Diagonal preconditioners offer some improvement in convergence rate, but do not incorporate the structure of the Hessian matrices in imaging problems. For inverse problems that are approximately shift-invariant (i.e. approximately block-Toeplitz or block-circulant Hessians), circulant or Fourier-based preconditioners can provide remarkable acceleration. However, in applications with nonuniform noise variance (such as arises from Poisson statistics in emission tomography and in quantum-limited optical imaging), the Hessian of the (penalized) weighted least-squares objective function is quite shift-variant, and the Fourier preconditioner performs poorly. Additional shift-variance is caused by edge-preserving regularization methods based on nonquadratic penalty functions. This paper describes new preconditioners that more accurately approximate the Hessian matrices of shift-variant imaging problems. Compared to diagonal or Fourier preconditioning, the new preconditioners lead to significantly faster convergence rates for the unconstrained conjugate-gradient (CG) iteration. Applications to position emission tomography (PET) illustrate the method

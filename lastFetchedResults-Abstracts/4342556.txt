This paper presents a cooperative path planning approach for the navigation of nonholonomic mobile robots in environment with obstacles. Shared information can be obtained by sharing the local information between robots, thus the trajectories can be more optimized. Visibility graph approach is used to generate a series of intermediate objectives which guarantee the robots to reach the final objective without local minima. Then the reach of intermediate objectives is ensured by the optimal path planning algorithm. The velocity constraints, kinematic constraints and nonholonomic constraints of the mobile robot are considered in the problem.

Background and Objective: Nesfatin-1 is an effective peptide in the regulation of energy balance. The aim of this research was investigation of the effects of resistance training with and without testosterone injection on plasma levels of nesfatin-1 in adult male rats.

Materials and Methods: For this purpose, 40 Wistar rats with a weight range of 205 to 265 g and aged approximately 10 weeks were randomly divided into four groups: control group, testosterone group, resistance training group, and resistance training with testosterone injections group. In testosterone group and resistance training with testosterone injections group, three times per week, 1 mg per kg body weight of testosterone was injected. Resistance training protocol was consisted of 5 sessions per week (for 12 weeks) on a ladder and rats performed 10 repetitions.

Results: Findings indicate that levels of nesfatin-1 in resistance training and resistance training with testosterone injection groups were significantly higher compared with control group (P?0.05). Also, a significant change in levels of nesfatin-1 in the resistance training group compared with testosterone group (P?0.05) was observed. In contrast, significant changes of nesfatin-1 in the resistance training with testosterone injections group was not observed compared to testosterone group (P?0.05).
 
Conclusion: Results of this study support the undeniable benefits of resistance training for the increased nesfatin-1 and exercise can be used to regulate appetite and energy expenditure. Because the present study is the first research about the effects of exercise training with testosterone injections on plasma levels of nesfatin -1, more studies in this field are needed for more accurate conclusions.

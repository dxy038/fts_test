Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine effects of ovariectomy (OVX) and conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE/MPA), or ethinyl estradiol plus norethindrone acetate (EE/NA) on biomechanics of uterosacral (USL) and round (RL) ligaments in postmenopausal (PMP) monkeys.
Study design
This was a randomized, triple blind, placebo-controlled study. OVX monkeys received 12 months no treatment (Pbo) (n = 19), CEE/MPA (n = 19), or EE/NA (n = 21). USL and RL step strains and stress-relaxation data were curve-fitted, giving strain-dependent tensile modulus (TM) from 0% to 30%.
Results
(1) USL: TM for both treatment groups was greater than Pbo for strains from 0% to 12% (P< .04). (2) RL: TM for both treatment groups was smaller than Pbo for strains from 12% to 30% (P< .05). No differences were found between treatment regimens.
Conclusion
CEE/MPA and EE/NA both affect functional biomechanical properties by increasing tensile stiffness in the USL and decreasing it in the RL.

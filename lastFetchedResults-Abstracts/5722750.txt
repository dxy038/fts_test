In a mobile communication system, the base station antennas are often required to radiate shaped-beam patterns, which have as low a level as possible toward the interference zone where the same frequency is used and, conversely, have as high a level as possible toward the service zone. So, the synthesis of the shaped-beam pattern is one of great importance to designing the base station antennas. We present a new synthesis method of the shaped-beam pattern by controlling only the excitation phases of the array elements. We first apply array theory and optimization theory to construct an objective function. Then, we employ the quasi-Newton method to minimize this nonlinear problem. Two synthesis examples based on the 16-element linear arrays are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.

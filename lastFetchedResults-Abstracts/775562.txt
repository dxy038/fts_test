Direct steam generation (DSG) in parabolic trough concentrators can cause some instabilities in steel absorbers.
These instabilities are caused mainly along the stratified two-phase flow related to the boiling process of water. These
instabilities are manifested as a transient state and shown as a bending of the absorber, causing a rupture of the glass
envelope of the receiver. This bending has been associated with the thermal gradient produced by the boiling of water,
and the effects are related to the thermal conductivity of the absorber, the flow pattern and heating of the absorber from
below around solar noon.
When solar beam irradiance is arriving on one side of the absorber, the bending, which is always upwards, can be up
to 50 mm. This is the worst condition because the temperature difference is at its maximum at a transient state. This
paper presents the results of a bimetallic absorber (copperâ€“steel), which should reduce such deflections due to the high
thermal conductivity of the copper and the mechanical resistance of the steel. In order to compare the results of the
theoretical model with experimental results, it was necessary to build a bimetallic absorber 3 m long with a 31.7 mm
internal diameter and a thickness of 2.6 mm. The bending obtained experimentally was between 5 and 10 mm,
depending on the mass flow and the temperature difference in the wall receiver.
As a main conclusion, the bending of the receiver is acceptable, eliminating the rupture of the glass envelope, and it
may be used in DSG of parabolic trough collectors at low flows. The objective of this work is to apply DSG to low
power generation with parabolic trough plants.

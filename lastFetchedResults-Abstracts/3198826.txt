The problem of robust gain-scheduling multi-objective was studied. Multi-channels was adopted to design robust gain-scheduling multi-objective controller for LPV systems with polytopic structure, the slack variables whose number can adjust was added for decoupling the systems matrix and Lyapunov functions, so the different Lyapunov functions can selected at different vertex. This method can reduce the conservatism of traditional method which use single Lyapunov function at every channel. The slack variables bring the bilinear matrix inequalities in the controller synthesized and a simple but available method to decide the initial value of the iterative LMI was proposed. At last, the robust gain-scheduling multi-objective controller was designed for active suspensions using proposed method, the multi-objective include pole placement and mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>-</sub>. From simulation result, it can be seen that the performance was increased 30 percent, and the method was proved efficiency from simulation and theory.

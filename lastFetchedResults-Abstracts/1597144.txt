This paper examines an optimal stopping problem for a geometric Brownian motion with random jumps. It is assumed that jumps occur according to a time-homogeneous Poisson process and the proportions of these sizes are independent and identically distributed nonpositive random variables. The objective is to find an optimal stopping time of maximizing the expected discounted terminal reward which is defined as a nondecreasing power function of the stopped state. By applying the “smooth pasting technique” [1,2], we derive almost explicitly an optimal stopping rule of a threshold type and the optimal value function of the initial state. That is, we express the critical state of the optimal stopping region and the optimal value function by formulae which include only given problem parameters except an unknown to be uniquely determined by a nonlinear equation.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of iodine (I2) and/or selenium (Se) deficiency on thyroid hormones and hepatic xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme systems using a triple animal model. Three-week-old male Wistar rats were fed for seven weeks. Se deficiency was introduced by a diet containing &lt;0.005 mg/kg Se, and I2 deficiency was produced by sodium perchlorate containing drinking water. The levels of plasma thyroid hormones [total T4 (TT4), total T3 (TT3)], thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH); total microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and cytochrome b5 (CYP b5) levels; activities of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (P450R), microsomal aniline hydroxylase (CYP2E1), microsomal 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), microsomal 7-pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase (PROD) and cytosolic glutathione S-transferase (GST) were determined. In I2 deficiency total CYP450 levels, activities of CYP2E1, EROD and GST decreased, and CYP b5 content increased significantly. In Se-deficient rats, total CYP450 level and CYP2E1 activity increased, and EROD and GST activities and CYP b5 level decreased significantly. In combined I2 and Se deficiency, except for CYP450 content and CYP2E1 activity, all enzyme activities and CYP b5 content decreased significantly compared to control group. Overall results of this study have suggested that metabolism of xenobiotics as well as endogenous compounds is affected by Se and I2 status.

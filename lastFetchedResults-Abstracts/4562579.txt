Accidents at intersections happen when drivers perform inappropriate manoeuvres. Advanced sensor systems enable the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) which can estimate the potential for a collision at a junction. Based on this the driver can be assisted to avoid the accident. This objective can be achieved by sensors for detection of vehicles and all other objects present at the intersection as well as sensors for localisation of the host vehicle when approaching the intersection and being on the intersection. Within INTERSAFE the accurate localisation of the host vehicle is achieved by Laserscanners and video using individual feature-level maps of the intersection. Furthermore the Laserscanner system is used to track and classify other road users and obstacles, providing additional data for the path prediction and risk assessment part of the application.

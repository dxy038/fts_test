In this paper, the problem of finite time consensus is discussed for multiple non-holonomic mobile agents. The objective is to design a distributed finite time control law such that the controlled multiple non-holonomic mobile agents can reach consensus within any given finite settling time. We propose a novel switching control strategy with the help of time-rescalling technique and graph theory. The numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the method.

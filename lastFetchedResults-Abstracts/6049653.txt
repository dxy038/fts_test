In wireless sensor networks, the reliability can be increased when data is sent to multiple sinks. Data information transmitted to each sink can be considered as a commodity. The objective is to determine the route between each source and sink such that the lifetime of the commodity is maximized. In this paper, we derive the upper and lower bounds for the lifetime maximization problem with multiple sinks. Simulation results show that these bounds are tight for large scale wireless sensor networks.

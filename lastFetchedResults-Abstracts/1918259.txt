Based on similarity of electrocardiographic features, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia has been considered a variant of long QT syndrome. Genes causing long QT syndrome were used as candidate genes in 4 patients with bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. In 2 patients, we identified a common low penetrance HERG allele (R1047L) with an intermediate biophysical phenotype.

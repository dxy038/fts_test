We model and simulate stochastic traffic based on two established statistics: marginal distribution and autocorrelation function. The objective or this paper is two-fold: firstly to investigate the issue of modelling input network traffic in an automated way using the QTES methodology. In order to capture both the autocorrelation structure and the marginal distribution simultaneously and secondly to examine the use of different traffic models such as transform expanded sample (TES) models, spatial renewal process, distorted Gaussian model in the output queueing analysis of a system

In this paper, an applicative example of multi-objective control based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is presented. A dynamic output feedback attitude controller is designed for flexible satellites subject to persistent disturbance model uncertainty and the actuator saturation. The controller is assumed to have an observer-based structure and the non-linearity due to saturation is incorporated into the controller design process. The design specifications in terms of robust stable, disturbance attenuation and actuator saturation can be effectively dealt with in the LMI synthesis framework

An adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to solve the multi-objective optimization design of the reducer. Firstly, according to the structure, strength, etc. in a reducer, a multi-objective optimization model of the helical gear reducer is established. And then an adaptive GA based on a fuzzy controller is introduced, aiming at the characteristic of multi-objective, multiparameter, multi-constraint conditions. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to show the advantages of this approach and the effectiveness of an adaptive genetic algorithm used in optimized design of a reducer.

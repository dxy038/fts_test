The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression levels of multiple potential molecular markers in prostate cancer to clarify the significance of these markers as prognostic indicators in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP). This study included a total of 193 patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer who underwent RP without any neoadjuvant therapies. Expression levels of 12 proteins, including Ki-67, p53, androgen receptor (AR), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor, Aurora-A, Bcl-2, clusterin, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), HSP70, and HSP90, in RP specimens obtained from these 193 patients were measured by immunohistochemical staining. Of the 12 molecules, Ki-67, p53, AR, MMP-2, MMP-9, and HSP27 expression were significantly associated with several conventional prognostic factors. Univariate analysis identified these 6 markers as significant predictors for biochemical recurrence as well, while prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), surgical margin status (SMS), lymph node metastasis, and tumor volume were also significant. Of these significant factors, Ki-67 expression, SVI, and SMS appeared to be independently related to biochemical recurrence by multivariate analysis. Furthermore, there were significant differences in biochemical recurrence-free survival according to positive numbers of these three independent risk factors. These findings suggest that consideration of expression levels of potential molecular markers in RP specimens, in addition to conventional prognostic parameters, would contribute to accurate prediction of biochemical recurrence following RP in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, and that combined evaluation of Ki-67 expression, SVI, and SMS would be particularly useful for further refinement of the system in predicting biochemical outcome.

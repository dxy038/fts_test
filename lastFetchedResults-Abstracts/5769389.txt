Multi-objective collaborative design synthesis and its evaluation is usually viewed as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP). In this paper, it is formulated firstly and then, a hybrid Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (h-MOEA) is proposed by introducing ideas from evolutionary computation, which is suitable for solving the MOP in design synthesis and its evaluation. Furthermore, a design synthesis and its evaluation method supporting multi-objective collaborative design, composed of many iterative steps, is developed and the h-MOEA is encapsulated as a black-box optimization tool to generate design solutions, namely the Pareto optimal set. And also, a Web-based experimental prototype is developed to verify the proposed method. Finally, a case study has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed methods.

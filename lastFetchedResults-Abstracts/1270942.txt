Phosphate adsorption and desorption studies provide insight for developing P management strategies. Very few studies have concentrated on P desorption which provides information on the reversibility of adsorbed P. Phosphate adsorption and desorption studies were carried out on seven rice-growing soils from three countries in West Africa, with the objective of relating these processes to P management strategies for the soils. The standard P requirement (SPR) of soils, defined as the amount of P to be added to attain an equilibrium solution concentration of 0.2 mg P l−1, varied from 42 to 175 mg P kg−1. Out of the seven soils, four required low amounts and the other three needed relatively higher P applications. The extractability of the adsorbed P in different extractants was: 0.01 M KCl 32–78%, Olsen P 21–112%, and Bray 1 P 15–40%. Differences in the amounts of P desorbed by the soils suggested that the critical P levels needed for P management must be different. Management options to increase P availability in the soils are suggested.

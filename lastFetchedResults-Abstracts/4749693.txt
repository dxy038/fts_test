This paper presents an objective evaluation system of English phoneme pronunciation. This system gives an objective evaluation and feedback from students´ pronunciation by analyzing the waveform and calculating the Mel Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) Euclidean distance between students´ pronunciation and the standard pronunciation using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. This helps students learn English phonemes without any teacher involved.

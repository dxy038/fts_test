The first generation of regional multimedia satellites will feature a satellite return channel system (RCS) coupled with a DVB-S forward path to support star networked interactive multimedia applications from low cost ultra small aperture terminals. This architecture is an evolution of the DVB broadcast satellite architecture and the associated ground segment. The next step in this evolution will essentially build on this first generation architecture to more efficiently support emerging Internet applications including realtime services and point-to-point mesh networking. A key objective in this evolution will be to ensure that the user terminals are backwardly compatible both with respect to services and hardware. In this paper the evolution of this first generation regional multimedia satellite to a second generation hybrid architecture, soon to be contracted, is described which achieves the required improvements in an incremental way. This hybrid approach is in itself a step toward a third generation system; the possible directions explored at the conclusion of this paper

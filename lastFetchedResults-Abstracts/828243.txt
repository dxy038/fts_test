From distant past to the present, “induction” has been a prevailing issue in logic, epistemology and philosophy of science being discussed from different angles. Induction is of two kinds: perfect and imperfect. The latter is the focus of most discussions on induction. The accuracy of deduction in imperfect induction is dependent on three principles: a) impossibility of chance and absolute accident, b) impossibility of chance and limited accident and c) justification of extension to cases on which induction is not conducted. Different schools of thought, including the followers of Aristotelian rationalism and the advocates of empiricism, have tried to prove the afore-mentioned principles.
Having presented a new theory called “the theory of essential” in his important work “Logical Bases of Induction”, martyr Sadr tries to make some critical remarks on Aristotelian rationalism and empiricism. 
According to martyr Sadr’s theory, imperfect induction produces objective certainty within the two stages of objective production and essential production. The first stage raises the probability and the second ends in certainty.

 The objective of this study was evaluating the effectiveness of encapsulated nisin in liposoms in contrast to free nisin in control of  Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19117 in Feta cheese during its ripening. The size of the nano-encapsules with nisin was around 103-150 nm and of the nano-encapsules without nisin was of approximately 101-143 nm. Addition of 500IU/g nisin to cheese resulted into 0.57, 4 and 3.7 log reduction in viable cells, respectively in free nisin, nano-encapsulated nisin (formulation 1) and  nano-encapsulated nisin (formulation 2) at the end of four weeks ripening. In addition, changes in pH during this period of time was also affected by the form of addition of nisin, it was significantly different from liposomal nisin formulations(p < 0.01). Since the free nisin had negative effect on starters, pH of this treatment could not achieve the standard range of pH determined for feta cheese and deficiencies in quality was observed.

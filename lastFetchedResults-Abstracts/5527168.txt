Uplink communication in a cellular radio network is considered where the base station in each cell employs a linear or nonlinear (decision feedback) multiuser receiver. For any such receiver, the problem of minimizing total transmit power under the constraint that all the users of the network achieve their quality-of-service (QoS) objective in terms of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) has been studied recently. Stochastic approximation-based adaptive power control algorithms have been presented and analyzed both in the context of single user receivers and multiuser receivers. The primary focus of this paper is on improving the convergence properties of the standard stochastic approximation-based power control strategy by using the more recent results on the stochastic approximation technique with averaging. Convergence issues of both the &#8220;non-averaged&#8221; and &#8220;averaged&#8221; algorithms are investigated and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance improvement due to averaging

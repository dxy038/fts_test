A method for subjective assessment of picture quality based on supra-threshold levels is presented. In the proposed approach, picture quality is graded relative to supra-threshold points in a recursive manner as opposed to the common absolute category rating scale. In addition, assessments were carried out with full resolution and sub-resolution pictures to measure the presence of quality disparity. Data collected from subjective tests were used to measure the capability of four human visual system based objective metric in quantifying picture quality relative to supra-threshold levels.

Background: Validity is of particular importance in test development. Objective: The aim of this paper is to briefly introduce the multidimensional scaling (MDS) as a method of determining construct validity, to assess its outputs, to compare it with other similar methods, and to show the utility of this method in different domains of psychology. Method: Multidimensional scaling was performed on 419 students of Tehran state universities (Tehran, Amir Kabir, and Allameh Tabataba’i universities) who were selected randomly to investigate the efficacy of Post-Critical Beliefs (religious beliefs) scale. Results: The implementation of multidimensional scaling showed the existence of two dimensions and confirmed the construct validity of the Post-Critical Belief scale. Conclusion: Generally speaking, multidimensional scaling is a suitable technique for determining the validity of psychological instruments that are used to evaluate individuals’ characteristics based on different dimensions

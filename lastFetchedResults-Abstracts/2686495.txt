This paper investigates interference coordination for 3-dimension (3D) antenna array systems in multicell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA) wireless networks. Cell-center user and cell-edge user specific downtilts are accordingly partitioned through dynamic vertical beamforming in the 3D MIMO-OFDM communication systems. Taking these user specific downtilts into consideration, the objective of our proposed interference coordination scheme is to maximize both the cell-center users´ and cell-edge users´ throughput, subject to per evolved NodeB (eNB) power and downtilt constraints. To solve the interference coordination problem, a novel partial joint processing (JP) coordinated multiple point (COMP) based dual decomposition method (JC-DDM) is proposed, where resource block (RB) assignment, power allocation (RAPA) and downtilt adjustment are jointly optimized. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed JC-DDM.

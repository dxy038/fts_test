From a historical perspective, one could consider the
modern library catalog to be that bibliographical apparatus that stretches at
least from Thomas Hyde’s catalog for the Bodleian Library at Oxford to
the near present. Mai and other recent authors have suggested postmodern
approaches to knowledge organization. In these, we realize that there is no
single and unique order of knowledge or documents but rather there are
many appropriate orders, all of them contextually dependent. Works
(oeuvres, opera, Werke, etc.), as are musical works, literary works, works
of art, etc., are and always have been key entities for information retrieval.
Yet catalogs in the modern era were designed to inventory
(first) and retrieve (second) specific documents. From Hyde’s catalog
for the Bodleian until the late twentieth century, developments are
epistemologically pragmatic–reflected in the structure of catalog records,
in the rules for main entry headings, and in the rules for filing in
card catalogs. After 1980 developments become empirical–reflected in
research conducted by Tillett, Yee, Smiraglia, Leazer, Carlyle, and
Vellucci. The influence of empiricism on the pragmatic notion of “the
work” has led to increased focus on the concept of the work. The challenge
for the postmodern online catalog is to fully embrace the conceptof “the work,” finally to facilitate it as a prime objective for information
retrieval. [Article copies available for a fee from The Haworth Document Delivery

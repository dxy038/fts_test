Some controversies still exist concerning the validity and efficacy of using footprint parameters to predict arch height. Some investigators have disputed the ability of using the footprint to characterize arch types, since factors other than arch height may contribute to the footprint. Chu and coworkers (1995) used a digital approach and included pressure information with AI, which they termed the modified arch index (MAI). Their results showed that significant correlation existed between the arch height and both the MAI (r=-0.71) and the AI (r=-0.70). The causes of the above-mentioned controversy have been believed to be due to errors introduced during the footprint acquisition and parameter extraction phases. The purpose of this study was to use the same digital approach as Chua to determine whether correlation existed between arch height and the other eight footprint parameters besides the MAI and AI. The objective of classifying foot arch type is to help people with abnormal foot structure prevent injury, and to help athletes enhance performance. The main purpose of footprint parameters is to provide an easily accessible and valid approach to reach this objective

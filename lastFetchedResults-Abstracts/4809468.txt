The selection of the most suitable SG with regard to a given learning objective seems to be less well addressed in the literature. This paper reports on the application a new Characterizing and Assessing Serious Games Grid (CASGG) in the higher education field with 41 graduate students to assess their learning performance according to one leaning objective using a specific SG. The tested SG was Star Bank the Game and the learning goal was to understand the principal mechanisms of banking. The findings revealed that there is no difference in terms of learning performance between students who have used the SG and those who have only followed the theoretical course. With reference to learning satisfaction, the first category of students expressed much more enthusiasm and motivation for learning. Using the SG was for them more enjoyable and engaging. The game play succeeded in capturing their attention, challenging their curiosity and enhancing their interest in the theoretical knowledge.

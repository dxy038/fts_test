This study originally focuses on optimizing the clustering algorithm employed in multi-radio ad-hoc networks with an objective of maximizing the end-to-end capacity. We theoretically demonstrate that, clusters with uniform size outperform those with not. A distributed uniforming algorithm which can be applied complementary to most existing clustering algorithms is developed to balance the cluster scale. Preliminary simulations finally confirm our conjectures and demonstrate the effectivity of our algorithm

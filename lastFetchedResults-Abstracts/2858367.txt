Not many studies on the importance of IT for green growth have been conducted, and most previous studies focused on measuring the greenhouse gas emission of IT infra and the effect of IT services on greenhouse gases reduction. Thus the discussions on the technology strategies for Green IT analysis and Green IT classification are not satisfactory. To establish an analytical framework of Green IT application and corporate Green IT strategies, this study has established the concept of Green IT through the investigation of current trends in Green IT and previous studies on Green IT classification systems and then systemized the top factors and sub factors of the analysis system. To test the validity of questionnaires, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted, and then to investigate the cause-and-effect relationship for the top factors constructed by an exploratory factor analysis, a confirmatory factor analysis which is a structured equation model was conducted. By utilizing Green IT application cases for individual industries based on research models derived in these manners, the implications for the green IT strategy for individual industries were suggested. Furthermore, to evaluate the Green IT standards of businesses, standards evaluation indexes were suggested based upon an analytic framework, a research model, which is the objective and scope of this study.

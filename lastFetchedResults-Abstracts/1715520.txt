The objective behind this study is to ameliorate the flowability, compressibility and tableting properties of aceclofenac by developing a prolonged release microparticulate system using an algino-carbopol polymeric blend. Prepared microspheres were subjected to various physico-chemical studies along with in vitro drug release studies to optimize the concentration of the polymeric blend required to sustain the drug release for 12 h. Optimize formulation was further subjected to different flowability and compressibility studies to observe the impact of microspheres on improvements of flow properties. All the microsphere formulations exhibited good entrapment efficiency and showed prolonged drug release. SEM study revealed that the microspheres were almost spherical in shape with rough outer surface containing small pores. The findings of micromeritic studies suggested that the flowability and compressibility properties of the pure drug were significantly improved by the microsphere formulation. Heckel analysis also suggested that the microspheres exhibited better plasticity and die filling behavior as compared to pure drug. The tablets containing optimized microspheric formulation showed better handling properties than pure drug and no significant difference in drug release when compared with the marketed product. So the present study concluded that encapsulation of aceclofenac into microparticulate system not only enhanced its flowability, compressibility and tableting properties but also simultaneously helped to improve the patient compliance by sustaining the drug release for a prolonged period of time to manage pain and its symptoms.

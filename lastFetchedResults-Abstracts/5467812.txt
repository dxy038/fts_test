In this paper a branch and bound algorithm is proposed for polynomial programming problems (P) that arise in various practical problems. By utilizing an exponential variable transformation and the mean value theorem a linear relaxation of the (P) is then obtained. Through the successive refinement of a linear relaxation of feasible region of the objective function and the solutions of a series of linear programming problems the proposed algorithm is convergent to the global minimum of the (P). At finally numerical results indicate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

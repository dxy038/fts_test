Objective
This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of reproductive factors on the prevalence of urinary symptoms.
Study design
Participants were women scheduled for hysterectomy (n = 1299). Before surgery, urinary symptoms were assessed by questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between bladder symptoms and parity, route of delivery, and other characteristics.
Results
Stress incontinence and urinary urgency were more prevalent among parous than nulliparous women (P< .01). Controlling for parity and other characteristics, women who had a history of cesarean delivery were significantly less likely to report stress incontinence than women with a history of vaginal delivery (odds ratio 0.60; 95% CI 0.39-0.93).
Conclusion
Women who have undergone vaginal delivery are more likely to report stress incontinence than women who have delivered by cesarean section. Although this suggests that cesarean delivery might reduce incontinence later in life, further research is needed to clarify the long-term risks, benefits, and costs of cesarean delivery.

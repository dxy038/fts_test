Time-varying signal strength is a fundamental characteristic of wireless channels. Scheduling packets over fading wireless channels has received much attention. In the previously studies, the objective is usually to maximize the total number of packets delivered by their deadlines. However, for many practical problems, it is more reasonable to differentiate various packets and take into account the amount and/or the significance level of the information embedded in the packets. Thus, in this paper, we associate packets with values and address the problem of optimizing weighted throughput, defined by the total value of the packets sent by their deadlines.

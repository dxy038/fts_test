During last stage of network reconfiguration after major blackout, loads should be picked up in sequence with considering certain constraints, which is a multi-constraint, non-linearity, integer programming problem. This paper proposes a combinatorial optimization model with considering the sequencing problem of load pickup, in which effects of pickup sequence are taken into consideration in both objective function and constraints. As the large optimization scale of restorable loads during last stage of network reconfiguration, a new adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed model. Case studies performed on the actual Shandong power system demonstrate that the proposed model effectively reflects sequencing problem and the adopted algorithm can satisfy the practical requirement on computation speed.

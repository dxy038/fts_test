This paper presents a new thresholding based speech enhancement approach, where the threshold is statistically determined using the Teager energy operated Wavelet Packet (WP) coefficients of noisy speech. The threshold thus obtained is applied on the WP coefficients of the noisy speech by employing a semisoft thresholding function in order to obtain an enhanced speech. A number of simulations is carried out in the presence of white, car, and pink noises to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Standard objective measures as well as subjective observations show that the proposed method outper-forms the existing state-of-the-art thresholding based approaches of noisy speech enhancement from high to low levels of SNR.

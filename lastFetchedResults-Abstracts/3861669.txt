We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel centrally controlled protection scheme for arrayed waveguide grating-based bidirectional wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical networks which can provide automatic traffic restoration against fiber cut between remote node and optical network unit. Compared with the previous structures, its requirements on the network resources are greatly reduced with negligible protection performance degradation.

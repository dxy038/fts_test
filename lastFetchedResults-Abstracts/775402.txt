Survivability is a key concern in modern network design. This paper
investigates the problem of survivable dynamic connection provisioning in general
telecom backbone networks, that are mesh structured. We assume differentiated
services where connections may have different availability requirements, so they
may be provisioned differently with protection (if needed) based on their availability
requirements and current network state. The problem of effectively provisioning
differentiated-service requests, that has been widely investigated for
connections routed at the physical layer, assumes peculiar features if we consider
sub-wavelength requests at the logical layer that have to be protected (or more
generically, whose availability target has to be guaranteed), but also have to be
groomed for an efficient use of network resources. An integrated multilayer
approach is necessary that considers requirements and grooming of connections at
the logical layer as well as their routing and availability at the physical layer. Joint
availability-guaranteed routing and traffic grooming may lead to a negative interaction,
since the objective of the first problem (guaranteeing a given level of
availability to the connections) clashes with the objective of the other problem
(minimizing resource consumption). For a multilayer WDM mesh network, we
propose new multilayer routing strategies that perform effective availabilityguaranteed
grooming of sub-wavelength connections. These strategies jointlyconsiders connection availability satisfaction and resource optimization and are
developed under two different practical hypotheses: guaranteed target, i.e., a connection
is routed only if its availability target is satisfied, and best-effort target, a
connection is always routed and, when the availability target cannot be guaranteed,
the path with the best possible availability is provisioned. Numerical results are
reported and discussed for the two approaches mentioned above. In both cases, the
results show high effectiveness of our provisioning strategy

In view of consumers, the risk of e-commerce transaction is divided into the subjective risk and the objective risk in this paper. Then, a multi-dimensional trust risk evaluation model (MTREM) is proposed for e-commerce based on the qualitative analysis of the subjective risk and the objective risk. In the model, the risk is dynamically and quantitatively evaluated in terms of the seller´s reputation, the commodity price, the consumer´s income, the consumer´s consumption idea (the risk tolerance), and the transaction experience. Finally, the actual transaction data from Taobao is used in the simulation experiment, a comparative analysis is done for MTREM. The experiment shows that the computing result from MTREM is similar to the qualitative analysis from some existing researches. However, the risk factors in the model are considered more comprehensively and more objectively, the computing result from MTREM is quantitative and easy to be understood and accepted.

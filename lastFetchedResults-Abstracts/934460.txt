Dairy byproduct proteins are considered natural functional additives having the ability to interact with the starch and gluten network in a dough system and thus behave as dough improvers. Native whey proteins have negative effect in bread making so whey protein concentrates modified to increase viscosity in solution (mWPC) might overcome undesirable weakening of the gluten network which usually occurs in frozen dough products during prolonged times in frozen storage. The objective of this research project was to determine the effect of mWPC on empirical and fundamental dynamic rheological properties of wheat flour dough. The results for empirical rheological studies showed that addition of mWPC had significant effects on mixographic parameters and also increased values of mixing time and peak height percentage. The results for the fundamental mechanical properties of the frozen dough revealed an increase in the values of Gâ€² with the increase in the frequency, along with an upward trend with increasing temperature, but the highest values were obtained after cooling. Addition of mWPC in the dough treatments induced softening in the dough system, as shown by the decrease in the values of the viscoelastic moduli. Rheological and textural changes in the bakery products made from frozen dough could be imparted by the incorporation of modified whey protein concentrates as dough improvers.

Objective
eral, ageing is a risk factor for sensory and motor deterioration, with the rate of decline varying amongst individuals. Concerning masticatory function, missing teeth along with oral disease seem to accelerate the dysfunction. Here, we aimed to confirm whether masticatory dysfunction by ageing is inevitable. This study investigated the effect of age, gender, number of natural teeth, occlusal force and salivary flow on the masticatory performance in a large sample of elderly adults.

udy sample consisted of 1288 independently living people aged 60–84 years. Masticatory performance was determined by the comminuted particles of test food. Bilateral maximal occlusal force in the intercuspal position was measured with pressure sensitive sheets. Stimulated whole saliva was collected.
s
atory performance was significantly correlated to age, number of residual teeth, occlusal force and stimulated salivary flow rate by Pearson's correlation test. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that, with other variables controlled, masticatory performance was significantly associated with the number of residual teeth (β = 0.456, P &lt; 0.001), occlusal force (β = 0.244, P &lt; 0.001) and stimulated salivary flow rate (β = 0.069, P = 0.003). Age was not related to masticatory performance (β = −0.007, P = 0.753).
sions
es in the number of residual teeth, occlusal force and salivary flow were associated with a reduction of masticatory performance in older adults. If tooth loss is not considered as an attribute of physiological ageing, then ageing by itself may not be a risk factor for masticatory dysfunction.

This paper presents electromagnetic field measurements performed in Portugal by the monIT Project, a Portuguese risk communication project, which has the objective of providing the general public with relevant information on electromagnetic fields produced by mobile communication systems. The project team performed extensive measurement campaigns in public places, over the country, over the past 5 years. Two types of measurements are performed: localised and continuous ones. Localised measurements are 6 minutes spot ones, having been performed until now more than 430 measurements, with a total of 2 290 points. Continuous measurements are performed by using a network of autonomous remote probing stations. Until now, 22 different networks have been installed, with a total of 121 stations, for an average period of about 3 months each. Results from measurements show that all analysed locations are in compliance with exposure thresholds. Also, the temporal and spatial measurements parameters influence on the results is studied, e.g., in indoor locations values are about 4 times higher than in outdoor ones.

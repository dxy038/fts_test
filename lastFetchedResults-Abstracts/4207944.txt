The importance of having phasor measurement units or PMUs in an electric grid is widely recognized. However, the number of PMUs on a large system is limited by cost and the placement of PMUs must be addressed. The main objective of this research is to create an algorithm to identify buses that are the best candidates for PMU placement based on certain requirements. The monitoring of certain grid events like transmission line failure or generator failure must be possible from the selected PMU locations. In addition, the PMUs must be distributed evenly so that critical parts of the grid are visible. At the same time, there should be no or little redundancy in the PMU readings unless it is intentional to provide additional data reliability. The algorithm, once developed, is then applied to the electric network directed and operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). After analyzing the results, clusters or group of buses are identified in each operational area in the ERCOT gird, where the PMUs should be located. The PMU can be located at any of the bus in the cluster. In future it is desirable to expand the algorithm to consider the geographical divisions in the ERCOT grid along with the commercial divisions.

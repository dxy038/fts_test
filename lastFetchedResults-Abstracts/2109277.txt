Objective(s): Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is known as a progressive inflammatory CNS disease. Cytokines belong to Th1 or Th2 family and inflammatory cells, play significant role in pathophysiology of MS. Thus, any treatment supposed to influence the relation between Th1 to Th2 cytokines expression. Although vitamin D has been prescribed as a therapeutic supplement of MS for a long time, it is not clear how much it may affect the Th1/Th2 ratio. To answer this question the present research was designed.  Materials and Methods: Thirty C57BL/6 adult female mice were used. The animals were randomly divided into trial and control groups. Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) modeling for MS and clinical scoring as cited by others was used. Based on scoring and step of the disease vitamin D3 prescription (5 mg/kg) started and continued for three weeks. Results: By using ELISA and RT-PCR the brain level of TNF-α, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-12 determined. Significant decrease of clinical symptoms in trial group which received vitamin D was seen comparing to control animals (P<0.05). The level of TNF-α but not IL-10 significantly decreased following vitamin D3 administration. By comparing the level of Th1 and Th2 Interleukins and counting the ratio of them we found that in treated animals the ratio was significantly less than non-treated (P =0.01). Conclusion: According to the results, vitamin D3 may be able to suppress the inflammatory ways that lead to progression of MS. Whether this ability is clinically valuable in human subjects is not clear and needs more clinical research.

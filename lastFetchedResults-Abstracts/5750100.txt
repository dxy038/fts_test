The project METAMORPHOS is a two-year Italian research project, funded by the Ministry of University and Research, aimed at facilitating the selection and the adoption of reverse engineering and migration techniques and tools in industry. To pursue such an objective, the project aims at empirically evaluating techniques and tools that can potentially fulfill industry needs. The project focuses in particular on migration activities towards distributed architectures - such as Web-based and service-oriented - and mobile devices that are nowadays gaining an increasing diffusion and central role.

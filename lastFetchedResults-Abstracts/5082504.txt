The analysis and design of a modular three-phase ac to dc converter using single-phase CUK rectifier modules is discussed based on power balance control technique. The control strategy consists of single output voltage loop control and three-inductor current calculator. The main objective of the proposed system is to reduce the number of stages and improve dynamic response of dc bus voltage for distributed power system. The proposed scheme offers simple control strategy, flexibility in either 3-phase delta or star-connected and simpler design. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed control system offers the fast transient response and power factor closed to unity.

This paper presents a multi-objective adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOAPSO) for reactive power optimization and voltage control, which reduces power system losses by adjusting the reactive power variables such as generator voltages, transformer tap-settings and other sources of reactive power such as capacitor banks and provides better system voltage control. To avoid the drawback of premature convergence of PSO, an adaptive strategy is introduced in PSO. During evolution process, the crucial parameter, which is inertia weight, is adjusted adaptively in order to get the optimal global solution. The IEEE standard 30 bus system was used as test systems to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method.

The objective of this study was to investigation effect of different of probiotic BIOSAF supplementation on the effect of different levels of probiotic BIOSAF on growth performance and immune system response of male Ross 308 broiler. Two hundred twenty five chickens were allocated in the three treatment containing 5 pen and 15 birds on each pen. Diets included 0 (Control) 0.1 (Treatment 1) or 1.5gr (Treatment 2) of probiotic BIOSAF/kg diet. The probiotic which used in this experiment was commercial BIOSAF containing at least 8 billion yeasts per gram. Considering all the experimental period, the use of BIOSAF increased feed intake in treated bird compared to control (p < 0.05). Also, the result showed that treatment1 and 2 had heavier breast and thymus weight than control. Treatment 1 and 2 had grater immune response to SRBC and Newcastle vaccination compared to control in 28th days of experiment. Although there were no differences among treatments regarding blood cells at 42th day of experiment, treatment 1 and control group had higher concentration monocytes compared to treatment 2 (p < 0.05). Generally, using probiotic BIOSAF /kg diet had efficient effect on growth performance of male Ross chicken particularly, when supplementation is done in starter period. Also, supplementation probiotic BIOSAF has positive effect on immune response to Newcastle and SRBC. However, 1gr/kg supplementation of probiotic BIOSAF is more suitable than 1.5gr/kg diet.

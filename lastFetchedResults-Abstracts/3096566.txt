This paper addresses the problem of objectively measuring quality in free-viewpoint video production. The accuracy of scene reconstruction is typically limited and an evaluation of free-viewpoint video should explicitly consider the quality of image production. A simple objective measure of accuracy is presented in terms of structural registration error in view synthesis. This technique can be applied as a full-reference metric to measure the fidelity of view synthesis to a ground truth image or as a no-reference metric to measure the error in registering scene appearance in image-based rendering. The metric is applied to a data-set with known geometric accuracy and a comparison is also demonstrated between two free-viewpoint video techniques across two prototype production studios.

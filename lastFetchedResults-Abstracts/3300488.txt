A survey in Beijing, China shows that 74 percent passengers traveling at late night have experienced missing last trains in urban mass transit (UMT). Among those passengers, 49% missed last trains at original stations, and others missed last trains on objective lines when transferring. As to solve this problem, we analyzed passengersÂ´ demands for trip planning considering Last Trains Running (LTR). Besides lowest traditional cost, the information passengers require contains latest departure time, highest reliability and the real destination. Then, we introduced a method to get the information. Based on the method, we present experiments on the real UMT network in Beijing. The result shows that the method is adaptive to tackle this problem. With the development of the trip planning system based on this method, the trip at late night will be more convenient.

The full wave analysis method developed Gonzalez, Encinar, Zapata and Lambea, (see IEEE Trans. Antennas Propagat., vol.46, no.2, 1998) is applied to investigate cavity-backed microstrip patch arrays with thick substrates and coaxially fed through a capacitive coupling. The objective is to obtain a broad bandwidth without a decrease in the scan coverage and efficiency and without the drawback of a high cross-polarisation owing to the surface-wave generation.

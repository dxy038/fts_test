The authors report the realization of monolithic impedance-matched lasers and photodiodes on InP substrates. The objective was to demonstrate the advantage of such an approach by using a transmission link operating at 6 GHz and 1.3 mu m. Starting from the analysis and modeling of discrete lasers and photodiodes fabricated in Thomson-CSF/LCR, the equivalent circuits of each device have been determined to design the associated impedance-matching cells.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

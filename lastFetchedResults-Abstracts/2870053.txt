High precision control is desirable for future weapon systems. Numerous control design methodologies are developed for a real-time automatic system capable of tracking two-dimensional (2-D) targets in complex scenes. The design objective of the control system is to achieve a rapid and precise response capable of tracking the fire control commands under the influences of disturbances, nonlinearities, and modeling uncertainties. A mathematical model of 2-D image spatial and temporal evolution applicable to certain classes of targets and target perturbations is developed. A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) scheme is proposed to control the multi-body, multi-input and multi output nonlinear systems with joints represented by a turret-barrel model which consists of two subsystems: two motors driving two loads (turret and barrel) coupled by nonlinear dynamics. Simulation results verify the desired system tracking performance. Then, as a verification and demonstration, the designed FLC is implemented into a PICC microcontroller to control a Dc motor.

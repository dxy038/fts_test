We present a general framework for the design of a mother wavelet best adapted to a specific signal or to a class of signals. The filterÂ´s coefficients are obtained via optimization of a smooth objective function. We develop an unconstrained gradient-based optimization algorithm for a discrete wavelet transform. The algorithm is extended to the joint optimization of the mother wavelet and of the wavelet packets basis.

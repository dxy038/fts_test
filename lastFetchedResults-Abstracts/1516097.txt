This paper presents the bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method for
the design of two-phase composite materials with optimal properties of stiffness and thermal
conductivity. The composite material is modelled by microstructures in a periodical base cell
(PBC). The homogenization method is used to derive the effective bulk modulus and thermal
conductivity. BESO procedures are presented to optimize the two individual properties and
their various combinations. Three numerical examples are studied. The results agree well with
those of the benchmark microstructures and the Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds.

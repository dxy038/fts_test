About decades ago, personal computers weren´t portable and cell phones were rare luxuries. Today, take a quick glance at the 3C stores; many electronic mobile devices are portable. Actually, a legendary manufacturing company, Corning, has developed a special glass product, named Gorilla Glass, which designed the glass for electronic lifestyles or 3C products[2]. Such products are: tablets, smartphones, MP3 players and other electronic wonders in the open market, which may suffer damage everyday by human neglects. Corning´s Gorilla Glass (GG) stands up to abuse with scratch, and impact-resistant qualities. And Corning´s approach allows the glass to be incredibly thin, and won´t interfere with capacitance touch screens or add significant weight to a specific device. This research focus on preference of GG, and possible impacts for different groups of people. In our research, we collected more than 300 cases from the telephone survey during Jan., 2012 and March, 2012. Total of 200 cases complied with the conditions. To probe mainly into the relationship between GG Confidence level and 3 different group of peoples: IT Administrator (IT), Multimedia Specialist (MS), and College Student (CS). The profiles of contingency table were used to explore the potential preference for many popular protective shield technologies for mobile devices. That is the reason why we are probe into this highly competitively market with brilliant products, and hope to offer an objective suggestion for both industry and education directors.

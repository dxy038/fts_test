The objective of this study was to assess the preparation of Portland cement with sugar filter mud (FM) as lime-based raw material. Burnability of raw mix, SEM characteristic and phase component of clinker, compressive strength, setting time and hydration characteristic of cement are investigated. The results show that FM can improve the raw mix burnability, and increase liquid phase amount. Less than 20% FM is helpful to promote the C3S formation, and heighten the C3S content in clinker. More than 20% FM will result in the new phase formation. Compressive strength, setting time and hydration characteristic of cement all are related to the replacement ratio of limestone with FM. It is found that the proper FM amount can raise the compressive strength, cut down the setting time, and promote the cement hydration in the initial and acceleration period. Excessive FM will lead to the decrease of compressive strength, the delay of setting time and prolongation of cement hydration.

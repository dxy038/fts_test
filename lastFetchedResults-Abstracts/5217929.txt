The objective of this work is to enhance performances of active sonar in reverberation limited conditions by means of specific waveforms and space time processing techniques. We focus on the performances of comb spectrum waveforms, merging the advantages of both HFM and CW codes: their broadband characteristics enable good detection performances (good temporal resolution) the reverberation direction of arrival is spatially limited and it can be rejected with spatial processing techniques. We compare the results of comb transmissions with adaptive and conventional beamforming

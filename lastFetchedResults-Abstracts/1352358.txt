Background: Magnetized water has made many improvements in industry, agriculture and medicine. However its utilization in medicine still remains controversial. Objective: In this study we aimed to investigate the effects of magnetized water on height of epithelial cells in pre-implantation stage endometrium and fallopian tube and number of corpus lutea in female mice. Materials and Methods: Eighty female NRMI mice were recruited to this experimental study and randomly divided into two groups: the control group which drank normal water and the experimental (case) group which drank magnetized water for 2 weeks. Super-ovulation was induced in these mice and then they were mated with male mice as well. Samples of ovary, uterus and fallopian tube were obtained at the pre-implantation stage. Then, after preparation, the number of corpus lutea in each ovary was counted and the height of fallopian and endometrial epithelial cells was measured by light microscopy. Results: Data analysis showed a significant increase in the mean number of corpus lutea and the height of epithelial cells in fallopian tube comparing the case with the control group (p=0.01, p=0.002 respectively) whereas uterus epithelial cells of the case group showed insignificant increase in height, in compare with the control group (p=0.052). Conclusion: Our results suggest that magnetized water intake increases the number of corpus lutea and the height of fallopian tube epithelial cells. Further research is needed to determine whether this will increase in the success rate of fertility

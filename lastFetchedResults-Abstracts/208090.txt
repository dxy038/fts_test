Introduction and Objective:
Burning is one of the worst
traurnas that a person might
experience in his/her life. In
addition to remarkable physical
and psychological
complications, extensive
burning involves expenses for
both the patient's family and the
society. This study was carried
out to determine the causes
and materials related to burning
among the patients hospitalized
in the burning ward of Shahid
Beheshti Hospital In Yasuj.
Materials and Methods:
Subjects of the study were 104
patients suffering from burning
who were hospitalized in the
burning ward of Shahid
Beheshti Hospital in Yasuj. For
data collection. a questionnaire
interview with the patients or
review the medical charts The
data were analyzed by SPSS
software.
Results: Findings showed that
66,4% of the cases were
accidental burning and 346%
cases were self-burning. The
major substance rn the
accidental cases included hot
liquids, mainly boiling water and
tea, and the major material
used in self-burning was oil
24% of patients were children
under the age of 13 and
burning among this group was
accidental. 97.2 percent of all
the self-burning cases were
among women, while 58.8% of
the accidental burning cases
occurred among men. 86.6% of
accidental cases happened due
to nonobservance of safety
rules and 55.6% of the selfburning
cases were under the
influence of familial conflict,
especially lack of
understanding among spouses.
A statistically significant
relationship was found between
the type of burning and age,
sex. body surface area
(percentage), depth of burning
and mortality rate.
Conclusion Children are
among the groups mostly
susceptible to accidental
burning. These cases usually
occur at home. This type of
burning can be prevented
through general training for
appropnate use of combustible
materials and observing the
associated safety rules. In
order to offer consultative
programs, self-burning cases
require psychological and
sociological considerations

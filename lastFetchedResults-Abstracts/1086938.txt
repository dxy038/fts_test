Background: Although tooth decay is a preventable disease, it is one of the most common childhood diseases that influences on children's health. Caring behaviors have a significant effect on prevalence of this disease.  The objective of this study was to investigate the tooth decay status of 2-5 year children and the role of their mother's’ caring behaviors.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 211 children aged 2-5 years and their mothers in Hamadan, Iran.  Mothers completed questions about their own oral self- care and their children’s oral caring behaviors.  Clinical examination of children’ oral health was carried by a trained dentist.
Results: Dental carrier was observed in 83% of the children. There was a relationship between mothers’ and children’s dental visit. The perceived barriers explained 14% of the variance in mothers’ caring behaviors.
Conclusion: In policy setting on oral health of children more emphasis should be placed on mothers’ own oral health behaviors and improving mothers’ skills to remove barriers of caring behaviors.

Background & Aims: Hwnan cystic Echinococcosis (CE) caused by larval stage of Echinococcus
granulosus, has a cosmopolitan distribution and is particularly more prevalent in rural regions. Iran is an
endemic focus for CE and humancases are reported regularly from medical centers in different parts of Jran
including Kerman. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of hydatidosis among rural
communities in Shahdadand Chatroud in Kermanprovince.
Methods: A total of 451 individuals (87 males and 364 females) were selected by randomized cluster
sampling between 2006 and 2007. Demographic features were recorded in a questionnaire and abdominal
ultrasonography was carried out. Then 5 ml venous blood sample was collected for ELISA test. Data were
analyzed usingChi-square test and Multivariate logistic regression for risk factors analysis.
Results: Two hydatidcases (0.4%) were detected by ultrasonography. Serological results showed 8.8% (37
cases) seropositivity, and females (9.7%) were more positive than males (4.9%). There was a significant
difference in CE prevalence in different age groups (p=O.012). Results showed the seroprevalence of 8.5%
and 9% in Shahdad and Chatroud respectively and therewas no significant difference in CE prevalence rates
between the two regions. Multivariate logistic regression showed that females were 4.6 times more likely to
be infected than males (OR=4.6, 95% CI=1.27-16.79). Proper washing of vegetables decreased the
probability of infection by 71% (OR=O.29, 95% CI=O.l3-0.65).Dog ownership was not a significant risk
factor of CE (OR=0.28, 95% CI=O.06-I.22, P=0.09). Housewives (9.6%) and farmers (9.1%) were more
seropositve than other groups.
Canclusion: The study showed that seroprevalence of hydatid disease is relatively high in rural regions of
Shahdad and Chatroud.

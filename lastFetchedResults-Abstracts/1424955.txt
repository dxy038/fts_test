Background: Social phobia frequently occurs in the general population but is probably underreported due to comorbid disorders which mask the social phobia. Another reason might be that patients do not consult their general pratitioner due to embarrassment or an estimation of their condition. There are several treatments available for social phobia, but not enough is known about the efficacy of the different treatments strategies. Methods: A retrospective, medical record-based study was carried out in four outpatient clinics specializing in treatment of anxiety disorders to investigate the characteristics of 64 patients with a DSM-IV axis diagnosis of social phobia who seeked help for their problems. Therapies for social phobia within these clinics and differences between these clinics were evaluated. Results: Men with a high educational level tended to seek more help and comorbid disorders tended to cause more impairment in functioning. Further, there is a large delay between onset and therapy attendance (mean 14 years). Finally, there was consistency in the treatment of social phobia in these four clinics which consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy and/or medication. Limitations: The study is retrospective and based on medical records which means there was no objective measurement of the effectiveness of the therapies. Conclusions: Seventy-five percent of patients improved after treatment independent of the kind of therapy, the occurrence of comorbid disorders and the type of social phobia.

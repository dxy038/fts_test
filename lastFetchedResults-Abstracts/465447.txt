OBJECTIVE: The coculture of human embryos with epithelial cells may improve both embryo quality and pregnancy rates. In this current study we tested the efficacy of coculture with the buffalo rat liver cell line on pregnancy rates in women with a potentially poor prognosis for success with in vitro fertilization (previous in vitro fertilization failure, advanced maternal age, increased early follicular follicle-stimulating hormone levels, and anovulation). STUDY DESIGN: This prospective controlled study evaluated a total of 203 women (135 coculture, 68 controls) undergoing in vitro fertilization. Implantation rates per embryo, clinical pregnancy rates, and continuing/delivered pregnancy rates were analyzed. RESULTS: Buffalo rat liver cells, which are commercially available, are stable in coculture. Implantation rates (number of sacs with fetal heart motion per embryos transferred) were similar for coculture (19%) and control (18%) embryos. No difference in the rate of continuing/delivered pregnancies per retrieval was noted (17% coculture vs 14% control) in the group with advanced maternal age, but coculture caused a trend toward improved pregnancy rates in the group with ovulatory dysfunction (43% coculture vs 14% control) and the group with previous in vitro fertilization failure (34% coculture vs 28% control). CONCLUSION: This is the first published controlled study to our knowledge that reports the use of the buffalo rat liver cell coculture for human in vitro fertilization in a large number of patients. Our data support consideration of buffalo rat liver coculture for in vitro fertilization for women with previous in vitro fertilization failure and possibly for patients with oocyte or ovulatory dysfunction.

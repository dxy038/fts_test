Logistics service suppliers play a very important role in culturing the competition capacity of an enterprise, so it is very important to study the methods of logistics service suppliers selection. First, a comprehensive evaluation index system of logistics service providers selection is put forward in the paper. Then, In order to overcome the lack of previous evaluation methods, projection pursuit method based on genetic algorithm for the uncertain and high-dimensional nature of the evaluation indicator data of logistics service suppliers is suggest whose essence is a dimensionality reduction technology in order to meet the purpose of analyzing high-dimensional and non-linear data in the low-dimensional space. The model can determine the index objective weights result directly from sample data of candidate schemes themselves, and can avoid the subjective negative impact on conclusion in subjective evaluation methods. Finally, the system is illustrated by example. The results prove that this method is feasible and could provide a basis for the enterprise to select a logistics provider scientificity and accuracy.

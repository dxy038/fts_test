Inroduction & Objective: Vitamins are organic compounds which are essential for normal growth and metabolic activities in fish and shrimp. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary vitamins E and B2 on growth performance of Acipenser nudiventris fingerlings.
Materials and Methods: The feeding trial was conducted by a completely randomized design with six treatments. Acipenser nudiventris fingerlings with the initial mean weight of 30±1.5 g (mean±SD) were fed five experimental diets for 8 weeks; diet one supplemented with vitamin E (300 mg/kg), diet 2 supplemented with riboflavin (B2) (20mg/kg), diet 3 supplemented with vitamin E (300 mg/kg) and riboflavin (B2) (15 mg/kg), diet 4 supplemented with vitamin E (300 mg/kg) and riboflavin (B2) (20 mg/kg) and diet 5 supplemented with vitamin E (300 mg/kg) and riboflavin (B2) (25 mg/kg). A control group was also used that was fed a diet lacking vitamin E and B2. Blood parameters including RBC, WBC, hemoglobin and hematocrit and Immune system indicator (Lysosyme, IgM and Compliment) were determined.
Results: The result showed.  Increasing of vitamin E and Riboflavin were influenced on blood and immune system fish. Fish fed 300 mg/ kg dietary had highest erythrocyte, lysosyme activity, IgM, total immunoglobulin. Amount of hemoglobin and compliment activity in fish fed with 20 mg/kg riboflavin showed significant difference with control group (P < 0/05). The result indicated blood in dices and immune system were improved by mixed of 300 and 20 mg/ kg vitamin E and dietar also these parameters were improved by addition 300 and 200 mg/ kg vitamin E and Riboflavin separately in diets.

The application of the criteria established by Y.D. Song and J.N. Anderson (1992) are applied to robotic systems. Performance analysis based on these criteria are given. A particular objective is to derive new adaptive and robust control strategies, which ensure stable path tracking and allow adjustable rates-of-convergence (ROCs). To this end, the concepts of rate function and rate transformation are introduced. Adaptive tracking with adjustable ROC is described

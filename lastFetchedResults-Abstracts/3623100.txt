In this paper, we consider multiprocessor implementation of real-time recursive digital signal processing algorithms. The objective is to devise a periodic schedule, and a fully static task assignment scheme to meet the desired throughput rate while minimizing the number of processors. Toward this goal, we propose a notion called cutoff time. We prove that the minimum-processor schedule can be found within a finite time interval bounded by the cutoff time. As such the complexity of the scheduling algorithm and the allocation algorithm can be significantly reduced. Next, taking advantage of the cutoff time, we derive efficient heuristic algorithms which promise better performance and less computation complexity compared to other existing algorithms. Extensive benchmark examples are tested which yield most encouraging results.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

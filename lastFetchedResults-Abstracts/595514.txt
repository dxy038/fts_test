Objective: The aim of present study was to assess the impact of exercise in trained and untrained exercise performers on serum iron, blood haemoglobin and cardiac efficiency through quantified exercise on Harvard Steps. Methodology: The present study was carried out on 13 male medical students and compared it with 10 male athletes in the age group of 18 to 25 years at Dr. Sampurnanand Medical College, Jodhpur. The biochemical parameter was serum iron and hemodynamic parameters measured were hemoglobin, pulse rate and blood pressure in both the groups after overnight rest and after quantified bout of exercise for 5 minutes on Harvard step. Result: Serum iron fell from pre-exercise level and was more marked (P<0.01) in untrained. After exercise there was significant rise (P<0.001) of hemoglobin and pulse rate in untrained (P<0.001). A significant increase in systolic blood pressure in case of untrained boys (p<0.01) and athletes (p<0.001) was observed. Whereas decrease in diastolic blood pressure was observed in both the groups but decrease in diastolic blood pressure were more marked in athletes (P<0.001). Conclusion: Exercise induces improvement in hemodynamic status.

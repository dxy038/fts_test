Background and Aim: One of the most important indices for the evaluation of services provided in different health and treatment sections qualitatively is the satisfaction rate of clients toward the offered services. The main objective of this study was to examine the satisfaction rate of patients, referred to Endodontic Department of Guilan dental faculty, to root canal therapy.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive cross - sectional study, conducted in Guilan dental faculty in 2003-2004, 78 patients, 35 males and 43 females, were studied. Data were collected on patients' satisfaction rate through a questionnaire using split - half method and confidence coefficient of 10%. Finally, 67 subjects were selected. The relationship between different variables was calculated through SPSS (Version 11.5) program and x 2 analysis.
Results: The highest satisfaction levels were related to the following cases:
- Students' behaviour toward patients.
- Faculty staffs behaviour toward patients.
There was a relatively lower satisfaction to the following cases:
- Waiting time to take turns for endodontic treatments.
- Waiting time since the completion of medical record until the beginning of treatment. - Received expenses for the treatment.
- Welfare facilities (Parking lot, Hygenic service, waiting room).
Conclusion: Comparing the present study to the previous ones suggests the general satisfaction of all clients referred to endodontic department, however; the mentioned deficiencies should be investigated and corrected as soon as possible.

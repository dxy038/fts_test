The paper presents analysis of multiple description coding (MDC) algorithm with spatial division of video stream into substreams. Two objective quality criteria Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Video Quality Metric (VQM) were used for rating of video quality. In case when network losses affect on any video substreams full picture is restored with using of linear interpolation. Presented results demonstrate high efficiency of the MDC algorithm up to 50% losses of information.

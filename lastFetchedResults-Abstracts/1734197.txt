Objective: the objective of this study is to prepare high vinyl copolymers containing various levels of styrene and butadiene, and also to prepare random butadiene in high styrene content styrene–butadiene copolymers (SBR) while controlling the styrene block length. These materials could be used in race tread applications. Summary: This reports presents the synthesis and characterization of random, high vinyl copolymers containing styrene and butadiene (SBR's). The styrene content of these SBR's ranged from 10 to 80%. These SBR's were synthesized via anionic polymerization initiated by a catalyst system with a ratio of 1/0.4/5 of n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) to sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) to N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). Kinetic data as well as NMR and ozonolysis techniques confirm that random SBR copolymers are being produced for low styrene content polymers. The glass transition temperature (Tg), increased dramatically as the styrene content was increased. The amount of vinyl based upon the polymer's total composition within the copolymer was found to decrease linearly as you increase the amount of styrene in the polymer. TGA results show that high styrene content polymers degrade at lower temperatures. The RPA confirms that as the styrene content increases, the elastic modulus decreases. As the frequency increased, the tan delta decreased for each polymer. Tan delta does not appear to be a function of styrene content. TEM results helped to describe polymer microstructure.

In this paper, a new policy is introduced to determine and adapt the generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) network topology based on the current traffic load. The objective of the new policy is to minimize the costs involving bandwidth, switching and signaling. The new policy is based on a threshold criterion. The policy is split into two levels, the first deals with the MPLS network and the second with the lightpath level. The two thresholds depends on the cost coefficients and the number of the intermediate hops. Our policy also performs a filtering control to avoid oscillations which occur due to highly variable traffic. The proposed policy has been evaluated by simulation and numerical results, which show its effectiveness and the achieved performance improvement.

This paper describes a technique for mapping objects such as insects and plants that exist in the field on a blank map in mobile learning. We propose to use man&#8217;s geographic recognition in addition to a GPS for mapping objects. With the help of man&#8217;s ability to recognize placement of objects and geographical relations between objects, objective geographic information with small error given by a GPS is effectively compensated. A mobile map-making learning system has been developed. Usability studies of the system and the map produced by the system are also provided.

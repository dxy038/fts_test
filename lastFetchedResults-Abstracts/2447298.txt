Finally, 407 questionnaires were analyzed.
Results: Coach evaluation priority was leadership skills & technical skills, and special skills & practical skills have been equal priority, and finally, communication skills were final priority. In the desired status, difference between the five groups at all examined criteria was significant (P < 0.05). In this assessment, there were not correlations between current and optimal status in these assessments (P < 0.001). In other word, special and practical skills of coaches are considered with equal priority and the last criterion is their communication skills. Whereas most coaches are evaluated on their leadership skills, according to findings, it’s appropriate that this assessment be made based on their special skills and their leadership skills.

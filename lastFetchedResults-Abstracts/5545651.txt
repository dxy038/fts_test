Software risk management is the practice of assessing and controlling risks that affects the software projects, process or products. Those who practice risk management agreed that it is must be performed regularly throughout the lifecycle of a software system. But one of the main challenges in dealing with software risks is to provide a visual risk assessment tool. This paper intends to report on the visualization tool development based on a traditional software development process model &#8212; &#8220;Waterfall Model&#8221;. This paper also shows the proposed framework and structured approach for this tool. The objective of this research is to construct a visualization tool for software risk assessment for all phases in software development processes.

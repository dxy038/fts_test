In this work the problem of camera placement for automated visual inspection is studied under a multi-objective framework. Reconstruction accuracy and operational costs are incorporated into our methodology as separate criteria to optimize. Our approach is based on the initial assumption of conflict among the considered objectives. Hence, the expected results are in the form of Pareto optimal compromise solutions. In order to solve our optimization problem an evolutionary based technique is implemented. Experimental results confirm the conflict among the considered objectives and offer important insights into the relationships between solution quality and process efficiency for high-accurate 3D reconstruction systems.

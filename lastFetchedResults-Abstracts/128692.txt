Objective: In many cases of thyroid disease effective therapy requires surgery which is indicated when medical treatment fails. However, surgery may be associated with serious complications. Statistics from different medical centers help us estimate the incidence and prevalence of complications. These complications may present as early or late compications. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, development of thyroid storm, hypocalcaemia, and hemorrhage are of primary concern to both the surgeon and the patient. This study was undertaken to evaluate the complications and its causes in theyroidectomy 259 patients treated from 1993 to 1999 in Baqiyatallah hospital.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 259 patients who had undergone thyroidectomy between 1993 and 1999 at our medical center. There were 62 males and 197 females. Mean age was 35.4± 4.1 years. Mean hospitalization time was 6.65± 4.8 days. The most common type of surgery was unilateral lobectomy and isthmectomy 198 (76.5%).
Results: There was no mortality. The recurrent laryngeal nerve was cut in 2 cases (0.8%), and 3 patients (1.2%) experienced thyroid storms. Seven patients (27%) suffer from permanent hypoparathyroidism.
Conclusions: When patients executed properly, throidectomy complications may be lower than previously reported.

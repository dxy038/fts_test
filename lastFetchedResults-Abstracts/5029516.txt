This paper presents an advanced algorithm for optimal motion planning of non-holonomic mobile robots in presence of multi obstacles. The proposed method is based on optimal control theory. To formulate optimal control problem, an appropriate objective function is assumed and the full nonlinear dynamic equations of non-holonomic mobile robot are used as constraints of problem. Also, for obstacles avoidance of mobile robot in presence of multi obstacles, the appropriate distance potential functions are applied to the objective function. By employing indirect solution of optimal control, the necessary equations of optimal motion planning are derived which can be solved numerically. Beyond the simplicity of our procedure, the presented method is able to plan optimal motion of non-holonomic mobile robots in the cluttered environment with multi obstacles. Finally, in order to demonstrate the power and efficiency of algorithm, a number of simulations are performed which truly show applicability of method.

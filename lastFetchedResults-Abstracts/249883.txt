Methods for improving the quality of all-hexahedral unstructured meshes by node-movement strategies
have, until recently, been lacking. Laplacian smoothing, while easily implemented and well-known,
fails to guarantee improvement of mesh quality and may result in inverted elements where none existed
before. A method for improving unstructured hexahedral mesh shape-quality that guarantees untangled
elements is proposed. The method is based on optimization of an objective function built from the
quality of individual hexahedral elements. The shape-quality measure for hexahedral elements is based
on the condition number of a set of Jacobian metrics associated with the element. The theory of the
condition number quality metric and of the objective function are reviewed. A numerical optimization
procedure to  nd the improved-quality mesh is described. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate
the robustness of the method. We do so by giving a realistic example. The method has also been
successfully applied to dozens of meshes on complex geometries

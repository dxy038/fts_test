This paper describes a general and robust method applied to the optimization of microwave oscillators. This method is a combination of the harmonic balance method, the device-line measurement technique and a multi-objective evolutionary optimizer. The importance of using proper harmonic loads is considered. An example shows that the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm allows the robust exploitation of the trade-off curve of the figures of merit of the oscillator.

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The world population will likely increase by 2.5 billion over the next 43 years, passing from the current 6.7 billion to 9.2 billion in 2050. Only limited information about the contraceptive practices especially modern contraceptive use is available. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of contraceptive methods and factors associated with modern contraceptive in use<br /><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> A cross sectional study of 288 females selected through consecutive sampling was conducted in Jinnah Post graduate Medical Center family reproductive health care center Karachi, Pakistan from November 2008 to January 2009. Females of reproductive age 16-50 years using any contraceptive measures and giving informed consent were included. Those who with severe debilitating disease, having any physical and mental disability were excluded. Two trained co researchers interviewed the participants for socio demographic reasons. The main outcome variables of the study were comparing modern and traditional contraceptive methods and factors associated with modern contraceptive in use.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The results showed mean age of contraceptive users was 29.49 (Â±6.42) years. Modern contraceptive method was used by 216 (75%) and traditional method by 72 (25%). Final multiple logistic regression showed that a few factors have influence on usage rate including: age&gt;30 years [AOR, 0.426 95% CI0.209-0.865], addiction [AOR, 0.381 95% CI0.173-0.839], and means of information like family planning worker (FPW) [AOR, 6.315 95% CI 3.057-13.046], Television (TV) [AOR, 0.402 95% CI 0.165-0.979] and billboard (BB) [AOR, 0.207 95% CI 0.066-0.447].<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Modern contraceptive method use is very common in our region (75%). The important means of information for modern contraceptive in use were GPs and family planning workers.</p>

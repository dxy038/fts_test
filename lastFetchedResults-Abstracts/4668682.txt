In todayÂ´s Internet world, information is available in large sizes especially in websites with news and article content or blogs. In order to use and present this high-volume of information available on the internet temporary solution such as filters, search and organization tools. All these solutions aim to use the browser interface in the most efficient manner. This process if carried out or controlled by a static web page administrator will require serious cost and time. Hence a web site design that allows to carry out this procedure dynamically during browsing that will enable readers to comfortably make use of articles, news etc. while occupying minimum space with maximum content. The objective of this study is to create a web site with the smallest run-time space possible by using annealing simulating algorithms. As a result of these studies there is a significant decrease in the total number of lines observed and it has been concluded that simulated annealing algorithm can successfully create a dynamic web page.

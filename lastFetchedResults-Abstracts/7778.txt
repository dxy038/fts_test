A solution methodology is described and demonstrated to determine optimal design configurations for nonrepairable seriesâ€“parallel systems with cold-standby redundancy. This problem formulation considers non-constant component hazard functions and imperfect switching. The objective of the redundancy allocation problem is to select from available components and to determine an optimal design configuration to maximize system reliability. For cold-standby redundancy, other formulations have generally required exponential component time-to-failure and perfect switching assumptions. For this paper, there are multiple component choices available for each subsystem and component time-to-failure is distributed according to an Erlang distribution. Optimal solutions are determined based on an equivalent problem formulation and integer programming. Compared to other available algorithms, the methodology presented here more accurately models many engineering design problems with cold-standby redundancy. Previously, it has been difficult to determine optimal solutions for this class of problems or even to efficiently calculate system reliability. The methodology is successfully demonstrated on a large problem with 14 subsystems.

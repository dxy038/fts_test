The objective of this study was to determine the location
of tomato mosaic tobamovirus (ToMV) in red spruce
(Picea rubens) seedling roots. Roots were collected from
uninfected and infected spruce seedlings at biweekly
intervals, ®xed in formaldehyde±glacial acetic acid±50%
ethanol (1 : 1 : 18), embedded in paran, sectioned, and
tested by indirect immuno¯uorescence (IF). ToMV was
detected by IF in infected, but not in uninfected red spruce
roots. All seedlings that tested positive by IF had
previously tested positive by enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay. Fluorescence was observed most frequently
2 weeks after inoculation in cortical and epidermal cells,
as well as in the lateral root primordia. The ToMV was
not observed in vascular tissue, the root cap, or meris-
tematic cells. Virus distribution was uneven, and occurred
in localized, concatenated pockets, parallel to the axis of
the apical meristem. In older seedlings, ¯uorescence was
associated with irregular-shaped vesicles in cortical cells

In this report, we show experimental results on the growth and characterization of InP nanowires (NWs) grown on silicon and SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrates by solid source molecular beam epitaxy (SSMBE) using Au-assisted catalytic growth. Our objective is to study the effect of a thin crystalline oxide template on the nucleation and growth orientation of the InP NWs. Various growth parameters such as growth temperature and phosphorous pressure were studied to control the NWs growth. Structural and optical properties of the InP NWs are also studied by photoluminescence and transmission electron microscopy.

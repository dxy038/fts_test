In this work, an optimization algorithm is presented for nonlinear analysis of space bar structures. The major character of the optimization algorithm is that the equilibrium state with elastic-plastic large deformation is chosen as the study object. Constitutive law adopts linearly elastic and power hardening model. The objective function is defined. The optimization problem is established for nonlinear analysis of space bar structures, and the optimization program is programmed. For the nonlinear problem of space bar structures with linearly elastic and power hardening model, typical examples are calculated by optimization algorithm, and numerical results are satisfactory. Hence, this optimization algorithm provides a new and effective idea for nonlinear analysis of space bar structures and has broad application prospects.

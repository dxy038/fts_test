The algorithm was given for solving a class of integer programming problems, this algorithm generates all combinations according to a certain order of the magnitude of objective function by using a multilevel generating method of preceding for higher place. In the procedure of generating combinations, the algorithm eliminates a majority of infeasible and nonoptimum combinations by using sequential delimitative and combinatorial method so that the algorithm has a higher computational efficiency.

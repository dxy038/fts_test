Customer satisfaction with products or services comes under the influence of the experience of the user before the purchase. In addition, customer satisfaction after prolonged use is different from customer satisfaction at first use. At present, we depend on only subjective evaluation to determine the change in the level of satisfaction of the customer after long-term use. As a result, much time and effort are expended trying to evaluate satisfaction. In this paper, we propose verification of User Experience evaluation using objective indicators obtained by comparing the operation log and subjective evaluation of continuous use of an application software.

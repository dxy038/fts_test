Objective
The objective of this study was to determine whether total serum carotenoids, α-tocopherol, selenium, and obesity were independently associated with oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDLs) in moderately to severely disabled older women living in the community.
Methods

Serum ox-LDLs, carotenoids, α-tocopherol, and selenium were measured in a population-based sample of 543 moderately to severely disabled women ≥65 y in the Women's Health and Aging Study I in Baltimore, Maryland.
Results

Total serum carotenoids, smoking, overweight (body mass index 25–29.9 kg/m2), and obesity (body mass index ≥30 mg/kg2) were significantly associated with the ox-LDL/LDL cholesterol ratio after adjusting for age, C-reactive protein, and chronic diseases. α-Tocopherol and selenium were not significantly associated with the ox-LDL/LDL cholesterol ratio.
Conclusion

Older women who are overweight or obese or who have low total serum carotenoids are more likely to have higher lipoprotein oxidation. Weight reduction in overweight/obese women and increased intake of carotenoid-rich foods may potentially reduce lipoprotein oxidation.

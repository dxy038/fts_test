Under the direction of the European Meteorological Satellite Organisation (EUMETSAT) and the European Space Agency (ESA), space industries within Europe are in the process of developing a new series of larger and more performant geostationary weather satellites. The initial three spacecraft within this new series, which are known by the name of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), are due to be progressively launched as from the year 2000 onwards. The major objective of this mission is the continuation of the European weather watch and space borne atmospheric sensing services provided by the present series of Meteosat spacecraft. To satisfy this mission requirement, the payload compliment to be supported by MSG will be consist of a comprehensive earth viewing instrument capable of operating in both the infra-red and visible spectrum, an Earth radiation measurement system and a search and rescue facility. In furnishing the power needs for these payloads, the power generating element on the spin stabilised MSG spacecraft consists of a body mounted solar array, capable of providing 628 watts of electrical power at the end of seven years of geosynchronous orbital lifetime. The energy storage elements for the spacecraft consists of two, 29 ampere-hour batteries, whilst centralised power management is achieved by the power control unit, which satisfies the payload and battery re-charge demands by controlling the available solar array power. Power distribution for the spacecraft electrical loads and heaters is achieved by the power distribution unit and for the pyrotechnic devices by the pyrotechnic release unit

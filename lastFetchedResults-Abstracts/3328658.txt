The objective of this paper is to find the optimal feed mix for dairy cows at different stages of livestock. Linear, Stochastic and Weighted Goal Programming Techniques are used to develop the models. Linear programming provides optimal solution and stochastic programming includes nutrient variability in the feed mix. Weighted goal programming is used to overcome the rigidity of singular objective function and of constraints. Solutions are compared and found that stochastic programming results are better than linear programming results. Weighted Goal Programming gives more practical and reliable results than linear and stochastic programming.

Policosanol is a mixture of higher aliphatic alcohols shown to have beneficial effects on plasma lipid levels in animals and humans. Over 50 studies have reported significant reductions in plasma cholesterol using policosanol obtained from Cuban sugar cane (Dalmer, La Havana, Cuba). However, other research groups using policosanol from alternative sources have failed to reproduce the efficacy of these alcohols observed in earlier studies. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to compare the cholesterol-lowering effect of the Dalmer sugar cane policosanol (SCP) product versus an alternative mixture of similar policosanol composition. Forty-eight male Golden Syrian hamsters were randomly assigned to four groups and fed experimental diets ad libitum for a period of 4 weeks: (i) non-cholesterol control, (ii) 0.1% cholesterol control, (iii) 0.1% cholesterol diet supplemented with 275 mg/kg diet of Dalmer Cuban sugar cane policosanol and (iv) 0.1% cholesterol diet supplemented with 275 mg/kg diet of alternative sugar cane policosanol. Hamsters were sacrificed and blood was collected at the end of the feeding period. Body weights and food intakes were similar across study groups. Neither of the two policosanol treatments had any significant effect on plasma lipid levels, as compared to cholesterol control. The outcome of the present study questions the clinical usefulness of policosanol mixtures as cholesterol-lowering nutraceuticals.

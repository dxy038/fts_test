Objective
Polycythemia rubra vera–1 (PRV-1) is a GPI-linked protein that is expressed on a subgroup of neutrophils. The number of PRV-1–expressing neutrophils increases in pregnancy and sepsis, or after administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Expression of the PRV-1 gene is also increased in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). We investigated whether DNA methylation of the PRV-1 gene has a role in regulation of transcription and expression of the PRV-1 protein.
Methods

We compared the level of methylation of the PRV-1 gene and expression of the PRV-1 mRNA in normal neutrophils expressing PRV-1 to those that are PRV-1–negative. We also studied PRV-1 methylation and mRNA expression in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative disorders and in an in vitro model of DNA demethylation.
Results

We found that methylation of CpG dinucleotides close to initiation codon of the PRV-1 gene was inversely related to expression of PRV-1 in normal neutrophils. Furthermore, overexpression of the PRV-1 gene in PV and ET is associated with a decrease in methylation of this gene. Among patients with PV and ET, methylation of the PRV-1 gene is also inversely correlated with the presence of the JAK2V617F somatic mutation. In an in vitro model, exposure of KG1 and KG1a cells to a DNA demethylating agent caused a decrease in methylation of the PRV-1 gene and increased its mRNA level.
Conclusion

DNA methylation regulates PRV-1 expression under physiologic and pathologic conditions.

This paper describes precision frequency transfer via fiber-optic cable. The solution presented is oriented toward realising transfer system which will not introduce significant signal degradation while maintaining a low cost of apparatus. The solution makes use of the FDM technique, which enables the transfer of multiple signals through the same optical fiber. Bidirectional operation is obtained using two optical fibres. Results of short-term propagation delay stability of the transferred signal are reported.

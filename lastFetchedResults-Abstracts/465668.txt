Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects on transfusion rates, perioperative complications, and survival of using intraoperative autologous blood transfusions for patients undergoing type III radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. Study Design: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 156 patients treated with type III radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy at the University of Miami School of Medicine from 1990 to 1997. One group of patients (n = 50) had intraoperative autologous blood transfusions and the other (n = 106) did not. Results: The group that received intraoperative autologous blood transfusion had a significant reduction in homologous blood transfusions (12% vs 30%; P = .02). Patient demographic data, histologic parameters, and operative factors were similar between the 2 groups. There was a higher percentage of patients with positive pelvic lymph nodes in the group that did not receive intraoperative autologous blood transfusion (10% vs 30%; P = .02). Seven patients in the intraoperative autologous blood transfusion group (14%) died with disease present and all the recurrences in this group were local. Conclusion: The use of intraoperative autologous blood transfusions during type III radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy appears to be safe and effective without compromising rates and patterns of recurrence.

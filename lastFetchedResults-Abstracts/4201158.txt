The objective of this research is to specify Ischemic Stroke Area by using Digital Image Processing principle to analyze Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) images from CBV (Cerebral Blood Volume) and CBF (Cerebral Blood Flow) images with 5 stroke patient samples. By assigning Threshold level of CBV to less than 2.5 ml/100g and Threshold level of CBF to less than 20ml/100g/min. Our experimental results will be shown in N-Match (normal tissue areas), D-Match (dead tissue areas), Mismatch (blood clot tissue areas) and Undefined area. Then, separate the brain into left and right to compare distribution of Mismatch and D-Match information in order to specify Ischemic Stroke Area. As a result of experiment, it is possible to sort elementary information of left and right side of the brain to specify Ischemic Stroke Area to compare the results with brain specialists.

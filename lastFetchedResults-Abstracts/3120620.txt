Blast furnace iron making is a complex industrial system involving control of multi-subsystems. The ultimate objective is to design a closed loop controller to maintain silicon content in hot metal at an appropriate level. Considering the interaction of the subsystems, a hierarchical model structure is proposed which includes 4 levels of models, e.g., mechanism model based on chaotic kinetics, inferential model based on fuzzy method, optimization models for operating variables and model predictive control method for silicon content in hot metal. This model structure takes all aspects of iron making process into account and provides a theoretical framework for closed loop control of blast furnace iron making.

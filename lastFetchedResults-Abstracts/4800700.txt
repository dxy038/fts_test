This paper proposes a networked embedded computing platform for wearable telemedicine especially devised to obtain an objective, accurate and non-invasive assessment of physical activity. The platform here proposed realizes a tradeoff between feasibility and accuracy of the measurements. The proposed platform can be easily used by both athletes and researchers/clinicians interested in the assessment of people physical performance.

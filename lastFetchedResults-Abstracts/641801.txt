OBJECTIVE: We investigated the frequency of night eating (NE) among obese patients, its biological correlates, and its relationships with binge eating disorder (BED).

METHODS: The eating behaviors of 166 patients enrolled in a weight-loss program were evaluated by a clinical interview specifically designed to detect BED and NE and by the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire. In all cases body weight and resting energy expenditure were measured.

RESULTS: Among all obese subjects, NE was observed in 18 cases (15.7%) and BED in 54 cases (32.5%). NE was more frequent among BED than among non-BED patients; however, in the BED patients the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire Disinhibition and Hunger scores were higher than those in non-BED and NE individuals. Further, between NE and non-NE subjects with similar body weights, fully comparable resting energy expenditure was observed, indirectly indicating the lack of difference in overall daily food intake.

CONCLUSIONS: Although these behaviors may well overlap, the data of this study uphold the concept that NE and BED have different underlying behavioral constructs.

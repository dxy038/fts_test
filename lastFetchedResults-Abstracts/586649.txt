This paper presents an Improved Artificial Bee
Colony (IABC) algorithm to optimal tune of the Power
System Stabilizer (PSS). In the IABC algorithm an
interactive strategy is introduced by considering the
universal gravitation to the movement of onlooker bees in
the original Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to enhance
exploration ability of the ABC algorithm. The robustly
PSS tuning problem is formulated as an optimization
problem according to the time domain-based objective
function for a wide range of operating conditions. It is
solved by the IABC technique to reduce PSS design
effort and find the best system damping characteristics.
The proposed Improved ABC based PSS is tested on a in
a Single-Machine connected to Infinite-Bus (SMIB)
power system through the nonlinear time domain
simulation and some performance indices. The results is
compared with the original ABC based tuned stabilizer
and conventional PSS to illustrate its robust performance.
Results evaluation show that the optimized PSS using the
proposed IABC algorithm achieves good damping of low
frequency oscillations for wide range of system operation
conditions and is superior to the other PSSs.

For the dynamic nature of the grid, the applications need to adapt to the changing resource status and usage scenarios. This is required to ensure that the performances of the components do not suffer. Objective of this paper is to present an adaptive execution scheme for achieving guaranteed performance as has been agreed upon through service level agreements (SLAs). The scheme has been implemented based on the notion of performance properties and by deploying a set of autonomous agents within an integrated performance-based resource management framework.

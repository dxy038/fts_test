This paper focuses on HDTV quality assessment based on MPEG-2 streams at high bitrates. Five high-definition video sequences at four different bitrates (30Mbps, 50Mbps, 70Mbps and 90Mbps) and four high-definition video sequences compressed repeatedly by multiple times are tested by both subjective and objective experiments. For subjective evaluation, we use double-stimulus continuous quality evaluation (DSCQE). We use PSNR and SSIM algorithms as objective evaluation methods, which are full-reference evaluation methods. The experiment results show that SSIM gives a better performance of quality evaluation on high-definition video streams at high bit rates.

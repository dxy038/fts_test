The enumeration and Monte-Carlo simulation approaches have been combined in this paper to form a hybrid algorithm for reliability assessment of composite generation and transmission subsystems. The main objective of this approach is to enumerate transmission outages and then sample generation states, conditioned to each enumerated transmission state, to evaluate the annualized reliability indices of the entire system. Within the proposed hybrid algorithm for generation rescheduling, correction of voltage levels or alleviating of component overloading in order to minimize the amount of load curtailment a linear programming model is implemented. This algorithm has been utilized for assessing the reliability of the Egyptian and Jordanian Power Systems as isolated and interconnected system

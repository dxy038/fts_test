The turn-on delay time of silicon p-n-p-n switches has been experimentally shown to be inversely proportional to gate currents in excess of the threshold value. Based on the measurements of bidirectional p-n-p-n switches, it is demonstrated that p-n-p-n structures with remote gating have inherently longer turn-on delay times than those of the conventional construction having the gate lead attached to a base region.

Background and Objective: Burn injury is not a disease, but it is a disaster with many social, economic and mental effects which contribute to the problem and make it several times larger. Several studies have examined various factors in burn. In this study, we evaluated the effect of L-glutamine on biochemical tests in mice with second degree burns.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 30 male mice were included and randomly divided into two groups. First, the mice underwent general anesthesia and then using an iron plate with 80°C thermal injury for duration of one second, a second-degree burn injury was induced on the animal's skin. In the case group, the mice received glutamine powder (1 g/kg/day) dissolved in water. The control group did not receive such supplementation. The data gathered on different days and analyzed by SPSS software. 
Results: There was no significant difference between two groups regarding weight and serum albumin, urea, and creatinine levels. The mean of serum levels of albumin is (4.93±0.24 and 4.84±0.79) on day 1 and 22th respectively (P?0.4) and in the control group on day 1 and 22th (4.21 ± 0.46 and 4.21 ± 0.45) respectively (P?0.7). The mean of serum levels of urea is (30.10 ± 3.3 and 30.48 ± 4.27) on day 1 and 22th respectively (P?0.3) and in the control group on day 1 and 22th (25.89 ± 0.14 and 25.89 ± 2.4) respectively (P?0.7). The mean of serum levels of creatinine is (0.82 ± 0.17 and 0.86 ± 0.25 on day 1 and 22th respectively (P?0.9) and in the control group on day 1 and 22th (0.86 ± 0.14 and 0.86 ± 0.19) respectively (P?0.4). 
Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that glutamine did not have any significant effect on biochemical parameters in burn. The role of glutamine in burn wound healing has not been established completely, but there is a lot of evidence supporting the beneficial effects of glutamine for treating burns. However, further research is necessary in order to understand which stage of the treating process glutamine supplementation affected.

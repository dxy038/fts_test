We present in this paper, new resolution methods for the selective maintenance problem. This problem consists in finding the best choice of maintenance actions to be performed on a multicomponent system, so as to maximize the system reliability, within a time window of a limited duration. When the number of components of the system is important, this combinatorial problem is not easy to solve, in particular because of the nonlinear objective function modeling the system reliability. This problem did not receive much attention yet. Consequently, rare are the effective resolution methods that are offered to the user. We thus developed heuristics and an exact method based on a branch and bound procedure, which we apply to various system configurations. We compare the obtained results, and we evaluate the best method to be used in various situations.

Objective This study aimed to assess the
social factors associated with self-reported emotional
and behavioral problems among Greek adolescents.
Methods At age 18, a population-based sample of
3373 Greek adolescents completed the Youth Self-
Report (YSR) questionnaire. Results The results from
the multivariate analysis indicated that both lack of
intimate friendships and not having parental monitoring
were independently associated with problem
behavior among both male and female adolescents.
Engagement in sexual activities was significantly
associated with higher YSR scores among both genders.
Absence of academic motivation was associated
with higher YSR scores in girls only. Conclusions Our
results confirm that social factors, including negative
family functions, lack of academic motivation and not
having close friends, were associated with emotional
and behavioral problems among adolescents and
imply the need to develop a supportive social network
for adolescents

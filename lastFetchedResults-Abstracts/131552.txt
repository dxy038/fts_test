The main objective of the research was evaluation of the effects of breakfast on attention and short-term memory of 8-years old school children. The study design was randomized controlled trial (RCT) which is done in a cross-over frame. 38 school children divided into two groups randomly and group one was given a standard breakfast (as 20% of RDA for energy in this age) at 8:00 AM. Before and one hour after breakfast pre-and post test of arithmetic and vocabulary tests were performed. At phase 2 of study (after two days), by crossing over the groups new tests were given and results analysed. All individual characteristics such as anthropometric, socio-economic. parents and teacher's opinion about children activity and school performances, and school average scores were obtained.
Results indicate that both attention ability and short-term memory scores of subjects have elevated at least 2 scores (P<0.05) in breakfast group. but in other group memory test failed, although decrement was not significant. Because of similarity of both groups, we suggest that the promotion of scores is due to consumption of breakfast.

The coordination operation between microgrids (MGs) and distribution network is an important problem when a large scale of distributed generations are connected to the grid. A multi-agent approach is considered as a preferred control scheme to promote bidirectional exchange of information between them. In view of the external characteristics of a MG as a power source or a load, an interactive economic scheduling model of distribution network with multi-microgrid is proposed based on multi-agent approach. Considering dynamic constraints, the distribution network confirms the output of every MG and generation company with the goal of operational cost minimization by decision making. Finally the genetic algorithm is used to solve a case of a distribution network with two MGs, and the result reveals the economic benefits of both distribution network and MGs.

There can be multiple types of data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in order to probe the environment accurately, which are different in the energy, the delay and the bandwidth requirements and so on. This requires that routing protocols for WSNs be flexible in routing selection to meet the transmission requirements of the different data. This paper proposes a multiple-objective fuzzy decision making based information-aware routing protocol specifically for WSNs, MOFDMIA. In the protocol, sensor nodes are grouped into the clusters and each cluster has a gateway node. Multiple paths are generated between each node and the gateway node in a cluster, and sorted according to the different requirements of the data by multiple-objective fuzzy decision making (MOFDM). MOFDMIA then chooses the "best"path(s) to transmit the data with the different requirements. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach for different types of data

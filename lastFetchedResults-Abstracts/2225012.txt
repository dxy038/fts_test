Abstract Background: Approximately one percent of current live births of the world are conceived via assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the developmental status of children born through assisted and natural conceptions at the age of five years. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, developmental status of 5 years old children was evaluated via Persian version of 60-month Ages and Stages Questionnaires. Case group consisted of 61 singletons, term babies whom were born through ART in the Research and Clinical Center for Infertility, Yazd, Iran in 2005. Control group consisted of 61 term, first child, singleton and spontaneously conceived born five years old children whom were referred to Shahid Akbari primary health care center in 2010. Results: 58 girls (47.5%) and 64 boys (52.5%) were evaluated. Frequency of developmental delay in domains of fine motor (47.5% vs. 24.6%, p=0.008) and problem solving (60.6% vs. 34.4%, p=0.004) were more in ART born children. On logistic regression, fine motor development state was independently affected by maternal educational level (OR: 5.3, 95% CI: 1.67-16.30, p=0.004) and developmental status in problem solving domains was independently affected by maternal educational level (OR: 4.88, 95% CI: 1.25-19.07, p=0.02) and birth weight (OR: 7.1, 95% CI: 1.78-29.01, p=0.006) Conclusion: Maternal educational level and birth weight are important factors that influenced developmental outcome of ART born children.

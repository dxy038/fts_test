The primary objective of this study is to assess anthropogenic impacts on the environment by determination of element atmospheric depositions. Bulk depositions were collected monthly, from June 2002 to December 2006, at three urban locations in Belgrade. Concentrations of Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry and the current deposition fluxes of atmospheric metals were established. Fourier analysis was applied in order to investigate seasonal variation of the monthly data set. Nickel, V, Fe and Al showed pronounced seasonal dependence, while seasonal variation of the other elements was not evident. The enrichment factors of Pb, Zn, Cd and Cu were obviously above those who could have been caused by natural processes, indicating a mainly anthropogenic origin. Nickel was intermediately enriched suggesting participation of both natural and anthropogenic sources. TheÂ multivariate receptor model, Unmix, was used to analyze a 5-yr element atmospheric depositions data set. Three main source profiles (mixed road dust, oil combustion and metal processing) were identified and the overall average percentage source contributions determined.

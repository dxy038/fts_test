It is known that patients may cease participating in a longitudinal study and become lost to follow-up.
The objective of this article is to present a Bayesian model to estimate the malaria transition probabilities
considering individuals lost to follow-up.We consider a homogeneous population, and it is assumed that
the considered period of time is small enough to avoid two or more transitions from one state of health
to another. The proposed model is based on a Gibbs sampling algorithm that uses information of lost
to follow-up at the end of the longitudinal study. To simulate the unknown number of individuals with
positive and negative states of malaria at the end of the study and lost to follow-up, two latent variables
were introduced in the model. We used a real data set and a simulated data to illustrate the application
of the methodology. The proposed model showed a good fit to these data sets, and the algorithm did not
show problems of convergence or lack of identifiability. We conclude that the proposed model is a good
alternative to estimate probabilities of transitions from one state of health to the other in studies with low
adherence to follow-up.

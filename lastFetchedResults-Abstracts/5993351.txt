This paper describes a new course on mixed-signal IC test engineering, jointly established by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) of The Ohio State University and Texas Instruments. The course is motivated by the lack of qualified test engineers in industry and the absence of this education at the collegiate level. The course objective is to help student obtain the fundamental skills required for a mixed-signal IC test engineer. The course structure and laboratory developments are covered in details. Students feedbacks based on anonymous survey indicate that the goals are well met.

In this paper, we aim to optimize the sizing of an autonomous multisource system in order to minimize the cost of the installation and to improve the dynamic behavior of the whole system. The multisource system comprises a solar generator, a wind generator (WG), a diesel generator (DG), and a lead-acid battery bank. The modeling of such a system is done by using the power model to describe the behavior of each subsystem. The cost of the multisource system is estimated by implementing the embodied energy (EE) concept. A dynamic simulator (DS) has been developed. Due to the complexity of the multisource system in terms of input variables and meteorological data, the simulation becomes difficult, requiring high-performance computing and moreover, the determination of the optimal configuration is not assured. Therefore, we propose to simplify the model by introducing the design of experiment (DOE) approach. The obtained model has been validated and used to perform a single-objective optimization. This model allows us to ensure the simulation of the multisource system efficiently and faster. An optimal configuration has been determined.

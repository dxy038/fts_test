Background: The efficacy of tele health interventions for achieving comparable or improved clinical outcomes has not been established well. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of home tele health interventions for people with asthma. Methods: An electronic search was performed in three different databases (Medline, Embase and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register). English language articles were selected for inclusion if they met the following criteria: randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a receiving tele health care with receiving usual care, inclusion of patients with asthma of any level of severity, and evaluation of efficacy or quality of life. Results: A total of 24 articles met inclusion criteria and were assessed. The included studies investigated various types of telecommunications technology to support and deliver healthcare from a distance. Improvement in asthma symptoms, quality of life and self-care behaviors as well as reduction in hospitalizations and emergency department visits was observed in different studies. There was a high level of acceptance of using the tele health systems among both healthcare providers and individuals. However, no statistically significant difference between the groups was observed in most of included studies. Conclusions: Overall, home tele health interventions appear to enhance patient access to healthcare professionals. Tele health solutions for asthma care are feasible and well-accepted and increase self-management skills, but evidence for their effectiveness in improving clinical outcomes is not strong. More research is needed to assess the effects of the range of telemedicine technologies.

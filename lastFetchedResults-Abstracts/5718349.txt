This paper proposes a rule based comprehensive approach to study distribution network reconfiguration (DNRC). The DNRC model with line power constraints is set up, in which the objective is to minimize the system power loss. In order to get the precise branch current and system power loss, a power summation based radiation distribution network load flow (PSRDNLF) method is applied in the study. The rules that are used to select the optimal reconfiguration of distribution network are formed based on the system operation experiences. For the purpose of illustrating the proposed approach, two distribution network systems are tested and analyzed in the paper.

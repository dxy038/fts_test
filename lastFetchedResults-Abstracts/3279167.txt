In this paper, we have tried to tune PD Controller inverted pendulum using Multiobjective Differential Evolution by nonlinear equations. The objective was to apply the differential evolution algorithm in the aim of tuning the optimum solution of the PD controllers K<sub>p</sub> and K<sub>d</sub> by minimizing the Multiobjective function. The results of this simulation have been mentioned in the conclusion. It seems that the results be acceptable results.

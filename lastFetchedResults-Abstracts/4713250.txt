Reactive power planning (RPP) involves numerous factors of uncertainty. In this paper, the cost of investment of reactive equipment is selected as objective function, which is based on the system security. And a method of multi-scenario processing is presented. Based on the balance of reactive power division, the model pursues the best scheme under the comprehensive optimal one which has probabilistically the best adaptability according to all the scenarios. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method is validated by the result of both IEEE 14-bus system and a certain actual distribution network with 1206-bus.

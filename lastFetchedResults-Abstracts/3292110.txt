The operation and optical crosstalk properties of low-cost AlGaAs-GaAs-based transceiver chips consisting of a VCSEL and a PIN photodetector are presented. Butt-coupled to a single 550 m long OM4-type standard multimode fiber, error-free bidirectional data transmission in full- and half-duplex mode is demonstrated at 10 Gbit/s.

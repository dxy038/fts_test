A novel bridgeless power factor correction (PFC) converter, pseudo-boost PFC converter, is studied in this paper. Pseudo-boost PFC converter consists of one bidirectional switch, two fast recovery diodes and a resonant branch, without diode rectifier bridge as in conventional boost PFC converter. In addition, zero-current turned-off of fast recovery diodes can be achieved. Operation modes of the converter are analyzed and time averaging equivalent circuit (TAEC) approach is applied to the analysis of this converter. It is found that the voltage transfer ratio of the pseudo-boost PFC converter is similar to that of conventional boost converter, with no relation to the resonant parameters and switching frequency. Furthermore, parameter of circuit design is considered. Experimental results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis results.

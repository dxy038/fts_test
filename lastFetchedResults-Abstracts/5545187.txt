In this study, fuzzy logic controller (FLC) design for tuning some parametric controllers are investigated. The objective in designing an FLC is to determine the rule base of the system and the data base which includes membership functions, set operations, and inference engine. Two designs have been realized using heuristic rule generation, one for a PID controller and one for a lead-lag type controller. The FLC in these designs sets the parameters of the PID and lead-lag controller online. The rules and the corresponding membership functions are constructed by observing the effect of the changes in the parameters on the overall performance. Simulation results show that better controller performance can be achieved in comparison with the classical design methods

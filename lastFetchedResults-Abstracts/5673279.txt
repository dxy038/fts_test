MPEG reconfigurable media coding (RMC) is a standardization activity in MPEG to provide a modular design framework for the existing MPEG multimedia coding standards. The objective of the modularization is to allow easy development, maintenance, and reuse of the coding tools in the standards. We observed that the concept of RMC is suitable for the 3D graphics coding. Since there are many overlapping object types (e.g., IndexedFaceSet in VRML, Mesh in Collada) in 3D graphics, the MPEG RMC framework can cover everything, from object type definition to object compression, in a modularized approach [1]. In this paper, we provide a walkthrough on the use of the RGC framework with the primitive-level FUs based on existing graphics coding standards such as MPEG scalable complexity 3D mesh coding (SC3DMC).

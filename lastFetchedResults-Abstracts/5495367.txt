In order to solve scheduling scheme of multiple supply points to provide a variety of emergency supplies for multiple hit points under large-scale disasters efficiently, after summarizing the existing research, mathematical model is constructed with the objective to minimize emergency response start time and the number of supply points, and a genetic algorithm to obtain optimal solution is designed. Based on the problem characteristics, algorithm uses symbol encoding, and adopts special crossover and mutation operator to ensure the legitimacy of the solution. After time complexity analyzing, simulation experiments both on literature case and random data are done and results showed that the algorithm is applicable to solve optimization of multi to multi emergency supplies scheduling.

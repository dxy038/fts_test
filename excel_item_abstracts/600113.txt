Three patients with synovial tuberculosis are presented. Involvement was in the hand in one patient, and in the wrist in two patients. None of the patients had pulmonary tuberculosis or a family history of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis treatment was initiated only after histologic verification. The cultures remained negative. The patients received a 12-month course of multidrug chemotherapy for tuberculosis, resulting in symptomatic improvement and healing. There were no recurrences during a follow-up period of 16 to 26 months. Our clinical observations showed that tuberculosis tenosynovitis benefited well from antituberculosis chemotherapy.

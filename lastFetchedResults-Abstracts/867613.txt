In this paper we consider the single machine scheduling problems with time-dependent deterioration
and exponential learning effect, i.e., the actual processing time of a job depends not only on the processing
times of the jobs already processed but also on its scheduled position. We consider the following
objective functions: the makespan, the sum of the dth ðd P 0Þ power of job completion times, the total
weighted completion time and the maximum lateness. We show that the makespan minimization problem,
the sum of the dth power of job completion times minimization problem can be solved by the smallest
(normal) processing time first (SPT) rule, respectively. We also show that the total weighted
completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization problem can be solved
in polynomial time under certain conditions.

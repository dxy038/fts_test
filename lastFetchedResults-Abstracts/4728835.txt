The objective of ONRÂ´s Composite Combat Identification (CCID) Reasoning Algorithm Program is to develop a common ID reasoning algorithm to provide high-quality, consistent and timely ID recommendations through fusion of all ID attribute information available in the theater. In this paper, we present an overview of the work in developing such a reasoning algorithm based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidential reasoning theory. Our algorithm has been tested using simulated composite track data with attribute information under a variety of stressful scenarios, and has been shown to be very robust and of high performance in terms of ID accuracy. We present the design and implementation of the algorithm, especially the D-S reasoning using the valuation-based system (VBS) framework, and summarize our algorithm performance evaluation and findings.

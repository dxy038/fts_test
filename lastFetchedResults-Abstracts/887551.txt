National and ethnic identities have come to be recognized as  serious subjects in the late decades especially in countries that have many minorities. There are many factors that influence these subjects, but Globalization is very important in this process. Some researchers believe that ethnicity and ethnic identities have inevitably grown in globalization process, but the other researchers disagreed with this idea, and believed that perhaps we will witness stronger  national solidarity and national identity than before , and personals have combined identities  with no conflict between national and ethnic identities .
The main objective of present research is to  study the  relationship between national and ethnic identities of Azari, Kurd and Arab students in  the state university in 1387 and relation between both identities (national and ethnic) with ''relative deprivation" feeling and ethnic socialization. The sample size of this survey was 687.
In general, the results showed that there is a positive and medium relationship between "national and ethnic identities" and there isn't conflict between them.
also  findings showed that there is a negative and strong  relation between "national identity" and "perceived relative deprivation" and there is a positive and low relation between "ethnic identity" and "perceived  relative deprivation", also ethnic socialization has a low and positive relation with national identity and has a positive and high relation with ethnic identity.

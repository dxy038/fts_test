Watercress is a leafy vegetable of the family Brassicaceae that grows in
and around water, it has a short shelf life (approximately seven days) and it is
consumed raw or steamed.The objective of this work was to study the effect of
packaging film and different storage temperature on the postharvest quality of
watercress minimally processed. Treatments were: packed with plain film
(PD961EZ, 31?m thickness), non perforated and perforated (perforated area
percentage 0.3%, hole diameter 1.1mm) and stored in refrigerated chambers at
1 ± 0.5 ?C and 8 ± 2 ?C (optimal storage temperature vs market temperature)
for 10 days. Overall visual quality, gas concentration inside the packages,
color Hunter lab parameters and weight loss were evaluated. Overall visual
quality, gas concentration and weight loss were significantly affected by
treatment, storage time and temperature. Color parameters did not show a
clear tendency. In conclusion, non perforated PDZ 961 film was suitable for
preserving watercress quality at the tested storage temperatures and in both
temperatures, the overall visual quality was maintained above the limit values
of commercial acceptability. The perforated film was no suitable for the
packaging of watercress at any of the tested temperatures, mainly due to
significant weight loss that reduce the overall visual quality of the product
less than limit of acceptability by the consumers.

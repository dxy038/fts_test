A novel integrated buck-boost and matrix three-phase power converter topology is applied for an AC motor drive. The combination performs some advantages: insignificant stator current harmonics at low converter switching frequencies which result in low torque ripple; boosting of the converter output voltage can be performed enabling higher than nominal stator voltages; and simple implementation of the high performance induction motor vector control based only on stator current monitoring. Its main drawback is the number of switches for this configuration (12 bidirectional switches or a total of 24 IGBTs). However, with the expected breakthrough in bidirectional semiconductor technology this motor drive concept continues to gain popularity

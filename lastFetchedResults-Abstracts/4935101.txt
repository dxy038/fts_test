The environmental/economic/reliability dispatch (EERD) problems considering both economic and environmental are solved by the rough sets (RS) and improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) method. For the EERD problems treats economic, emission and reliability impact as competing objectives. There are lots of indexes used for the evaluation of electric power generation units. Firstly, the RS method is used to the indexes reduction and the formation of the objective function. Then the IPSO method is used to calculate the output of the electric power generation units. At last, the feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated from 8 unit systems, and the test results are compared with those obtained by Simulate Anneal (SA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) in terms of solution quality and convergence properties. The simulation results show that the proposed method is capable of obtaining higher quality solutions.

The objective of the project described is to determine the feasibility of using a symmetrical six-port junction as a six-port reflectometer (in waveguide form) for measuring complex reflection coefficients at microwave frequencies. The results obtained from a series of laboratory trials indicate that a simple modification to the basic circuit may help to improve the measurement accuracy of the proposed reflectometer

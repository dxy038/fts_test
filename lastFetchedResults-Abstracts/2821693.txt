This paper addresses dynamic behaviour of Unity Power Factor (UPF) rectifier for permanent magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). Furthermore SPWM based five level diode clamped inverter also is introduced to drive three phase balanced R-L load. The performance of the rectifier is compared to that of a traditional uncontrolled diode bridge rectifier. The features of the front end rectifier are low cost, small size and high efficiency. Three bidirectional switches are used in the configuration which is switched at only twice the generated frequency. The THD and power factor of the input current of the front end rectifier are the parameters of significance in this analysis. The performance is analysed for both variation in wind speed and also the dynamics of the load. The whole model is simulated using MATLAB, Simulink software platform.

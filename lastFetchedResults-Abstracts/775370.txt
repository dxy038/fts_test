In this paper, we investigate the load balancing problem in mobile
communications by considering sectorization and a hybrid F/CDMA scheme
(HFCS) jointly in the scenario of uneven traffic distributions. The problem is formulated
as a combinatorial optimization model, subject to quality of service (QoS)
requirements, and solved by the Lagrangean relaxation approach. In addition,
Lagrangean multipliers are used to conduct sensitivity analysis. The model’s
objective is to minimize the weighted call blocking rate in terms of the distribution
diversity. The model’s performance is evaluated by the proposed HFCS, which is an
adaptive scheme (AS). We compare the performance of AS with that of a nonadaptive
(NA) scheme, which is a common power control method. Experiment
results show that combining sectorization with the bandwidth segmentation scheme
provides effective adaptive load balancing (ALB). The performance improvement
achieved by the proposed adaptive scheme over the common power control scheme
is as high as 68%. Moreover, under the scheme, the performance improves as the
traffic load increases. Load balancing improves even further when AS is combined
with the sectorization.

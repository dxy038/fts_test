In this letter, both the number of participating nodes and spatial dispersion are incorporated to establish a bi-objective optimization problem for maximizing the quality of aggregation under interference and delay constraints in tree-based wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The formulated problem is proved to be NP-hard with respect to Weighted-sum scalarization and a distributed heuristic aggregation scheduling algorithm, named SDMAX, is proposed. Simulation results show that SDMAX not only gives a close approximation of the Pareto-optimal solution, but also outperforms the best, to our knowledge, existing alternative proposed so far in the literature.

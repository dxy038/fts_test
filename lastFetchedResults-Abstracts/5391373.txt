Without an international quality standard, Indonesian higher education institutions will find it hard to compete against international higher education institutions. European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) is an international accreditation that has an objective to increase the quality of management education worldwide. There are 10 standards and criteria that will be assessed by EQUIS. An appropriate business process design is required to meet that 10 standards and criteria. The business process design methodology, named integrated business process for higher education system (IBEST), starts from analyzing the 10 standards and criteria of EQUIS. The next step is to design a process with an appropriate input and output that will answer that certain standard and criteria. After each standard and criteria has an appropriate process, those processes will be classified by its type (planning, preparation, execution, and evaluation) and its time cycle (10 years, 5 years, 1 year, and 6 months). In addition to primary business process design, a human resources business process design is also needed as one of supporting business processes.

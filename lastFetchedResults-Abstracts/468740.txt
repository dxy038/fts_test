Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate fetoplacental vascular tone and response to a vasoconstrictor in placentas of preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies with and without the presence of magnesium sulfate.
Study design
Two cotyledons from each placenta were selected from preeclamptic (n = 8) and normotensive (n = 7) pregnancies. In one cotyledon from each pair, the maternal circuit was perfused with magnesium sulfate. The fetal arteries were injected sequentially with angiotensin II (10−10mol and 10−11.5 mol). Perfusion pressures and response to angiotensin II were compared, with regard to preeclampsia and exposure to magnesium sulfate.
Results
Perfusion pressure was higher in preeclamptic placentas, compared with normotensive placentas (30.4 mm Hg vs 24.4 mm Hg, P = .02). There was a decrease in perfusion pressure with exposure to magnesium sulfate in preeclamptic placentas (22.5 mm Hg, P<.01), but not in normotensive placentas. Fetoplacental vascular response to angiotensin II was not affected by preeclampsia or magnesium sulfate.
Conclusion
In placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies there is increased fetoplacental perfusion pressure, which decreases with exposure to sulfate.

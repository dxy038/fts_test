In this paper, we try to determine the status of the relation between Dahr world and matrial world. The conclusion shows the subjective duality and objective unity of Dahr and material entities. Two interpretations of this duality can be suggested. In the first interpretation, this unity, and the duality supposed, are explained on the basis of different intellectual cognition of immaterial and material creatures. Concerning the deficiency of this interpretation, a second interpretation is offered in which on the basis of the role and contribution of the concept of manifestation, the real unity of Dahr entities and those of material world would be explained.

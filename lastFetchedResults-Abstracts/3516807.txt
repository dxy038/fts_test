The cold-cavity modal characteristics of an antiresonant optical waveguide-type cylindrical vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) are investigated through numerical simulations using a three-dimensional (3-D) bidirectional beam propagation method (BD-BPM) and a full-vector axisymmetric finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Good agreement between the BPM- and FDTD-computed radial mode profiles as well as the mode-dependent radiation losses is obtained. The results of this paper establish the accuracy of the BD-BPM technique for simulating this class of devices and confirm effective-index method predictions that antiresonance conditions for cylindrical geometry devices (i.e., VCSELs) differ from those of planar geometry devices (i.e., edge emitters).

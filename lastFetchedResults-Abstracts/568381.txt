The most Iranian farmers use So2 gas for preservation and color stability of dried apricots, but this gas is allergic and carcinogenic. In this research, there was investigated some materials substitute for So2 for producing dried apricots. The main objective of this research is use of replacement material instead So2 for producing dried apricots. So, in this study Jahangiri variety treated with citric acid, (0.5% and 0.7%), ascorbic acid (0.5 and 0.7%) and sodium meta bisulfite (0.5% and 0.7%) before drying and then were compared with control samples (without any treatment). After drying, characteristics such as Brix, pH, moisture contents, browning index, acidity and organoleptic properties were evaluated. Results showed that treatments affect on evaluated traits, significantly. All of traits also had significant different with control. Diaphanous and bright color is one of most importance qualitative factors in apricot drying. Browning and darkening are count as a negative trait in apricot drying. Sodium meta bisulfite had lowest browning, nevertheless, not only it is unsafe for human life because of allergic effects but also it produced firm drying. There werenâ€™t any significant differentiation between citric acid and ascorbic acid however acid citric introduced as a best treatment for apricot drying because of it is more cheap and permanent than ascorbic acid. Also Apricot drying with lighter color, low browning and softer tissue whit low firmness produced in 0.7% of citric acid treatment.

Background: Inclusion of inhomogeneity corrections in intensity modulated small
felds always makes conformal irradiation of lung tumor very complicated in accurate
dose delivery.
Objective: In the present study, the performance of fve algorithms via Monte
Carlo, Pencil Beam, Convolution, Fast Superposition and Superposition were evaluated in lung cancer Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy planning.
Materials and Methods: Treatment plans for ten lung cancer patients previously planned on Monte Carlo algorithm were re-planned using same treatment planning indices (gantry angel, rank, power etc.) in other four algorithms.
Results: The values of radiotherapy planning parameters such as Mean dose, volume of 95% isodose line, Conformity Index, Homogeneity Index for target, Maximum
dose, Mean dose; %Volume receiving 20Gy or more by contralateral lung; % volume
receiving 30 Gy or more; % volume receiving 25 Gy or more, Mean dose received by
heart; %volume receiving 35Gy or more; %volume receiving 50Gy or more, Mean
dose to Easophagous; % Volume receiving 45Gy or more, Maximum dose received by
Spinal cord and Total monitor unit, Volume of 50 % isodose lines were recorded for
all ten patients. Performance of different algorithms was also evaluated statistically.
Conclusion: MC and PB algorithms found better as for tumor coverage, dose distribution homogeneity in Planning Target Volume and minimal dose to organ at risks
are concerned. Superposition algorithms found to be better than convolution and fast
superposition. In the case of tumors located centrally, it is recommended to use Monte
Carlo algorithms for the optimal use of radiotherapy.

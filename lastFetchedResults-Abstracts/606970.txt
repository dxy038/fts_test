The objective of the present study was to establish the non-genetic factors which affect slaughter weight and carcass traits. A mixed classification model containing the effects of year of slaughter, age at slaughter, month of slaughter and sex was used for identification of non-genetic factors. The slaughter weight and carcass traits data were analyzed using the General Linear Models (GLM) procedure of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) (1996) to establish the significance of the non-genetic factors. The effects of year of slaughter had a significant influence on slaughter weight and all carcass traits analyzed in the present study. The year of slaughter also influenced the size of the prime cuts such as hind barrel and front barrel within the 1992 to 1999 period of study. The dressing percentage averaged 58.40 Â± 2.76 kg which was slightly constant within different year of slaughter. Age at slaughter had a significant (p < 0.01) difference on slaughter weight and most carcass traits with the exception of edible meat offals as a percentage of hot carcass mass. Sex significantly affects slaughter weight and most carcass traits except for edible meat offal as a percentage of hot carcass mass and empty gastro-intestinal tracts. There was variation in performance of slaughter weight and carcass traits due to year of slaughter, month of slaughter, age of slaughter and sex.

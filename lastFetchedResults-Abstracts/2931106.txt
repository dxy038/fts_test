This paper describes a new algorithm for the placement of analog modules. The algorithm is a hybrid of greedy partitioning and mean field annealing techniques. The sensitivities of performance functions are used to compute the changes in the functions during the placement process. The objective function is designed to incorporate the effect of the performance functions in terms of their slacks beyond the design constraints along with other requirements such as area and aspect ratio. The algorithm has been implemented and results are tested for seven commercial bipolar circuits

There are different conditions for routing algorithms in wireless sensor networks. In this article, an optimized routing algorithm is provided with two objectives; reliability and energy-balancing in wireless sensor networks. Through creating optimal routes, beside maintening energy balance in network, the algorithm proposed here ensures reliable information and data transmition to base station. In order to meet first objective, the algorithm chooses a route which increases minimun residual energy in whole network, consequently a balance of energy is created in network and its lifetime increases as well. As the second objective, the algorithm transmits a packet to base station through selected route in order to provide the network with highest reliability. Therefore, the results obtained ensure selection of reliable routes which ascertain a reduction in energy consumption in wireless sensor networks.

Welcome to A-SSCC 2008, the fourth Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference, in Fukuoka Japan. Since it was founded 4 years ago to promote circuits and SoC design technology in Asia by the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society, A-SSCC has been establishing itself as a world prestigious forum for the SoC design in spite of its short history. Initial objective, providing technical contribution to semiconductor design and technology and expanding cooperation and friendship especially in Asia-Pacific regions, seems to be completed far more than expected because many excellent papers and distinguished attendees come from all over the world, not alone from Asia. This year, the conference is held at JAL Resort Sea Hawk Hotel in Fukuoka, Japan, on November 3rd through 5th. I hope you have a great opportunity to learn about the latest advances in this field as well as to meet and interact with other researchers for the future challenges on the SoC here in Asia, the world most dynamic place of semiconductor technology and industry. This year we have 309 papers submitted from 26 different countries around the world, and a thorough review process chooses 116 high-quality papers from 15 different countries including Vietnam and India. I?????????m proud that the quality of the papers is increasing every year, and all of the accepted papers are based on the real measurement results of their newly fabricated silicon chips. The accepted papers will be presented throughout 16 sessions for two days. Some of the technical papers will be published in special edition of IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits (JSSC) next year. In addition, you can experience the excitement of the student real demo of 8 outstanding chip designs at the student design contest (SDC), unique event of A-SSCC comparing with other conferences. SDC selects outstanding designs from the accepted student papers and competes on site by demonstration of their chip operations.

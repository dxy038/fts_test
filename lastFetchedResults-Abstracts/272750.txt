Pores and defects in real materials often have very irregular shapes. Thus, micromechanical modeling based on the
analytical solutions of elasticity becomes inapplicable. The objective of this paper is to present a computational procedure
to calculate the contribution of the irregularly shaped defects into the effective moduli of two-dimensional elastic
solids. In this procedure, the cavity compliance tensor is constructed numerically for an individual defect, and then used
in the elastic potential-based approach to predict the effective moduli of porous solids. Two computational methods are
used in this paper to calculate the components of a cavity compliance tensor: finite element analysis and numerical
conformal mapping. Application of this procedure to the regular hole shapes produces results that are in good correspondence
with analytical predictions

Background:There is controversy about the relationship between vitiligo and thyroid dysfunction.
Objective:To evaluate the relationship between vitiligo and thyroid disorders. Patients & Methods: This was a case-control study carried out on individuals with vitiligo in 2004 in Zahedan, that had it for at least 6 months as cases and individuals without vitiligo considered as the control group (age and sex were matched with case group). T3 , T4 , TSH, T3RU in both groups were assessed and FTI was calculated. Then hypo-, hyper- and euthyoid states were determinded based on FTI and T3 level (for T3 hyperthyroidism) and data were analyzed by conditional logistic regression.
Results: Each study group consisted of 50 individual, 52% female and 48% male. In the patient group, 16% had thyroid dysfunction,
14% of which had hyperthyroidism and 2% hypothyroidism. In control group, 4% had thyroid dysfunction, 2% of which had hyper thyroidism and 2% hypothyroidism. In case group only one patient had signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism but in control group none had clinical symptoms. With statistical analysis was done odds ratio =7 (p<0.05) and the difference was significant.
Conclusion: Vitiligo patients should be evaluated for thyroid dysfunctions to prevent complications of thyroid disease.

Objective. The purpose of the study was to compare the bond strength of AH-26 root canal sealer to human root canal dentine exposed to different intracanal medications both with and without the use of three bonding agents. The materials used were AH-26 sealer, two one-bottle bonding agents (Single Bond, Bond-1) and one self-etching bonding agent (Clearfill SE Bond).

Methods. The dentine substrate was obtained from single rooted human teeth. The dentine specimens were treated either with EDTA 15% or phosphoric acid 37% to achieve the removal of smear layer. The AH-26 sealer was placed on the dentine surfaces both with and without the use of the bonding agents. Bond strength was tested using a single plane shear test assembly.

Results. The SBS values were (MPa): Group A (EDTA–AH-26) 3.678±0.853, Group B (Phosphoric acid–AH-26) 3.470±0.834, Group C (EDTA–Single Bond–AH-26) 4.8±0.865, Group D (Phosphoric acid–Single Bond–AH-26) 5.043±1.022, Group E (EDTA–Bond 1–AH-26) 4.939±0.877, Group F (Phosphoric acid–Bond 1–AH-26) 5.101±1.117, Group G (Clearfill SE Bond–AH-26) 6.975±1.694.

The use of dentine bonding agents improved significantly (p<0.05) the adhesion of AH-26 sealer with the root canal dentine. However, the best results were obtained with the self-etching system. Similar results were observed from the pretreatment of dentine either with phosphoric acid 35% or EDTA 15%.

Conclusions. The use of dentine bonding agents gave higher shear bond strengths of AH-26 sealer to human root canal dentine.

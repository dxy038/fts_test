Context: Concern engendered by a previous study that showed inadequate first aid for burn injuries was prevalent in the community led to a novel multi-media public health campaign ensued to address the issue. Objective: To determine whether this public health campaign influenced behaviour by altering first aid treatment for burn injuries (BFAT). Design, setting and population: Prospective intervention study. Consecutive patients with acute burn injuries over two 4-month intervals, presenting to a regional burn service, Auckland, New Zealand. This research was ethically approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee. Main outcome measures: Demographics, burn size, adequacy of burn first aid, outpatient/inpatient wound care and operative intervention requirement. Results: Adequacy of BFAT improved following the campaign (59% versus 40%, P=0.004). Fewer inpatient admissions (64.4% versus 35.8%,P<0.001) and surgical procedures (25.6% versus 11.4%, P<0.001) were undertaken following the campaign with a corresponding increase in outpatient care. Greatest decreases were observed in Maori and Pacific Islanders, and in children <10 years old. Conclusions: Adequacy of BFAT together with a reduction in the numbers of patients requiring inpatient surgical care was improved by a multi-media public awareness campaign.

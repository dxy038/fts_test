Objective. The purpose of this study was to prepare a light-cured adhesive applicable for orthodontics by mixing monomers and a polymerized reactive organic composite filler (prepolymerized trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate-filler, TMPT-filler).

Methods. The monomer component was a mixture of 3.0 wt% 2-hydroxy-3-(2-naphthoxy)propyl methacrylate (HNPM) in triethylene glycol dimethacrylate. This was applied to extracted bovine tooth enamel after acid etching with 65 wt% phosphoric acid for 30 s. After 24 h in 37°C water, the tensile bond strength was measured, and the data were analyzed with Duncan's new multiple range test (p < 0.01 or 0.05).

Results. The tensile bonding strength to enamel etched with 65 wt% phosphoric acid was 13.1 ± 0.5 MPa, and the thermal stability of the bond was excellent. SEM examination of the cross-sectioned specimens modified with HCl demineralization showed that when the diffusion time prior to light irradiation was only 1 min, a well-developed resin honeycomb-like structure was created in the enamel surface in the formulation containing HNPM.

Significance. Monomer impregnation beyond the etched enamel surface was important for resin-enamel bonding, increasing bonding strength and thermal stability. HNPM was effective in enhancing monomer diffusion and impregnation of the etched enamel surface.

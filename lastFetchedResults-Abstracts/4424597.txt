Antenna designers are constantly challenged with the temptation to search for optimum solutions for the design of complex electromagnetic devices. The ability of using numerical methods to accurately and efficiently characterizing the relative quality of a particular design has excited the engineers to apply stochastic global evolutionary optimizers for this objective. Evolutionary techniques have been applied with growing applications to the design of complex electromagnetic systems. These schemes are finding popularity in electromagnetic as design tools and problem solvers because of their flexibility, veracity and ability to optimize in complex multimodal search spaces. This paper discusses the design and optimization of antenna arrays with special emphasis on Genetic Algorithm and TABU search method. It also illustrates the implementation procedure of Genetic algorithm and Tabu search algorithm in electromagnetic optimization problems. The optimization procedure is then used to design linear antenna array with specific array factor requirements. A comparative study of both design tools is done through simulation.

The main objective of this research is to provide information about the effects of mineralogical characteristics of aggregates on concrete properties. Crushed aggregates were selected with different petrographics from different resources. Aggregates such as, Marble, Dolomite, Tuff, Granite, Genasis, Basalt, Andesite, Lumashele, SandStone and Diorite which have different chemical, physical and mechanical properties were used in this study. The results of the study showed that physical and mechanical properties of minerals control properties of concrete and undesirable properties of concrete influenced with which of mineral. Also, the results indicated that aggregates with flaky and elongated minerals subjected to weathering have a great effect on undesirable properties of concretes. The highest uniaxial compressive strength (33 MPa) at 28 curing days was measured in the specimens prepared with dolomite aggregates while the lowest strength (13 MPa) was measured in the specimen prepared with lumashele aggregates at the same age.

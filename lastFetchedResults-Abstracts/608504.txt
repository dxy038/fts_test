Controlled environment may be adopted for a rapid multiplication of a large number of potato seed tubers. The controlled environment prevents seed tuber degeneration which may occur under field conditions. The objective of this study was to introduce new mini-tuber production system with high multiplication rate and low production cost. To evaluate the superiority of culture systems in terms of tuberization, a split plot experiment based on randomized complete block design with 4 replications was used. The main and subplots included culture systems (peat-moss and sand culture) and cultivars (Agria and Sante) respectively. Results showed that plantlets establishment in sand culture were higher than the traditional system (peat culture). The tuber number per unit area and per plant in sand culture increased by 70% and 44% respectively. Specific gravity of tubers was decreased by hydroponic sand culture. Tubers germination in all three grades, total nitrogen content and percent of crude protein of harvested tubers was not affected by culture systems and cultivars. Therefore, hydroponic sand culture due to low initial cost of growth media and high multiplication rate can be used as a relatively inexpensive method in potato mini-tuber production.

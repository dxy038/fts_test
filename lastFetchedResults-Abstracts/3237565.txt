In this paper, we investigate the optimal allocation of the power in the downlink cooperative cognitive radio network using decode and forward (DF) relaying techniques. The power allocation in DF relaying for green cognitive radio with objective of maximizing energy efficiency is a constraint nonlinear nonconvex fractional programming (CNNFP) problem. We present the optimal power allocation in DF relaying by transforming the CNNFP power allocation problem into a concave fractional program by using Charnes-Cooper transformation. We also present an iterative &#949;-optimal solution for the CNNFP problem using Dinkelbach algorithm. The convergence of the iterative algorithm is proved and numerical solutions obtained using simulations for DF cooperative communications are presented.

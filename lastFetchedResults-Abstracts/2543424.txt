The methodology was conceptual analysis Based on research objective and methodology, tree research questions were formulated as follows: What is Heideggers anthropological look on technology? What are the opposing and approving views about Heideggers anthropological look on technology? What are the educational implications of Heideggers anthropological perspective on technology? The findings resulted from the answers given to the first question show that the technology freed itself from man authority and imposed its culture on him. In his views, Heidegger believes that through art we can tackle this problem. Findings related to two question reveal that philosophers as Marcuse and Lyotard agree with Heideggers determinism view, but some others like Borgman, Dreyfus, Jaspers, Habermas and Finberg opposed to this view and try to modify it. They favor applying technology in life under specific conditions. The findings related to third question indicate that although technology have a growing application in todays education, it is necessary to preserve the genuineness and individuality of students and teachers., the scope of technology (including Art), in its real meaning, should be considered, the technological language should not be a dominant discourse in education and teachers and students should not be dominated by technology

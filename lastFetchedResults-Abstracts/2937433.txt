The asymptotical stability of exponential bidirectional associative memory (eBAM) has been proved based on the systematic stability of the exponential correlation associative memory (ECAM). Although the eBAM has also been proved to possess high capacity, the hardware realization still remains an issue mainly due to the implementation of the necessary exponential function. Considering the practical problems, we employ the current-mode implementation using the exponential I-V characteristic of the MOS diode circuit to realize the eBAM. The proposed architecture for the implementation turns out to be a scalable, regular, and dense design

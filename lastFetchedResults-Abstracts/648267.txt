The formation of hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) during waste incineration processes is of interested because its carcinogenic characteristic. The objective of this study is to simulate the formation of Cr(VI) species under various operating temperatures and input waste compositions during incineration by a thermodynamic model. The results show that the major hexavalent chromium species are CrO2Cl2(g) and CrO3(g). Chlorine and oxygen can increase the formation of Cr(VI) species; while hydrogen, sulfur, sodium, and calcium can inhibit. The input waste composition has greater effect on the formation of hexavalent chromium species than operating temperature

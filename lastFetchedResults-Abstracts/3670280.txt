This short correspondence is a reply to a recently published paper by Verlinde et al. (2006) in which the authors empirically compared fuzzy and nonfuzzy association analysis and, on the basis of their results, questioned the usefulness of a fuzzy approach. Although we highly welcome the critical examination of the topic and definitely agree that fuzzy extensions of existing methods call for a thorough justification, the empirical comparison presented in the aforementioned paper is in our opinion not objective and extensive enough to fully warrant the conclusions drawn from the results. Apart from some general comments on the claims raised in their paper, we present empirical results based on an alternative experimental setup that lead to different conclusions.

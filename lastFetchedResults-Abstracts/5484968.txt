The reduction in size and weight of beam forming networks (BFNs) used in contoured and reconfigurable beam antennas for satellite applications, is a main objective of the whole antenna design. This objective is achieved by including in the BFN branchguide couplers with 6 or 8 ports instead of all 4-port branchguide couplers as in previous prototypes. A very good electrical performance is maintained following an approach based on the electromagnetic characterization of these multiport devices and on the BFN design entirely performed at the computer level.

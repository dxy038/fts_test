This paper presents a strategy for the solution of the WDM optical networks planning. Specifically, the problem of Routing and Wavelength Allocation (RWA) in order to minimize the amount of wavelengths used. In this case, the problem is known as the Min-RWA. Two meta-heuristics (Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing) are applied to take solutions of good quality and high performance. The key point is the degradation of the maximum load on the virtual links in favor of minimization of number of wavelengths used; the objective is to find a good compromise between the metrics of virtual topology (load in Gb/s) and of the physical topology (quantity of wavelengths). The simulations suggest good results when compared to some existing in the literature.

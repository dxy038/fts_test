Most digital cameras use a color filter array to capture the colors of the scene. Sub-sampled (Down sampled) versions of the red, green, and blue components are acquired using Single Sensor Embedded vision devices with the help of Color Filter Array (CFA)[1]. Hence Interpolation of the missing color samples is necessary to reconstruct a full color image. This method of interpolation is called as Demosaicing (Demosaicking). Least-Square Lumaâ€“Chroma demultiplexing algorithm for Bayer demosaicking [2] is the most effective and efficient demosaicking technique available in the literature. As almost all companies of commercial cameras make use of this cost effective way for interpolating the missing colors and reconstructing the original image, the demosaicking arena has become a vital domain of research of embedded color vision devices[3].Hence, in this paper ,the authors aim is to analyze ,implement and evaluate the relative performance of the best known algorithms. Objective empirical value prove that LSLCDA is superior in performance.

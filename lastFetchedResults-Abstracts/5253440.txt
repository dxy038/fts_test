A simple non-coherent solution to UWB-IR communication has been presented here. An all digital differential transmitter, developed in a 65 nm CMOS technology and a simple receiver, developed in a 180 nm CMOS technology, for detecting the received differential signal are demonstrated in the work. Though the transmitter and the receiver have been developed in two different technologies, the main objective of this paper is to show the effectiveness of such a non-coherent solution for BPSK modulated UWB-IR communication.

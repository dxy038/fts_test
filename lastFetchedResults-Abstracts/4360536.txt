Error resilience techniques have already become an important part of video coding over error-prone channels. In this paper, we present an error resilient codec which is based on H.263 data partitioned slice mode. It employs several error resilient techniques including data partitioning, reversible variable length coding, error detection and localization, error concealment etc. In order to check out the error resilience performance of the codec, we use error patterns to simulate W-CDMA channels. The simulations are conducted on H.263 sequences at 64, 128 and 384 kbps. Simulation results show that the error resilience algorithms applied by the codec are effective. Both the subjective and the objective quality of the reconstructed image show a remarkable improvement

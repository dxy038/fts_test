Political thought is divided, in terms of generality and permanence or with relation to a certain political environment, into two sorts. The author divides it into: fixed political thought and political pattern. Fixed political thought consists of a collection of abstract, total and constant propositions in the realm of politics and it has to do with no particular political environment, time and place. Ti the contrary, political pattern is a collection of objective propositions in the realm of politics which is principally concerned with political environment. In other words, political pattern is part of political thought which is presented to meet the political environment, and, by resting of fixed political principles and thoughts, show a desirable governmental pattern which can conform with that period to the largest extent. When evaluating the relation of political action with the two above mentioned thoughts we can say that although there is a lot of relations between political action and political pattern, one can have access to fixed political thought through a difficult political action.

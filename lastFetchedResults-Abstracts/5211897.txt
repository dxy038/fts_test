This paper describes the development, implementation and validation of an extension module to a 4D capable Flight Management System to enable environmentally efficient CDA techniques in a future operational environment. It briefly explains an operational concept that will allow optimized CDA in high density traffic situations and demonstrates that with the developed FMS functions an optimized CDA can be flown in 4D so that a given RTA can be met with high accuracy. Flight trials with DLR´s test aircraft ATTAS, a modified VFW 614 and with DLR´s Advanced Flight Management System onboard, proved a highly accurate predictability of 4D optimized CDA trajectories. The work has been carried out within the OPTIMAL project, a European 6th Framework Program research project (2004-2008) which develops innovative procedures for the approach and landing phases of aircraft and rotorcraft. The objective is to minimize environmental impact and increase airport capacity while improving operational safety.

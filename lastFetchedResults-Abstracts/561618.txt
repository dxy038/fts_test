Inclusion of genetic marker information in animal model is an effective method for identification of superior animals with proper breeding values. Candidate genes for growth provide additional information for breeders for proper breeding programs for improvement of growth in sheep breeds. The objective of this study was to study association of POU1F1 with biometric traits in Makui sheep. For this purpose, 95 Makui sheep (males and females) were selected from Makui breeding station and subsequently extraction of DNA was done according to salting out method from whole blood. the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the 295 bp DNA fragment (a part of intron 2, exon 3 and a part of intron 3) with a pair of designed specific primers. The single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) patterns of PCR products were studied using 6% Polyacrilamid gel and silver staining method. Finally, 4 banding patterns AA, AB, CC and CD were obtained with frequencies of 0.45, 0.073, 0.44 and 0.037, respectively. The frequencies of A, B, C and D alleles were calculated as 0.48, 0.04, 0.46 and 0.02, respectively. Results indicated that studied samples was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0.05). Associations of the observed polymorphisms with withers height, rump height, body length, chest girth, testis girth and leg girth were analyzed using a general linear model procedure. Significant (P < 0.05) statistical relationships between polymorphism of POU1F1 gene and withers height, rump height and testis girth were found. CC genotype was associated with highest withers height and rump height (69.27 and 71.22 cm, respectively) than AB genotype (61.67 and 65.6 cm, respectively). The testis girth was highest in the CD genotype (20.55 cm) and lowest in the AB genotype (13.31 cm). Perhaps result of present study could be useful for genetic improvement of growth traits in this brees

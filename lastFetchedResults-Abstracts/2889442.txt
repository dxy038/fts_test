The main objective of this paper is to make a detailed modelling of a single solar cell incorporating basic operating equations and include the dependence of cell temperature on irradiance as a combined effect in the model. For this purpose at first the change of open circuit voltage and short circuit current at varying operating conditions like irradiance and temperature is theoretically explored. After that, a simulink model is made using MATLAB to simulate the separate and combined effect of irradiance and temperature on single solar cell and the output curves are analyzed to compare the model with used moduleÂ´s datasheet. Then fall of open circuit voltage with irradiance due to temperature effect is illustrated and explained in detail.

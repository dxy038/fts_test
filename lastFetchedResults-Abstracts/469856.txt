Objective
Our objective was to determine whether demographic, colposcopic, and pathologic variables are predictive of recurrent cervical dysplasia.
Study design
A retrospective review of patients who underwent loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was performed. The medical records of the subjects were reviewed to identify demographic, pathologic, and procedural characteristics that predict recurrent dysplasia.
Results
A total of 514 subjects were identified who underwent LEEP between 1996 and 2003. Multivariate analysis revealed that advanced age, immunosuppression, and a positive endocervical margin were associated with recurrent dysplasia.
Conclusion
Demographic and pathologic data can be used to predict the risk of recurrence of cervical dysplasia after LEEP.

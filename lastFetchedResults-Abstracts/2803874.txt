In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) is considered for optimizing electrical power loss for a real hydrocarbon industrial plant as a single objective problem. The subject plant electrical system consists of 275 buses, two gas turbine generators, two steam turbine generators, large synchronous motors, and other rotational and static loads. The minimization of power losses (J<sub>1</sub>) objective is used to guide the optimization process, and, consequently, the injected power into the grid (PR<sub>Inject</sub>) is increased. The results obtained demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed approach to optimize the power consumption. Also, in this paper a cost appraisal for the potential daily, monthly and annual cost saving will be addressed.

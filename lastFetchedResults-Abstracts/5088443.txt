This paper deals with the design and the experimental implementation of a robust higher order sliding mode controller for the stepper motor. The control objective is to track in finite time a given position reference trajectory. The developed algorithm provides a control based on geometric homogeneity with an additional integral sliding mode term which completely dismisses the influence of uncertainties from the initial time instant. Some experimental results illustrate the properties and the robustness of the controller with respect to parameter uncertainties and load torque perturbation

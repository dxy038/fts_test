An open-source software including an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed for processing, modeling and mapping of gravity and magnetic data. The program, called Potensoft, is a set of functions written in MATLAB. The most common application of Potensoft is spatial and frequency domain filtering of gravity and magnetic data. The GUI helps the user easily change all the required parameters. One of the major advantages of the program is to display the input and processed maps in a preview window, thereby allowing the user to track the results during the ongoing process. Source codes can be modified depending on the users' goals. This paper discusses the main features of the program and its capabilities are demonstrated by means of illustrative examples. The main objective is to introduce and ensure usage of the developed package for academic, teaching and professional purposes.

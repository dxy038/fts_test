The main objective of this work is to perform a feasibility study on the geometrical behavior of finger beam of a non-crossing differential capacitive accelerometer. The non-crossing differential capacitive accelerometer has an advantage as to the crossing differential capacitive type because of its linear sensitivity. This paper discusses the effect of a beam deflection in designing a MEMS accelerometer due to the acceleration and the reactive force. From the simulation, the optimum geometrical size found is 200 &#956;m finger length with width varies from 1.75 &#956;m to 2.5 &#956;m.

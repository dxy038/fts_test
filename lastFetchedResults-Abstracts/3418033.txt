A series of tests was conducted in a space environment chamber to determine experimentally the space radiation effects in ZnCdS, CaWO4 and CsI. The scintillating materials were exposed to electron and proton beams of varying energy and flux to determine techniques for reducing space radiation induced light emission to a minimum. The objective was to determine whether scintillating materials could be used in a space-craft to monitor signals from active sources. Electrons were found to contribute to the background light output via secondary X-rays produced in the shielding materials, while protons were found not to have any effect on shielded scintillators. A lead-aluminum sandwich geometry was shown to be the most effective means of shielding scintillating materials.

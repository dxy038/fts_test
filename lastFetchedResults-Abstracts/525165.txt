Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) has numerous neurologic signs and symptoms, including hearing impairment. The reports concerning the type and severity of hearing loss in MS patients vary and little is known about an association of the disease characteristics with changes in hearing status. Objective: To _nd the otologic and neuro-otologic manifestations of MS with the use of routine hearing assessment tools. Methods: The presence of neuro-otologic signs and symptoms were studied in 30 patients diagnosed with MS. Patients underwent pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry and acoustic brain stem response (ABR) tests. The results were compared with 30 healthy age and sex matched controls. Results: The most common _nding was sensory-neural hearing loss followed by dizziness and nystagmus. The shape of the audiogram and severity of hearing loss was associated with both chronicity and disease activity. There were abnormal latencies in ABR waves which were more signi_cant with high velocity stimulus. Conclusion: Hearing status deserves careful attention in MS patients. It may be used as a diagnostic means or an indicator for evaluating the characteristics of the underlying disease.

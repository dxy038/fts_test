<div><div><p>There are conflicting results concerning <em>DC-SIGN</em> and <em>DC-SIGNR</em> VNTR polymorphisms. The present study aimed to evaluate the possible association between <em>DC-SIGN </em>as well as <em>DC-SIGNR </em>VNTR<em> </em>polymorphisms and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in a sample of Iranian population. This case-control study was done on 171 PTB and 161 healthy subjects. The variants were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). <em>DC-SIGNR</em> VNTR genotypes in cases were 12.7% for 5/5, 2.4% for 6/5, 32.7% for 7/7, 38.2% for 7/5, 5.5% for 7/6, 1.2% for /5, 0.6% for 9/6, 6.7% for 9/7 in PTB patients and 19.7% for 5/5, 2.0% for 6/5, 31.6% for 7/7, 37.5% for 7/5, 5.7% for 7/6, 0.0% for 9/5, 0.7% for 9/6, 2.6% for 9/7 in controls. The findings showed no significant association between <em>DC-SIGNR</em> VNTR polymorphism and PTB. All subjects in cases and controls were 7/7 genotype regarding <em>DC-SIGN</em> VNTR polymorphism. Our data propose that <em>DC-SIGNR</em> VNTR, as well as DC-SIGN VNTR, were not associated with the risk of PTB in a sample of Iranian population.</p></div></div>

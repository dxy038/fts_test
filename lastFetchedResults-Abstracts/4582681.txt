This paper presents an original method for the analysis of geometrical and physical properties of parabolic solar trough collectors that belong to operating solar thermal power plants. The method is applied in operating plants, which is a novelty with respect to the majority of the methods proposed so far, used only in the mirrors design phase. Laser scanners have turned out to be an ideal tool for acquiring the surface of parabolic mirrors on field. The aim of our proposal is the comparison of the sensed 3D data with a theoretical parabolic surface. All the phases needed for the achievement of this objective constitute a general framework that has been detailed throughout this paper. The proposed framework has been applied to the analysis of real surfaces of parabolic solar trough collectors acquired in an operating solar thermal plant. The results obtained demonstrate its validity and robustness.

Few studies have examined physical activity in patients who are severely mentally ill. We assessed feasibility and validity of using standardized self-report and objective measures of physical activity in 20 community-dwelling veteran patients, most with psychotic disorders and substance abuse in remission. Test–retest reliability of a past week physical activity survey and the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors interview were evaluated with repeated interviews. RT3 accelerometer data provided objective physical activity data. Test–retest reliability and validity correlations for the self-report instruments were similar in magnitude to those reported for nonclinical adult samples. Some activity measures were correlated with cognitive status and quality of life. Results indicate that self-reported physical activity can provide valid information for clinical and research applications in mental health settings. Correlations between physical activity measures and psychiatric symptoms suggested interesting patterns for future study.

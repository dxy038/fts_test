Objective(s): This study aimed to develop drugs from natural sources to overcome the side effects of many of synthetic drugs. Methanol extracts of both pericarp and seeds of Pleiogynium solandri were used to investigate antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and renal function protective, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects and to determine the chemical composition of the extract responsible for bioactivity. Materials and Methods: Methanol (70%) extracts of the seeds and pericarps of P. solandri were prepared. Hot plate method was used to test analgesic activity, carrageenan-induced paw inflammation method was used to test anti-inflammatory activity, and colorimetric methods were used to test antioxidant, hepatoprotective (by determination of serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase activities), and renal function protective effects (by measuring uric acid and creatinine levels). Chromatographic methods and means of 1H-NMR, 13C –NMR, and UV spectra were used for isolation and identification of the responsible compounds. Results:In this study for the first time,four phenolic compounds were isolated from the pericarp of P. solandri which were identified as catechin, quercetin, quercetrin and rutin[m1] . Methanolic extract of both seeds and pericarp of P. solandri showed strong antioxidant effect, hepatoprotective, renal function protective, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, seed extract had lower effect than pericarp in a dose dependent manner. Conclusion: This study showed that methanol extract of pericarp of P. solandri is more powerful than that of the seed regarding its antioxidant, hepato-protective; renal function protective, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects[m2] . The phenolic compounds isolated from the methanol extract of pericarp were responsible for bioactivity.

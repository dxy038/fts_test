The paper presents a 2 DOF haptic interface reproducing the mechanical behavior of an automotive manual gearshift. As a long-term objective, the proposed system will be integrated in a vehicle simulator. The activities carried out during the design process of the HI are presented: definition of the system technical specifications, kinematics analysis, mechanical design, control of the system and test of the force response

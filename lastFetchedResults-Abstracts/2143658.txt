Background and Objective: Obesity is a major risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) plays an important role in complications of obesity. Although, measurement of waist circumference is a useful index for evaluating obesity and its complications, its increase is not associated with VAT accumulation. Hypertriglyceridemic waist circumference phenotype is a useful marker for visceral adipose tissue accumulation. The purpose of this study was to compare small dense LDL cholesterol (sdLDL-C) serum level and Low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) particle size as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in middle aged women with and without HTGW phenotype. 
Materials and Methods: 90 Zanjani women volunteer in the age range of 40 to 60 years old were selected and divided into two groups with and without HTGW phenotype based on the four common definitions of HTGW phenotype. Precipitation method was used for measurement of serum levels of sdLDL-C. LDL-C particle size was measured by the gradient gel electrophoresis technique.
Results: Although in all of the definitions, LDL-C particle size was significantly smaller in HTGW phenotype group, sdLDL-C serum level was significantly different in both definitions of HTGW-L and HTGW-H.
Conclusion: According to the significant difference in diameter of LDL-C particles and sdLDL-C concentrations based on the definitions of HTGW-L and HTGW-H as well as the role of sdLDL-C particles in cardiovascular diseases, the mentioned definitions are useful and inexpensive screening tools in order to diagnose individuals at risk of cardiovascular diseases.

The objective of this paper is to discuss the performance of a new L-Band, truck-mounted radiometer antenna. This new low loss antenna has been designed to increase the calibration stability of the ComRAD radiometer system. ComRAD is a dual polarized combined radar radiometer system operating as a radar at 1.3 GHz and as a radiometer at 1.413 GHz. It utilizes the same antenna for both frequencies. ComRAD is used to develop algorithms for the sensing of soil moisture in the presence of vegetation. The system is presently being employed to monitor agricultural crops over the growing cycle in preparation for the upcoming SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite mission.

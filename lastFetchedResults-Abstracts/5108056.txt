The understanding of surgical gesture, by means of measuring apparatus, can play a key role for a possible evaluation of the surgical performance and the human factors characterizing it. To this aim a neural network classification algorithm can be helpful, since combines good generalization performances along with a parsimonious architecture when dealing with high dimensional classification problems. So, here it is presented and proposed the development of an innovation in surgical training system, as a fundamental objective support for training of novice surgeons.

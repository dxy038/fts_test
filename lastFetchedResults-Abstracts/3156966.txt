This paper presents a newly developed quantitative evaluation system on hand sensorimotor integration function. The objective assessment of hand sensorimotor integration function should be necessary to evaluate how the affected thumb or fingers move smoothly. Our present study aims to construct the quantitative evaluation system of sensorimotor integration function of the hand finger. The experimental results show the different tendency between non-dominant hand and dominant hand in the healthy persons. Furthermore, the phenomenon that the visual information and the somatosensory information are integrated by the integration function, is found only for the healthy dominant hand.

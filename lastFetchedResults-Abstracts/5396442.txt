A multi-objective, multi-level, multi-product, multi-constraint batch planning problem is abstracted from production of diaphragm caustic soda, and the problem is formulated as a mathematic optimization model with constraints involved resources, work manufacture processes and production capacity etc. Some sub_objectives were considered in the problem model, such as total profit amount, profit margin, total energy wastage and wastage per ten thousand RMB. A modified particle swarm optimization algorithm with a percent-coding and dynamic-bounds coding scheme is proposed for the problem. The validity and flexibility of the model and algorithm are verified by calculating the data from production practices numerically.

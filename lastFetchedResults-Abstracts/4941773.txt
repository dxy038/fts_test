Work currently in progress on spatial planning for a semiautonomous mobile robot vehicle is described. The overall project objective is to design a semiautonomous rover to plan routes in unknown, natural terrains. The authors elaborate on the problem of reasoning with imperfect geographical knowledge and briefly discuss a route planner which uses the results of reasoning with such spatial knowledge. An overview is given of current work on the development for a planetary rover robotic vehicle being done at the California Institute of TechnologyÂ´s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This includes a description of the vehicle operation when everything works as planned as well as an overview of the software system architecture and the functionalities of the various modules

Based on the careful status analysis of the digital Agriculture research at home and abroad, according to the multi-dimensional multi-objective fuzzy decision-making theory, the paper studies 12 main factors which effect model building of the farmland, forming the first level of decision-making indicators. Then, according to the similarity of the first level of decision-making indicators, it integrates into a second level of the four decision-making indicators. On the basis, it establishes a multi-level and multi-objective decision-making index system of the farmland. According to the Analytical Hierarchy Process, it explores the methods of defining weight of multi-level and multi-objective decision-making indicators for farmland, which is from the establishment of the hierarchy system, construction of the matrix structure, the ordering of the computational importance. The rationality and feasibility of the method is proved by the specific application.

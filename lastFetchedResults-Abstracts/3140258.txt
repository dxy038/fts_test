The objective function of the model was to minimize the sum of completion time, number of tardiness workpieces and energy consumption. A hybrid collaborative evolutionary method was adopted to design the algorithm of Job Shop scheduling with parallel machines. In the algorithm a neighborhood-based evolutionary strategy was adopted to improve the population diversity. Finally, feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by an application case.

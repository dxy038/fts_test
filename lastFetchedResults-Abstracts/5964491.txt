The objective of the study is to develop a set of test system for testing and evaluating the working performance of electric nail guns. This paper studies the evaluation methods of the electric nail gun through the analysis of the working principle and internal structure of the electric nail gun. And the performance evaluation indicators of the electric nail gun are proposed. Based on these indicators, a set of test system is developed. And the system includes Mechanical parts and Measurement and control software. The set of test system provides a scientific and reasonable platform for testing and evaluating the working performance of electric nail guns.

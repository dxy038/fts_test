There are many proposed inverter design topologies, which exhibit certain advantages and disadvantages in various performance aspects. However there exist few quantitative techniques to optimally develop inverters to achieve different objectives such as size minimization, power loss minimization and reliability maximization. Without the relevant techniques, the selection and design of inverters are merely based on qualitative reasoning, which are often subjective to individual preferences. Aiming to address that issue, this paper proposes an optimal design method for two level inverters. The design objective is to achieve optimal performance of inverters by selecting appropriate size, power loss and reliability. The specified operation conditions such as ambient temperature, input voltage, output voltage and output power are considered in the design process. Five typical types of two level inverters, namely: conventional inverter, DC-DC boosted PWM inverter, Z-source inverter, Cuk-derived inverter and SEPIC-zeta-derived inverter are selected and analyzed by using the proposed methods.

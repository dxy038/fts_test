Free energy functional and elastic Green's function techniques are combined to find real space solutions for electrostriction controlled elastic field exemplified by 3D Gaussian and periodic model polarization distributions under periodic and freestanding elastic boundary conditions. This technique is addressed to self-consistent solutions for polar systems considered within Landau-type free energy functional approach as the main objective.

It is the truth that spending life on the road is not fun. Therefore, every driver is searching for the "shortest path" for their traveling. Since the real objective is the smallest time frame that the driver spends on the road before arriving at the required destination. Various methods have been proposed to solve the problem of this shortest path under the hierarchical index road network. Unfortunately that none of them has considered the situation of traveling in the congestion traffic mode. This paper presents a solution, called an adaptive travel-time path selection algorithm, to obtain the shortest path where the shortest travel-time has been achieved. The experiment had shown that the selected path obtaining from the proposed algorithm has less time complexity than the previous existing methods.

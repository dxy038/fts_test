In this paper, we intend to introduce a new paradigm to ease the path from the optimization research area towards the operational use: how to inject automation in ATM by integrating several constraints without increasing the complexity for the controller? The fundamental idea is to model the airspace linked to the ground to connect all the possible trajectories through a mesh representing the space of possible trajectories. One objective is to reinforce the realism of the trajectory by combining the aircraft performances to automatic learning and procedural patterns. Thus, the multi criteria shortest path approach with its associated algorithms are used to resolve an instance created from a representative mesh with the possible trajectories for the aircrafts. The question to resolve is then: how to build this instance from the data of a 3D environment by taking into account the uncertainties?

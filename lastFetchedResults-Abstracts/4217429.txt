During the design of the large die casting machine, the topology optimization is introduced. Combined with the factual engineering application, the interpolation function of solid isotropic microstructures with penalization (SIMP) is constructed in the density method and the optimization criteria algorithm is deduced for the numerical solution of topology optimization. In virtue of the Hyperworks code, the mould platen of die casting machine is used for topology optimization design and the more reasonable distribution of material is obtained. Compared to the result of the traditional design, the stress maximum of the mould platens is cut down from 205 MPa to 47.3 MPa, the mass is changed from 23.6 T to 19.12 T and the maximum of the displacement is decreased from 0.29 mm to 0.245 mm and the product technology index is satisfied. The objective of lightweight structure is achieved and the optimization model suitable for engineering applications has been obtained.

We consider a specific ATIS whose objective is to reduce driversÂ´ travel cost uncertainty with recurrent network congestion through provision of traffic information. Most of studies premise on the use of static model for an essentially dynamic problem. The paper proposes a multi-user stochastic dynamic route and departure time model for modeling interactions among drivers. We propose a nested logit model for the ATIS market penetration and compliance rate. The upper level is for the market penetration; the lower level is for compliance rate. And we propose an iterative procedure for the determination of the endogenous market penetration and compliance rate of ATIS and the equilibrium network flow pattern.

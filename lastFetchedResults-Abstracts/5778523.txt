Summary form only given. With a memory-cell size comparable to that of a DRAM memory cell and a manufacturing process similar to that of a stacked high-density DRAM, it can be expected that ferroelectric memories will be soon introduced in the market. The objective here is to summarize some of the recent research effort in this important area. Research on ferroelectric memories is proceeding on three fronts: material processing, modeling and circuit design. We briefly discuss all these activities.

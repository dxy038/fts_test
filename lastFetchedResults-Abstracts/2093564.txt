The objective of the current work is to show the effectiveness of using wavelet transform for detection and
localization of small damages. The spatial data used here are the rotational mode shapes of the damaged and
undamaged plate-like structures. The continuous wavelet transform using complex Gaussian wavelet is used to get
the spatially distributed wavelet coefficients so as to identify the damage position on a square plate. The rotational
mode shape data of the square plate with damage of different sizes are obtained using ANSYS 9.0. Damage
identification for different boundary conditions is studied.

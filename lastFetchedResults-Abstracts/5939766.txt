Objective: To study the function and interaction of genes related to esophageal squamous cell cancer and discuss esophageal cancer molecular mechanism.Methods: The gene microarray date set of esophageal was downloaded from the GEO BRB-ArrayTools and online tool was used to analysis the difference expression genes between esophageal squamous cell cancer and normal tissue, and analysis the functional and interaction of the difference expression gene. Results: 262 different expression genes were obtained, the upward genes mainly involves the DNA replication, the mitotic cycle, the protein serine/tyrosine activating enzyme actively and so on; The downward genes mainly involves genes weakly perishing and splitting up, the immunity and the inflammation response, the cell skeleton and so on. 49 different expression genes related closely mutually constitute interaction network, of which 19 gene participate in mitotic cycle, especially in the centrosome adjustment of the mitotic cycle, 22 gene participate in cell matrix forms and the cell communication; 8 genes are mainly active in the linoleic acid, arachidonic acid metabolism. Conclusion: Many closely related gene unusually express in the esophageal squamous cell cancer, especially in mitotic phase centrosome aspect and tumor and microenvironment relations, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid metabolism and so on.

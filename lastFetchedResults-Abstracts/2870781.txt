This paper discusses the comparison between two modulation systems, pulse code modulation and delta modulation. The objective is to identify a suitable modulation for speech coding by comparing delta modulation (DM) with pulse code modulation (PCM). The reconstruction performance of the delta modulation is compared with the pulse code modulation by using MATLAB, SIMULINK and finally implemented DSP Processor for real time realization. The simulation result using SIMULINK shows that the delta modulation performs better than pulse code modulation. Hence, delta modulator is implemented for real time test on DSP board, TMS320C6416. Delta modulation is successfully implemented in real time realization and can be further improved to reduce noise for future works.

Objective
Although refeeding syndrome has been well documented in starved patients, obese patients, those with anorexia nervosa, malnourished elderly individuals, and certain postoperative patients, little is known about the presence and the importance of refeeding syndrome in patients with gastrointestinal fistula and insufficient nutrition support over the long term. The objective of this study was to estimate the morbidity of this syndrome in these patients, to assess the safety and efficacy of our graduated refeeding regimen, and to emphasize the importance of this syndrome.
Methods

One hundred fifty-eight patients with gastrointestinal fistula during the past 2 y were reviewed.
Results

Fifteen of these patients were diagnosed as having refeeding syndrome. They were started on the refeeding procedure according to our regimen, and changes in their serum levels of electrolytes were recorded. The symptoms and signs they presented were noted. All patients were successfully advanced to full nutrition support. During the refeeding procedure, patients presented with weakness, paralysis of limbs, slight dyspnea, paresthesia, tachycardia, edema, and diarrhea. Serum phosphorus concentration decreased in all patients within 24 h of refeeding, reaching a mean nadir after 3.3 ± 1.5 d and another 6.1 ± 2.1 d to return to above 0.70 mM/L upon phosphorus supplementation. Three patients treated with growth hormone presented more severe hypophosphatemia (<0.20 mM/L) than the others.
Conclusions

1) Refeeding syndrome occurs commonly in patients with malnutrition secondary to gastrointestinal fistula. 2) Alterations in phosphate metabolism are central to the refeeding syndrome. 3) Supplementation with electrolytes (including especially phosphate) and vitamins is the focal point of the treatment of this syndrome. 4) Growth hormone treatment may aggravate hypophosphatemia.

Salmon claims that explanation is an objective affair, and is nothing more than descriptive knowledge of the world. A criterion which Salmon provides for causal explanation as scientific explanation has two foundations: 1. Statistical Relevance; 2.Â Causal relation. In this paper, first, we will argue that the explanation includes both objective and subjective components and scientists use inference to the best explanation. Second, we will state that causation is an intellectual and philosophical affair so that necessity of causal relation is its result. Therefore there is no ontological status for the probabilistic approach of causality.

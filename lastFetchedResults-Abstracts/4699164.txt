This paper presents an approach for design and implementation of cooperative rescue robots. The objective is to implement robots making search and rescue (SAR) action safe and easy. The approach is based on two robots, the latter fast and agile to take a general view of disaster area, the former well-equipped to explore surrounding details. However the robots are quite different in appearance and capabilities, but they accomplish the SAR task with a close synergy. Abilities of remotely detecting victims, using non-touch sensors, interactive user friendly control interface and following a planned trajectory to guide towards the victims are main facts of the prosperous SAR. Different parts of the synergetic system, robots; sensors, hardware, control interface, mapping and localization are introduced throughout the paper.

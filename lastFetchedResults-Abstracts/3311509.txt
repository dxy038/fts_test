We take the first computer course for undergraduate students, University Computer, as the starting point of our discussion in this paper. In an attempt to solve the problem of the lack of fundamentality in public computer courses, we propose the "three matches" for public computer education based on an analysis of the mismatch between the course content and the course objectives. The three matches are the match between the experimental content and the course material, the match between the assessment and the course syllabus, and the match between the course planning and the course objective. We propose methodology and examples for designing teaching experiments for the University Computer course, using virtual reality technology. In addition, we study how to reveal the fundamentality of public computer courses in this paper.

In order to solve the problem as machine allocation, job sequencing and time arrangement, a mathematical model of optimal scheduling is established. Considering the production experience, the objective function of model is defined the minimum of energy consumption as the deviation of continuous casting and rolling and waiting time of material. For the model established in this paper, a optimization method based on hybrid particle swarm optimization and linear programming is presented. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the model and the optimization method, and the optimal scheduling scheme with minimum energy consumption can be obtained efficiently.

The objective of this study is to improve the workplace layout and assembly standard in automotive assembly line by ergonomic simulation of manual assembly tasks. The installation of fog lamps, which involves 120 actions within 58.63 seconds, was simulated using Siemens Jack incorporated with Chinese digital human model. The inefficient actions were found out and the computer manikinÂ´s physiological performance was evaluated by using some typical ergonomic methods such as RULA and NIOSH lifting equation. The physiology workload of workers was improved by re-layout the workplace and work process. As a consequence, the time of installing the two fog lamps was shortened to 42.87 seconds. Comparative analysis shows that the new solution is much safer, more efficient and more comfortable for assembly work.

A fuzzy multi-objective linear programming model having probabilistic constraints is demonstrated in order to make product-mix decision. The proposed model considers fuzziness in presence of multiple objective functions. The most important aspect of the model is that it is able to tackle constraints which are probabilistic in nature. A product-mix problem having real-world data of a food processing industry is illustrated focusing the application of the proposed model.

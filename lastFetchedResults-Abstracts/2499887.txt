Background & objective: Evaluation of the effects on environment is an executive view for sustainable development. Solid waste is one of the factors that pollute the environment and the management, control and proper hygiene play a key role in promoting the health of society. So, in establishing the composting plants, the environmental issues should be considered and a proper place for these plants must be chosen. This can be one of the most important tasks in waste management programs in developing countries. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of these plants on environment and the procedures to be  carried out in this field.
Materials & Methods: This research was a review study. By Using the key words (such as compost plants, environmental impact assessment, Iran) the related articles on Web sites google schoolar, iranmedex , SID, Magiran and civilica were searched and studied.
Results: In this study, Articles in the period 1995 to 2016 were studied and 40 papers were selected. One paper Environmental impact assessment study methods, One paper method Adkins and Brooke,7 paper  method Leopold matrix, one paper matrix math,one paper matrix method of rapid, 2 paper Matrix interactions, the Check list for assessing and one paper  matrix type III.
Conclusion: In most reviewed studies, the method of Leopold matrix has been used to assess the environmental impact of compost plant. Leopold matrix method has been considered by researchers and experts because of its accuracy, surveying in the construction and operation phases, using two-dimensional tables to express the effects of a compost plant project on the environment, determining suitable place And finally scoring waypoint is placed by specialists for more Compost Plant

Pearl River Tower, located in Guangzhou, has 71 stories and rises about 310 m from the ground, which features four open holes (tunnels) equipped with four wind turbines at mechanical floors on two height levels. This study investigated the wind loads on the tall building and the wind speed up factors in the tunnels for wind-power generation based on wind tunnel tests and wind climate data analysis. Wind-induced pressures and overall forces on the building model with a geometric scale of 1:150, including the mean and fluctuating components, were determined and the wind speed amplifications in the tunnels were measured in the wind tunnel tests. Comparative analysis and discussions of the results for four cases were conducted. The objective of this study is to evaluate the wind speed amplifications in the tunnels for wind-power generation through the installation of wind turbines and to gain a better understanding of the wind effects on such a high-rise building with open holes. The results presented in this paper are expected to be of considerable interest and practical use to engineers and researchers involved in the design of tall buildings incorporating wind turbines for power generation.

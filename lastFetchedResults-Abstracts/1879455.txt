The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of transcutaneous immunization with tumor antigen to induce cell-mediated immunity. For this purpose, hydrophilic recombinant gp100 protein (HR-gp100) was topically applied on human intact skin in vitro, and used as a vaccine in a mouse model. We demonstrate that HR-gp100 permeates into human skin, and is processed and presented by human dendritic cells. In a mouse model, an HR-gp100-based vaccine triggered antigen-specific T cell responses, as shown by proliferation assays, ELISA and intracellular staining for IFN-Î³. Transcutaneous antigen delivery may provide a safe, simple and effective method to elicit cell-mediated immunity.

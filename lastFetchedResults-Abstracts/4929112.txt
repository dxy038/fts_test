In this paper, a novel channel equalization algorithm based on evolutionary algorithm is proposed. By exploiting the excellent global optimization performance of the evolutionary algorithm, the order and impulse response of the equalizer are jointly evolved in different manners with the objective function of constant modulus algorithm (CMA) adopted as fitness function. The experimental results on simulated channel show that the proposed algorithm achieves satisfactory performance and robustness upon order information

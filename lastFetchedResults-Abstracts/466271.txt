Objective: This study was undertaken to assess the cure rate of stress urinary incontinence, long-term effects on other lower urinary tract symptoms, and quality of life in a cohort of patients who underwent pubovaginal sling procedures for treatment of incontinence related to intrinsic sphincteric deficiency and urethral hypermobility. Study Design: This was a retrospective analysis of 57 patients with 90% follow-up who underwent pubovaginal autologous fascial sling procedures for stress urinary incontinence related to urethral hypermobility and intrinsic sphincteric deficiency. Objective postoperative urodynamic evaluation was performed in 34 (60%) of the cases. Telephone interviews to assess quality-of-life parameters were performed in all cases. Results: The mean follow-up period was 42 months and the median follow-up period was 34 months, with a range of 0.5 to 134 months. The age at the time of the sling procedure ranged from 18 to 84 years, with a median parity of 3.0 (range, 0-6). Preoperative body mass index ranged from 19.5 to 39.1 kg/m2. Five percent of patients had detrusor instability before the operation. Forty-one percent (41%) of the patients who underwent postoperative urodynamic evaluation had voiding dysfunction. The postoperative objective cure rate for stress urinary incontinence was 97%. Of all patients 88% indicated that the sling had improved the quality of life, 84% indicated that the sling relieved the incontinence in the long-term, and 82% would choose to undergo the procedure again. Conclusion: Construction of a pubovaginal sling is an effective technique for relief of severe stress urinary incontinence. Voiding dysfunction is a common side effect. Despite this problem, a significant number of patients would elect to undergo the procedure again. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:14-9.)

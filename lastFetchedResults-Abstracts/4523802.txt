Detection of broken rotor bars has been an important but difficult work in fault diagnosis area of induction motors. The characteristic frequency components of faulted rotor are very close to the power frequency component but by far less in amplitude, which brings about great difficulty for accurate detection. In the present study, a new method is proposed in order to remove the main frequency component, resulting in more efficient detection of the rotor fault characteristics in the frequency spectrum of stator currents. The method is based on ParkÂ´s transformation in combination with discrete wavelet decomposition to eliminate the effect of main frequency and zoom on the energy of objective fault related frequency components. In addition, the method efficiency is evaluated using Simulations in Matlab.

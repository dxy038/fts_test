This study addresses the experimental and theoretical investigations of piezomagnetic acoustic waves propagating along the surface of a piezoelectric substrate on which a magnetostrictive thin film is deposited. The main objective of this work is to design high sensitivity surface acoustic wave resonator for the development of a magnetic sensor.

In Holy Quran, many of the concepts are expressed in the form of symbols and allegories. The allegories actually make the concept clearer to the audience's mind. Mystical stories which often are interpretive and allegorical have benefited from this style of Quran especially in the light of interpretation of the Quran stories. One of the allegorical stories in Quran is the story of Adam (peace be upon him) that mystics have focused on its implications in their works and explicitly or implicitly decoded it. The main objective of this paper is to study the expression of mystical allusions of Adam in the works of Attar. In this research, we have studied the story of Adam in Quran and Torah; also this story has been reviewed in terms of the creation of Adam, Mephistopheles records, forbidden fruit, and Adamâ€™s repentance with poetic evidence. The data analysis reveals that Adam indicates the divine wisdom and Eve indicates the whole self and in this story, the serpent, the devil, and the peacock are considered as obstacles of evolution that have been studied in detail.

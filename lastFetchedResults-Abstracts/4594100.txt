High data transfer rates in the order of 1 Mbit/s are now in demand for some inductively powered devices, but communication needs to be made without compromising power transfer and its efficiency. This paper compares different modulation schemes and proposes an interface to satisfy demanding bidirectional transmission needs. New demodulation approaches are used for phase and amplitude modulation and an adapted configurable protocol is presented. A complete integrated system is under design with a submicron technology. A transfer rate of 1.13 Mbit/s has been obtained with a discrete component prototype for amplitude demodulation.

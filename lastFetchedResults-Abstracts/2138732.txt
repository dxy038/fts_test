Background and Objective: The control of parenchymal hemorrhage especially in liver parenchyma, despite improvements in surgical science, is still one of the challenges that surgeons are facing with. Therefore, introducing an effective method to control liver bleeding is of important research priority. This study aimed to compare the hemostatic effect of calcium sulfate and ferric chloride on controlling liver parenchymal tissue bleeding in rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study 70 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to seven groups. An incision, two centimeters (cm) long and half cm depth, was made on each rat’s liver and the hemostasis time was measured first using calcium sulfate and ferric chloride with different concentrations (15%, 25%, and 50%) and then using the control method (i.e. control bleeding by simple suturing). Then, liver tissue was examined for pathological changes. Finally, hemostasis time was entered into SPSS software and analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Post hoc and Mann Whitney tests.
Results: Hemostasis mean time in groups of calcium sulfate  concentrations of 50%, 25% and 15%, were 8.00±0.94, 20.70±1.88,and 36.10±2.27 seconds, respectively, and in groups of ferric chloride concentrations of 50%, 25% and 15%, were 15.50±1.71, 29.40±2.06 and 49.20±3.32 seconds respectively. The hemostasis mean time in the control group (suture) was 91/30±7.30 seconds. The haemostatic time for different concentrations of calcium sulfate and ferric chloride were significantly less than the control group (P=0.004). There was a statistically significant difference between different concentrations of calcium sulfate and ferric chloride haemostatic time (P = 0.009). The pathologic examination showed the highest frequency of low grade inflammation based on the defined pathological grading.
Conclusion: Calcium sulfate and ferric chloride in comparison to the control method (i.e. control liver bleeding by simple suturing) need less time to control liver bleeding. Calcium sulfate was more effective hemostatic agent than ferric chloride in controlling liver bleeding in rats.

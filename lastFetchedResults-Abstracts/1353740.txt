Arsenic contamination of water has been recognized as a serious environmental issue and there are reports on its
epidemiological problems to human health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performances of
iron-coated pumice and manganese-coated pumice as the adsorbents for removing arsenate from aqueous
solutions. The effect of various parameters such as adsorbent dose, contact time, pH and initial concentration on
removal efficiency of arsenate were evaluated in batch mode. The data obtained from the kinetic studies were
analyzed using kinetic models of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order. In addition, two isotherm models of
Freundlich and Langmuir were used to fit the experimental data. The results showed that the optimum dosage of
iron-coated pumice and manganese-coated pumice for arsenate removal were 40 and 80 g/L whereas the
adsorption process reached equilibrium after 80 and 100 min, respectively. The maximum removal efficiency of
arsenate using the two adsorbents were both recorded in pH=3 as the removal efficiency gradually declined
following every increase in pH values of the solution. Iron-coated pumice also showed to have high removal
efficiency when the initial concentration of arsenate was high while the low concentration of arsenate was
efficiently removed by manganese-coated pumice. Moreover, it was depicted that the adsorption kinetics by both
adsorbents followed pseudo-second order equation and the uptake data of arsenate were well fitted with
Langmuir isotherm model. Therefore, it could be concluded that iron and manganese-coated pumice could be
considered as suitable adsorbents for arsenate removal from aqueous solutions.

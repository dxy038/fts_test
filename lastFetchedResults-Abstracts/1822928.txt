Objective
ontal ligament (PDL) cells play an important role in preserving periodontal homeostasis and periodontal remodelling in response to mechanical stimulations. Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) is essential for homeostasis and many other biological processes of multicellular organisms. While the role of GJIC in mechanotransduction of PDL cells remains largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the influence of cyclic stretch on the expression of membrane gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) in cultured human PDL cells.

ed human PDL cells were exposed to 1%, 10% and 20% stretch strains for 0.5 h, 1 h and 24 h. Then the membrane Cx43 protein expression was measured by flow cytometry and the Cx43 mRNA level was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
s
our and 1 h cyclic stretches with strains up to 20% did not change the expression of membrane Cx43 protein, while 24 h cyclic stretches with 10% and 20% strains down-regulated the expression of membrane Cx43 protein in a strain magnitude-dependent manner. Furthermore, cyclic stretch also changed the Cx43 mRNA level and induced realignment in cells.
sion
esent research provide the first evidence that cyclic stretch influenced the membrane Cx43 protein expression in cultured human PDL cells.

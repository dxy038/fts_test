To improve the first word dictionary with hash structure and the reverse maximum matching segmentation algorithm, the last word dictionary based on Hash structure which records word length is designed. By utilizing the reverse maximum matching methods, it realizes the intended objective of improving the speed and reducing the ambiguities rate of word segmentation. This essay explains the design principle of last word dictionary with hash structure and reverse backtracking algorithm, as well as their test effect.

The main objective of this paper is to control the position of a robot manipulator by means of the implementation of a new control scheme based on the combination of hyperbolic trigonometrical functions. In order to accomplish the control we used the method of shaping energy; and by means of the Lyapunovpsilas theory its stability is demonstrated formally. It is important to compare the functionality of the proposed controller, for this reason is compared with the simple PD controller, this analysis is made based on the performance index having solved the norm L<sub>2</sub>.

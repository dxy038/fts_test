Bread and crumb features were used to compare differences between winter wheat varieties and commercial retail flours (crop years 2002–2005 and 2004–2006, respectively). Further, two commercial flours (crops 2006 and 2007) were fortified by 8 non-traditional cereals at 10% substitute level. Overall baking quality was described by bread specific volume and shape, and a crumb penetration. Image analysis software Lucia G was used for objective crumb porosity evaluation. Determination of the bread and crumb features interactions was done by correlation analysis. Baking quality of varieties was higher in crops 2002–2003 than 2004–2005 – bread volumes were 348 and 365 cm3 100 g−1 vs. 323 and 295 cm3 100 g−1, respectively. Technological quality of commercial wheat was the highest in crop 2006 and the worst within year 2004 (bread volumes 353 and 332 cm3 100 g−1, crumb penetration 21.3 and 15.7 mm). In both sample groups, crops 2004 and 2005 affected wheat baking quality similarly (e.g. in 2005, mean cell areas 1.564 and 1.338 mm2 for wheat varieties and commercial samples, respectively). Fortified bread quality profile was affected more by archaic wheat species substitution than by barley and millet. Bread cut area was correlated with 5 of 8 observed traits, among others also with specific bread volume and crumb penetration.

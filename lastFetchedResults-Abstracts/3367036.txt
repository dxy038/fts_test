This correspondence presents a modification to the Bello single-integral troposcatter channel model. The objective of the modification is to improve the modelÂ´s ability to accurately predict the delay power spectrum of troposcatter paths of less than 150 mi. The model was modified by treating the scatter-angle exponent as a function of path length rather than a constant. The data from six shortrange troposcatter paths were compared with Bello model predictions using various values of the scatter-angle exponent. The results indicate a possible first-order relationship between the scatter-angle exponent and path length. Use of this relationship in the Bello model significantly improved the prediction performance for the six paths analyzed.

This paper presents implementation of different space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) switching patterns for three phase voltage source inverters (VSI) using digital signal processor (DSP) and comparative analysis of them. The sequence most favored in the literature is not the best one for all applications. Such is the diversity of digital motor control that it is sometimes difficult to determine which techniques are best suited to a particular application. The main objective of this paper is to analyze different schemes that are best suitable for different applications. The integration of digital signal processor core with a set of useful peripherals significantly simplifies the implementation of SVPWM technique for three phase inverters. Both simulation and experimental results are presented

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenia is one of the most prevalent diseases in psychiatry. A lot of efforts have been made to find out the biologic and organic causes of this disease. One of the cases, which more attract the attention of researchers, is soft neurologic signs and their relationship with schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of soft neurologic signs between schizophrenic patients and their sisters and brothers, and normal group.
METHODS: Thirty schizophrenic patients, 30 persons of their sisters and brothers, and 30 persons of normal group were chosen and evaluated in view of soft neurologic signs. Then a total score was obtained in view of signs for each case. Finally these groups were compared with each other. FINDINGS: The average of soft neurologic signs in schizophrenic patients was more than in their sisters or brothers and in normal group. The average of scores of soft neurologic signs in these patients' sisters and brothers was also more than in the normal group. There was also a significant relationship between the total score of the soft neurologic signs and the family history of schizophrenia in schizophrenic patients (p=0.034), it means that the patients having a family history for schizophrenia, had a higher total score than other patients in view of soft neurologic signs. There was no relationship between age, sex and the average of total score of these signs.
CONCLUSION: This finding that neurologic signs in schizophrenic patients were more than in the two other groups confirms the biologic and organic view about the etiology of schizophrenia, these signs can be raised as a strong biologic marker of schizophrenia. Considering the early beginning of treatment by anti-psychotic drugs, these signs can influence the outcome of this disease.

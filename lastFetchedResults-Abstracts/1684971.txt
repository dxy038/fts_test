The objective of this study is to develop a new constitutive model for cyclic response of metals with much broader applicability. Accordingly, a two-surface damage thermoplasticity model is proposed to understand inelastic behavior and to evaluate a potential damaged state of the metals. This model, which derived from small strain theory, is formulated through a thermodynamic approach to damage mechanics based on entropy production. A simple shear problem was utilized to examine several effects of this model, such as fatigue by cyclic loading and temperature, and to allow for the thermal effects on metals. Following this, the proposed cyclic damage model is implemented as a user subroutine in the finite element software ABAQUS. Finally, numerical results of energy dissipation devices are compared with experimental data for validity of this model.

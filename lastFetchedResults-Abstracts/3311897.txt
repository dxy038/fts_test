This paper presents a risk constrained economic dispatch model incorporating both the wind power and unitsÂ´ forced outage. The operation cost objective includes the costs of generation, spinning reserve, load shedding and wind spillage and the risk index is chosen as the expected load not served. A test system is adopted for illustration. The simulation results show that to decrease the cost (risk) to a relatively low value will dramatically increase the value of the risk (cost). Unit outage will increase both the cost and the risk values. The incorporation of wind power can relieve the increase in both the cost and the risk caused by unit outage. On the other hand, the wind power uncertainty will increase both the cost and the risk values.

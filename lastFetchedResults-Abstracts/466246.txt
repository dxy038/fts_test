Objective: Postmenopausal women who receive sequential hormone replacement therapy with estrogen combined with progestogen for 10 to 24 d/mo for a prolonged period may have an elevated endometrial cancer risk relative to those who have never received hormone replacement therapy. We investigated whether daily use of estrogen and progestogen (continuous combined hormone replacement therapy) could diminish any excess endometrial cancer risk. Study Design: A population-based study in Washington State obtained interview data from 969 women aged 45 to 74 years with endometrial cancer diagnosed during 1985 through 1991 or 1994 through 1995 and from 1325 age-matched control subjects selected primarily by random digit dialing. Women who had received only continuous combined hormone replacement therapy were compared with women who had only received another hormone replacement therapy regimen or who had never received hormone replacement therapy. Results: The risk of endometrial cancer among users of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (n = 9 case patients, N = 33 control subjects) relative to women who had never received hormone replacement therapy was 0.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.3); the risk relative to women who received hormone replacement that included progestogen for 10 to 24 d/mo was 0.4 (95% confidence interval, 0.2-1.1). Most continuous combined hormone replacement therapy use was short-term (<72 months) or recent (in the previous 24 months). Conclusion: Women who had received continuous combined hormone replacement therapy for several years did not appear to be at any increased risk for endometrial cancer relative to women who had never received hormone replacement therapy and may in fact be at decreased risk for endometrial cancer.

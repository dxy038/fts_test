Background and Objective: Hypcrlipidemia is a common health problem, which can lead to cardiovascular diseases, a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Studies show that changes in life style, such as not smoking, following a healthy diet, and exercise can help prevent these diseases. Deep-fat frying is one of the most popular procedures for food preparation. However, heating oils can produce undesirable constituents, which not only compromise the quality of the food but also pose a potential hazard to human health and nutrition. The effccts of heating on oils and blood lipid profile have been determined in many studies, but very few comparative studies have been made in this regard. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of Ghoo frying oil and Ghoncheh hydrogenated vegetable oil on the blood lipid profile in rats.
Materials and Methods: The study included 36 Wistar male rats purchased from Tehran Pasteur Institute. They were fed the AIN-93G diet for one week and then randomly divided into 3 groups of 12 each. Group 1 was put on the control diet which contained corn oil. In the diets of groups 2 and
 corn oil was replaced by the Ghoncheh hydrogenated vegetable oil and the Ghoo frying oil, respectively. After 28 days of feeding, fasting blood samples were collected from the animals and analyzed for lipids. Statistical tests used for data analysis (SPSS 1105 software) were the ANOVA two-way repeated measures and ANCOVA
Results: In the frying oil group the plasma trigyceridc, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lower than in the corn oil (p<0.02) and the hydrogenated oil (p<0.05) groups. Conversely, the hydrogenated oil increased the lipid levels in the rats. None of the oils had a statistically significant effect on the HDL-cholesterol level.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that, as compared to corn and hydrogenated oils, frying oil increases blood lipid indices to a lesser extent.

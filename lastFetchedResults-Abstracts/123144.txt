Introduction: Although in recent years, the dental condition of many animal models was used for odontogenesis study and survey but still knowledge about many changes of odontogenesis such as amelogenesis and morphogenesis of enamel organ is insufficient.
Objective: Therefore in this present study, it was tried to study the amelogenesis and ameloblast differentiation
during embryonic and postnatal periods in wistar rat.
Materials and Methods: Amelogensis process and ameloblast differentiation along developing molar teeth of embryonic (E15-E20) and postnatal (I-10) days in the rats were investigated by routine staining. Results: Based on data obtained, amelogenesis was first observed in the late embryonic stage (E16). On day 18th of gestation, organ of mina was differentiated and its developmental processing along to early postnatal period. After that, ameloblast maturation and enamel development continued until 9 postnatal day.
Conclusion: Results of research findings indicated that amelogenesis and developmental changes in the wistar rat occurs in the late embryonic period with the phenomena of amelogenin and by the end of one week with secretion of extracellular matrix and odontogenesis, ameloblast differentiation resulted.

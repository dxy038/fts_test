The objective of this paper is an analytical and numerical study of the dynamics of a beam––mass system. Special attention is given to the phenomena arising due to the motion of the attached mass and modal interactions produced by the existence of multi-component, specifically two-component, parametric resonance under primary resonance. The two-component parametric resonance occurs when the sums or the differences among internal frequencies are the same, or close, as the dimensionless speed parameter of the moving mass. The effects of two-component parametric resonance post on dynamic condition are investigated. Resonance generated by more than two-component modes are neglected due to its remote probability of occurrence in nature.

chanics of the problem is Newtonian. Based on the assumption that when the moving mass is set in motion the mass is assumed to be rolling on the beam, the mechanics, including the effects due to friction and convective accelerations, of the interface between the moving mass and the beam are determined.

on the Bernoulli–Euler beam theory, the coupled non-linear equations of motion of an inextensible beam with an attached moving mass are derived. By employing Galerkin procedure, the partial differential equations which describe the motion of a beam–mass system are reduced to an initial-value problem with finite dimensions. The method of multiple time scales is applied to consider the solutions and the occurrence of internal resonance of the resulting multi-degree-of-freedom beam––mass system with time dependent coefficients.

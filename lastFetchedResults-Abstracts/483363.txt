While early mention of differences between men and women existed in geographies of individual communities, an explicit focus on gender developed from the	as feminist scholarship and
activism coincided to highlight gender difference and inequality. Since then, a wide number of theoretical currents have stimulated a range of studies and academic thought. During the late ^ A * s and early ^ ^ â€¢ s gender studies in rural geography began to make up ground. Thus, gender analyses of rural societies have an increasingly flourishing existence in rural studies. Moreover, common policy initiatives that actively promote greater interaction between the state, local governments and civil society are an increasingly important component in the politics of poverty reduction and the promotion of better livelihood for poor people. In this way, to address local inequalities, and to strengthen rural economies, local societies and local public services, a new common space is needed, that could be ideally designed to incorporate ordinary people into the planning, implementation, administration, management and supervision of public activities. The objective of this paper is to integrate gender, common policy and rural development in an applied approach to the analysis of rural communities.

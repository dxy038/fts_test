In order to utilize the waste heat efficiently for a gas engine-driven heat pump running in a cooling mode, this paper studies two combined absorption/compression refrigeration cycles using ammonia and water as the working fluid. By analyzing the operating characteristics of the combined cycles that make efficient use of both the work and the heat output of an engine, this paper puts forward an optimal mathematical model with an objective function of the primary-energy ratio (PER). The model has been calculated for typical cooling applications. Analysis of the results indicates that optimization can make the combined cycle fully achieve the sought-after energy saving advantage. It was also found that the PERs of the combined cycles increase considerably compared with a conventional engine-driven compression cycle working with pure ammonia. The combined cycle, with two solution circuits, is the best.

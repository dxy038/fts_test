In this paper optimum size and location of the capacitors and distributed generators (DGs) are determined for
reliability improvement and power loss reduction using genetic algorithm (GA). The main innovation of this paper is
using both DG and Capacitor for the reliability improvement and power loss reduction. For this purpose an objective
function consisting of reliability cost, power loss cost and also DG's and capacitor's investment cost are considered.
The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined in the 10 and 33 bus test systems and comparative studies are
conducted before and after DG and Capacitor installation in the test systems. The results obtained show the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

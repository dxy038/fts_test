This paper describes a control method based on using instantaneous line to line voltages to generate the modulation functions needed to operate a direct frequency changer (AC-AC) using bidirectional switches operating at high frequencies. The advantages are minimal low order harmonics, sinusoidal waveforms, bidirectionality, separate control over amplitude, frequency, phase, and power factor. Moreover, the converter operation can be set to produce almost any power displacement factor, independent of load power factor. The paper presents basic theory and simulation results showing the algorithm in operation

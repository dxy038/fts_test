Evolutionary multi-objective service composition optimizer (E<sup>3</sup>) is a recently proposed optimization framework for SLA-Aware service composition. It considers multiple SLAs simultaneously and produces a set of Pareto solutions. Two multi-objective genetic algorithms: E<sup>3</sup>-MOGA and Extreme-E<sup>3</sup> provided by E<sup>3</sup> have shown very good performance in comparison to NSGA-II. In this paper, an improved version of E<sup>3</sup>-MOGA, namely E<sup>3</sup>-IMOGA is proposed, which incorporates a fine-grained domination assignment value strategy. We evaluated our approach experimentally using dataset and compared with E<sup>3</sup>-MOGA and NSGA-II. It reveals promising results in terms of the quality of individuals and the time for finding all feasible individuals.

A scientific evaluation of network´s threat degree is an important part of network risk assessment. It´s main basis to perform active defense for supervisory systems. And itpsilas an important function of network risk evaluation system. It´s necessary to create a credible and general evaluating index model in network threat assessment. Many indices affect the evaluation of network threat and generally they also affect each other. Thus it can not reflect the real situation of network threat with index weights determined by single method. According to the network indicespsila effect, this paper proposed an algorithm which combines grey correlation degree in grey theory with traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine the indices. It considered both objective and subjective factors. Experiments showed that this method had a strict mathematical theory basis, a definite meaning and a high practical value. It improved the evaluation methods´ credibility of network threat assessment.

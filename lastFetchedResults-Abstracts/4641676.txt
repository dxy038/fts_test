Fault restoration on regional power grids is a multi-objective, multi-constrained and complex optimization problem. An analytical model based on subsystem-switch for on-line fault restoration is built. Based on the connectivity and status attribute of subsystems in the equivalent model, breadth-first search algorithm is used to carry out the on-line quick search of the optimal restoration path. The validity of the algorithm has been verified by practical cases of fault restoration.

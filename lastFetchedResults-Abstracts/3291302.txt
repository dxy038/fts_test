In this paper, risk communication as it relates to the issue of personal information leakage is discussed with the help of participants using the Multiplex Risk Communicator support system. We propose an information acquisition method that is divided into three phases corresponding to cognition models by the clarity of the information acquisition objective. The key characteristic of this method is the quick transition among three phases that effectively promotes learning in novice participants. An experiment verifies the effects of the proposed method.

In this paper, we present a surrogate-based multi-objective evolutionary optimization approach to optimize airfoil aerodynamic designs. Our approach makes use of multiple surrogate models which operate in parallel with the aim of combining their features when solving a costly multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed approach is used to solve five multiobjective airfoil aerodynamic optimization problems. We compare the performance of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with surrogates with respect to the same approach without using surrogates. Our preliminary results indicate that our proposal can achieve a substantial reduction in the number of objective function evaluations, which has obvious advantages for dealing with expensive objective functions such as those involved in aeronautical optimization problems.

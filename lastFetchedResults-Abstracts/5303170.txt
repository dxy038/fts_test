Objective: Realize the accurate segmentation and tridimensional visualization of cardiac medical image and finish the design of cardiac aided diagnosis. Methods: Combine clinical experts diagnosis experience, CT image prior feature and graph cut algorithm model, adopt GPUs parallel data processing to realize the segmentation of cardiac struction and tridimensional visualization. Result: Finish the accurate, quick and robust segmentation and visualization of CT image sequence, initially realize the visualized cardiac aided diagnosis system based on GPUs. Conclusion: The study makes full use of the powerful parallel comouting capacity of computer graphics processing unit, solves the problems in medical image processing and segmentation, and improves the operating efficiency of the program and the user experience.

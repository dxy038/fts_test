Background & Aims: Cancer is a serious problem for human being. A necessary prerequisite for any
therapeutic modality is early diagnosis. Fractal dimension measurement of nuclear boundary of cancer
cells can be used as a feature extraction in the field of automated cancer diagnosis.
Materials & Methods: 41 positive urine cytology and 33 negative ones were selected randomly.
Digitalized images prepared using objective 100X and a digital video head preprocessed subsequently
and the fractal dimension ofnuclear boundaries was measured by a software.
Re.•ults: Findings revealed a statistically significant difference between fractal dimensions of nuclear
boundaries of cancerous versus non-cancerous in urinary smears. Selecting a proper cut off point
(1.732 ± 0.006 in this study) can discriminate malignant and non-malignant epithelial cells in urinary
smears.
Conclusion: Based on diagnostic accuracy measures (sensitivity and specificity), probability of
disease measures (predictive value of a positive and negative test results), and likelihood ratio of
positive and negative tests, it seems fractal dimension of nuclear cell boundaries in urinary smears can
be used as a feature extraction in the field ofautomated cancer diagnosis.

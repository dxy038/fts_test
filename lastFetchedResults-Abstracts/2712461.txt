The transmission grid in Europe is interconnected to guarantee the security of supply and to facilitate the competition among different market players, thereby making the system highly meshed. It is a challenging task for the transmission system operators (TSOs) to manage the power flows in their system, especially in the light of integration of renewable energy generation sources into the transmission system. The intermittent nature of such generation sources creates variable power flows and loop flows, in turn, questing for installation of controllable devices to manage these flows. The TSOs are currently installing such devices to cope with the situation. A proper coordination is needed for the operation of these devices, since they can lead to adverse effects on power flows in a meshed system. Coordination among TSOs in Central Western Europe (CWE) is performed, however, not towards a full system-wide objective, since there is no regulatory framework that exists for such coordination. This paper focuses on the potential of coordination among TSOs with respect to operation of the controllable devices. Two aspects are investigated: management of constraints in the system in the day-ahead scheduling process and wind in-feed optimization. Both approaches are implemented at the Regional Security Center and tested on a high-stress situation in the CWE region. Furthermore, a case study at the coordination center is performed using actual data for the month of January 2013 to assess the usefulness on a longer time period.

In this paper, we study a green supply chain network design problem with environmental concerns. We are interested in the environmental investments decisions in the design phase and propose a multi-objective optimization model that captures the a compromise between the total cost and the environment influence. This work addresses the optimization of the supply chain design considering economical and environmental issues. We explicitly consider two objective functions. The first one, measures the total cost: fixed setup cost, environmental protection investment, transportation cost, logistics cost, waste treatment cost and energy consumption cost. The second one, measures the total CO<sub>2</sub> emission in all the supply chain. The strategic decisions considered in the model are warehouses and distribution centers location, building technology selection and processing/distribution planning.

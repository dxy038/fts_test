Objective.  To investigate whether the intralimb coordination of the lower extremity during one-legged hopping in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is different and less stable compared to control subjects.

Design. Measures of coordination dynamics are applied to study the coordination and stability of movement patterns of the knee and ankle in patients and control subjects.

Background. Due to several factors, such as loss of proprioceptive function and muscle weakness, the intralimb coordination of the lower extremity might be altered.

Methods. Seven patients and 13 healthy control subjects were instructed to hop in place on one leg for 10 seconds at a comfortable frequency for each leg separately.

Results and conclusions. The one-legged hopping movement pattern of patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction one-year post-operative is different and less stable compared to healthy subjects, and thus is still impaired.

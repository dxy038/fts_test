Objective
The study was undertaken to identify factors contributing to the poor student perception of the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship.
Study design
Third-year medical students at the University of Michigan complete an annual questionnaire about the overall quality of their clinical experiences. In addition, at the end of each rotation, the students complete an evaluation form assessing various aspects of their learning experience. We reviewed data collected from 2000 to 2002. We calculated effect sizes using mean scores and SDs to compare individual aspects of the learning environment across the clerkships.
Results
Twenty-six percent of the third-year medical students at the University of Michigan rated the strength of their obstetrics and gynecology experience as very or exceptionally strong. Compared with the other 6 clerkships, the rotation had one of the lowest ratings for overall quality. Aspects of the clerkship experience we identified as potentially explaining this overall poor rating include the clarity of the clerkship goals and objectives, clarity of expectations for student performance, accessibility of faculty, experiences in learning history-taking skills, experiences in learning physical examination skills, and student perception that they were treated in a respectful/professional manner.
Conclusion
Aspects of the clerkship experience identified by this study as potentially explaining the low ratings of the obstetrics and gynecology rotation should be studied in greater detail. Addressing these factors will be critical for improving the overall student perception of the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship.

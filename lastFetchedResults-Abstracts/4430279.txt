This paper analyzes and compares the dual active bridge (DAB) converter and the full-bridge-forward integrated DC-DC converter when applied to a microgrid energy storage bidirectional system that demands high power flow at the discharging operation mode and low power flow at the charging operation mode. The phase-shift modulation (PSM) is generally applied on the DAB converter, but it presents practical limitations, such as maximum and minimum phase-shift angle restrictions. In order to obtain a wide power variation range on the discharging operation mode, a hybrid modulation scheme can be applied. On the other hand, the full-bridge-forward DC-DC converter is also an alternative, which is specifically designed for different power level bidirectional processes and therefore presents low number of active devices. Theoretical analysis and experimental results of both converters are presented.

The objective of this study was to determine whether one perceptually dominant channel in carrying emotional cues could be determined among speech, textual content and facial expression. To this end a Wizard-Of-Oz type scenario was used to elicit a corpus of emotional speech and facial expressions from five female speakers. Excerpts from this corpus were then presented to 48 listeners in the various modalities: audio only, video only, text only and video+audio. Listeners judged emotional content on two scales: activation and valence. Most listeners rated the combined modality easiest to judge and video alone as most difficult. Statistical analysis of the judgments revealed that activation was more difficult to judge than valence. Furthermore, the best agreement between judgments of valence was obtained between judgments based on audio alone, text alone, and the combined channel, indicating that textual content had a major and indeed dominant influence on the judgments.

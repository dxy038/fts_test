This work extends the inverse design methodology to systems in which the emissivities of the surfaces are dependent on the wavelength. The objective is to find the powers of the heaters to achieve uniform temperature and heat flux on the design surface. The mathematical formulation is described by an ill-conditioned system of non-linear equations, which is regularized by the TSVD method. The solution involves an iterative approach in which the radiation distribution in the spectrum bands is repeatedly guessed and corrected as the estimation of the heaters temperatures evolves. The example cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Objective:This study was designed to determine (1) occupational stress in a group of residents in obstetrics and gynecology, (2) whether occupational stress differs between years of training, and (3) whether there is seasonal variation in occupational stress. Study Design: The Occupational Stress Inventory was administered to the 44 residents in obstetrics and gynecology at our institution in September 1998. A subgroup of 24 residents were also asked to complete the occupational stress inventory in January and May 1999. T-scores of 40 to 59 are within the normal range; scores of ≥70 on the occupational role questionnaire or the psychologic strain questionnaire suggest significant maladaptive stress; scores of ≤30 on the personal resources questionnaire suggest a significant lack of coping skills. Kruskal-Wallis and repeated-measures analysis of variance were used when appropriate. Results: Forty residents completed the occupational stress inventory in September. The median T-score for each subscale was between 40 and 60. Eleven residents (27.5%) scored ≥70 on at least 1 subscale of the occupational role questionnaire. Three residents (7.5%) scored ≥70 on at least 1 subscale of the psychologic strain questionnaire. Seven residents (17.5%) scored ≤30 on at least 1 personal resources questionnaire subscale. There was no significant difference in occupational adjustment between resident level. In the 24 residents who were followed throughout the academic year, there was no significant difference in stress at different times of the years. Conclusion: Occupational stress is relatively common in a group of residents in obstetrics and gynecology. There is no difference in occupational stress or personal coping skills between years of training, and there is no seasonal variation in the academic year. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:907-9.)

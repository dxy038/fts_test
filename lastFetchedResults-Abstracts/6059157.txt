Reversible logic attains the dominance in the realm of overwhelming research in logic synthesis and also has the significance in the context of quantum computing because of loss-less information processing. Due to low power dissipation, researchers are first designing smaller components with reversible gates, that eventually lead to design reversible computer. In this paper, we propose a robust architecture of logarithmic barrel shifter that performs bidirectional arithmetic and logical shifting, including rotate operation. Incorporating fault tolerance capability, the circuit is designed very efficiently that exhibits superior performance over state-of-the-art design methods in terms of minimum number of gates, garbage outputs, ancilla inputs, quantum cost, delay and others cost factors.

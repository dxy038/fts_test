Identifying cost-effective network(s) is an essential challenge for a network operator. This paper presents a procedure for designing and dimensioning VP networks. The objective is to find the number of VPs that gives the lowest total network cost. In the network design procedure a decomposition approach, where the locations are examined one by one, has been used. This allows us to apply more comprehensive relationships than found in most of the design algorithms using optimisation. The dimensioning procedure presented is modular, expressions may be replaced such that alternative combinations can be examined. Further enhancement related to network element functionality, traffic handling principles, cost model, network design objectives and traffic approximations can also be made

This paper presents a speech enhancement method based on an improved wavelet based multitaper spectrum (MTS) a-priori signal to noise (SNR) ratio estimator and an harmonics regeneration noise reduction technique. The major advantage of this method is that we can effectively suppress noise in a noisy speech even in very low SNR environments without sacrificing speech intelligibility. In this paper, we devise a speech enhancement system using the improved wavelet based algorithm for the estimation of the a-priori SNR of noisy speeches, and the harmonics regeneration technique is applied to further restore the harmonics and remove the noise remained in the speed spectral. Objective evaluation results show that the proposed method demonstrates better noise suppression ability over conventional approaches without evident degradation of speech quality.

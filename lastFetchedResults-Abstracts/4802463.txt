Visualization of individual network events is a crucial part of testing new network designs and analyzing network performance and efficiency. This research designed and developed a framework for visualizing complex military and non-military wired and wireless networks. Our framework provides a robust network simulator trace file parser, multiple network visualization layouts-including user-defined layouts, and precise visualization controls. The parser architecture is capable of accepting trace files from different network simulators and provides one common visualization environment to study network scenarios run on different simulators. The many dynamic multi-objective network views add to the analyst&#194;&#191;s suite of tools available for analyzing networks. Analysts can toggle between the different views to provide even greater analysis capability. We describe our methodologies for the design and provide example analysis scenarios. Our framework will allow researchers to advance the state of network simulation-based analysis.

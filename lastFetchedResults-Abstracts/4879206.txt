The objective of this paper is to present a unified gyro error model. The fibre-optic gyro (FOG) will be used as the gyro of example, but with a small adjustment the model could be used for low-cost gyros as well. The error model will be used in the simulation of gyro measurements and for the compensation of the raw FOG measurements inside an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Such a unified error equation is needed as most FOG design specifications and development documentation define the system performance parameters in the format of the IEEE Std 952-1997 [1]. The correspondence between this format and the more widely published gyro error models is not obvious. This paper will attempt to bridge this gap.

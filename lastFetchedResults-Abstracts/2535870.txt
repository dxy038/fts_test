Introduction: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are inevitable consequences of ergonomic principles neglect. The increasing use of computer by students may result in these disorders. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the prevalence of MSDs and evaluate the effectiveness of ergonomics training intervention among university students.

Methods: This interventional and cross-sectional study was performed on a group of medical and paramedical students. Samples were chosen by simple sampling method. In the first stage, data were gathered by means of a self-made measurement and Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ). Furthermore, an educational booklet regarding the principles of ergonomics in computer use (educational intervention) was offered to the subjects. In the second stage of the study, the effectiveness of intervention was evaluated using a written exam and a quasi-objective structured clinical examination (quasi-OSCE) test. Data were analyzed by SPSS 15, as well as descriptive and analytical statistical indexes.

Results: From 205 students participated in the first round of the study, the results showed that 62.44% of them (128 persons) reported at least one complain or limitation in their musculoskeletal systems during the past year. Less than 10% of the participants were aware about the considerations of ergonomics principals during computer use. After submission of the educational materials, their awareness about the ergonomics considerations in computer use significantly improved(P<0.001) and more than 95% of them had good or medium performance after the intervention.

Conclusions: The training program was effective on the awareness of ergonomics principles in computer use. However, prevention of musculoskeletal disorders requires complementary measures such as elimination of risk factors and administrative controls.

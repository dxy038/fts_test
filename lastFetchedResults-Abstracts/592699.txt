Abstract
Spiritual perfection is man’s ultimate and the loftiest goal in this world which is the only place where this goal may be materialized. Unless one struggles to achieve spiritual perfection in this world, there is no other place where man can realize and attain this objective. Life is what we have from the world. The world and our life in it are more important than they are often assumed.  Without doubt, satisfaction in life leads to prosperity and success. Success depends on “life skills” or on acquiring the skills necessary for satisfaction in life. It is therefore necessary to acquire the skills required for satisfaction and contentment in life because one who is deprived of such skills will not achieve success. 
In order to be satisfied in life, we must have realistic expectations. That is, we must know that the world is transient and mortal and it is not worth having feelings of attachment to it. One of the most important challenges facing man’s life is the problem of earning one’s livelihood which, as per the ahadith [traditions], God has guaranteed. We must therefore be hopeful that God will sustain us as He has guaranteed.

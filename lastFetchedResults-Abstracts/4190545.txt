The objective of this experiment is to create a device that will maintain the integrity of the mandible and maxilla in edentulous patients. The absence of mechanical force on the bone induces resorption, increasing fracture risk. Ultrasound transducers will be used to simulate the mechanical stress normally induced by teeth through the propagation of ultrasound into the bone. As a result, the Wnt signaling molecular pathway, controlling bone growth, will be activated. This device consists of a mouthpiece containing transducers. It is powered by a flyback inductor circuit with a 9-Volt rechargeable power supply. The transducers are constructed from barium titanate, a piezoelectric material. The effectiveness of the transducers and the optimal transducer frequency are being determined through tests conducted on BatGal mice. The transducers are applied directly to the jaws of the mice once a day for ten minutes over a span of 30 days. Two trials are being conducted to ensure accuracy. The jawbones will be stained for the enzyme beta-galactosidase, which the mice have been genetically altered to synthesize when Wnt signaling occurs. The results from these tests can aid in determining the optimal frequency for an analogous human device.

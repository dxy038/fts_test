For optimal operation of multi-storage tank multi-source system, a two-stage method is developed in this paper. In the first stage, the optimal storage policy of each tank is determined according to the electricity tariff. In the second stage, Genetic algorithm is applied to solve pump scheduling problem. The objective of the pump scheduling problem is to ensure that the required volume is adequately provided by the pumps while minimizing the operation cost. Decision variables are the settings of the pumps and speed ratio of variable-speed pumps at time steps of the total operational time horizon. A mixed coding methodology is developed according to the characteristics of decision variables. Daily operation cost savings of approximately 11% is obtained by application of the proposed method to a pressure zone of S.Y. water distribution system.

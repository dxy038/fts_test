Through a simple extension of Brézis–Browder principle to partially ordered spaces, a very general strong minimal point existence theorem on quasi ordered spaces, is proved. This theorem together with a generic quasi order and a new notion of strong approximate solution allow us to obtain two strong solution existence theorems, and three general Ekeland variational principles in optimization problems where the objective space is quasi ordered. Then, they are applied to prove strong minimal point existence results, generalizations of Bishop–Phelps lemma in linear spaces, and Ekeland variational principles in set-valued optimization problems through a set solution criterion.

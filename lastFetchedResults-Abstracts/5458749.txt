Because the number of affecting factor is very large and the correlation of factors may impact the precision of measurement result, rough set theory is introduced in the process of software testability measurement. The attribute reduction method is used to reduce the set of affecting factor because it can eliminate the attribute that cannot affect the decision according to the interrelation between attributes. The importance of an attribute to the result of system classification can be used to calculate the weight coefficient that is critical to the software testability measurement. Because the foundation of rough set theory is the objective data the analysis result is impersonal and its correctness is impacted by the data adequacy.

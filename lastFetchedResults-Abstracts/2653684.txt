 Background The prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) has
                            been reported to increase in recent decades. Therefore, scientific
                            studies should be performed to specify psychological variables, which
                            may contribute to the etiology of this disorder. In this study, we
                            examined the role of body image and perfectionism in predicting BDD
                            symptoms among students. Objective The aim of this survey was to
                            investigate the role of body image and perfectionism in the prediction
                            of BDD symptoms. Methods This cross sectional study was performed in
                            2016 on a sample, including 351 students of Hamadan University of
                            Medical Sciences, who were selected based on the Morgan formula and
                            multistage cluster random sampling. The participants completed the
                            Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale modified for BDD (BDD-YBOCS),
                            multidimensional body-self relations questionnaire (MBSRQ), and
                            Besharat’s Tehran multidimensional perfectionism scale (TMPS). The
                            collected data were analyzed by Pearson’s correlation test and stepwise
                            regression analysis. Results and Conclusions The results of stepwise
                            regression analysis showed that perfectionism and body image could
                            significantly predict BDD symptoms (P &lt; 0.001). Therefore, these
                            variables can be important in the promotion of students’ health.

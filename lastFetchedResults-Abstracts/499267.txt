The poor water and soil resources and small farm lands impede the agricultural development and consequently raise unemployment and migration rates. Appropriate development of rural small industries and workshops and employment generation can resolve these problems. The main objective of this study is to propose small industries and workshops which are appropriate to the potentials of rural areas in rural areas of Ardestan county. To this end the views of 20 experts from wood industries were collected in a Delphi framework. The results indicated that the goals of sustainable rural industrialization, and prevention of raw material export have the highest and lowest importance according to the scores. Agricultural products relating to fruits and livestock have the first priority, and production of textiles, metal and stone have the last priority in the recommended industries of the area.

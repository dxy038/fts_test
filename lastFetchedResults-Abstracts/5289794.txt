In this paper a method called fuzzy gates is presented for signal feature detection. The principle of gate based feature detection is briefly discussed. A MATLAB(R)-based tool for performing signal feature detection is then presented. Finally, an application of the method is demonstrated in an analysis of the reason for causing paper web breaks. The need for deeper understanding of the early stages of paper making (paper web formation in the wet end of the paper machine) and the need of visualization are the main objective the method described

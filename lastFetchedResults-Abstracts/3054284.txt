This paper presented an operational strategy for cogeneration plants under a deregulated market. The objective of this paper includes fuel cost, population cost, and electricity wheeling cost, subjective to the use of mixed fuels, operational limits, emissions constraints, and transmission line flow constraints. Enhanced immune algorithm (EIA) was proposed by an improved crossover and mutation mechanism with a competition and auto-adjust scheme to avoid prematurity. Results verify that EIA can offer an efficient way for cogeneration plants to solve the problem of economic dispatch, environmental protection, and electricity wheeling.

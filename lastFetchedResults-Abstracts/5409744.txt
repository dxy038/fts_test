Method of ameliorative multi-objective synthetic evaluation based on entropy weight is presented. The various original data of different types and dimensions are standardized by dimensionless function. The concepts of evaluation index entropy and entropy weight are proposed. The synthetic weight is constructed by expert and entropy weight, which would dispel the subjectivity and arbitrariness while judging the weight of the problem. The approach is approved to be practical while applied to synthetically evaluate the economic benefit of the state-owned enterprises in Liaoning province.

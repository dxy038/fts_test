This paper proposes a bidirectional generation method with a set of consistent bidirectional generation rules between SmartC models and codes. Based on these rules, the consistency of the bidirectional generation between SmartC models and codes is demonstrated by a case study. Extensive tests are conducted to show the performance of this bidirectional generation method. And the efforts of different industrial applications are recorded to illustrate its advantage of decreasing project efforts and accelerating project progress.

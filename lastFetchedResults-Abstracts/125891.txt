Objective: Regulation of normal cell growth and turnover is possible by balance between: 1-cell proliferation 2-cell differentiation ation 3- programmed cell death or apoptosis. A disruption of this balance is thought to be an important event leading to carcinogenesis. One of the effectors in apoptosis is Fas (CD95IAPO-1) antigen. Cross-linking of Fas by its ligand (Fas L) or agonistic anti Fas antibodies induces apoptosis of cells expressing Fas on the membrane by triggering cascade of caspaces.
Materials and Methods: This research has been a basic study and the percentage of expression antigen on blastic cells (BM or PB) in 100 patients suffering from acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia disease were analyzed by flowcytometry method. Samples obtained at the time of diagnosis before antileukemic therapy. Expression of Fas antigen on normal control PB leukocytes (Granulocyte, Monicyte and Lymphocyte) were also analyzed.
Results: From these data, it is obvious that Fas antigen was expressed in all cases, but expression level varied widely. The percentage of Fas antigen expression in all samples were below 20%, but in AML samples, 8 cases above 20% have been observed. In normal control samples, the mean value for monocytes was higher than granulocytes and in granulocytes higher than lymphocytes.
Conculusion: Expression of Fas antigen in most of the leukemic cells in low and the early reports showed that increase in Fas antigen expression above 20% after treatment, is a favourable prognostic sign associated with increase relapse free and total survival. Therefore evaluation of this antigen before, during and after treatment is recommended.

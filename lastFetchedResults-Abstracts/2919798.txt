The RTCE system described comprises a global network of HF (2-30 MHz) transmitters and receivers allowing users to monitor and collect a variety of real-time data on propagation and noise/interference conditions in the HF band on a worldwide basis. The system is accessible by anyone with a requirement for such data, whether they belong to professional or amateur radio communication communities. Any user of the system will be limited in the information he can extract only by the radio receiving and signal processing equipment at his disposal. The system design enables users with even the most simple manually-controlled receiving systems to have access to basic real-time propagation data. The major objective of the system is to provide information to enable the effectiveness and accuracy of off-line HF propagation and noise prediction methods to be enhanced

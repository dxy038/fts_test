This paper presents the status of the design and of the development programme of the two test blanket systems (TBSs) based on the blanket concepts supported by the EU, namely the helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) and helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) concepts.

he test blanket modules (TBMs) box design and the associated systems (Helium Cooling Systems, PbLi loop for the HCLL system, helium processing systems for tritium extraction, etc.) have been revised and, where needed, modified according to the assumption that one ITER equatorial port could be available for testing the two European test blanket modules (TBMs).

ing to EU TBMs programme, two reliable test blanket systems shall be ready for installation on the first day of ITER operation. In order to comply with this ambitious objective, six EURATOM associates who have sustained the TBM program so far have joined themselves in a consortium aiming to ensure an efficient management of the project tasks and exploit specific competences enhancing potential synergies. The consortium objectives and development programme are summarised in the paper.

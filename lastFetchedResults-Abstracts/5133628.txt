The paper presents the development of a fuzzy logic position controller for a single-link robotic manipulator. The use of this controller is motivated by the system model uncertainties, parametric variations, and load excursions. The objective of the controller is to make the robot arm position follow a specified reference trajectory with minimum deviation and no overshoot/undershoot. The laboratory experimental results indicate that the fuzzy logic position controller is robust and effective regulator

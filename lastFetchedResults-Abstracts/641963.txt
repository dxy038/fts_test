Objective
The objective of this study was to measure the relation between menstrual cycle length disorders and degree of obesity.
Methods
We enrolled 120 obese patients ages 18 to 40 y from an outpatient obesity clinic in a cross-sectional study. Patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome were excluded. Obesity was classified in five grades by relative weight. Waist-to-hip ratio was measured and comorbidities were assessed in each patient. Patients were asked to record menstrual cycle characteristics for 3 mo. Logistic regression analysis was performed, with age and type 2 diabetes as confounding variables. The patients’ mean age was 29.9 ± 6.4 y, the mean relative weight was 159.2 ± 26.6%, and the mean waist-to-hip ratio was 0.84 ± 0.1.
Results
Twenty-two (18.3%) patients had oligomenorrhea and 14 (11.7%) had amenorrhea. The risks for amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea were increased twofold by each unit increase of obesity grade. The odds ratio by waist-to-hip ratio tertile was not statistically significant. Type 2 diabetes and glucose intolerance were statistically significantly associated with amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea.
Conclusions
Higher obesity grades were associated with higher probabilities of menstrual cycle disturbances such as amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea in this group of Mexican women.

This work presents a control strategy that allows a follower robot to track a target vehicle moving along an unknown trajectory with unknown velocity. It uses only artificial vision to establish both the robotÂ´s position and orientation relative to the target, so as to maintain a specified formation at a given distance. The control system is proved to be asymptotically stable at the equilibrium point, which corresponds to the navigation objective. Experimental results with two robots, a leader and a follower, are included to show the performance of the proposed vision-based tracking control system

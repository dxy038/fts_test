The main objective of the present study is to develop a probabilistic model for ice shedding and flashover consequences in power system networks. This model is based on a probabilistic approach to ice shedding, switching surge overvoltages and mechanical characteristics of overhead power lines. The risk of flashover between phase conductors and ground wires was calculated using the Monte Carlo numerical simulation technique. This approach will allow for the refinement of mathematical models of ice loading and ice shedding. It also provides a useful tool for the design of overhead power lines

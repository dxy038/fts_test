In this paper, we propose three heuristics for high-efficiency selections of MPRs (multipoint relays) in link state QoS routing protocol: MIMS (maximizing integration metric selection), MQES (maximizing QoS-efficiency selection), and MCIS (minimizing cost-inefficiency selection). The basic approach of these selections is to determine a smaller set of MPRs that provide better QoS paths between any two nodes. The main objective in doing so is to maximize the QoS (quality of service) effect while limiting routing overhead for flooding control traffic. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the routing protocols with the proposed selections by simulation. The results indicate that the proposed methods achieve high-efficiency selection; as compared to an existing MPR selection taking into account the QoS requirements, MIMS reduces the maintenance cost by 30%, while the throughput of the resultant path is decreased by 13%, and MCIS reduces the cost by 21% without any decrease in the throughput.

The main objective of this article is to study conceptual metaphors on the basis of cognitive semantics in the 20:30 news headlines on TV channel 2. Metaphor on this approach is a cognitive process in the conceptual system of language used to understand abstract concepts on the basis of more objective concepts. On the other hand, applying metaphors in TV news headlines, as the first point of audience confrontation with news content, is considered a kind of mental activation process that is an important issue is linguistic studies. In the study we tried to answer the question how are the effects of the applying conceptual metaphors in the news headlines. For this purpose, 67 samples of the 20:30 news headlines in January 2015 were selected based on purposive sampling, then analyzed based on Lakoff and Johnson metaphor theory (1980). The results showed that metaphors discussed in the theory, were realized in the different headlines. In addition, for all three types of structural conceptual, ontological, and directional metaphor were found good examples in the news headlines. Ontological metaphors have been observed at the highest rates.

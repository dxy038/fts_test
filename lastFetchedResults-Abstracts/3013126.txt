Network centric warfare is the foundation for Joint Vision 2010/2020, under which new levels of operational effectiveness in warfighting will be achieved. The Expeditionary Command Control Communications Computer and Combat system Grid (EC5G) is a near-term enabler of JV2010/2020. The fundamental objective of EC5G is the enhancement of naval network architecture. A major problem in the development of the EC5G is to merge joint data network and joint planning network while retaining certain levels of application service guarantees through utilization of quality of service (QoS) mechanisms between source and destination of network traffic. The objective of this paper is to identify potential vulnerabilities and pitfalls that may be encountered in sending tactical digital information link (TADIL) data from the JDN over an IP-QoS advanced data network system (ADNS) communications devices and links, which commonly service the JPN. The analysis that was performed during this effort highlights two conditions wherein message sequence errors may occur. Both of these conditions suggest careful planning and additional consideration before a concrete TADIL-over-ADNS implementation is proposed.

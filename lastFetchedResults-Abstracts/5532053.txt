Approximations are presented for calculation of the covariance, mean estimator gradient, impulse response, and bias of three types of penalized &#8220;maximum likelihood&#8221; estimators when measured attenuation data is used. The three estimators examined are: (1) the conventional penalized maximum likelihood objective for emission tomography; (2) joint maximum likelihood estimation of emission intensity and attenuation; and (3) a &#8220;robust&#8221; maximum likelihood model where the additional variance introduced by the attenuation measurements is compensated through the use of a shifted Poisson model. Resulting limiting expressions for the covariance are shown to be the same for all methods as the measurement noise approaches zero

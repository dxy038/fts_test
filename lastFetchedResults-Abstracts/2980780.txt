The paper details a Fuzzy-Feedback Linearisation controller applied to a non-linear missile. The design uses an evolutionary algorithm optimisation approach to a multiple model description of the airframe aerodynamics. A set of convex models is produced that map the vertex points in a high order parameter space (of the order of 16 variables). These are used to determine the membership function distribution within the outer loop control system by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. This produces a design that meets objectives related to closed loop performance such as: rising time, steady state error and overshoot

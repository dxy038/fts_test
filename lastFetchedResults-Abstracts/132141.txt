Oral cervicofacial disease can be manifested as a mass lesion . Actinomycosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any mass lesion in the head and neck region . Bacteriologic identification from a sterile site or
detection of sulfur granules accompanied by microorganism confirms the diagnosis.

A new methodology for model structure identification is presented. This is implemented as a new toolbox of MATLAB. The methodology developed has two parts, the first one has the objective to find a pure delay using the estimated impulse response, and the second one, uses at same time the minimal value of the identification criteria and the representative value of numerator coefficients. The graphical interface and the results obtained using some real applications are also presented

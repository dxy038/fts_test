Background  and  Objective:  the  role  of  cone  beam  CT  in  imaging  of  the  oral  and  maxillofacial  region  is  well  known  and  its  indications  and  possibilities  are still  increasing.  one  of  the  major  problems  remaining  to  be solved  is  the  unwanted  movements  of  the  patient  during  the  scanning  procedure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects of   human dry mandible motion on linear measurements and quality assessment via Cone Beam Computed Tomography. Although motion artifact is a common problem in daily pediatric diagnostic procedures, there are only few studies in the literatures on this topic. 
Subjects and Methods: l0 dry adult human edentulous mandibles were used in this invitro analytical study.  Height,  width  and  quality  measured  for  three  areas  (midline,  right  posterior  and  left  posterior)  on  each  mandible. Three oral radiologists independently used a subjective rating score to evaluate the CBCT images. Obtained data analyzed via repeated measurements of variance LSD test and paired samples t test.
Results: No significant  statistical difference was observed in the assessment  of  jaw  dimensions (height  and width) with  and  without  motion  for  three  observers. But values  were  significant  in the assessment  of  parameters  due  to  quality  between  them. 
Conclusion: According  to the  data obtained  from  this  study, we  conclude  that there is  no  significant  statistical difference  in assessment of  jaw  dimensions  (height  and  width ) between  three observers. Also, there is no significant statistical difference in the assessment of jaw dimension with and without motion, but observer's idea affects the quality of assessment.

Optimization of the piping network layout of the district cooling system (DCS) is a typical combination optimal problem. A mathematical model with multiple corresponding constrained conditions is put forward. In the model, the annual cost of piping network is regarded as the objective function. Based on the graphic theory and genetic algorithm, an improved genetic algorithm, named single parent genetic algorithm (SPGA), is applied to optimize a DCS piping network layout. Code technology, genetic operation and the fitness function are proposed in SPGA. An optimal piping network layout was made by applying SPGA in a practical engineering of a district cooling system. In comparison with the Dijkstra algorithm, applying SPGA, the investment and running-cost of DCS can be decreased, and SPGA is of high searching efficiency, quick convergence and good stability.

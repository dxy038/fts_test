Numerous power amplifier circuits are described in the literature, which seem to follow many distinct design approaches. While circuit implementations may be quite different indeed, the underlining system-level signaling inside these circuits follows similar conditions dictated by the common design objective for high efficiency. This paper presents a general theory for analyzing and designing power amplifiers, providing an insight on the fundamental factors limiting the performance, irrespective of the implementation circuits or technology.

In this paper, we propose a strategy for resource allocation for different traffic classes at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of wireless systems based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), such as the recent Long-Term Evolution (LTE) wireless standard. In order to achieve inter-class fairness, we propose a modification of the Virtual Token Modified Largest Weighted Delay First (VT-M-LWDF) and Modified Largest Weighted Delay First (M-LWDF) rules. Through simulation, we show that the proposed scheduler introduces remarkable multi-objective improvement of the Quality of Service (QoS) performance parameters, i.e., Packet Loss Rate (PLR), average throughput, fairness index and system spectral efficiency, among different classes of traffic such as video, VoIP and best-effort.

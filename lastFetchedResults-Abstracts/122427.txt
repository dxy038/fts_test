Objective: The determination of the relative frequencies and patterns, the mean, standard error and range of the durations and amplitudes of, the P wave in the Turkman horse compared to the well known breed of horse in the world (Thoroughbred).
Design: A controlled field study.
Animals: A total of 123 normal Turkman horses; 70% female and 30% male, 36%4, less than 6-year-old and 64% more than 6-year-old. Procedure: After establishment of the horses in the state of maximum possible tranquillity and standing body position, the ECG was performed using a battery-driven apparatus in the 12 standard leads I, 1I, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V10, CV6LU, CV6LL, CV6RU, C V6RL and BA. The speed for all tracings was as 25 mnilsec. and wave voltages as I cm/mv. Statistical analysis: t-test.
Results: The simultaneous were revealed for the first time ECG parameters of the P wave in the 12 equine standard leads. The comparison of the predominant patterns of the P wave in the leads aVR and V 10 to the lead BA also showed a mirror-image state in the orthogonal trigonometric planes.
Clinical implications: Considering the parameters revealed for the first time in the field of equine electrocardiography using the 12 standard leads, and on the other hand a remarkable similarities between the ECG of the Turkman and Thoroughbred horses; the results of this study provided a suitable matter for more electrocardiographic reseaches in horse species. Meanwhile, equine clinicians would have the essential clinical criteria for the simultaneous examining of the 12 ECG leads particularly of the standard lead BA.

The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a recently developed evolutionary algorithm (EA) based on the swarm behavior in the nature. This paper presents recent advances in applying a versatile PSO engine to real-number, binary, single-objective and multiobjective optimizations for antenna designs, with a randomized Newtonian mechanics model developed to describe the swarm behavior. The design of aperiodic (nonuniform and thinned) antenna arrays is presented as an example for the application of the PSO engine. In particular, in order to achieve an improved peak sidelobe level (SLL), element positions in a nonuniform array are optimized by real-number PSO (RPSO). On the other hand, in a thinned array, the on/off state of each element is determined by binary PSO (BPSO). Optimizations for both nonuniform arrays and thinned arrays are also expanded to multiobjective cases. As a result, nondominated designs on the Pareto front enable one to achieve other design factors than the peak SLL. Optimized antenna arrays are compared with periodic arrays and previously presented aperiodic arrays. Selected designs fabricated and measured to validate the effectiveness of PSO in practical electromagnetic problems

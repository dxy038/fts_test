Background and Objective: At present, the use of nano-structured materials is becoming more widespread and a lot of advantages have been offered over either organic or inorganic nanoparticles. The purpose of this study was to find out the sensitivity of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to the Antimicrobial Activities of CdO Nanoparticle. 
Subjects and Methods: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) were used in the experiment. In the first experiment, the optical density of E. coli and S. aureus cultures were observed in the presence of 0.01 %, 0.75  % and 1.5 %  of CdO. In the second experiment, 6.3 log CFU/ml of E. coli and S. aureus separately, were exposed to 1.5  % CdO at 37 ?C in water. In the third experiment, E.coli was developed in the solid medium with and without nanoparticles.  
Result: Only in the presence of 0.75% and 1.5 % of these nanoparticles a considerable decreased was observed in the number of bacteria. In the control group the bacteria survived up to 13 days while complete cells death of  E. coli and S. aureus was  observed after 30 and 20 hours, respectively, when 1.5% CdO was added to the culture media. The same experiment, with S. aureus, showed complete cell death when the bacterial culture was exposed to 1.5 % CdO for 20 hours. 
Conclusion: The present data demonstrate that a formulation made with the biologically stabilized CdO  nanoparticles may be useful in the treatment of the infections and diseases caused by E. coli and S. aureus

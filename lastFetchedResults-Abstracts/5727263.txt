Broadcast Scheduling of large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are highly hards because they consist of numerous resource-constrained devices and communicate via wireless links. The broadcast scheduling problem (BSP) is aim to schedule each node in different slot of fixed length frame at least once, and the objective of BSP is to seek for the optimal feasible solution, which has the shortest length of frame slots as well as the maximum node transmission. In this paper, we propose a two stage mixed algorithm based on fuzzy hopfield neural network to solve this BSP in Ad hoc. In the first stage, we use a modified greedy vertex coloring algorithm to obtain a minimal TDMA frame length. In the second stage, we adopt hopfield network to find added conflict-free slots for nodeÂ´s transmission. Experimental results, obtained from the running on three benchmark graph, show that our algorithm can achieve better performance with shorter frame length and higher channel utilizing ratio than other exit BSP solutions.

The levels of selected mycotoxins and mold contamination of Ontario field-dried hay from 10 performance horse farms were examined. The farm owner, trainer or manager was questioned regarding their opinion of the quality of the hay. Half of the hay sampled showed potentially significant levels of mycotoxins, mold and actinomycete contamination. Subjective opinion did not correlate to objective analysis. Deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin), T 2 toxin and zearalenone were measured with vomitoxin present in the highest amounts. Vomitoxin is among the mycotoxins most frequently found as contaminants in cereal crops, in temperate climates, in North America. It can be concluded that the levels found in this study could potentially have an influence on the health of horses consuming such hay.

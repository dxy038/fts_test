Dietary vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) levels that are sufficient to maintain normal blood coagulation may be sub-optimal for bone, and habitual low dietary intakes of vitamin K may have an adverse effect on bone health. The objective of the present study was to measure the intake and adequacy of phylloquinone intake and the contribution of foods to phylloquinone intake in a nationally representative sample of Irish adults. The North/South Ireland Food Consumption Survey database was used, which contains data collected using a 7 d food diary in a randomly selected sample of Irish adults aged 18â€“64 years (n 1379; 662 men and 717 women). Phylloquinone intakes were estimated using recently compiled food composition data for phylloquinone. The mean daily intake of phylloquinone from food sources was 79 (SD 44) (mu)g/d. The main contributors to phylloquinone intakes were vegetables (48 %), particularly green vegetables (26 %). Potatoes (including chipped and fried potatoes), dairy products and fat spreads contributed 10 % each and meat contributed 8 %. In men, social class and smoking status influenced phylloquinone intakes. Of the population, 52 % had phylloquinone intakes below 1 (mu)g/d, respectively. The present study shows that habitual phylloquinone intakes in Irish adults are low, which may have implications for bone health.

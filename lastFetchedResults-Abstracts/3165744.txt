The authors present a localizing device for computer assisted preoperative surgery planning and intraoperative localization. Objective of the development focused on reduction of complication rate of endonasal procedures by providing highly accurate location information. The Computer Assisted Surgery device CAS consists of a high capacity computer which processes CT data in real time connected to a mechanical measuring arm for determination of position. For practical application, a diagnostic CT examination is performed. Out of these CT data the computer calculates a 3D reconstruction and displays the tip of the instrument as a reticle into this model while operating with the measuring arm. Thus, the surgeon has a means of checking position that comes close to intraoperative CT monitoring. This system has been sufficiently used in 193 cases of paranasal sinus surgery.

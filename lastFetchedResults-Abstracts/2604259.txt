In this paper a system consist of two reservoirs was evaluated by using a genetic algorithm
method.In this way four cases were analyzed:optimized.Case2: demands were fixed and the
reservoir capacities and operating rules were optimized.Case3: reservoir capacities were
fixed and the demands and operating rules were optimized.Case4: reservoir capacities,
demands and operating rules were optimized.The first reservoir is taken to supply irrigation
water and the second one is used to supply domestic and industrial water demands .The
range of capacities for reservoirs were determined and according to the method of study
which is GA ,the objective function for each case was optimized byselection of random
samples ,coding, evaluation of their fitness, decoding ,crossover , mutation and determining
penalty function proportional to environmental situation of the problems.Analysis of results
through graphs show that they are close to expected objective functions 98,2%,,98,5%ØŒ99,1%
and 99,6%.respctively.

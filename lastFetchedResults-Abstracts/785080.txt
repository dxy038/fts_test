Objectives: Vitamin D intake may prevent physical performance decline through prevention of muscle
mass loss. our objective was to determine whether low dietary intakes were associated with low muscle mass
(MM). Design and participants: Cross-sectional analysis of 1989 community-dwelling women (mean age
80.5±3.8years) from the epiDémiologie de l’ostéoporose (epiDos) study were assessed at baseline.
Measurements: Low intakes of vitamin D (<70μg/week) were estimated from the weekly dietary vitamin D
intakes (self-administered food frequency questionnaire). Low MM was defined according to the appendicular
skeletal muscle mass index assessed using Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, divided by square height of less
than 5.45 kg/m2. usual gait speed defined physical performance. age, sun exposure, co-morbidities, education
level, living arrangements, recreational physical activity, dietary protein and calcium intakes, bone mineral
density, handgrip strength, and body mass index were considered as potential confounders. Multivariate logistic
regression analyses assessed the association between low vitamin D intakes and low MM. Results: two-hundred
and nine (10.5%) women with low MM were compared to 1,780 women with normal MM. in final model,
obesity/overweight (adjusted odds ratios, aor=0.09; 95%Ci [0.05-0.17]), malnutrition (aor=3.90; 95%Ci
[2.74-5.54]) and low handgrip strength (aor=2.33; 95%Ci [1.44-3.77]; p<0.001) were statistically associated
with a low MM status. Conclusion: no association with low MM has been reported regarding low dietary intakes
of vitamin D.

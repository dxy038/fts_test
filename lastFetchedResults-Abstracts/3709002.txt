It is common practice to partially characterize a filter with a finite portion of its impulse response, with the objective of generating a recursive approximation. This paper discusses the use of mixed first and second information, in the form of a finite portion of the impulse response and autocorrelation sequences. The discussion encompasses a number of techniques and algorithms for this purpose. Two approximation problems are studied: an interpolation problem and a least squares problem. These are shown to be closely related. The linear systems which form the solutions to these problems are shown to be stable. An efficient algorithm for obtaining solutions is given and shown to be closely related to a well-known algorithm of Levinson and the Jury stability test. The close connection between these algorithms suggests that they are fundamental in the numerical analysis of stable discrete-time linear systems.

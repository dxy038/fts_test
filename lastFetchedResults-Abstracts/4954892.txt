Real world multi-objective optimization problems are often solved with the only intention of selecting a single trade-off solution by taking up a decision-making task. The computational effort and time spent on obtaining the entire Pareto front is thus not justifiable. The Pareto solutions as a whole contain within them a lot more information than that is used. Extracting this knowledge would not only give designers a better understanding of the system, but also bring worth to the resources spent. The obtained knowledge acts as governing principles which can help solve other similar systems easily. We propose a genetic algorithm based unsupervised approach for learning these principles from the Pareto-optimal dataset of the base problem. The methodology is capable of discovering analytical relationships of a certain type between different problem entities.

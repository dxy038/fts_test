Progress in wireless technology has fostered the widespread use of computing and communication devices for commercial usage. The success of consumer products like PCs, laptops, PDA, mobile phones, and their peripherals has been based on continuous cost and size reduction. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of impulsive noise, cochannel interference due to other piconet, Nakagami fading on the bit error rate (BER), and throughput performance in the Bluetooth scatternet. Simulation results illustrate the significant difference in performance between synchronous and asynchronous Bluetooth networks. The paper also provides the insights on how to design Bluetooth scatternet for minimal error rate and maximum throughput performance.

Many applications of the classical vehicle routing problem involve pick-up and delivery services between the depot and peripheral locations (warehouses, stores, stations). This paper studies an important version of the vehicle routing problem with pick-up and delivery (the so-called delivery and backhaul problem): delivery in our case refers to transportation of goods from the depot to customers, and pick-up (backhaul) refers to shipment from customers to the depot. The objective is to find a set of vehicle routes that service customers such that vehicle capacity is not violated and the total distance traveled is minimized. Tour partitioning heuristics for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem are based on breaking a basic tour into disjoint segments served by different vehicles. This idea is adapted for solving the delivery and backhaul problem. Two heuristics that focus on efficient utilization of vehiclesâ€™ capacities are introduced, analyzed and tested numerically.

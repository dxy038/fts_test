Serum albumin, one of the most abundant serum proteins, blocks the expression of other important biomarkers. The objective of this study is to remove serum albumin effectively by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) in microfluidic devices. Photo-polymerized adsorbent as a stationary phase of SPE was used to remove bovine serum albumin (BSA). The adsorption capacity was examined with the effect of pH and concentration in BSA solution, and adjustment of monomer concentration such as hydrophilic 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid and acrylamide in the adsorbent. The effect of hydrophobic butyl methacylate on BSA adsorption was also studied. Selective removal in a bicomponent with BSA and bovine Î³-globulin was performed by adjusting the pH as required.

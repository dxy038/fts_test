With wireless energy transfer, a mobile node can operate perpetually without having a wired connection to charge its battery. In this paper, we present a quality of service (QoS) aware data transmission and wireless energy transfer for the mobile node. The node can request for wireless energy transfer or transmit a packet when the node is in a coverage area of an access point. The node supports service differentiation for different type of traffic (i.e., low and high priority data). To meet the QoS requirement of each traffic type, we present the performance modeling and optimization framework. The objective is to maximize the throughput, while the packet loss probabilities are maintained below the target levels. The optimal policy for the node is obtained from solving the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). In addition, we present an application of the framework to a data mule for collecting, carrying, and transmitting data from sensors to the access point.

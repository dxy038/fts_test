In this article, different ternary moving bed configurations are studied by determining the working flow-rates of the equivalent true moving bed at the low solvent consumption point using equilibrium theory. This method has been applied for linear adsorption isotherms. The simulated moving bed flow-rates can then be calculated and a final comparison between the performances of each process is given based upon two different objective functions.

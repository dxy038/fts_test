Left handed metamaterials are attracting great considerable interests from the scientific and engineering communities owing to their unique electromagnetic characteristics not found in known naturally occurring materials. The objective of this work is to study behaviour of left-handed coplanar waveguides (LH CPWs) on ferrite substrate focusing on the effect on changing the magnetic bias on the non reciprocity features. Two LH CPW structures are studied by periodically loading either lumped or distributed CPW with series capacitance and shunt inductance. The two structures with finite length are numerically simulated to predict their electric performance by varying DC biased magnetic field. The preliminary results indicate that a transmission band with transmission coefficient better than -3 dB can be achieved.

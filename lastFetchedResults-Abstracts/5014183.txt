Because of the ambiguity and the subjectivity of man-machine design evaluation, an objective and quantitative man-machine evaluation is a difficult problem in the product design and development. Firstly, some basic design evaluation methods are briefly introduced. Secondly, the basic theory and the main steps of the fuzzy evaluation method are described in detail. The fuzzy evaluation method should be used in the process of man-machine evaluation, because the problem on subjectivity and uncertainty of man-machine evaluation can be effectively solved and the relatively objective and accurate evaluation conclusion can be drawn. Finally, fuzzy man-machine evaluation of the chairs as an example is provided to prove the effectiveness and the feasibility of fuzzy evaluation method. In a word, the fuzzy evaluation method is an effective way of man-machine evaluation and one of the focuses and the directions in the further study on man-machine evaluation.

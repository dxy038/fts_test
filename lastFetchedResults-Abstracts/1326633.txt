This paper introduces the system's perspective of the dynamic planning and control methodology (DPM), aimed to support both the strategic and the operational aspects of project management. For this objective, a new modeling framework that integrates system dynamics and network-based tools is presented in this paper. The proposed framework adopts system dynamics as a core simulation engine for strategic project management and network-based tools as a wrap layer for operational project management. To implement the DPM framework, a web-based system has been developed within a collaborative environment. The developed system provides great support to both the strategic and operational aspects of project management by integrating familiar network concepts with system dynamics to analyze the overall strategic and operational project performance.

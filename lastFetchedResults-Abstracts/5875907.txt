With the rapid increase of complexity in system-on-a-chip (SoC) design, the electronic design automation (EDA) community is moving from RTL (Register Transfer Level) synthesis to behavioral-level and system-level synthesis. The needs of system-level verification and software/hardware co-design also prefer behavior-level executable specifications, such as C or SystemC. In this paper we present the platform-based synthesis system, named xPilot, being developed at UCLA. The first objective of xPilot is to provide novel behavioral synthesis capability for automatically generating efficient RTL code from a C or SystemC description for a given system platform and optimizing the logic, interconnects, performance, and power simultaneously. The second objective of xPilot is to provide a platform-based system-level synthesis capability, including both synthesis for application-specific configurable processors and heterogeneous multi-core systems. Preliminary experiments on FPGAs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a wide range of applications and its value in exploring various design tradeoffs.

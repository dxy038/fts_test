This paper presents a proposal for transmitting images using Multiple Description Coding (MDC) techniques over multiple links in a mesh network, while using network coding technique to add a protection path. In pure MDC, the loss of one of the multiple descriptions degrades the received image quality. In the proposed technique, the protection path ensures that all the descriptions are received even when one description is lost, but at the expense of additional link and data bandwidth. A comparative evaluation based on simulation and objective quality metrics is presented.

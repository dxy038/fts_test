The gradient algorithm used absolute value of error signal as a criterion to adjust the filter coefficient of adaptive IIR notch filter is presented in this paper. The objective is to estimate or track the frequency of a single sinusoidal signal corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. The proposed algorithm can solve the problem of selecting an initial condition as met in the previous method. Moreover, it also has a high convergence speed.

Objectives. The development of adhesive resins to dentine enables resin restorations to be more durable. Several bond strength measurement techniques for measuring adhesion have been proposed. A standardised method is needed which produced higher and more consistent bond strength values which allow bond stability and the bonding mechanism to be studied. Our aim was to investigate mainly the adhesives and not the substrate.

Data sources. This review is based on the literature on an adhesive, 4-META/MMA–TBB resin and conditioners to modify dentine substrates. The latter is a very important topic for developing our understanding of the bonding to dentine. The objective of the review is to explain the efficacy of the mini-dumbbell specimen in measuring the tensile strength of resin to dentine and to analyze the resin to dentine interface. Both the adhesive and the substrate control the quality of hybridized dentine.

Conclusions. By creating an impermeable acid resistant barrier to both biological and chemical stimuli between the exposed dentine and the restored tooth surface we are able to protect exposed dentine from caries (infection) at the same time as protecting the pulp and preventing toothache. This barrier also helps maintain tooth vitality and for the purposes of this article is termed ‘artificial enamel’. Microleakage free restorations are possible through the introduction of this ‘impermeable artificial enamel’ barrier.

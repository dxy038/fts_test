Objective: Syndecan 1 is a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan that binds growth factors and antithrombin III. The objective of this study was to examine whether placental expression of syndecan 1 in preeclampsia differs from that in normal pregnancy and whether gestational age and fetal growth affect syndecan 1 expression. Study Design: An immunohistochemical analysis of 30 placentas of women with severe preeclampsia and 15 placentas of women without preeclampsia was performed with the monoclonal antiâ€“syndecan 1 antibody B-B4. Results: In 47% of preeclamptic placentas the immunoreactivity with antibody B-B4 was faint or absent, whereas 93% of the normal placentas exhibited strong immunoreactivity. The reduction in placental expression of syndecan 1 in preeclampsia was not associated with gestational age or impaired fetal growth. Conclusion: The expression of syndecan 1 on the chorionic villi is reduced in preeclampsia irrespective of gestational age or fetal growth. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:1495-8.)

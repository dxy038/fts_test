Objective
Gestational night blindness (XN) is associated with increased risk of reproductive morbidity and mortality. This study investigated the prevalence of gestational XN among postpartum women treated in a public maternity hospital in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and evaluated its association with maternal and neonatal (cord blood) serum retinol concentrations.
Methods

XN was evaluated retrospectively, using an interview according to guidelines of the World Health Organization, in 222 postpartum women (≤6 h after delivery) after singleton births who had low obstetric risk. Serum retinol concentrations were measured according to the modified Bessey method, with a cutoff point lower than 1.05 μmol/L for inadequate serum retinol concentration.
Results

Prevalence of gestational XN was 18%, and inadequate maternal and cord blood serum retinol concentrations were found in 24.4% and 45.5% of samples, respectively. The results associated gestational XN with inadequate maternal serum retinol concentration (P = 0.000), and an association was observed between maternal and neonatal serum retinol concentrations (P = 0.000). A poor association was observed between maternal XN and serum levels of retinol in newborn children (P = 0.06).
Conclusions

The results suggest that prevalence of gestational XN and inadequate serum retinol concentration among postpartum women and newborns is a concern, calling attention to the need for studies in other parts of Brazil. In addition, the risk of inadequate serum retinol in newborns was significantly higher among infants of postpartum women with serum retinol levels below 1.05 μmol/L. Gestational XN was associated with inadequate levels of maternal serum retinol, and the results suggest a poor relation between maternal XN and vitamin A nutritional status of newborns.

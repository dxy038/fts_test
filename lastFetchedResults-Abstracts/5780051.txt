Performance of wireless mesh networks can be greatly improved by spatial reuse with concurrent transmissions. However, most current research works on WiMAX mesh networks are based on a unidirectional concurrent transmission scheme to perform link and packet scheduling. In this paper, we analyze the interference model of IEEE 802.16 TDMA mesh networks and propose a bidirectional concurrent transmission model. We formulate the model into an ILP problem and provide the solution. Simulation results show that our bidirectional transmission mechanism can effectively improve the network performance. Further study reveals that the throughput enhancement varies with different network topologies and distinct location of BS.

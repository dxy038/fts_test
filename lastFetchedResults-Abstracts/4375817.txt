An adaptive sensing period optimisation scheme for cognitive radio networks based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm formulation is proposed. The proposed scheme aims at maximising the spectrum opportunities as well as minimising the incurred sensing overhead. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the non-optimised proposals by up to 90%. It can also obtain similar or superior performance to the compared schemes described in the literature, while keeping the sensing overhead within a target value.

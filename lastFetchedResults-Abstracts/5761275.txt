This paper presents a region of interest (ROI) based video coding technique for H.264 based video coding with improved error resilience and error protection in the foreground. We used the flexible macroblock ordering (FMO) tool in H.264 video coding standard to encode the video frame into three separate slices. First slice carries the background, and other two slices contains alternative macroblock of the foreground forming a check board pattern. Foreground packets are protected with a stronger error correction code than background packets. Experimental results show that the proposed technique improves the objective quality of the foreground by more than 1 dB

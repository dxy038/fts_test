This article deals with the creation of dynamic models in the form of transient characteristics obtained from the monitoring system boring machine-rock used in tunneling Branisko using the tunnel boring method (TBM). The rating system is the creation of statistical models and their approximation of the measured, respectively, monitored values. As a starting point a statistical model was used that was obtained by transient characteristics. The statistical model was then replaced by a new model by approximation. The objective is to design a model that would ensure that the output variable accurately monitors changes in input, and that the suppressed disturbance variables affect the output variable. To assess how the solutions to this goal are being approached, it is necessary to choose some quantitative indicators and indicators of the quality and accuracy of the model. The quality requirements for the model are expressed using quality indicators, respectively, selected criteria. The quality indicators model enables us to judge several variants of solutions and choose the most appropriate one. The following quality parameters of the model will be based on an analogy for the synthesis of control loops. The accuracy of the model is given by the deviation of the steady-state system in the course of a given type of input and a disturbance variable. The advantage of using these quality indicators for the model is their explicitness and that gives direct information on the timing of the reporting process. The disadvantage of these quality parameters of the model is that not all of them fully describe the whole course of the transient response. For these reasons, we have chosen an integral quality criterion for the model system.

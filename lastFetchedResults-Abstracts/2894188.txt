This paper prescribes a digital forensic policy framework for a State to introduce Digital Forensics as a Service (DFaaS) as an integral part of e-Government services. DFaaS constitutes of investigating services for crimes committed upon and using electronic media. The policy framework proposes to establish a Centralized Digital Forensic Facility (CDFF) for enabling digital forensic services across all digital forensic units of a State. The basic objective of CDFF is to standardize, disseminate knowledge and reduce duplication of works related to DFaaS maintaining Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity of information. The core of the Policy aims to impose a few cost effective security mechanism on top of any infrastructure, be it a data centre or be it a cloud computing environment. Such mechanism enforces State specific forensic agents to be executed at specified levels of any public or private Infrastructure to facilitate forensic activities on the Infrastructure on demand and as per convenience.

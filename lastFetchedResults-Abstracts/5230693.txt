This paper studies the feasibility of using low-power wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee in high-speed railway scenarios that involve bidirectional ground-to-train communication. The presented results have been obtained through experimental tests conducted at the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail line. A multiplatform communication system has been installed in a high-speed train, circulating at velocities up to 300 km/h, whereas autonomous devices have been disseminated along of the railway path to communicate with the onboard devices. The conclusions drawn from this work will be used as guidelines for the future implementation of autonomous communication platforms for high-speed rail connectivity.

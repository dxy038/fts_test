 Objective: To assess whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the vocal tract (VT) area function to be determined for a normal male speaker. Method: VT shapes were acquired using MRI during sustained production of French points vowels: /i/, /a/, /u/. Cross-sectional areas were measured from a series of planes spaced at intervals of 1 cm along the length of the VT and were used as input in a previously described VT model to simulate the vowels. The first three formant frequencies, F1, F2, and F3, computed from the MRI-measured VT model were compared with subject's natural formant frequencies. Results: Including piriform sinuses, calculated formants differed from measured formants F1, F2, and F3, respectively, for /i/ by âˆ’3.5%, +7.7%, and +27.5%; for /a/ by +11% +19.5%, and âˆ’4.3%; and for /u/ by +.9%, +23.4%, and +9.6%. Excluding piriform sinuses, calculated formants differed from measured formants F1, F2, and F3, respectively, for /i/ by âˆ’3.5%, +12%, and +28%, and for /u/ by +10.1%, +26.8%, and +13.7% The piriform sinuses were not visualized for /a/ on MRI. Conclusions: MRI is a noninvasive technique that allows VT imaging and determination of VT area function for a normal male speaker. Several possible sources of discrepancies are as follows: variability of the articulation, difficulties in assessment of VT wall boundaries, role of the piriform sinuses, and VT length.

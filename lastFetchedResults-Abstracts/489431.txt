The objective of this study was to investigate of possibility of MDF production from successful Eucalyptus Species. Eucalyptus camaldulensis fibers were produced using different levels of steaming time ( 7.5 and 15 minutes), press temprature (170, 180 and 190 Â°C ) and press time (3 and 4 minutes) and used for panel making. Physical and mechanical properties of panels were measured and analyzed. The results indicated that increasing of steaming time, lowered MOR of boards. The press temprature had significant effect on MOR, and with increasing press temprature, MOR increased. Furthermore increasing of steaming time, decreased the IB of boards and increasing steaming time from 7.5 to 15 minutes, decreased IB from 0.787 to 0.533 MPa. Increasing of steaming time, also decreased thickness swelling of boards. However, the results of this study showed that, the MOR and MOE of boards produced from Eucalyptus camaldulensis fibers are around standard level. But in other hand, the internal bonding and thickness swelling of boards are higher than level standard.

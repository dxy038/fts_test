As part of the European CommissionÂ´s DRIVE II programme, funding was made available for the ATT Project PROMPT (Priority and Informatics in Public Transport). The project ran from 1992 to 1995. The main objective of the project was to develop, demonstrate and evaluate strategies for giving active priority to buses and trams in real-time adaptive urban traffic control (UTC) systems. A second objective was to allow other European cities and industry to benefit from the project through exploitation of the results. PROMPT was a core project in the area of public transport management, with links to the areas of demand management and integrated urban traffic management. The project was based on activities in the three major European cities: London, Turin and Gothenburg, with a further demonstration being undertaken in Southampton. Each city has an advanced UTC system and has a vehicle location system on at least part of the public transport fleet

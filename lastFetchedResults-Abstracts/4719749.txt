Reasonable division of port hinterland distribution centers can effectively utilize port resources and increase efficiency. A nonlinear programming model for hinterland distribution center division is established under the objective function of minimizing total transport distance. And then, the model is transformed into a linear programming model. The computational example manifests that the two models can divide the hinterland distribution centers and the schemes of division are consistent with the peopleÂ´s intuition.

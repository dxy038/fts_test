The engine air-start test program was carried out as one of the flight tests for the XF-2, Japanese next generation support fighter. The objective of the program was to demonstrate the aircraftÂ´s capability to recover from in-flight engine shutdown. The XF-2 being a single engine aircraft, this is one of major requirements to the aircraft. The planning and results of the tests are described. Tests were planned with emphasis on the safe execution because the engine is shut down during the flight tests. In all air-start conditions tested the air-start succeeded without exceeding the criteria; the time to ignition, the time to thrust recovery and the maximum exhaust gas temperature, and it was confirmed that the aircraft is capable to recover from in-flight engine shutdown

This correspondence deals with the problem of noise reduction for hands-free communications when two microphones are in use. We consider two methods usually adopted in the case of uncorrelated noises. The first one is based on the coherence function and the second on Wiener filtering. We propose to modify the previous methods by including a cross power spectrum estimation to take the presence of some correlated noise components into account. Objective results show a significant improvement in comparison with the basic structures

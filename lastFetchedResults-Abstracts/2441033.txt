A new kind of low temperature superconductor (LTS) and high temperature superconductor (HTS) hybrid conductor is proposed. In LTS/HTS hybrid conductor, a multifilamentary NbTi/Cu LTS cable and Bi-2223/Ag HTS tapes are combined. The objective is to use Bi-2223/Ag tapes as stabilizers in composite-type superconductors in place of low resistive metals, such as pure aluminum. Firstly, the stability measurement experiments on short sample LTS/HTS hybrid conductors have been done as a proof-of-principle using a 9 T bias magnet. A significant increase in minimum propagation currents has been observed in case of the LTS/HTS hybrid conductor as compared with NbTi/Cu cable.

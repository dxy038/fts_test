Glucans have a long history as non-specific biological modulators; however, but the search for optimal chemical configuration is still on. The objective of this study was to evaluate intraperitoneal application of PS3, a sulfated derivative of a (1–>3)-β-d-glucan isolated from sporophytes of Laminaria digitata. PS3 showed significant stimulation of phagocytic activity as well as potentiation of synthesis and release of IL-2 by splenocytes. In addition, PS3 increased NK cell-mediated killing of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. When combined, our observations suggest that PS3 is similarly effective as native non-sulfated (1–>3)-β-d-glucan and is generally more active than lentinan.

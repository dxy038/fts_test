An ecological risk assessment (ERA) was conducted for Shadegan Wetland in Iran. The objective of
this study was to assess the risk to phytoplankton, zooplankton, invertebrate, insect larvae, and fish
affected by pesticide in Shadegan Wetland. Five pesticides (DDT, Aldrine, Dieldrin, Ametryn and
Lindane) were assessed to evaluate the impact to aquatic community in the Shadegan Wetland. The risk
quotient (RQ) served as calculation in water concentration and toxicant reference values of five
pesticides. The results of RQ method showed that RQs for shirbot or large scaled barb (Barbus grypus),
benni (Barbus sharpeyi), golden barb (Barbus luteus) and insect larvae (Chironomus sp.) were high and
the environment at risk of harmful pesticides .It is recommended that proper strategies should be
implemented to reduce the risks.

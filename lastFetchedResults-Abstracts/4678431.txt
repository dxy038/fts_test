Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are semiconductor lasers based on intersubband transitions in quantum wells. Semiconductor lasers in ring format do not need cleaved facets or gratings to achieve optical feedback required for lasing and could support either bidirectional or unidirectional operation. In this paper, we report on QCL in this ring format for unidirectional operation and coupled ring tuning.

This paper considers a joint design that incorporates the physical, medium access and network layers of a generic OFDMA-based wireless network with an ad hoc topology. The network employs channel reuse, whereby a frequency subchannel might be used simultaneously by multiple nodes. In addition to being a source and/or a destination, each node can act as a half-duplex relay to assist other nodes. The design objective is to determine the jointly optimal data routes and subchannel power allocations that maximize a weighted sum of the rates that can be reliably communicated over the network. Assuming that the signals transmitted by the nodes are Gaussian, the joint cross layer design of routing and power allocation is cast as an optimization problem. Unfortunately, this problem is non-convex, and hence difficult to solve. To circumvent this difficulty, an efficient technique based on geometric programming is developed to obtain a local solution that satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker necessary optimality conditions. Numerical results show that, despite the potential suboptimality of the obtained solution, for some network scenarios, it offers significant gains over optimal scheduling-based schemes in which a frequency band is allowed to be used by one node only at any time instant.

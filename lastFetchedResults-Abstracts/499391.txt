Background and Objective: To evaluate interaction of salvigenin with DNA and the molecular mechanism of its anti-cancer effect.

Materials and Methods: Salvigenin from Tanacetum canescens and DNA from calf thymus were isolated and purified. Then, salvigenin interaction with DNA in Tris buffer (0.05 M, pH equal to 4.7 and the temperature at 25 Â°C) was studied by different methods.

Results and Conclusion: DNA absorption spectra in the presence of various concentrations of each of these ligands showed that the DNA with salvigenin has interaction and complex formation and the absorption wave length at 260 nm increased. Under the effect of changes in DNA uptake ligand showed structural changes. Also, using information obtained from the suppression with ethidium bromide of DNA complex by ligand skachard, above analysis indicated that the mechanism of suppression of publication is through non-competitive inhibition and it means that connecting mechanism of salvigenin is non-intercalated with DNA and probably through connection small grooves.

In this paper, a model-based predictive control strategy based on local modeling approach is proposed for distributed parameter system. As the partial differential equation (PDE) descriptions of the systems are unknown, the local modeling approach is used to estimate the dynamics of the system based on the input-output data. Based on finite local models, each local controller output can obtain through minimizing the local optimization objective. The global controlled outputs can be solved by linear programming where the deviations of the global spatial temporal outputs from their spatial set points over the prediction horizon are considered as the optimal objective. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodologies are tested in the cross-flow heat exchanger.

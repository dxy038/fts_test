Controller design and optimization problems, with more than one objective, are referred as multiple objectives or multiple attributed problems. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for designing optimum PID controller that is called genetic multiple attributed decision making method (GMADM). This method is newer than the previous methods and in this paper some options are considered that have not been considered in previous paper for simplicity. The proposed PID controller is applied on the automatic voltage regulator (AVR).An automatic voltage regulator system is the main part of a generator because this system keeps the output voltage in constant level. The simulation results of automatic voltage regulator system are compared with conventional multiobjective algorithm, known as multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA).The simulation results of automatic voltage regulator system show that GMADM method is better than MOGA and the number of optimum solutions of the proposed method is greater than the other one.

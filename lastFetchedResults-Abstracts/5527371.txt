Open content represents a huge knowledge base in nearly every domain regarding the currently arising social semantic Web. However, weaving these precious resources sustainable into agile knowledge transfer and learning is not lighted very well so far. The focus of this contribution lies on utilizing available, distributed data sets on the Web for vast interactive knowledge transfer and learning. Social educational gaming is instanced to simplify interoperation, to spread knowledge in a handy way and to enhance users´ collaboration with open content. Learning aims deal with broaden the users´ perspective on available information and resources. Especially fact-related knowledge is assessable in an effective manner this way. Attendance increases through game-based, incentive arrangements like point and level concepts. Confrontation with daily knowledge topics can be immerged through knowledge games for a broad audience. Long-term objective is to establish open content in educational contexts as knowledge base - by enabling a proposal of suitable Web service compositions and a modular construction kit for user-centered interfaces with high functionality and design issues. Overall, we boost open content as an inherent part of higher-layered, lightweight applications in knowledge and information transfer via standard tasks of knowledge engineering and augmented user interaction. Knowledge management concerns interweave with social gaming and collaboration.

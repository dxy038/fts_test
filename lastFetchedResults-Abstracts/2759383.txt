Sparse coding is a promising theme in computer vision. Most of the existing sparse coding methods are based on either <i>l</i><sub>0</sub> or <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> penalty, which often leads to unstable solution or biased estimation. This is because of the nonconvexity and discontinuity of the <i>l</i><sub>0</sub> penalty and the over-penalization on the true large coefficients of the <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> penalty. In this paper, sparse coding is interpreted from a novel Bayesian perspective, which results in a new objective function through maximum a posteriori estimation. The obtained solution of the objective function can generate more stable results than the <i>l</i><sub>0</sub> penalty and smaller reconstruction errors than the <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> penalty. In addition, the convergence property of the proposed algorithm for sparse coding is also established. The experiments on applications in single image super-resolution and visual tracking demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective than other state-of-the-art methods.

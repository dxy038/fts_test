Disassembly scheduling is the problem of determining the ordering and disassembly schedule for used products while satisfying the demands of their individual parts or components over the planning horizon. The objective is to minimize the sum of purchase, inventory holding, and disassembly operation costs, subject to capacity restrictions in each period. In this paper, an integer programming model, which is a reversed form of the multi-level capacitated lot sizing problem, is suggested to represent and solve the problem optimally. A case study on used inkjet printers is worked out and the test results are reported.

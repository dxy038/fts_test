When dealing with multiobjective optimization (MO) of the tire-suspension system of a racing car, a large number of design variables and a large number of objectives have to be taken into account. Two different models have been used, both validated on data coming from an instrumented car, a differential equation-based physical model, and a neural network purely numerical model. Up to 23 objective functions have been defined, at least 14 of which are in strict conflict of each other. The equivalent scalar function based and the objective-as-constraint formulations are intentionally avoided due to their well-known limitations. A fuzzy definition of optima, being a generalization of Pareto optimality, is applied to the problem. The result of such an approach is that subsets of Pareto optimal solutions (on such a problem, a big portion of the entire search space) can be properly selected as a consequence of input from the designer. The obtained optimal solutions are compared with the reference vehicle and with the optima previously obtained with design of experiment techniques and different MO optimization strategies. The proposed strategy improves both the reference (actual) car and previously obtained optima (scalar preference function) in the majority of objectives with technically significant improvements. Moreover, the strategy offers an univoque criterion for the choice among tradeoff solutions in the 14-dimensional objective space. The problem is used as a test of a proposed optimal design strategy for industrial problems, integrating differential equation and neural networks modeling, design of experiments, MO, and fuzzy optimal-based decision making. Such a linked approach gives also a unified view of where to concentrate the computational effort.

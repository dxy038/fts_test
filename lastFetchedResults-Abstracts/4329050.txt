An investigative study of three-parameter diversely polarized array manifold is presented in this paper. With a polarization diversity, an extra degree of signal discrimination is provided to an array system allowing the multipath fading to be mitigated and the performance of a communication system to be significantly enhanced. The main objective in this work is to use differential geometry as a tool to analyze the array manifold of this type. A new mathematical framework based on the study of three-parameter array manifold is proposed in conjunction with an analysis of diversely polarized manifold. Various intrinsic parameters such as arclength, area, and volume are defined to provide a fundamental understanding of the geometrical properties and local behavior of the manifold.

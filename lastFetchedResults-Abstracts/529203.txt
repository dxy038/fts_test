We study the effects of different pricing strategies available to a productionâ€“inventory system with capacitated supply, which operates in a fluctuating demand environment. The demand depends on the environment and on the offered price. For such systems, three plausible pricing strategies are investigated: static pricing, for which only one price is used at all times, environment-dependent pricing, for which price changes with the environment, and dynamic pricing, for which price depends on both the current environment and the stock level. The objective is to find an optimal replenishment and pricing policy under each of these strategies. This article presents some structural properties of optimal replenishment policies and a numerical study that compares the performances of these three pricing strategies.

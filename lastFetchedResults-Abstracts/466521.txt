Objective: We sought to determine whether Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7) and Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) scores are sensitive to changes in clinical status after surgery for genuine stress incontinence (GSI) or pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Study Design: Patients were included in this study if they had completed the IIQ-7 and UDI-6 scales and had undergone urodynamic testing before and 3 months after surgery for GSI or POP. Kruskal-Wallis tests and logistic regression were used to compare IIQ-7 and UDI-6 scores according to the outcome of surgery. Results: Among 55 patients satisfying inclusion criteria for the study, 34 (62%) underwent Burch colposuspension, and 21 (38%) underwent suburethral sling procedures for GSI; 44 (80%) patients were subjectively continent after surgery. Thirty-four (62%) patients underwent surgical treatment of their POP; 31 (90%) were subjectively cured of their POP symptoms. Mean IIQ-7 and UDI-6 scores were lower in patients who were subjectively continent, and UDI-6 scores were lower in patients who were objectively cured of GSI. Conclusion: UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores change after surgery for GSI and POP, with patients who are subjectively continent having lower postoperative scores on both scales.

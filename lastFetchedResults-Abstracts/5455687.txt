This work presents a comparative study of two indirect current control techniques based on proportional integral (PI) controller and on a fuzzy logic controller applied to a voltage source inverter operating as an active power filter. The performance of the fuzzy controller depends on the choice of membership function and the inference of fuzzy rules that does not require an accurate mathematical model of power converter. The objective of this paper is to design a fuzzy controller using a Sugeno method, then optimizing it using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and thereafter compare the simulation results with a proportional integral controller (PI). The output of these controllers is used to calculate the peak supply current. Simulation results are presented using Matlab. It is demonstrated that the fuzzy logic controller improves the performance of the active filter.

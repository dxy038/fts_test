Solution of inverse problem of estimation of radiation sources is suggested. It is based on a non-linear optimization technique where objective function is built by penalty residual function and by spatial quasi-extent regularizator. The model of radiation sources is described by a set of the ideal Hertzian dipoles. The case, when dipoles are located along a straight line, which is parallel to measurement line of electric field, and when their electric moments are perpendicular to the measurement plane, is considered. Algorithm and numerical simulations with Gaussian additive noise are presented.

Objective
luate the effect of different concentrations of inhaled budesonide on secretion of tumoral necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and on ligature-induced alveolar bone loss in Wistar rats.
als and methods
two animals were randomly divided in four groups. Control group (G1) did not receive any procedure. For the other 3 groups, alveolar bone loss was induced by placement of ligatures around the upper second molar. The contralateral molar was considered intra-group control. Group 2 (G2) was nebulized with saline solution (NaCl 0.9%). Groups 3 and 4 (G3 and G4) were nebulized with 30 μg and 100 μg budesonide, respectively. Administration of drugs was performed daily for 14 days. Blood samples were collected from all animals for analysis of TNF-α. The maxillae from G2, G3 and G4 were removed and defleshed with 9% sodium hypochlorite. Morphometric analysis of bone loss was performed in digital standard photographs. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey HSD or Scheffé multiple comparison's test (significance level P ≤ 0.05).
s
lveolar bone loss values for teeth with ligature were 0.72, 0.70 and 0.77 mm for Groups 2, 3 and 4, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found amongst groups with or without ligature. The production of TNF-α was 60% higher in the presence of ligature (G1 vs. G2/G3/G4). No effect was observed in TNF-α secretion after inhalation of budesonide.
sion
d budesonide in different concentrations did not alter alveolar bone loss and TNF-α secretion in male Wistar rats.

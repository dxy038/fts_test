Data were collected by means of a questionnaire covering personal and social characteristics, parity and gynecologic history. It contained 15 questions on factors influencing sexual behavior, 5 questions related to the variations in the nature of sexual intercourse during the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy (libido, number of sexual contacts, love-making positions and feelings of inconvenience during and after coitus). The data were analyzed using the SPSS-10 program.
Results: The findings showed that 10.7% of women in the first trimester, 15.2% in the second and 20.6% in the third trimester had experienced dyspareunia. 18.5% of women in the first trimester, 18.3% in the second trimester, and 33.2% in the third trimester had complaints of stomachache and backache during intercourse. 17.7% of women in the first trimester, 24.3% in the second trimester, and 23% in the third trimester suffered from stomachache and backache after intercourse. The results of chi-square tests showed a significant association between parity and the following set of symptoms: feelings of guilt, dyspareunia (P-0.004), fear of preterm labor and dyspareunia (P=0.04), parity and postcoital stomachache and backache (P=0.01), dyspareunia and postcoital vaginal irritation (P=0.03) in the first trimester.

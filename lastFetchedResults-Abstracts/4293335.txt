Malaysia has many renewable energy sources that can be developed such as solar, wind, biomass, hydro, geothermal and tidal wave. However, it is not yet widely developed. Since, energy is important, a national center for renewable energy resources database should be setup to bring together designers, engineers, architects and policy makers to use the actual data for implementing renewable energy projects. The objective of this study is to determine the most suitable renewable energy generation to be implemented in Malaysia from four obvious options available which are solar, wind, biomass and tidal wave. A study has been conducted in several contributing factors namely geographical distribution, technology involved and economic analysis. The analysis has been done by gathering the related information and data from previous studies as well as and visits to sites and related authorities. The result of these analysis shows that biomass energy generation has the most encouraging potential to be developed in Malaysia as shown by evidences from the comparative study being made in this paper.

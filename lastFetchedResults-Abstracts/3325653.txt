Motivated by the biological metamorphosis process and the need to solve multi-objective optimization problems with conflicting and fuzzy goals and constraints, this paper proposes a simulated metamorphosis algorithm, based on the concepts of biological evolution in insects, such as moths, butterflies, and beetles. By mimicking the hormone controlled evolution process the algorithm works on a single candidate solution, going through initialization, iterative growth loop, and finally maturation loop. The method is a practical way to optimizing multi-objective problems with fuzzy conflicting goals and constraints. The approach is applied to the nurse scheduling problem. Equipped with the facility to incorporate the user´s choices and wishes, the algorithm offers an interactive approach that can accommodate the decision maker´s expert intuition and experience, which is otherwise impossible with other optimization algorithms. By using hormonal guidance and unique operators, the algorithm works on a single candidate solution, and efficiently evolves it to a near-optimal solution. Computational experiments show that the algorithm is competitive.

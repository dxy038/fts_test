This paper will explain the design process and results achieved to make a ground tracker base. The general objective of the project was to build a base for a ground antenna, capable of adjusting its position automatically, in order to point to an airplane, which location has been transmitted to the ground station by the airplane with the intention to create a point to point link. The results obtained (Table 1) exceed the expectations using a low cost approximation obtained by the use of commercial products.

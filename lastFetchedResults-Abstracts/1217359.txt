Background and Objective:  Postural control in people with non- specific low back pain (NSLBP) is disturbed. To investigate this disturbance, an external mechanical perturbation can be applied. The effect of local mechanical vibration on postural control through external perturbation in people with NSLBP has been less studied, so the purpose of this study was to investigate the ability to maintain postural stability in this patients following local mechanical vibration under external perturbation.
Subjects and Methods: Thirty participants (15 with NSLBP and 15 healthy controls) were recruited. First while standing on a force plate with sampling frequency of 500 HZ, the load was released unexpectedly on a tray which was on the participantâ€™s hands. Then, following experiencing a local vibration on lumbar area for 5 minutes, the similar perturbation, was applied. To investigate the effects of vibration on postural control parameters including mean displacement and mean velocity of center of pressure (COP), in Medio-Lateral and Antro-Posterior directions, paired T-test was used. 
Results: No difference was found in postural control parameters in sagital and frontal planes before and after vibration between two groups and within each group. 
Conclusion: Local, medium frequency mechanical vibrations for 5 minutes on low back area had no significant effects on postural control in people with low back pain and did not decrease their postural robustness.

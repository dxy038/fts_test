Color demosaicking is well known as an ill-posed problem of sensor image restoration. In this paper, a self-validation framework for color demosaicking is proposed. In the proposed self-validation framework, multiple algorithms under different hypotheses will be performed to generate multiple candidates. Then the final estimation of a missing color sample will be decided by evaluating the local consistency of each algorithm with double interpolation. With this framework, the strengths of different algorithms can be combined and thus eliminate color artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can improve the image quality in both subjective and objective measures.

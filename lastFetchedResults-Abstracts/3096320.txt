The objective of TERAEYE project, funded by the European Community through the Sixth Framework Programme, is to develop an innovative range of inspecting passive systems, based on Quantum Dot sensor, to identify harmful materials for homeland security both by spectral analysis and imaging. Main applications will be related to airports security systems, surveillance of crowded areas such as railway and metro stations and detection of chemical and biological harmful substances and hazards in post and goods. TERAEYE will develop an innovative range of THz inspecting passive systems based on nanofabricated detectors to identify harmful materials for homeland security both by spectral analysis and imaging. The detector is based on Quantum Dots coupled with metal single-electron-transistors. This device works at few Kelvin and is able to convert a single THz Photon into 10 million electrons.

Background: With the technical development, ultrasound tends to overpass its limits
and to become the main investigation tool even for situations when it was traditionally
considered “second best”. It is more convenient both for patient and doctor, less
expensive and has real diagnostic value.
Objective: The present paper, and its graphic back-up, are intended as a visual
testimony of the fact that the newer three dimensional (3D) ultrasound technique is
much more than a simple generator of “nice”, commercial, images. Moreover, its use
may be extended from obstetrics to gynecological pathology, especially in cases related
to infertility.
Materials and Methods: We performed a review of the main local infertility causes
and their perception by the 3D ultrasound, as compared to the conventional methods.
General literature citations were completed with personal cases and images. In our
research, we used a Kretz – Voluson Expert 730 ultrasound machine with a full logistic
equipment. Our database was completed over a period of 18 months and included
various pathology, such as uterine anomalies, fibroids, polyps, ovarian cysts and many
others.
Results: Three dimensional ultrasound represents the best tool in evaluating the uterine
cavity, the endometrium, assessing its volume and vascularity pattern. It also offers a
very good image of the uterine structure, the adnexal morphology and their relationship.
It performs a thorough pelvic assessment by a single examination. Moreover, it may
realize a histerosalpingography, which is as efficient as the radiological method, but
easier and with fewer side effects.
Conclusion: Even though it is technically more difficult and time consuming, a good
practice and high quality ultrasound equipment offer a series of benefits over any other
kind of investigation.

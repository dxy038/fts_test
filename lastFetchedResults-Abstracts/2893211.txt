This paper summarizes the work related to power line robotics over the past 15 years at Hydro-Que&#769;bec´s research institute (IREQ). Robotic platforms are presented as well as the inspection and maintenance systems equipping them. The paper also presents a new organizational unit recently established at IREQ and called the &#8220;Power Line Robotics Program&#8221; (PLRP). This novel structure´s objective is to leverage the benefits of external collaboration and international interest in power line robotics, in order to provide Hydro-Que&#769;bec with professional inspection services, manufacturing capacity and strategic funding for new developments. More recent activities related to non-destructive probes are also discussed. Examples of PLRP tasks and responsibilities are given, stating why this structure is relevant within a power utility and how it accelerates the use and benefit of robotics in the power industry.

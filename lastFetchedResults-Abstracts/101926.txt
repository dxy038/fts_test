The objective of this paper is to understand how and why the orifice nature (rigid or flexible) governs bubble generation. The differences in orifice nature and properties have strong consequences on the bubbles generated. Indeed, the dynamics of the formation and the nature of the detached bubbles are fundamentally different depending on whether the bubbles are generated from the rigid orifice or from the flexible orifice.

Computer science students need to understand parallel computing, since it may become an integral part of their own careers. The best way to accomplish this is to integrate parallel computing concepts throughout the entire curriculum, from the introductory level up. As parallel computing becomes a part of several courses, it need not displace large segments of material that are currently in these courses; each course can contribute a small amount to the overall objective of understanding parallel computing. The paper presents a sample curriculum

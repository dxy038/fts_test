This paper considers Active Network Management (ANM) in optimal sizing and sitting of the distributed generation (DG) units in distribution network. The objective of the proposed formulation is to maximize the DG capacity. On the one hand, using large amount of DGs in a distribution network will result in great savings like as investment deferment and loss reductions, but on the other hand, it may causes technical problems like as overvoltage and overloads. The ANM method has essential role in facilitating the connection of new generations without need of reinforcement traditional network. The proposed approach is successfully applied to a real 29-bus urban distribution network in Iran. The results of DG sizing and placement using ANM method are compared with the Passive Management (PM). The results indicate that using ANM reduces losses effectively compared to passive management and maximize size of the DG units.

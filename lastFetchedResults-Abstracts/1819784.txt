The objective of this investigation was to determine whether celecoxib, a highly specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inhibits the promotion phase of mammary tumorigenesis in rats fed a high fat diet rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that is known to induce COX-2 expression. Sixty female Sprague–Dawley rats were initially maintained on an AIN-93G diet. At 50 days of age they received a single i.p. injection of methylnitrosourea (MNU). One week later, all rats were switched to a modified AIN-93G diet containing 18% safflower oil plus 3% soybean oil. Half of the rats also began receiving 1500 ppm celecoxib in the diet and the control and experimental diets were continued for a further 23 weeks. Celecoxib significantly decreased both the final tumor incidence (63.3% in the celecoxib group versus 82.2% in the control group, P&lt;0.05) and tumor multiplicity (0.9±0.2 tumors/rat in the celecoxib group versus 2.3±0.3 tumors/rat in the control group, P&lt;0.05). At the termination of the experiment, body weights were significantly lower in the celecoxib group compared to controls (330.6±6.1 versus 401.5±10.9 g respectively, P&lt;0.05) although there was no evidence of toxicity and food intakes were not different for the two groups. Fasting serum triglycerides and abdominal adipose tissue accumulation were lower in the celecoxib group compared to controls (49.3±4.4 versus 82.8±12.6 mg/dL, P&lt;0.05, and 7.2±0.3 versus 11.3±0.4% of body weight, P&lt;0.01, respectively). These results show that administration of celecoxib to rats in a high fat diet rich in n-6 PUFAs suppresses the promotion of mammary tumorigenesis induced by MNU. This inhibition may be due to the effects of celecoxib on lipid metabolism as well as COX-2.

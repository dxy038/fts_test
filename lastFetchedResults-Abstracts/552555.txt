Objective: Adenoid is responsible for some upper respiratory tract infections including otitis media and para nasal sinusitis. Adenoid tissue contains a burden of both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms relative to adenoid size. The number of these microorganisms, some of which are pathogenic, increase with enlargement of the adenoids. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of two commonly administered antibiotics (amoxicillin and erythromycin) in control of infections produced by aerobic microorganisms.

Subjects and Methods: In this randomizad clinial trial, 84 patients with recurrent acute otitis media and who were candidates for adenoidectomy and ventilation tube insertions were allocated into three groups: Amoxicillin (group 1), erythromycin (group 2) and no treamtnet (group 3).

Results: adenoid tissue cultures revealed that aerobic bacteria in group with antibiotic treatment was obviously lesser than group 3.

Pathogen bacteria and B-Lactamase producing agents were lesser in group 1 and this antibacterial activity was stronger in amoxycilline .

Conclusion:, both erythromycine and amoxicillin can reduce pathogen bacterial mass and reduction in aerobic and B-Lactamse producing agents in adenoid tissue of patients with recurrent otitis media .

The main objective of this work is to perform a feasibility study on the use of head nodding signal from a single axis ig MEMS accelerometer to detect fatigue on set in individuals. This study involved recording and developing a data acquisition system to acquire signal from the accelerometer. It uses active and sleepy head movements as comparison and head nodding as the sign of fatigue. Statistical method has been used to analyze and identify the fatigue characteristics that are presence in the head-nodding signal acquired from the accelerometer. In addition, fractal analysis has been used to detect the onset of fatigue. The results show that fatigue on set can be detected using the head nodding signals and detection on individual is feasible using a 4% threshold criteria from the computed normalized fractal number.

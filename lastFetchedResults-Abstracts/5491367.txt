A generalized sensitivity algorithm for optimal power flow (OPF) has been developed based on the quadratic form of power systems. The conditions for convergence and optimality are included in the construction of the OPF algorithm. It is also capable of using hierarchical structures to include multiple objective functions and selectable constraints. The method assumes no approximations in the models. The generalized algorithm using sensitivity of objective functions with optimal adjustments in the constraints yields a global optimal solution. The generalized algorithm includes special cases of OPF that reduce the computational burden when the number of constraints is equal to the number of variables and can select the constraint sets that are binding or nonbinding. The optimal power flow package developed can accommodate other OPF methods. The algorithm has been tested using different objective functions on actual power systems, and optimal solutions were reached in relatively few iterations

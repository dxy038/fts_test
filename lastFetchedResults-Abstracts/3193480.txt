Recovery of distribution network is an important part of distribution automation, and it is also the basis of self-healing of the smart grid. The model of recovery of distribution network is constructed based on the principle of the optimization. considering its multi-objective, non-linear characteristics of combinatorial optimization, genetic algorithm is used to solve the issue of recovery. The feasibility and effectiveness of this method is verified by the example of the 13 nodes network.

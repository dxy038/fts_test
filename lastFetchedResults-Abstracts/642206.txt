Objective
We studied alterations of circulating antioxidant nutrients in patients with classic dengue fever in the tropical lowlands of Guatemala.
Methods

In nine patients with dengue fever and 12 healthy Guatemalan control subjects, we assessed plasma concentrations of retinol, α-tocopherol, β-carotene, glutathione, taurine, thiobarbituric acid-reactive species, and total antioxidant status. Control subjects were assessed twice within 48 h to account for day-to-day variations. Febrile patients with dengue fever were examined on the day of admission to the hospital, at discharge after defervescence (approximately 5 d after admission), and 7 d thereafter.
Results

In patients with dengue fever, increases in plasma concentrations of retinol and β-carotene were seen, whereas decreases were observed for glutathione and total antioxidant status. As compared with the reference group, patients with dengue fever had lower retinol concentrations in the acute phase of the disease and lower glutathione concentrations 7 d after discharge. Further, thiobarbituric acid-reactive species levels were higher in the dengue fever patients as analyzed by unpaired t test.
Conclusion

Using dengue fever as a model for the metabolic response to an acute, self-limited tropical viral infection, the present findings suggest slight turbulence of the antioxidant system that may be a response to or a consequence of the viral inflammatory process.

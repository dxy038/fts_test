The objective of this study was to determine the effect of drying and tempering treatments on rice kernel fissuring and head rice yield (HRY). Samples were dried under three different drying air conditions and tempering periods were introduced during or at the end of the drying treatment. Results showed that the percentage of fissured kernels increased as temperature and evaporating capacity of air augmented. Both intermediate and final tempering improved final rice quality, diminishing the number of fissured kernels and increasing HRY.

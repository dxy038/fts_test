Background: Therapeutic and diagnosis properties of radioactive gold nanoparticle
(198-AuNPs) cause them to be suitable for detection and treatment of tumors.
Objective: Electrical and optical properties of PEG-198AuNPs were examined
in this paper. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)-198 AuNPs can be used for treatment and
diagnosis of small intestine tumors.
Methods: Wireless ?uorescence capsule endoscopy will be able to detect emission
lights of triggered Au by external light. First, the output electrical feld was calculated
by DDSCAT software. Secondly, tumor and distribution of PEG-198 gold nanoparticles
were modeled using Monte Carlo simulation and fnally dose delivered throughout a
solid tumor when the PEG-198 gold nanoparticles linked to each cell was calculated.
Results: Polyethylene Glycol functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) possess
optimized sizes (30 nm core diameter and 70 nm hydrodynamic diameters) to target
individual tumor cells. Surface distribution to receive doses of up to 50Gy was simu
lated. Activities and absorbed doses by the tumors with 0.25cm and 0.5cm radius were
187.9mCi and 300mCi and 72 and 118 Gy,respectively.
Conclusion: Therapeutic and diagnosis properties of 198-AuNPs show that it can
be used for treatment and detection of small bowel tumors in early stage of growing.

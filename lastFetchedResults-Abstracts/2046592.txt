
Objective: The present study was carried out to study the relationship between sensation
seeking and social skills in two groups of school age patients; Down-Syndrome (DS) and
Autism Disorder (DS). Method: This is a descriptive-analytic and correlation study in which all participants were
of primary school age (10 to 13 years) with Down-Syndrome and Autism Disorder of autism
spectrum disorder and down-syndrome rehabilitation centers and schools, in Tehran. Two
groups, Down-Syndrome (N=35) and Autism Disorder (N=35), were randomly selected
from a larger community, as sample group for the present study. Marvin Zuckerman (1994),
4-dimensions Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS), and Scott-Bellini Autism Social Skills Profiles
(ASSP) 3 subscales were used as outcome measures. Results: Gathered data were analyzed by using Pearson’s correlation coefficients, multivariable
regression and Z tests. The results showed that there are significant (α=0./05) relationships
between susceptibility to boredom, seeking experience and sum scores of sensation seeking
with social skills in Down-Syndrome group as well as there is significant relationship between
susceptibility to boredom and sum scores of sensation seeking with social skills in Autism
group. Conclusion: Based on the results, it can be concluded that sensation seeking capability
can improve social skills in children who are seriously impaired in social relationship and
communication. In addition, this study suggests sensation seeking training program for
promotions of social skills in children with social problems and who do not show normal social
behavior specially children with autistic spectrum disorders.

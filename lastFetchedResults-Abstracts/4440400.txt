The objective of this study was to identify new ideas and business opportunities for developing new IT-driven service concepts for managing disturbances and to minimize the risks related to disturbance management in supply chains. The data for this study were collected by arranging an electronic expert session from several perspectives, e.g. those of service and technology providers, logistic solution providers and cargo owners. The new ideas for service concepts were also prioritized according to their impact and feasibility for disturbance management. As the results of the study, altogether 94 ideas and business opportunities were identified for IT-driven services and products related to disturbance management, and the priorization of the ideas highlighted the most significant ones for further service concept development. The most significant service concepts were related especially to the electronic monitoring services for supply chains and deviations, training services, tools for reporting and analyzing disturbances, and calculation services of the cost effects of disturbances.

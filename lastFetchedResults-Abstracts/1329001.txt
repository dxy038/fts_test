Background & Objective: There are many common infections and inflammations among people
over the world. This demands an affordable and reliable test with high sensitivity/specificity to
predict or confirm the diagnosis of such cases in routinely clinical practice. In the present study, we
aimed to find any potential correlation between serum levels of GGT and CRP- Q and/or hs- CRP
and WBC count as the well- known markers of inflammation in human body.
Materials and Methods: Through a cross- sectional study, serum levels of CRP-Q, hs- CRP, and GGT,
in addition to WBC count were measured in 1,500 healthy people, referred to Blood Transfusion
Organization from across the country. Data were analyzed after the patients were checked by
physical examination for ruling out the presence of any inflammation or other illness. Serum levels
of GGT, CRP- Q, hs- CRP, and WBC count were analyzed by SPSS for windows version 16.
Results: Analysis showed a positive linear correlation between CRP- Q and hs- CRP with GGT
also confirmed by non- parametric tests.
Conclusion: Serum GGT may be an inflammatory index and a useful marker in approaching to
inflammatory diseases.

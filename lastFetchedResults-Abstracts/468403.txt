Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect that a patientâ€™s age at the time of hysterectomy for endometriosis-associated pain has on long-term improvement in symptoms. Study Design: An investigation of women who underwent hysterectomy for pelvic pain and endometriosis at <30 or >40 years of age was performed by means of medical records review and mailed questionnaires. Participants were asked to complete 2 standardized surveys, the Disruption of Functioning Index and the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: Sixteen women in the study group (<30 years old) and 27 women in the control group returned completed questionnaires. Although similar proportions reported overall alleviation of pain, the study group was significantly more likely to report residual symptoms, such as dyspareunia and dysuria. This younger group also more often reported a sense of loss after hysterectomy and reported more overall disruption in different aspects of life. Conclusion: Women who undergo hysterectomy for pelvic pain and endometriosis at <30 years old are more likely than older women to have residual symptoms, to report a sense of loss, and to report more disruption from pain in different aspects of their lives.

The objective of this paper is to propose a functional specification method that takes into account simultaneously the mechanical and automation aspects. This iterative method takes progressively information from the needs of the client. Its first aim is to obtain a product in accordance with the requirements, and the second goal is to reduce the design time under the concurrent engineering concept. This paper explains the second phase of the procedure (operational functions) and validates it through the study of a automated bottling system

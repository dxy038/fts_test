The objective of this study was to clarify the clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of heat shock proteins (HSP) 27 and 70 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Immunohistochemical staining for HSPs 27 and 70 was performed on surgical specimens obtained from 62 patients with esophageal SCC. The expression of both HSPs 27 and 70 correlated inversely with depth of invasion (P&lt;0.05) and pathologic stage (P&lt;0.05), and correlated positively with lymphocyte infiltration (P&lt;0.05). Reduction of HSP 70 expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis (P&lt;0.05). Patients with HSP 27-negative tumors tended to have a poor prognosis compared with patients with HSP 27-positive tumors. The present findings suggest that HSPs 27 and 70 are significant prognostic factors for esophageal SCC.

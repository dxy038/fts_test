In this paper, the optimization modeling and algorithm of facility location problem in perishable commodities emergency system is studied. First, transportation cost and perishability loss of the distribution network is computed separately. Then, our problem is modeled as a kind of emergency optimization problem under certain time constraints, and the modeling objective is logistics cost minimization. In order to solve it, a re-marking algorithm is proposed.

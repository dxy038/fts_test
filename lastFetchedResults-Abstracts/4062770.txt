This paper presents a comparison of different existing and proposed wave prediction models applicable to control wave energy converters (WECs) in irregular waves. The objective of the control is to increase the energy conversion. The power absorbed by a WEC is depending on the implemented control strategy. Uncertainties in the physical description of the system as well as in the input from irregular waves provide challenges to the control algorithm. We present a hybrid robust fuzzy logic (FL) controller that addresses the uncertainty in the model and the short-term tuning of the converter. The proposed robust controller uses the energy from the power take off as input, while the FL controller portion is used for short-term tuning. The FL controller action is based on a prediction of the incoming wave. Simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid control yields improved energy production, while being robust to modeling errors.

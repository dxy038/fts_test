In this study, three-dimensional models of microchannel heat sinks (MCHSs) with different geometric configurations (such as single-layered- (SL), double-layered- (DL) or tapered-(T)-channels) are constructed by an optimization procedure. This procedure integrates a direct problem solver with a simplified conjugate-gradient method as the optimizer. The overall thermal resistance of an MCHS is the objective function to be minimized with respect to geometric parameters, such as the number of channels, channel width ratio, channel aspect ratio and tapered ratios, as the search variables. The optimal thermal resistance is found to decrease in the following order: the initial guess parallel channel (IGP channel), SL-, DL- and T-channel designs. In addition, the T-channel design has the minimum temperature difference and the most uniform temperature distribution, followed by the DL-, SL- and IGP-channel designs. Moreover, the optimal thermal resistance reduces with the pumping power for the various channel configuration designs, and the lowest thermal resistance corresponds to the T-channel design. The larger the pumping power, the larger the decrement in thermal resistance. Therefore, the optimal T-channel is the best MCHS design when considering thermal resistance and temperature distribution uniformity.

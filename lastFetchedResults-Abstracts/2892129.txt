This paper proposes a general procedure to compute the load profile of a bus rapid transit station where a fleet of full-electric buses is charged. Such procedure is divided in two stages. At first, in order to determine if the flash charging is feasible given a certain travel route, the state of charge of a bus during its operation is modeled, based on GenevaÂ´s all-electric articulated bus and its flash battery charger. Then, assuming that buses are autonomous and can complete their routes without running out of energy, the point of view of a charging station is taken into account. The objective of the model is to compute the load profile for a station, according to its charging policy and demand. The models are tested with the bus rapid transit system implemented in Bogota&#769;, Colombia. Through the implementation of Monte Carlo simulations, different charging scenarios are considered for this study.

This paper presents the results of an analytical study on the seismic response of bridge in YingTan city. The main goal is to determine the capacity for various structural systems in order to evaluate the seismic vulnerability and to develop retrofit strategies. Another important objective is to investigate the effect of those response characteristics on their seismic performance. The study reveals that floating system is a kind of ideal structural system for the little-span cable-stayed bridge.

This paper considers the problem of synthesizing low-order anti-windup controllers for a PID control system in the presence of actuator saturation. In particular, a class of second-order anti-windup compensators is considered. Based on the small gain theorem, the sufficient conditions for achieving anti-windup control with model matching are given in terms of the multi-objective H<sub>&#8734;</sub> specifications. The admissible controller parameters can be determined constructively using linear-programming techniques. A numerical example is given to illustrate the detailed design procedure. The effectiveness of the theoretical developments is verified through simulation studies.

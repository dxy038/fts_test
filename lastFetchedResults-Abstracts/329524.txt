Background and Aims: The objective of the study was to compare data obtained from the Cosmed K4 b2 and the Deltatrac IITM metabolic cart for the purpose of determining the validity of the Cosmed K4 b2 in measuring resting energy expenditure.
Methods: Nine adult subjects (four male, five female) were measured. Resting energy expenditure was measured in consecutive sessions using the Cosmed K4 b2, the Deltatrac IITM metabolic cart separately and the Cosmed K4 b2 and Deltatrac IITM metabolic cart simultaneously, performed in random order. Resting energy expenditure (REE) data from both devices were then compared with values obtained from predictive equations.
Results: Bland and Altman analysis revealed a mean bias for the four variables, REE, respiratory quotient (RQ), V CO2, V O2 between data obtained from Cosmed K4 b2 and Deltatrac IITM metabolic cart of 268±702 kcal/day, −0.0±0.2, 26.4±118.2 and 51.6±126.5 ml/min, respectively. Corresponding limits of agreement for the same four variables were all large. Also, Bland and Altman analysis revealed a larger mean bias between predicted REE and measured REE using Cosmed K4 b2 data (−194±603 kcal/day) than using DeltatracTM metabolic cart data (73±197 kcal/day).
Conclusions: Variability between the two devices was very high and a degree of measurement error was detected. Data from the Cosmed K4 b2 provided variable results on comparison with predicted values, thus, would seem an invalid device for measuring adults.

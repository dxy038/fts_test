At first, what presented in the paper is the theoretical derivation of the multi-solution principle of VSR, as well as the theoretical analysis of the essential relationship between SPWM and SVPWM. Then, the minimized switching loss SPWM and SVPWM modulation algorithms, injecting zero-sequence component into the objective function of rectifier, are presented. The rectifier, with minimized switching loss SPWM and SVPWM modulation algorithms, is simulated by means of MATLAB/SIMULINK. Then the experimental platform of VSR with minimized switching loss PWM modulation algorithm is realized based on DSP F28335, which has verified the above theoretical analysis and simulation results. The results show that the overall efficiency of the rectifier with minimized switching loss PWM modulation algorithm increases about 2&#8764;3% compared to traditional SPWM and SVPWM modulation algorithms.

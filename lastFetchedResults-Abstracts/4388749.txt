This paper proposes the Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO)-based tuning of controllers for a pancake DC torque motor in the framework of a Diesel engine exhaust gas recirculation valve as a representative automotive torque motor actuator. The validation of the position of bacteria only if the control system response is in a valid range is inserted in the BFO algorithm. PID and sliding mode controllers are optimally tuned by the BFO algorithm focused on solving an optimization problem that minimizes an objective function expressed as the weighted sum of overshoot plus the integral of squared error. The parameters of these two controllers belong to the vector variables of the objective function. A case study that deals with the shaft angle control of an automotive torque motor actuator is included to validate our approach by simulation results. The comparison of control system performance is carried out.

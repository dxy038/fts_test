In this paper, the influence of thermal ageing on the breakdown characteristics of transformer oil with the needle-plane configuration under oscillatory impulse voltages (unidirectional, sin/cos-bidirectional) of different frequencies and dampings have been studied. For the purpose of comparison, the results obtained under similar configuration have been obtained under AC, lightning and switching impulse voltages

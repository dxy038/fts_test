In this paper we briefly review some of the Bayesian techniques for sample size determination in different trials. The two main areas are inferential and decision theoretic frameworks. In the inferential approach we are usually concerned with inference about unknown parameters) of interest and sample sizes are determined by taking the parameters of posterior distribution into account. In the decision theoretic approach the problem is treated as a decision problem and using a proper utility function the optimal sample size is determined by optimizing an objective function.

The problem of time to contact or time to collision (TTC) estimation is largely discussed in perspective images. However, a few works have dealt with images of catadioptric sensors despite of their utility in robotics applications. The objective of this paper is to develop a novel model for estimating TTC with catadioptric images relative to a planar surface, and to demonstrate that TTC can be estimated only with derivative brightness and image coordinates. This model, called &#8220;gradient based time to contact&#8221;, does not need high processing such as explicit estimation of optical flow and feature detection and/or tracking. The proposed method allows to estimate TTC and gives additional information about the orientation of planar surface. It was tested on simulated and real datasets.

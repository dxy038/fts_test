Correct placement of the electrode is crucial for cochlear implantation (CI) surgery. It determines the access to the auditory nerve and subsequent hearing performance. Here, we propose an objective measures tool that can partially verify the electrode position. The intracochlear spread of the electrical fields is measured and analyzed by means of multidimensional scaling resulting in an intuitive visual representation. The user can then detect major issues, such as electrode foldover or ossification. Other implantation issues, such as electrode migration into the scala vestibuli, may not significantly alter the electrical conduction pattern and remain undetected. Still, as the measurement is quick and readily available, it may be a valuable intraoperative verification tool.

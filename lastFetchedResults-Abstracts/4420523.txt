Various factor in the communication ecosystem are acting together on the final experience of the users who use the related video services. In this paper, the joint effect in both the technology and the human domain is considered and incorporated to evaluate the users´ quality of experience (QoE) with respect to the IPTV service. Here the parameters of the video quality, the watching duration, the duration of fast forward, and the times of fast forward, etc, are collected and combined to establish the objective model for accurate QoE prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed model can well estimate the quality of users´ experience.

In this paper, we study traveling salesperson (TSP) and bottleneck traveling salesperson (BTSP) problems on special graphs called Halin graphs. Although both problems are NP-Hard on general graphs, they are polynomially solvable on Halin graphs. We address the multiobjective versions of these problems. We show computational complexities of finding a single nondominated point as well as finding all nondominated points for different objective function combinations. We develop algorithms for the polynomially solvable combinations.

<div style="display:none">fiogf49gjkf0d</div>The objective of this study is to analyze the behavior of an energy storage system which is made of a horizontal
channel  crossed  by  a  fluid  and  whose  walls  contain  an  unsaturated  porous  medium.    We  developed  a  three-
dimensional model to study the two processes: thermal energy charging and thermal energy discharging. The coupled
and  highly non  linear  nature  of  the  transport  equations  that  govern  the  heat  and  mass  transfer inside  unsaturated
medium  were  discretized  by control  volume  finite  element  method  (CVFEM).  The  resulted  system  of  algebraic
equations was solved by the Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized iterative solver.  Results concerning the influence of
the initial liquid saturation on the rate of charged and discharged thermal energy are presented and analyzed.

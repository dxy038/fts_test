A cross sectional study was conducted on randomly selected 300 goats in five Sub-districts of Kolla Tembien District from June 2012 to November 2012 to investigate the epidemiology of tuberculosis in goats using single intradermal tuberculin skin test and post-mortem examination. Well structured questionnaire was also administered to animal owners to assess their awareness about the importance of animals for transmission tuberculosis to humans. Chi-square statistic was used to analyse the data and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant (STATA version 11). The overall animal prevalence of TB in goats was 2.33%. From a total of 33 flocks/herds examined, 4(12.12%) contained at least a positive animal. There was significant difference (p < 0.05) in prevalence of caprine tuberculosis among age groups and among Sub-districts. However, the individual animal prevalence was not affected by sex and flock size (p > 0.05). Gross tuberculous lesions were detected in two tuberculin positive (suspected) goats that were slaughtered for confirmation of tuberculosis lesion. Acid-fast bacilli were detected in granuloma. Out of the 33 household heads interviewed, 21 (63.64%) had awareness of TB. However, 12 (36.36%) did not have the awareness of TB. Of the respondents, 29 (87.88%) replied that they consume boiled milk and 4 (12.12%) responded that they consume both raw and boiled milk. In conclusion, this study showed the occurrence of tuberculosis in goats in Kolla Tembien District. Isolation and characterization of the mycobacterial species which infect goats are important. In addition, the zoonotic nature of the disease should be communicated to the public.

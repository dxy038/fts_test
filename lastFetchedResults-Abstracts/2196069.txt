Background and objective: Swimming is a beneficial sport with many recreational and therapeutic aspects. However, it is likely to put oneâ€™s health at jeopardy through many channels. This research aimed to investigate the quality of public swimming pools, whirlpools and cool water basins in Tehran city.
Methods: This descriptive-analytic inquiry was performed in two stages from April 2013 to September 2013 in the municipal districts of 12, 13, 14 and 15 in Tehran. We investigated 27 active indoor swimming pools. 
During the first stage, samples were provided from all the pools. Following that, sampling was repeated after presenting instructions to the managers of the swimming pools which were suspected to be contaminated during the first stage.
All stages including sampling, data transfer to the lab and sample analysis regarding the amount of free residual chlorine, pH and microbial contamination were conducted according to the standard methods of sewer testing.
Results: The results of this inquiry indicate the amount of free residual chlorine to be within the national standard range (minimum 0 and maximum 4) (1-3mg/L) in 48% of the samples. Furthermore, 76.1% of the samples had standard pH (7.2-8) and the Heterotrophic bacteria of all the samples were in normal condition. 
Conclusion: In this research, microbial contamination was mostly observed in whirlpools and cool water basins in which the amount of free residual chlorine had surpassed the standard level.
In the swimming pools where microbial contamination was detected during the first stage, repeated sampling, preparations on behalf of the swimming pool managers and recommendations given by environmental hygiene inspectors of the East Hygiene Center resulted in the reduction of microbial contamination to a great extent.

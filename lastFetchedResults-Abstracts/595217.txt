Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic effect of amitriptyline on a fruit fly D. m el a no gas ley and to make suggestions if any for its use.Material and Methods: The pure strain of Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon K) was used for experiments. The pure culture way maintained under the laboratory condition at a temperature 24Â±2" C. Standard food medium (wheat cream agar medium) wa.v used for maintenance of Drosophila flies in the laboratory. Eggs of the same age collected by procedure of Delcour. LC50 of amitriptyline for the larval feeding method was estimated (0.21%) then, sub lethal concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3% of amitriptyline were selected.Results: Mean viability uv/.v reduced in different concentrations of amitriptyline. There is no significant difference in sex ratio of D. melanogaster treated with amitriptyline. On increase in concentration, not only there was delay in emergence but also reduction in the number of flies emerged. Amitriptyline in all concentrations employed prolong the developmental time even in the lowest concentration testedConclusion: Amitriptyline has effect on viability, eciosion and developmental time but not on sex ratio of Drosophila melanogaster.

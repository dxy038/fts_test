We present a preprocessing algorithm to make certain polynomial algorithms strongly polynomial. The running time of some of the known combinatorial optimization algorithms depends on the size of the objective function w. Our preprocessing algorithm replaces w by an integral valued w whose size is polynomially bounded in the size of the combinatorial structure and which yields the same set of optimal solutions as w. As applications we show how existing polynomial algorithms for finding the maximum weight clique in a perfect graph and for the minimum cost submodular flow problem can be made strongly polynomial. The method relies on Lov&#225;szÂ´s simultaneous approximation algorithm.

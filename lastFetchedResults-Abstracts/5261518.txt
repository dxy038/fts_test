Summary form only given, substantially as follows. There have been significant advances in wireless communications as well as increased utilization of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for commercial navigation systems. A major component in maritime applications of these technologies is a portable shipboard system that provides more that own-ship position. In addition to their own ship, users want to see local electronic charts, real-time situational information on other vessel traffic, transit schedule updates, waterway conditions, etc. With the ability to see around corners, call up information on other vessels, check currents or tidal conditions, and receive other voiceless vessel traffic services information, pilots will have a situational awareness that can directly enhance safety and reduce transit delays. The Center for Navigation at the Volpe Center has developed an advanced electronics navigational aid for use by pilots on the Panama Canal. The primary objective of this project is to provide Panama Canal pilots with a platform for evaluating new features, defining requirements for an operational system, and gaining GPS navigational experience. This paper discusses some of the preliminary results of the design and development stage of a prototype system that has been operating in the Canal for six months, and describes capabilities described as most useful by the pilots

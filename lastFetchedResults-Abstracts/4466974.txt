We present a novel N-state Markov chain model of rain/cloud attenuation as encountered on high frequency satellite/terrestrial links. The objective is to show how to construct such a model. We then go on demonstrating that such an approach allows a comprehensive description of the important statistics of rain attenuation. In particular, the derivation of the N-state transition matrix of rain attenuation from the ITU-R model of rain attenuation is presented. This matrix is then used to compute expected theoretical first and second order characteristics of rain attenuation. A Markov chain Monte Carlo simulator capable of synthesizing typical rain attenuation events is then described.

Finding the global optimal solution for a general nonlinear program is a difficult task except for very small problems. We identify a class of nonlinear programming problems called polynomial programming problems (PP). A polynomial program is an optimization problem with a scalar polynomial objective function and a set of polynomial constraints. By using Groebner Bases, we can determine the global minimum of a polynomial program in a reasonable amount of time and memory

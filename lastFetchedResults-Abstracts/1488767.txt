This study evaluated the effects of the myostatin g + 6723G &gt; A mutation on carcass and meat quality traits of lamb (AA: n = 5; AG: n = 8; GG: n = 9). Dressing percentage was positively affected by the mutation with homozygotes for the mutation having the highest yield. Regarding carcass composition, there was a significant increase in the proportional weights of the loin and hindquarter muscles. Objective meat quality traits of the M. longissimus lumborum (LL) and M. semimembranosus (SM) were not significantly affected. For the SM, toughness (shear force and compression) tended to be lowest for homozygotes for the mutation. The myostatin g + 6723G &gt; A mutation did not affect sensory meat quality traits of grilled steaks for the LL, but resulted in a significant improvement in eating quality for the SM. Given the number of animals in this study, the robustness of the outcome of this study with regard to the effects on meat quality and its causes requires further investigation.

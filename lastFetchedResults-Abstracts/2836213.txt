Power is one of the most important factors in developing the economy and the standard of living of a country. Like the rest of the countries of the world, in Bangladesh the demand for power is increasing day by day. To fulfill our future power demands, Solar Home System (SHS) seems to be the only feasible form of renewable energy despite the cloudy climate in Bangladesh. The objective of the study was to observe the present conditions of the SHS, the degree of satisfaction experienced by the users of SHS, finding the prospects and constraints as well as contributing in the field of solar energy through presenting and highlighting important principles of solar energy. Our study revealed the usersÂ´ satisfaction level to be not that encouraging due to low back-up time, high cost and increased interest rate. If these hindrances are overcome then this would show positive proliferation in the energy sector of Bangladesh.

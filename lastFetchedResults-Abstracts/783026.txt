Objective The aim of this study was to investigate
the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship
between life satisfaction and depressive symptoms
in healthy adults. Method This is a 15-year prospective
cohort study with a nationwide sample of healthy
Finnish adults (N=9679), aged 18–45,who responded to
postal questionnaires in 1975, 1981 and 1990 including a
4-item life satisfaction (LS) scale (range 4–20) and, in
1990, the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results
A strong linear association was found between concurrent
LS and BDI scales (r=0.6).With an LS cut-off
point of 11/12, moderate/severe depression (BDI ≥ 19)
was detected with 87% sensitivity, 88 % specificity and a
94% area under the ROC curve. Longitudinally, a
strongly increased risk of moderate/severe depression
in 1990 was observed among the dissatisfied (LS 12–20)
compared with the satisfied (LS 4–6) in 1975 (OR=6.7;
95%CI 4.2–10.9) and in 1981 (OR=10.4; 6.1–17.6). Conclusion
The 4-item LS scale can identify a group of
healthy people from the general population with a high
risk of having or developing depressive symptoms.Since
low life satisfaction also indicates an elevated risk of
other adverse health outcomes, the assessment of subjective
well-being should be encouraged both in surveys
and in clinical practice.

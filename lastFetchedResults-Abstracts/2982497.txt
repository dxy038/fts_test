Several computer simulation and information systems for machinery industries have been studied. The objective is to construct a virtual manufacturing environment for concurrent engineering. For the environment, three types of models, which are geometry model for a product, mathematical model for physical phenomena and activity model for human operations, should be considered. In this study, computer simulation systems for casting and heat treatment processes as tools of a virtual manufacturing environment have been developed considering the interface of geometry model from a three-dimensional CAD system. These computer simulations can predict the quality and productivity quantitatively. As well, an information management system for pre-production material processes based on activity models has been developed. Background data for decision-making is stored and related to foreground information such as multimedia data. A summary of the system is shown and several examples are presented

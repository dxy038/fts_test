Similarly to business intelligence tools, performance analysis and tuning tools often run one or more iterative processes to identify optimization opportunities and implement an effective tuning strategy. However, the majority of them do not automate these very common tasks and require manual application of the tools multiple times to get a profile of the runtime behavior of application. This paper introduces a new framework called PAThWay. Its objective is to support the users in structuring and executing the overall performance tuning process and tracking the typical evolution of the source code that is part of it. It adopts established standards and research ideas from the field of business intelligence and adapts them to the scientific domain of performance analysis and tuning of High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications.

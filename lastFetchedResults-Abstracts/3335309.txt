Since the emergence of smartphones, there is a noticeable shift in our daily lives from desktop use to mobile use while maintaining interactivity, improving the use of these devices. Mobile gaming is an area that can provide a very personalized way to enjoy life for smartphone users. Today, while smart devices have the ability to recognize facial expressions, robust recognition of facial expressions in real time remains a challenge due to difficulties in accurately extracting the most pertinent emotional characteristics. A valuable objective is to define a computerized system facilitating the design and implementation of behavior detection on mobile devices for various applications. Our work aims to detect emotions through the face recognition of a smartphone user in order to synthesize his behavior while playing.

An analysis is conducted of the complexity of placing recovery points where the computation is modeled as a reverse binary tree task model. The objective is to minimize the expected computation time of a program in the presence of faults. The method can be extended to an arbitrary reverse tree model. For uniprocessor systems, an optimal placement algorithm is proposed. For multiprocessor systems, a procedure for computing their performance is described. Since no closed form solution is available, an alternative measurement is proposed that has a closed form formula. On the basis of this formula, algorithms are devised for solving the recovery point placement problem. The estimated formula can be extended to include communication delays where the algorithm devised still applies

In this paper, a dry-or-buy cost model for a dry kiln scheduling problem in the furniture manufacturing industry is considered. Factory-specified due-dates for jobs, kiln availability, kiln capacity, and drying and buying costs are incorporated into an IntegerProgramming (IP) model. As it may be difficult (i.e., because of due-dates, kiln availability, processing times, etc.) to meet all the due-dates, certain jobs may have to be out-sourced. The objective of the model is to minimize the total drying and buying costs while satisfying all due-dates. Because of the computational complexity of the problem, a heuristic approach is developed. Computational experience indicates that the heuristic gives high quality solutions with significant savings in time over standard IP algorithms.

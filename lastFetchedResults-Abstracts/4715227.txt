To deal with the problem of obtaining the status of temperature and humidity in industrial environment, this paper proposes a fuzzy set-based approach for multi-sensors data of temperature and humidity fusion. Firstly, the hardware architecture of temperature and humidity monitor system is presented. Then, based on fuzzy set theory, the paper describes the fuzzy synthetic evaluation model and proposes a novel algorithm for choosing the weight assignment proposals. A multi-sensors data of temperature and humidity fusion approach, which is based on fuzzy synthetic evaluation, is finally presented. An example is also showed for demonstrating the approach presented in this paper. The experiment results identify that the approach can eliminate the impact of incorrect data on evaluating the temperature and humidity status, and thus make sure the data fusion result is objective and correct.

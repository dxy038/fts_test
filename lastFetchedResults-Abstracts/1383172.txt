The purpose of this study was to assess quantitative electroencephalography (q-EEG) in 10 healthy beagle dogs under propofol anaesthesia in order to determine objective guidelines for diagnostic electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and interpretation. The basic pattern after preliminary visual examination of EEG recordings was characterized by spindles, k-complexes, vertex sharp transients, and positive occipital transients that were superimposed on the slow background activity. The results of the q-EEG were characterized by the prevalence of slow rhythms δ and θ, both in absolute and relative power spectrum analysis, while fast rhythms (α and β) were poorly represented. The distribution of single frequency bands was widespread for δ, focal for frontal and central for θ, as well as for most α and β patterns. The present study has shown that the use of quantitative EEG gives information on the frequency content of the bio-electrical activity and defines the distribution of the single frequency bands under a standardized anaesthetic protocol.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine from what time onward fetal fibronectin is consistently detectable in the cervicovaginal secretions before delivery and to what extent the actual time of delivery can be better determined by this procedure than by the sole use of the Bishop score.
STUDY DESIGN: A fast-reacting fetal fibronectin test was performed on 206 women on their expected date of confinement. In addition, the cervical status was evaluated with use of a modified Bishop score. Follow-up evaluations were subsequently carried out in the course of the routine examinations.
RESULTS: Women with a positive fetal fibronectin test result and a high Bishop score were delivered after a median of 1.7 days. Conversely, women with a negative fetal fibronectin test result and a low Bishop score were delivered after a median of 7.1 days.
CONCLUSION: Determination of fetal fibronectin in combination with the Bishop score makes it possible to predict the actual time of delivery with a greater degree of accuracy.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:1478-82.)

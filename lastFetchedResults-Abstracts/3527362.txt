It is shown how the adjoint-network approach to automated design due to Director and Rohrer can be implemented in gradient calculations for least pth and minimax response objective functions. Their formulas, for example, for frequency-domain design of networks consisting of lumped, linear and time invariant elements may be used without change, provided that the adjoint network is appropriately excited.

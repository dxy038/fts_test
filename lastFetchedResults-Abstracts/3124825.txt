Axiomatic Design is applied to the modular special robot configuration system. For a specific design mission, we refine the design objective and the design restraints, and then complete decomposing of FRs and DPs between the functional and physical domains through zigzagging. By adjusting design matrix, configuration design order can be overall planned. By using the design parameters, the corresponding module can be found from the module set easily, and the candidates can be defined for modular configuration design activity.

Learning helps human to meet his needs and promote his knowledge and ultimately reach his goals. To achieve a behavior change in individuals, there is a constant need to motivation; thus to achieve the ultimate objective of universities, students need to be motivated enough. In this study the causes of academic failure of students have been analyzed. In total, two inner and outer motivational factors are effective on educational performance. So different causes of reduced incentives for academic study decline have been mentioned that are: individual and personal problems, social, cultural, and training insufficiencies. To resolve this problem in academic communities the proposed solutions are: paying attention to physical and psychological problems of students, strengthening family relationships, providing a ground for the incidence and learned application and removal of unemployment, introducing disciplines, strengthening the right relationship of students and mentors, and revising the topics. Identifying the  current and after graduation needs of the students and appropriate training courses and value harmony with science and research rather than creating job security by government planners seem essential.

Boneless pork loins (N=95) divided into three groupings based on National Pork Producers Council color standards were utilized to characterize changes in color and pH throughout the loin. CIE L∗, CIE a∗, CIE b∗, saturation, and hue angle differed (P&lt;0.05) for color category and chop position. A color category by position interaction (P&lt;0.05) existed only for pH values. These differences in color and pH measures throughout the loin indicate that one measurement may not characterize the entire boneless loin. For all color and pH measures significant orthogonal and polynomial contrasts existed, therefore, separate regression equations were developed for each color category to predict position response. Multiple regression equations were significant for most objective measures of color and pH, but the low R2 values indicate that these models provide little information as to changes in color and pH throughout the boneless pork loin.

Objective: To find out the frequency of vaginal discharge in women attending antenatal clinic and to find out correlation between vaginal discharge and various sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).Material and Methods: This prospective study was conducted at the antenatal clinic, Govt. Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar on 400 pregnant women attending antenatal clinic. Patients were randomly selected by recruiting every 5,h antenatal attendee and after informed consent; all women were interviewed and examined for general physical and gynecological examination. Specimens for laboratory examination including endo-cervical swabs, high vaginal swabs and blood samples were collected and after allotting a special code, samples were sent to pathology department for microbiological tests. Results were analyzed by SPSS.Results: Out of 400 women, vaginal discharge was present in 226 cases (56.5%), which was moderate in 91 cases (40.2%) and copious in 9 cases (4%). Out of 400 cases, 93 cases (23.25%) had STDs; Chlamydia Trachomatis in 49 cases (12.25%), Candida Albicans in 31 cases (7.8%), Gardnerella Vaginalis in 10 cases (2.5%) and syphilis in 3 cases (0.75%). No case of HIV, Gonorrhea, Trichomonas Vaginalis and H. Ducreyi was detected. Out of 226 cases of vaginal discharge, 179 cases (79.2%) had no STD and 47 cases (20.8%) had at least one STD. Out of 93 cases with STDs, 47 cases (50.5%) had vaginal discharge and 46 cases (49.5%) had no vaginal discharge. Out of various STDs, 53.06% (n=26) of Chlamydia Tranchomatis, 61.2% (n=19) of Candida Albicans and 20% (n=2) of G. Vaginalis were associated with vaginal discharge.Conclusion: Vagina) Discharge is not necessarily due to STDs. STDs can occur in asymptomatic women. Strategy of treating STDs on syndromic approach needs to be modified.

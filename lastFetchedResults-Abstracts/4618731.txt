The main objective of this paper is the description of the properties of the nonlinear standing waves generated by a vibrating boundary in the acoustical resonator. The nonlinear oscillations of gas in the hard-walled air-filled resonator having one closed end and the other periodically oscillating are analyzed in this work.

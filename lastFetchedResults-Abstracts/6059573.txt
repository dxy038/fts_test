In this paper, actuators reliability analysis is considered in the design of active fault tolerant control system. The main objective consists on the synthesis of a fault tolerant controller gain which guarantees a highest overall system reliability. Benefit of incorporating reliability indicators on the controller gain design is to manage effectively the control inputs in order to increase the remaining life time of a system in the presence of faults. A reliability analysis of system modeled by a state space representation is proposed. A controller gain design is reformulated as an Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem and synthesized through an effective admissible model matching approach.

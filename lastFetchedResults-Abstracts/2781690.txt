This letter introduces the ecohydrological wireless sensor network (EHWSN), which we have installed in the middle reach of the Heihe River Basin. The EHWSN has two primary objectives: the first objective is to capture the multiscale spatial variations and temporal dynamics of soil moisture, soil temperature, and land surface temperature in the heterogeneous farmland; and the second objective is to provide a remote-sensing ground-truth estimate with an approximate kilometer pixel scale using spatial upscaling. This ground truth can be used for validation and evaluation of remote-sensing products. The EHWSN integrates distributed observation nodes to achieve an automated, intelligent, and remote-controllable network that provides superior integrated, standardized, and automated observation capabilities for hydrological and ecological processes research at the basin scale.

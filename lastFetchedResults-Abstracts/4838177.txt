Dynamic classifier ensemble selection is focused on selecting the most confident classifier ensemble to predict the class of a particular test pattern. The overproduce-and-choose strategy is a dynamic classifier ensemble selection method which is divided into optimization and dynamic selection phases. The first phase involves the test of different candidate ensembles in order to produce a population composed of the highest performing candidate ensembles. Then, the second phase calculates the domain of expertise of each candidate ensemble to pick up the solution with highest degree of certainty of its decision to classify the unknown test samples. It has been shown that the optimization phase decreases oracle, the upper bound of dynamic selection processes. In this paper we propose a hybrid algorithm to perform the optimization phase of overproduce and-choose strategy. The proposed algorithm combines stochastic initialization of candidate ensembles of different sizes, with the traditional forward search greedy method. The objective is to apply oracle as search criterion during the optimization phase. We show experimentally that choosing the population of classifier ensembles taking into account the population oracle leads to increase the upper bound of the dynamic selection phase. Moreover, experimental results conducted to compare the proposed method to a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), demonstrate that our method outperforms MOGA on generating population of candidate ensembles with higher oracle rates.

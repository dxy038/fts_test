Background and aims: Several studies indicated that auditory efferent system is effective on selective attention. Therefore, examining this system in children with autism would be very valuable. This study was aimed to investigate auditory efferent system in autistic children compared to children with normal development.
Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, 34 children with 5 to 11-year-old assigned into two normal and autism groups were enrolled , both consisting of 17 children. All children had normal pure-tone audiometry; speech audiometery, tympanometry, and transient otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) test results. Auditory efferent function was evaluated through TEOAE measurement, with and without contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS). To analyze the results, independent t-test, paired t-test, and SPSS software was used.
Results: The study revealed a significant difference in mean of suppression amplitudes between the two groups (P=0.001). Without CAS condition, amplitude mean of TEOAE was 17.63±4.09 dB in normal group and 17.40 ± 3.78 dB in autism group, in having no statistically significant difference (P=0.83).
Conclusion: The obtained findings showed a diminished auditory efferent activity in children with autism compared to children with normally development. Regarding that the test used in this study was TEOAE suppression, it could be concluded that TEOAE suppression is a sensitive, non-invasive, objective, and appropriate clinical tool for the study of the efferent system function in children with autism.

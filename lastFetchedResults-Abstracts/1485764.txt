The objective of this study was to investigate the association of DNA markers in candidate genes for glycolytic potential on meat quality parameters (pH1, pHu, glycogen and lactate content and glycolytic potential of semimembranosus muscle) and estimated breeding values (EBVs) for average daily gain, lean cuts, back fat thickness, ham weight, and feed:gain ratio in 272 Italian Large White pigs. Three mutations in the PRKAG3 gene (T30N, G52S and I199V) were investigated as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms in two other skeletal muscle genes (PGAM2 and PKM2) involved in the glycolytic pathway. Association analysis with the PRKAG3 markers showed significant results (P &lt; 0.05) only for pH1 (I199V, with significant additive effect) and lactate content (T30N), confirming, at least in part, the effects of this gene on meat quality traits. Significant association (P &lt; 0.05) was also observed for PGAM2 and ham weight EBV with significant additive and dominance effects. PKM2 was associated with average daily gain, lean cuts (P &lt; 0.001), back fat thickness and feed:gain ratio (P &lt; 0.05), with significant additive and/or dominance effects on these traits. PKM2 encodes for a key enzyme of the muscle glycolytic pathway and maps on porcine chromosome 7 where other studies have reported important QTL for the same traits. These data might suggest an important function of this gene in the mechanisms that produce the observed effects. The results will be important to evaluate the inclusion of some of these DNA polymorphisms in marker assisted selection programs.

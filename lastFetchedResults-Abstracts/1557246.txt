Nonlinear image deblurring procedures based on probabilistic considerations have been widely investigated in the literature. This approach leads to model the deblurring problem as a large scale optimization problem, with a nonlinear, convex objective function and non-negativity constraints on the sign of the variables. The interior point methods have shown in the last years to be very reliable in nonlinear programs. In this paper we propose an inexact Newton interior point (IP) algorithm designed for the solution of the deblurring problem. The numerical experience compares the IP method with another state-of-the-art method, the Lucy Richardson algorithm, and shows a significant improvement of the processing time.

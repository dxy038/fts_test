The problem of grasping with multifingered robot hands is discussed. Relationships between grasp configurations and task objectives are discussed. A number of grasp quality measures are explored to gain insight into the relationships between grasp posture, relative hand-object contact, and task requirements. The method in which these measures are calculated is analyzed. A procedure based on this analysis for planning an optimum grasp configuration for a specified type of contact and a desired task objective is proposed

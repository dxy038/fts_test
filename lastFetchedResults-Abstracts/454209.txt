The alteration of the oxidant/antioxidant balance may affect the susceptibility of low density lipoproteins (LDL) to oxidation in haemolytic disorders such as thalassemia. Thirty patients affected by β-thalassemia intermedia were examined, and compared with age-matched healthy controls. The mean amount of vitamin E in the thalassemic LDL was lower than control (p<0.0001), either when it was calculated on the base of LDL protein (61% decrease) or cholesterol (25% decrease). The LDL resistance to Cu2+-induced oxidation, evaluated as the length of the lag phase before the onset of conjugated diene (CD) lipid hydroperoxide production, was 20% lower than control. Other parameters of LDL susceptibility to oxidation, such as the rate of lipid peroxidation, Rp, and the total amount of conjugated dienes produced, CDmax, were only slightly lower than control, which can be explained by a lower content of peroxidable lipids in the thalassemic LDL. Total LDL cholesterol was 1.08×103 and 2.07×103 mol/mol LDL in thalassemic and in control LDL, respectively. The length of the lag phase in thalassemic LDL shows a strongly positive correlation with its vitamin E content (r=0.732; p<0.0001). The r2-value of 0.53 provides evidence that more than 50% of the lag phase is determined by vitamin E. Oxidizability of LDL lipids may explain 22-24% of the lag phase, as calculated by the inverse correlation between the length of the lag phase and CDmax (r=−0.474; p=0.008; r2=0.22) and Rp (r=−0.499; p=0.005; r2=0.24). In multiple regression analysis, the lag phase was predictable to 66% by vitamin E plus CDmax, and to 60% by vitamin E plus Rp. Plasma vitamin E was 53% lower in thalassemia patients compared to control and positively correlated with vitamin E in the LDL (r=0.677; p<0.0001). None of the correlations above were observed in control subjects. In conclusion, β-thalassemia is associated with very low levels of vitamin E in plasma and in LDL, a condition that renders these particles more susceptible to in vitro oxidative modification and may account for atherogenesis-related vascular diseases described in thalassemia. The present data on a statistically significant correlation between abnormally low vitamin E and oxidizability of LDL contribute substantially to the hypothesis that vitamin E is a pathophysiologically important determinant of antioxidative protection of LDL.

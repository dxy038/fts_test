In this paper, we tackle the problem of model selection when misclassification costs are unknown and/or may evolve. Unlike traditional approaches based on a scalar optimization, we propose a generic multi-model selection framework based on a multi-objective approach. The idea is to automatically train a pool of classifiers instead of one single classifier, each classifier in the pool optimizing a particular trade-off between the objectives. Within the context of two-class classification problems, we introduce the “ROC front concept” as an alternative to the ROC curve representation. This strategy is applied to the multi-model selection of SVM classifiers using an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. The comparison with a traditional scalar optimization technique based on an AUC criterion shows promising results on UCI datasets as well as on a real-world classification problem.

Objective: The study was performed to examine the satisfaction of a specific population of oncology patients with their physicians and to quantify its association with characteristics of their disease. Study Design: A descriptive design was used in which patients attending a weekend cancer support retreat completed the Princess Margaret Hospital Satisfaction with Doctor Questionnaire (PMH-PSQ-MD). Demographic information was requested separately. Results: Of 48 patients, 96% completed the PMH-PSQ-MD, and 67% mailed in the additional demographics. Average overall score was 3.08 (SD = 0.56, 4 being most satisfied). Patients reported a desire for more time with physicians and that their pain be better understood. Patients were most satisfied with the physician's honesty, thoroughness, and communication. Satisfaction scores did not correlate with intensity of treatment or time since diagnosis. Scores declined as financial burden of therapy increased, but the trend was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Patients attending this retreat were generally satisfied with their physicians, regardless of treatment intensity. Increasing financial burden may be associated with physician dissatisfaction. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1177-9.)

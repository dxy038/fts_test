During a hyperthermia treatment, a tumour is locally heated for a defined period of time by focussing the energy of electromagnetic waves into it. Hyperthermia treatment planning (HTP) consists of finding optimal amplitudes and phases for the antenna array of the applicator to realize this objective. Current optimization methods for HTP are time-consuming and not very flexible. In this paper we present an automated refined eigenvalue-based approach for optimizing antenna parameters for hyperthermia treatments, that allows for fast and efficient calculation and near-realtime adjustments. The approach is demonstrated on a two-dimensional clinical case, yielding good results.

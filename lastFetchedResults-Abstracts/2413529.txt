Objective: critical thinking in education and research centers, including libraries, provides a better ground for the growth of science and theorizing. It is therefore essential that these centers besides the content and processes, act on critical thinking skills. But checking the status of educational institutions and inhibitors indicated that there are considerable difficulties in the way of critical thinking. Hence, this study explores the barriers to the development of critical thinking in libraries.
Methods: We reviewed the literature by searching the extensive books and databases, including IranDoc, Scientific Information Database(SID), , Ovid, Emerald, PubMed, ScienceDirect, using the words such as critical thinking in libraries, critical thinking barriers and critical thinking components.
 Findings: This review leads to drawing a chart of critical thinking barriers in libraries. These barriers can be classified in four areas of users, librarians, libraries, resources and organization.
Conclusion: with regarding the barriers introduced in this study, libraries and librarians should weaken them by holding educational workshops to optimize information seeking skills, search strategies and evaluation of information content. In addition, library instruction tours can help users to enhance their self esteem.

The design of various multistage RO systems under different feed concentration and product specification is presented in this work. An optimization method using the process synthesis approach to design an RO system has been developed. First, a simplified superstructure that contains all the feasible design in present desalination process has been presented. It offers extensive flexibility towards optimizing various types of RO system and thus may be used for the selection of the optimal structural and operating schemes. A pressure vessel model that takes into account the pressure drop and concentration changes in the membrane channel has also been given to simulate multi-element performance in the pressure vessel. Then the cost equation relating the capital and operating cost to the design variables, as well as the structural variables of the designed system have been introduced in the objective function. Finally the optimum design problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which minimizes the total annualized cost. The solution to the problem includes optimal arrangement of the RO modules, pumps, energy recovery devices, the optimal operating conditions, and the optimal selection of types and number of membrane elements. The effectiveness of this design methodology has been demonstrated by solving several seawater desalination cases. Some of the trends of the optimum RO system design have been presented.

Complex system is a very common objective reality, the study about complex problem is the frontiers and focuses of science. Complex system which always is hierarchical and has multi-layers, it certainly contains qualitative and quantitative information, and the data of it always are multi-dimensional. This paper proposed that in a complex hierarchical system background, through the method of expressing the multi-dimensional qualitative and quantitative data as multi-dimensional statistical chart, we constructs hierarchical, multi-layers, and has coupled parameters information fusion model. And we use this system for analyzing the authoritative database data to demonstrate the method can be applied in information fusion research.

The main objective of this work was to examine the effects of using five types of commercial starter cultures in fermented sausages. During the fermentation stage, changes in proteolytic characteristics were observed in fermented sausages. Proteolytic activity was high in Lsb + Sc:(Lactobacillus sakei + Staphylococcus carnosus) and Pp + Sx:(Pediococcus pentosaceus + Staphylococcus xylosus) starter-inoculated sausages during processing. Moreover, a slight increase in proteolytic activity was detected during storage in both these sausages. Sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins were also affected by this starter culture addition, during the fermentation, ripening and intense proteolysis were observed in both the fermented sausages. The content of free amino acids was similar at the beginning of the fermentation stage for all the studied batches. However, the high differences in the content of free amino acids at the end of the process could be attributed to the starter culture activity.

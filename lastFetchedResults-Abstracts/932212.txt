Biogenic amines are organic nitrogenous compounds produced in wines mainly during malolactic fermentation. Its presence is a health risk for sensitive individuals and it could negatively affect the wine quality. The objective of this work was to determine the biogenic amines content in Chilean young varietal wines. For that, a liquid chromatographic method with pre-column derivatization was optimized and validated to achieve a reliable quantification of the most important biogenic amines in wines, i.e. histamine, tyramine, spermine, spermidine, putrescine, cadaverine and phenylethylamine. Using a face-centered central composite design derivatization and chromatographic conditions were optimized. Derivatization with dansyl chloride showed an optimum yield for all biogenic amines at 60 °C during 60 min. These derivatives were optimally separated with a C18 YMC-Pack ODS-A column set a 40 °C using a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water under gradient conditions. An effective separation and quantification of the biogenic amines was achieved in 40 min using ultraviolet detection at 254 nm. Validation was established according to ICH guidelines, calibrations in matrix fitted a linear regression model with R2 > 0.997. Repeatability (n = 6) and intermediate precision (n = 3) in matrix showed RSD values <2.34% and <3.16%, respectively. This method was applied to determine for the first time the biogenic amines content in Chilean wines. Twenty-seven samples of young varietal wines, i.e. Cabernet Sauvignon (n = 9), Merlot (n = 8) and Carménère (n = 10) were analyzed finding a biogenic amines content from 18.12 to 39.84 mg L-1, where putrescine showed the highest concentration in all grape varieties. No significant difference was found between grapes varieties regarding total biogenic amines content (P = 0.7842, df = 26). Along with putrescine, histamine and tyramine were the most abundant biogenic amines but similar levels were also observed with spermidine.

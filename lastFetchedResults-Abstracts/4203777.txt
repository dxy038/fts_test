The recent developments in electric vehicles philosophy and technology requires that they be able of charging anywhere, but also be capable of delivering their storage energy back to the grid. Therefore, autonomous energy management decision support technologies such as Energy Box, have earned prominence along with the latest electric vehicles chargers developments. These technologies increase the end users and utilities benefits given the occurred energetic exchanges. Thus, in this paper a bidirectional and power adjustable charger topology is presented as well as the respective applied controllers, in order to be further governed by the Energy Box. Moreover, in order to verify the proper operation of the proposed charger and the further interaction with Energy Box, this paper presents the obtained simulation and reduced scale experimented results. These were obtained respectively trough Matlab/Simulink<sup>&#174;</sup> and National Instruments<sup>&#8482;</sup> environment. Projections about the monetary benefits achieved in end user perspective are also presented, being the global attained results quite promising, foreseeing a meritorious interaction between the proposed charger and any compatible autonomous decision support system for the domestic energy management.

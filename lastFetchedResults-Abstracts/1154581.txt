Since 1980s the problem of manufacturing defect-free parts has been tackled with simulation tools. In this paper, a numerical method for shape optimisation of pre-form dies in a two-stage hot forging is presented. The object of optimisation is to eliminate work-piece defects that may arise during the forging process. A two dimensional finite element code has been developed for the simulation of the mechanical process and prediction of the defects. The material is incompressible and it follows the Nortonâ€“Hoff law. To deal with contact constraint, the velocity-projection algorithm is used. The optimisation method is based on a genetic algorithm supported by an elitist strategy. The developed scheme is used to design optimal pre-form dies for two axi-symmetric examples. The objective function is associated with the quality of the final product. Comparing the obtained optimal results with other articles justifies the proposed optimisation method.

Part I of this paper has proposed a duty-cycle-space-vector (DCSV)-based modulation strategy for three- and four-leg matrix converters (MCs). This paper develops a digital DCSV-based modulation strategy for the three- and four-leg MCs based on the results of Part I of this paper. The digital DCSV-based modulation strategy is implemented in a DSP-field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. The objective is to reduce the calculation time of the modulation algorithm by performing the following: 1) reducing the total number of instructions needed to implement the modulation algorithm in the DSP and 2) implementing parts of the modulation algorithm in an FPGA to generate the switching pattern. Therefore, the calculation process of the modulation algorithm is split between the DSP and the FPGA.

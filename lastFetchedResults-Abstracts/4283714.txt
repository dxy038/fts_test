This paper illustrates the importance of control on energy saving opportunity in electrical drives systems. The paperÂ´s objective is to develop an optimal control law for an electrical position drive systems with induction machine (IM) using a voltage source inverter. The optimal control provides dynamic regimes with minimum input energy and performs the minimization of the copper losses from IM. The solution of the problem uses optimal control theory and the numerical integration of the matrix Riccati differential equation (RMDE). The synthesis of the optimal energetic control law is accomplished by comparing, via simulation, the two control methods: conventional and optimal.

Inter-sequence error concealment defines a novel class of concealment techniques which utilize two or more representations of a particular video sequence for image reconstruction. An image-based approach introduced recently provides superior reconstruction quality of concealed image parts and outperforms well-known intra methods by up to 15 dB PSNR<sub>Y</sub>. However, computational complexity is high due to a numerical solution of the image registration problem. In this paper, we propose a feature-based technique for image registration which is included in the concept of inter-sequence error concealment. Based on the determination of scale-invariant features, the processing time is reduced on average by a factor of up to 28. At the same time, the loss in terms of objective image quality compared to the image-based approach is less than 1 dB PSNR<sub>Y</sub>.

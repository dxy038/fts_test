Introduction & Objective: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and other endocrine disorders are frequent in thalassemic patients that need regular transfusion due to iron overload. This study aimed at determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in thalassemic patients that referred to cooly's centers of Kohkiloyeh and Boyrahmad for blood transfusion.
Materials & Methods: in this cross- sectional descriptive study fasting blood suger (FBS) of 223 patients was checked for two times (103 patients from Yasuj , 64 patients from Gachsaran-56 patients from Dehdast).
Results: Prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 3.1% (7 patients) and prevalence of impaired FBS was 4% (9 patients). These two conditions were more in patients from Dehdast than those from Yasuj and Gachsaran. No significant correlation was found between the prevalence of DM and impaired FBS and the age of blood transfusion and disferral taking. Prevalence of impaired FBS and diabetes mellitus in female patients was significantly higher than that in male patients.
Conclusion: It seems that a survey of endocrine glands and an evaluation of diabetes mellitus must be done regularly in cooly's centers especially for patients older than 10 years old.

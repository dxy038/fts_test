Discusses factors which could have a significance influence on how analogue and digital filters are perceived in the future. The main conclusions are that there will be increased emphasis on analogue-digital codesign, in which the special separate advantages of analogue and digital signal processing are combined in a unique way to provide optimum solutions. This is combined with a tendency to take a systems view in which communication system variables enter the optimisation objective function. A key trend is that towards the integration of high frequency IF and RF circuits, requiring an awareness of system architectures, evolving technologies and advanced devices. Finally, we have explored some of the implications on further education which are emerging as necessary for full development of microsystems.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

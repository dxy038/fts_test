We propose a full-duplex MIMO wireless communication system where simultaneous bidirectional communication in the same band is obtained via cancellation of the self-interfering signal. In this paper, first of all, we review the three mechanisms for self-interference cancellation in the full-duplex system, i.e., Antenna cancellation, analog domain cancellation and digital domain cancellation. Then, we introduce the MIMO system on the basis of proposed full-duplex system and build a simulation model for the 2&amp;times;2 full-duplex MIMO system. Finally, we study the system performance under different node distance, fading channel models, channel estimation error and residual interference. Simulation studies have an advantage of being able to show one of the entangled factors effects on the system performance.

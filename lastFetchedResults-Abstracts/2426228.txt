In this paper, finite element simulations of spherical indentation of a thin hard film deposited on a soft substrate are carried out. The primary objective of this work is to understand the mechanics of fracture of the film due to formation of cylindrical or circumferential cracks extending inwards from the film surface. Also, the role of plastic yielding in the substrate on the above mechanics is studied. To this end, the plastic zone development in the substrate and its influence on the load versus indentation depth characteristics and the stress distribution in the film are first examined. Next, the energy release rate J associated with cylindrical cracks is computed. The variation of J with indentation depth and crack length is investigated. The results show that for cracks located near the indenter axis and at small indentation depth, J decreases over a range of crack lengths, which implies stability of crack growth. This regime vanishes as the location of the crack from the axis increases, particularly for a substrate with low yield strength. Finally, a method for combining experimental load versus indentation depth data with simulation results in order to obtain the fracture energy of the film is proposed.

However, the present updating methods based on multi-objective optimization technique is difficult to be applied to update the finite element model of civil structures by reason of low efficiency. To develop an efficient multi-objective updating method, an efficient multi-objective optimization technique for model updating is proposed based on Taguchi method, which has the ability to solve the multi-objective optimization problem by introducing the classification of searching population and the new objective function. And then a parameterizing scheme for structural boundary condition is proposed, and the proposed updating method is employed to update the boundary conditions of a truss bridge structure.

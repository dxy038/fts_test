We introduce a spatial and temporal target detection method using spatial bilateral filter (BF) and temporal cross product (TCP) of temporal pixels in infrared (IR) image sequences. At first, the TCP is presented to extract the characteristics of temporal pixels by using temporal profile in respective spatial coordinates of pixels. The TCP represents the cross product values by the gray level distance vector of a current temporal pixel and the adjacent temporal pixel, as well as the horizontal distance vector of the current temporal pixel and a temporal pixel corresponding to potential target center. The summation of TCP values of temporal pixels in spatial coordinates makes the temporal target image (TTI), which represents the temporal target information of temporal pixels in spatial coordinates. And then the proposed BF filter is used to extract the spatial target information. In order to predict background without targets, the proposed BF filter uses standard deviations obtained by an exponential mapping of the TCP value corresponding to the coordinate of a pixel processed spatially. The spatial target image (STI) is made by subtracting the predicted image from the original image. Thus, the spatial and temporal target image (STTI) is achieved by multiplying the STI and the TTI, and then targets finally are detected in STTI. In experimental result, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were computed experimentally to compare the objective performance. From the results, the proposed algorithm shows better discrimination of target and clutters and lower false alarm rates than the existing target detection methods.

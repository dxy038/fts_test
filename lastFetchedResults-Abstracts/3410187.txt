A modulated lapped transform with extended overlap (ELT) is investigated in image coding with the objective of verifying its potential to replace the discrete cosine transform (DCT) in specific applications. Some of the criteria utilized for the performance comparison are reconstructed image quality (both objective and subjective), reduction of blocking artifacts, robustness against transmission errors, and filtering (for scalability). Also, a fast implementation algorithm for finite-length-signals using symmetric extensions is developed specially for the ELT with overlap factor 2 (ELT-2). This comparison shows that ELT-2 is superior to both DCT and the lapped orthogonal transform (LOT)

Objective: GBV-C is a virus transmissible via blood transfusion and sexual routes. Because of the shared transmission routes in GBV-C and hepatitis B virus (HBV) we have attempted to detect GBV-C in HBsAg-positive patients using the more sensitive semi-nested PCR. We used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to determine genotype.
Methods: A total of 100 serum samples were collected from HBsAg-positive patients from 1389-1390. After designing specific primers and optimizing the semi-nested PCR, sequences of PCR products were analyzed by Neb Cutter software. Restriction enzyme sites were determined and suitable enzymes selected for RFLP.
Results: Semi-nested PCR shows acceptable sensitivity for the detection of GBV-C and its genotype determination. This technique is more affordable than other techniques.
Conclusion: There appears to be a high rate of GBV-C infection among Iranian HBV patients. In this study, the majority of patients co-infected with GBV-C were of HBV genotype 2, which is similar to the pattern seen in the US and Europe.

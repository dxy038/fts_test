Research on P2P based on Video on Demand (VoD) recently has been expanding, with the main objective is to gain effectiveness in distribution of VoD content in network. Probabilistic caching schema is one of caching schemas that is built in the top of P2P architecture, which provide means to store segments in the local buffer of peers. Beside for pre-buffering mechanism, this cache also keep segment in order to increase systemÂ´s service capacity that is useful for another peer. While Bittorrent protocol gives the way to preserve the effectiveness of distributing content, using particular segment selection and peer selection algorithm. In this paper we try to combine the Bittorrent protocol and probabilistic caching schema that has been proposed before, by utilizing the features that exist in each schema. We tried to modify both caching schema and Bittorrent protocol algorithms in order to be adaptive in the way to distribute VoD content. From the experimental result we can see that some of modification in algorithm and schema can give influence in several parameters related to increment of the VoD quality on user.

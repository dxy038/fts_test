In this paper, a comprehensive study is carried out to analyze different spreading codes for a DS/CDMA system, and an objective way is presented to measure the performance of different codes based on various correlation parameters such as aperiodic, even, odd, maximal, mean and square-sum cross-correlations. The codes concerned in this paper include m-sequence, Gold, Kasami, GMW, No and Walsh codes with length from 31 to 2047

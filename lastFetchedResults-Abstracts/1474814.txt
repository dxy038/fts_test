The objective of the present study was to develop the multidimensional and multilayers macroporous crater-like surface for the cost-effective solar cells, which is easily possible to realize by chemical and electrochemical etching. A mathematical model of the macroporous silicon of the real layer was realized, to develop the technology of chemical and electrochemical etching, which allowed to develop the cost-effective silicon solar cell with a new form of the surface texture. Special attention has been paid to the search of optimal, from point of view of the optical losses reduction, geometry of the texture and its technology of preparation. Correlation of the simulation results with experimental data gives the evidence of sufficient accuracy of the model. It also allows to assume the possibility of using this model for the PS real layer optical properties prediction.

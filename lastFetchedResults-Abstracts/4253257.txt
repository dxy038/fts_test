This paper describes the architecture and implementation of a shortest-path processor, both in reconfigurable hardware and VLSI. This processor is based on the principles of a recurrent spatiotemporal neural network. The processor´s operation is similar to E.W. Dijkstra´s (1959) algorithm and it can be used for network routing calculations. The objective of the processor is to find the least-cost path in a weighted graph between a given node and one or more destinations. The digital implementation, which exhibits a regular interconnect structure and uses simple processing elements, is well-suited for VLSI implementation and reconfigurable hardware

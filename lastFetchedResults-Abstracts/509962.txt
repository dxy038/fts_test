Background and Objective: Menopausal estrogen-deprivation is an important cause of memory impairment. Exercise is known to improve learning and memory, while ovariectomy causes memory impairment. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of forced treadmill running on learning and on spatial memory in ovariectomized rats.

Materials and Methods: Sixty female Wistar rats (between 240-270 g ) were randomly divided in to six groups: Intact and sham exercised control; Intact and exercised (Exe); Sham ovariectomized and sham exercised (Sh-Ovx-Sh-Exe); Sham ovariectomized and exercised (Sh-Ovx-Exe); Ovariectomized and sham exercised (Ovx-Sh-Exe); Ovariectomized and exercised (Ovx-Exe). Animals in all groups were exposed to 10 days treadmill forced running after ovariectomy or sham ovariectomy operation and recovery period. Then spatial learning and memory were tested for 21 days using T maze.

Results: Latency and errors to goal box were not changed in control group comparing to Sh-Ovx group during learning and memory test. Latency and errors to goal box were reduced in control group comparing to Ovx-Sh-Exe during learning and during memory test. Latency and errors to goal box were reduced in Exe group comparing to Ovx-Sh-Exe and Ovx-Exe in both learning and memory test. This factors were reduced in Ovx-Exe group comparing to Ovx-Sh-Exe during learning and memory test.

Conclusion: Sham ovariectomization did not affect spatial learning and memory, while ovariectomy causes spatial learning and memory impairment in rats. This reduction effect of ovariectomy can be compensated by exercise. Furthermore, exercise causes memory improvement in both intact and Ovx rats. Sci Med J 2010;9(2):123-133

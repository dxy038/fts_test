At the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI), research activities related to probabilistic fracture mechanics (PFM) have been conducted as a part of the research program on aging and structural integrity of LWR components. This paper describes the outline of two activities related to PFM, i.e. the development of a PFM code and a contract research on ‘Application of PFM Methodology to Reliability Assessment of Nuclear Components’ implemented by the Japan Welding Engineering Society (JWES). In the former research, a new PFM code PASCAL (PFM Analysis of Structural Components in Aging LWR) was developed. This code has some new functions in models of semi-elliptical crack extension, elastic–plastic fracture analysis based on R6 method and options for the evaluation of overlay cladding and warm pre-stress (WPS) effect. Besides, the code has the function to evaluate the effect of irradiation embrittlement recovery by thermal annealing of a reactor pressure vessel and re-irradiation embrittlement. Based on the analyses on benchmark problem conducted by USNRC/EPRI, performance and functions introduced in the code were examined. Some case studies were also carried out to investigate the influence of various parameters. On the other hand, JAERI has been sponsoring the PFM related activities in relation to the structural integrity of LWR components. These activities have been conducted at JSME and JWES. The objective of this activity has been to provide for the future need of PFM methodology.

The measurement of voltages, mrents
and losses of saturated magnetic devices under
nonsinusoidal conditions is not well understood, because
the principle of superposition does not apply. The complexity
of the task is increased by the fact that intern
d y generated harmonic currents can be compensated
by externally applied currents of either the same harmonic
frequency or of other harmonic frequencies. In
other words a transformation of fundamental power to
harmonic power, and vice versa, takes place. In addition
the flux-density waveshape varies -and therefore
also the iron-core losses- as the harmonic phase shift
of the externally applied harmonic voltage changes, although
the percentage of the harmonic amplitude remains
constant. It is the first objective of this paper to
assemble a computer-aided testing circuit which enables
the investigation of the variation of the iron-core losses
with the amplitude of the fundamental flux density &,
the amplitude of the vth harmonic B,, the harmonic order
v and the phase shift p, of the vth harmonic with
respect to the fundamental. Phase-factor functions -
which reflect the dependency of the iron-core losses on
the harmonic phase shift (p,- are directly measured for
given Epstein frame iron-core samples. Thereafter, the
effect of these newly defined phase-factor functions on
the total transformer losses is demonstrated. The attenuation
of low-frequency (60 to 3,000 Hz flux-densityharmonics in inductors is determined, if t i, e core is bi-ased with fundamental flux density.

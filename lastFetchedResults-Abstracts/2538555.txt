Background and Objective: Lead is one of the most common environmental pollutants. The use of medicinal plants may protect tissues from lead damages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of Pelargonium graveolens leaf extract (PGE) on spermatogenesis in male rats.

Materials and Methods: Fortytwo male rats with 220250 gr body weight were randomly assigned to 6 groups(n=7): control (normal saline,0.5ml/day, gavage ), witness group (lead acetate, 500 ppm in tap water), treated groups: (1; 250mg/kg PGE and 2; 500mg/kg PGE, gavage), and lead acetateinduced group (500 ppm in tap water) + treated by PGE (250mg/kg and 500mg/kg, daily gavage) for one month. After examination, the epididymis and testes tissues were collected for sperm counting and histological study. All data were expressed as mean&amp;plusmn;SEM, and statistically significant differences were accepted at P&lt;0.05.

Results: Our results showed that the lead acetate decreased sperm numbers and damaged testis tissue. The PGE protected testes and significantly increased sperm number compared with witness group (P&lt;0.001).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Conclusion: The Pelargonium graveolens hydroethanolic extract can protect the testis tissues against toxic effect of lead acetate.

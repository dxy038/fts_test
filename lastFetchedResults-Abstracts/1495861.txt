The use of cover crops affects the support capacity of soil and least limiting water range to crop growth. The objective of this study was to quantify preconsolidation pressure (σp), compression index (CI) and least limiting water range (LLWR) of a reclaimed coal mining soil under different cover crops, in Candiota, RS, Brazil. In the experiment, with randomized blocks design and four replicates, the following cover crops (treatments) were evaluated: Hemarthria altissima (Poir.) Stapf &amp; C.E. Hubbard, treatment 1 (T1), Paspalum notatum Flüggé, treatment 4 (T4), Cynodon dactilon (L.) Pers., treatment 5 (T5), control Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst.) Stapf, treatment 7 (T7) and without cover crop treatment 8 (reference treatment, T8). Soil compression and least limiting water range were evaluated with undisturbed samples at a depth of 0.00–0.05 m. In order to evaluate parameters of soil compressibility, the soil samples were saturated with water and subjected to −10 kPa matric potential and then submitted to a uniaxial compression test under the following pressures: 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1600 kPa. Cover crops decreased the preconsolidation pressure of constructed soils after coal mining and the greatest soil reclamation was obtained with the H. altissima cover crop, where the lowest degree of soil compactness and soil load capacity were observed. Soils cultivated under H. altissima or B. brizantha presented the highest least limiting water range and these two cover crops generated similar soil critical bulk density obtained by least limiting water range and soil load support capacity.

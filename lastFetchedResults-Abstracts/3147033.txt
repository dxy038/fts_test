Face is the most common biometric used by humans, its applications range from static, mug-shot verification to a dynamic, uncontrolled face identification in a cluttered background. The main objective of this paper is to construct an effective human face identification system. The presented algorithm combines the scaling process, histogram equalization process, binary two dimensional principal component analysis (B2DPCA) process, and support vector machine (SVM) scheme to construct a human face identification algorithm. The experimental results show that the presented algorithm has good efficiency for human face identification.

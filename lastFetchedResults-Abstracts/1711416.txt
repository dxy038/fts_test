Experimental and numerical finite element results on the mechanical behavior of timber beech finger-joint are presented. Numerical simulations are based on the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) of Abaqus software to allow for accurate description of the progressive damage of the bond-lines within the finger-joint up to failure. To increase the finger-joint resistance, the geometry of the finger-joint has been optimized using the Response Surface Method (RSM) and the Kriging interpolation. The finger length, the pitch and the tip gap have been defined as the design variables to optimize. The objective function has been defined in terms of the maximum bending force, obtained from four-point bending tests. Feasibility constraints on the design variables, conforming to the EN 14080 are also taken into account. The obtained results demonstrated clearly the potential in increasing the finger-joint resistance by optimizing its geometry.

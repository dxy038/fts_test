The objective and importance of structural performance tests for the ITER gravity support prototype were described. The model of the gravity support system was established. Based on the analysis of loads, the torque transformation method and the 3D loading method for prototypes under complex load conditions were proposed. The proposed methods overcome 3D loading problems in the case of the complex load cases. The structural design schemes of the mixed 3D loading system with hydraulic bolt tensioners and the 3D loading system with bidirectional hydraulic cylinders were discussed. Two design schemes were compared and analyzed. Based on the finite element method, the numerical analysis of the 3D loading framework for bidirectional hydraulic cylinders was done. Results show the proposed 3D loading system meets the performance test requirements of the ITER gravity support prototype and should be preferred for the prototype loading experiment.

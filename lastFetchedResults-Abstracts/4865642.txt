This paper is focused on the analysis of nonlinear dynamics of an enzymatic process involving three chemical species. The work is based on the immobilization of Acetyl-cholinesterase enzyme into an artificial proteinic membrane. Our objective is to study oscillations observed in the membrane potential difference during experimental works. Stability analysis is provided for the system from a theoretical point view. Reported results allow the analysis of the profile of diffusion motion of molecules inside the membrane.

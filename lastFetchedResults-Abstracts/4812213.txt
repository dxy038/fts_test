The objective of this research is into detecting sea ice by using PALSAR (Phased-Array type L-band SAR) polarimetric data. It is generally difficult to detect thin sea ice area by using the methods based on the backscattering coefficient. We propose a new method utilizing scattering entropy to detect sea ice. This paper shows the results of extracting sea ice area from PALSAR fully polarimetric data acquired from 2009 to 2010. The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data are used as sea ice reference. The threshold of PALSAR scattering entropy to discriminate sea ice from open water is determined from the distribution of scattering entropy for both sea ice and open water. We compared PALSAR derived sea ice area with MODIS derived area. Since most of PALSAR detected sea ice area is also detected by MODIS data, we can conclude that our proposed method is reliable to detect thin sea ice area in the Sea of Okhotsk. The high resolution backscattering and scattering entropy images give us an idea that there are some difficulties in detecting thin sea ice only by backscattering coefficient.

Soil infiltration is one of the most important factors in successful operation of floodwater spreading projects. The suspended particle in floodwater reduces the rate of soil infiltration. The objective of this research was  firstly to monitor the variation of infiltration and secondly to determine the effective factors in decreasing the infiltration rate. In this research, three representative strips of the floodwater spreading network were selected. Each strip was divided into three rectangular areas, and by drawing rectangulars diameters,  each rectangular area was further broken into 4 triangulars. The soil infiltration rate was measured in two steps at the center of each triangle during 2004 â€“ 2005. In each step, 9 measurements were undertaken in each rectangle, implying totally 27 measurements were collected from each strip.  
Based on the obtained results, there was no significant difference between the infiltration rate at the strips over this two-year experiment. Also, there was no significant difference between the infiltration rate in the experimental strips compared to the control strips. Comparing the soil infiltration rate of the stripes in the first and second year showed that its values in the second year are less than the first year. Also, a significant difference at a 95% confidence level was observed in the infiltration rate of the first and second strips in two years.

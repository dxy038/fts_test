The paper describes the current research situation of automotive ride comfort from two aspects of experimental and simulation. The dynamics model with five degrees of freedom of a bus is established, meanwhile the kinetic equations is also derived according to DÂ´Alembert principle. A road simulation model of class B is also established on the basis of white noise method. Combined with vehicle model and road model, the model of Matlab/Simulink is built. The vertical acceleration RMS on the seat is objective function and stiffness and damping of front and rear suspension are optimization variables. On the basis of GB/T4970-2009, the acceleration RMS is optimized in the speed interval of 50km / h and 100km / h. After been optimized, the RMS is reduced by about 10% and the effect is obvious at 60km / h.

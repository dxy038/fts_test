The aim of the project is to provide an alternative to short distance transport and in turn reduce the ever increasing pollution and demand on fuel resources. Our objective is the development of a solar powered electric recumbent trike which will cater to the present day transport needs without being a burden on the environment and also does not compromise on matters like stability and comfort.

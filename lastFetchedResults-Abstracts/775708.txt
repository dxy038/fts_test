The objective of this work was to assess the effectiveness of using near UV light to disinfect water supplies for potential
applications in developing countries. A pilot scale photoreactor comprised of non-tracking compound parabolic
collectors installed at Plataforma Solar de Almerı´a was examined and a comparison of disinfection efficiency using
E. coli K-12 was carried out with a reactor configuration of 3 and 1 m2 illuminated area. Tests were also carried out
using suspensions of titanium dioxide (TiO2) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 9 mg/l. The removal of E. coli K-
12 from initial concentrations of 1 · 105 CFU/ml to below the limit of detection was achieved both with and without
the use of TiO2. Levels of inactivation in 35 l of inoculated water of up to 4-log removal were achieved in under 30 min.
The addition of TiO2 created an enhancement to the process only at the 3 mg/l dose. However, the results have also
suggested the possibility that another disinfection mechanism, possibly governed by the frequency of intermittent
UV light exposure, was regulating the overall inactivation kinetics of the trials.

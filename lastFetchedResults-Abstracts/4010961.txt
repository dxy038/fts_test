Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) networks require dynamic flow admission control to guarantee end-to-end quality of service (QoS) for each Internet protocol (IP) traffic flow. In this paper, we propose to tackle the joint routing and admission control problem for the IP traffic flows in MPLS networks without rerouting already admitted flows. We propose two mathematical programming models for this problem. The first model includes end-to-end delay constraints and the second one, end-to-end packet loss constraints. These end-to-end QoS constraints are imposed not only for the new traffic flow, but also for all already admitted flows in the network. The objective function of both models is to minimize the end-to-end delay for the new flow. Numerical results show that considering end-to-end delay (or packet loss) constraints for all flows has a small impact on the flow blocking rate. Moreover, we reduces significantly the mean end-to-end delay (or the mean packet loss rate) and the proposed approach is able to make its decision within 250 msec.

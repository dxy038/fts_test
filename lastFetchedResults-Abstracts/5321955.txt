It is expected that robotics is introduced into search and rescue activity, planetary explorer and investigation in extreme environment etc. The robots in such environment need high mobility against extremely rough terrain. Pressure exerted on the terrain is distributing wider, thus tracked vehicles are advantageous, accordingly. Since it is difficult for usual tracked vehicle composed of a pair of tracks to change length/width ratio a lot from 1/1 because of its turning property, serially connected tracked vehicles and paddled tracked vehicles have been introduced in order to improve the mobility. We have proposed a tracked vehicle called flexible mono-tread mobile track (FMT). The body of FMT except both side wall is completely wrapped around only by a track belt, which is possible to prevents sharp or thin edges of obstacle and cloth from penetrating. However the prototypes have rail colliding and derailing problems of the track belt caused by flexion and surface profile of the ground. The objective of the paper is, therefore, to develop a new prototype of FMT called RT04. RT04 adopts one degree of freedom rotational joint in stead of the flexible components and accurately designed guide rail system in order to prevent the belt from colliding or derailing. Rubber sponge grouser is also introduced against obstacle penetration and impact from the ground. Finally, some experimental tests validate the prototype.

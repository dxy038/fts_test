An MOS IC crosspoint switch for space division digital switching network is described. A sense amplifier for compensation of signal attenuation through the MOS IC switch is also considered. Transmission of a 50-100 Mbit/s bit rate digital signal seems a reasonable design objective on the basis of analysis of a preliminarily fabricated MOS IC switch and the design characteristics of a bipolar IC sense amplifier. The MOS switch and the SA are monolithic integrated. Dynamic test of the subsystem, in which MOS IC switches and bipolar IC SAÂ´s are connected in cascaded stages, has indicated that they are capable of 100 Mbit/s return to zero digital signal transmission and 46-dB signal-to-noise ratio.

A series of 2-[4-cyano-(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl amino)]-4-(4-quinoline/coumarin-4-yloxy)-6-(fluoropiperazinyl)-s-triazines has been synthesized by a simple and efficient synthetic protocol. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was studied against several bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96, Bacillus cereus MTCC 619, Escherichia coli MTCC 739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 741, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 109, Salmonella typhi MTCC 733, Proteus vulgaris MTCC 1771, Shigella flexneria MTCC 1457) and fungi (Aspergillus niger MTCC 282, Aspergillus fumigatus MTCC 343, Aspergillus clavatus MTCC 1323, Candida albicans MTCC 183) using paper disc diffusion technique and agar streak dilution method. Newly synthesized compounds were also tested for their in vitro antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using BACTEC MGIT and Lowensteinâ€“Jensen MIC method.

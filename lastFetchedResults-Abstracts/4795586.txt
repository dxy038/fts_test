The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships of the project manager´s leadership style with teamwork, and their associations with project schedule and cost performance. The second objective was to determine whether the effect of leadership style on project performance may be mediated by teamwork. To address the primary aims, a questionnaire-based survey was used to measure the project manager´s leadership style, teamwork in terms of communication, collaboration and cohesiveness, and project success in the areas of schedule and cost. The analyses suggest that project manager´s leadership style, teamwork, and project performance are highly correlated. The findings also indicate that teamwork dimensions may partially or fully mediate the relationships between leadership style and project performance.

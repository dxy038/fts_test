This work describes the preparation of HfO2 thin films by the sol–gel method, starting with different precursors such as hafnium ethoxide, hafnium 2,4-pentadionate and hafnium chloride. From the solution prepared as mentioned above, thin films on silicon wafer substrates have been realized by ‘dip-coating’ with a pulling out speed of 5 cm min−1. The films densification was achieved by thermal treatment for 10 min at 100 °C and 30 min at 450 °C or 600 °C, with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. The structural and optical properties of the films are determined employing spectroellipsometric (SE) measurements in the visible range (0.4–0.7 μm), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The main objective of this paper was to establish a correlation between the method of preparation (precursor, annealing temperature) and the properties of the obtained films. The samples prepared from pentadionate and ethoxide precursors are homogenous and uniform in thickness. The samples prepared starting from chloride precursor are thicker and proved to be less uniform in thickness. Higher non-uniformity develops in multi-deposition films or in crystallized films. A nano-porosity is present in the quasi-amorphous films as well in the crystallized one. For the samples deposited on silicon wafer, the thermal treatment induced the formation of a SiO2 layer at the coating–substrate interface.

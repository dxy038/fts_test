Techniques and tools are described that have been developed and implemented at Bellcore for the analysis of software defects. The objective of software defect analysis is to identify process changes that will result in the greatest improvements in quality and productivity. Measures of expected quality and productivity improvements are presented from projects in which software defect analysis was performed. Practical issues, such as resource requirements, and technical and management factors for successful implementation of defect analysis are addressed. Overall conclusions based on BellcoreÂ´s experience with performing defect analysis on several projects are provided

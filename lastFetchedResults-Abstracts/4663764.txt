The objective of this research was to clarify effects of driver visual distraction on alarm effectiveness and necessity for FCWS by comparing results obtained in two driving simulator studies. Results show that the presence of alarms induced decreases in collision risk when drivers were distracted. Contrary alarms could not lead to a decrease of risk when drivers were not distracted although alarms were given with the same timing. Moreover, subjective ratings of unnecessary alarms varied according to whether driver distraction occurred.

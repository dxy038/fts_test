The activity of the IST European Research Project INTERFACE is oriented to the development of advanced interfaces based on an interaction engine capable of interpreting natural voice or gestures and answering through artificial voice and animation feed-backs. Classic technologies of voice recognition and synthesis have been integrated with innovative algorithms for emotional speech modeling. Video analysis techniques have been developed for interpreting human gestures capable of being reproduced artificially through three-dimensional virtual animated faces and bodies. The INTERFACE objective is that of integrating all these analysis/synthesis techniques into a single piece of technology capable of accepting queries through talk and facial expressions, as we are used to do in everyday life with relatives, friends and colleagues, and of providing answers to the user through virtual actors capable of artificially reproducing human voice and gestures. The INTERFACE achievements have been recently demonstrated with live demos during international exhibitions and conferences

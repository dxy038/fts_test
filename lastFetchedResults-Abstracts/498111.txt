Introduction: The importance of cardiac rehabilitation has been widely acknowledged, after myocardial infarction. Improved physical capacity is an important outcome of cardiac rehabilitation. Therefore, accurate measurement of the exercise tolerance of cardiac patients before and after cardiac rehabilitation program using an objective measure is important.

Objective: To comparison the effects of cardiac rehabilitation program (concurrent endurance and resistance training) on exercise capacity of men and women patients with coronary artery disease.

Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, among 40 patients, 20 patients (10 female with mean age 54.5±5.44 and 10 male with mean age 53.2±7.68) who arrived to Phase II cardiac rehabilitation were assesed. 6MWT and Exercise Test (ET) were performed at the beginning and at the end of 8 weeks program (3 days per week) in the both group of the patients.

Results: Both of 2 groups had significant response to Cardiac rehabilitation program after cardiac rehabilitation, functional capacity (6MWT) and exercise capacity (ET). There is no significant difference between final value of 6mwt distance, Exercise capacity (Exercise test time), Heart Rate Recovery (HRR), Rate Pressure Product (RPP), V02peak between men and women patients with Coronary Artery Disease before and after cardiac rehabilitation program, but all of above improved significantly in both CRP men and women (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Probably all of men and women patients affected of exercise training similarity.

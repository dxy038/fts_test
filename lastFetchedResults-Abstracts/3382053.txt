The ensemble average of pattern shift visual evoked potentials (PSVEPs) signals is seriously affected by random latency variations encountered in each individual sweep which is modeled as a continuous signal with linear segments and well-shaped triangular peaks. This effect is causing the smoothed peaks of the averaged PSVEP waveforms. It is the authors objective to restore the degraded peaks and provide accurate information about their exact location. The method used is based on nonlinear filtering of the FIR-median hybrid (FMH) type and is recommended as a postfiltering process to the well-known averaging methods of recovering PSVEP signals from noise by time-locking to stimuli. The new technique, tested in signals from clinical observations, has proven very promising.

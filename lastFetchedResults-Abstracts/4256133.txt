When facing with the competition between the domestic technology and the similar foreign one, government often intentionally or unintentionally favors the domestic technology, such as the battle between United States and EU for 2G mobile communication technology standards. However, whether or not this approach is correct is still controversial. This paper attempts to establish a multi-objective decision-making model to quantitatively analyze the relationship between government regulation and technology choices in telecom markets.

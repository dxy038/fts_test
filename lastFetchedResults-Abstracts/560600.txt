
The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of “Hardiness” scale for university students. The instrument used was Lang and Goulet hardiness scale, translated from English into Persian by using back-translation technique. The “Hardiness” scale for university (Shahed, Tehran & Beheshti).
Factor analysis revealed three factors (control, commitment, and challenge) explained 30% of the variance. For all items of this questionnaire construct validity was (r=0.64), Internal consistency coefficient was obtained in three ways (cronbach’s alpha=0.82), Test=retest reliability was r=0.71) and Split-half reliability was r=0.76). The results indicated acceptable validity and reliability of the scale as a whole and for subscales. These preliminary results provide support for using LGHS to measure hardiness levels in Iranian university students and can be used to assess the hardiness of other populations.

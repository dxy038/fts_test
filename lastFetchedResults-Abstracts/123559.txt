Backgrand: Diagnosis and treatment of neonatal hypothyroidism is of prime importance. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare thyroid hormones levels before and after exchange transfusion in neonates with indirect hyperbilirubinemia admitted to Quds children hospital, Qazvin, Iran.
Methods: This study was performed on 20 neonates with indirect hyperbilirubinemia chosen as candidates for exchange transfusion. The neonates were full term and over 37 gestational weeks. Thyroid hormones levels of neonates and blood bags were measured using ELISA method. In neonates, the thyroid hormones concentrations were measured at 3 different times: before, immediately after, and also 3 days after exchange transfusion. The results were analysed by t test.
Findings: The data showed that the mean concentrations of T4 and TSH in neonates' blood were higher than in blood bags (P<0.05). There was a decrease in T4 and TSH values in samples taken immediately after exchange transfusion, although returned to values before exchange after 3 days. There was no statistically significant difference between mean concentrations of T4 and TSH in neonates' blood collected in the periods before and 3 days after exchange transfusion.
Conclusion: The data found in our study showed that there was a return to normal values of T4 and TSH in neonates 3 days after exchange transfusion. Thus the screening of neonates for hypothyroidism could be performed at this time .

This paper presents the synthesis of Concentric Circular Antenna Array (CCAA) with hybrid optimization technique combining Differential Evolution with Biogeography Based Optimization (DE/BBO). Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) is a novel optimization technique based on distribution of organisms over space and time. BBO uses its migration operator to share information between solutions. Differential Evolution (DE) is a robust optimization technique which uses it mutation operator to explore search space for better solutions. DE/BBO combines the mutation operator of DE with migration operator of BBO to improve the quality of solutions and convergence performance. This paper presents the thinning of nine-ring CCAA with centre element using DE/BBO. The main objective of thinning process is to reduce the Side Lobe Level (SLL) while keeping the First Null Beam-Width (FNBW) fixed. Results obtained are compared with Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and BBO techniques. Results show the superior performance of DE/BBO as compared to other techniques, both in terms of SLL and convergence speed.

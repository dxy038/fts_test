This paper investigates the problem of robust fault detection for a class of uncertain systems with time-delay and unknown input. The objective is to minimize the difference between the residual and the fault, and to enhance the robustness to unknown inputs, control inputs and model uncertainties. Attention is focused on formulating the design of robust fault detection filters as H<sub> &#8734;</sub> filtering problem. The sufficient condition for the existence of the above filters is established by means of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

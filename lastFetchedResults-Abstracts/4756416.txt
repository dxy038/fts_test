Survivable RWA under dynamic traffic involves the setup and tear down of lightpaths dynamically at random times with the objective of reducing blocking rates. Moreover due to the QoS requirements, the RWA is not only required to utilize network resources efficiently during the setup of lightpaths for newly arriving demands, but it is also required not to interrupt lightpaths that are in progress. These constraints dictate the optimization of the RWA for each individual connection request separately as it arrives with the objective of allocating minimum bandwidth based on the network status at the time of the arrival. This paper proposes a new algorithm for shared protection RWA under dynamic traffic for wavelength-routed mesh network with no wavelength conversion. The algorithm is based on the iterative two step approach proposed for networks, with full wavelength conversion. Two wavelength assignment schemes were evaluated and the results are presented.

Nowadays, the research for new and better antimicrobial compounds is an important field due to the increase of immunocompromised patients, the use of invasive medical procedures and extensive surgeries, among others, that can affect the incidence of infections. Another big problem associated is the occurrence of drug-resistant microbial strains that impels a ceaseless search for new antimicrobial agents.

s context, a series of heterocyclic-sulfonamide complexes with Co(II) was synthesized and characterized with the aim of obtaining new antimicrobial compounds. The structural characterization was performed using different spectroscopic methods (UV–Vis, IR, and EPR). In spite of the fact that the general stoichiometry for all the complexes was Co(sulfonamide)2·nH2O, the coordination atoms were different depending on the coordinated sulfonamide. The crystal structure of [Co(sulfamethoxazole)2(H2O)2]·H2O was obtained by X-ray diffraction showing that Co(II) is in a slightly tetragonal distorted octahedron where sulfamethoxazole molecules act as a head-to-tail bridges between two cobalt atoms, forming polymeric chains.

s, the activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, one of the responsible for tuberculosis, and the cytotoxicity on J774A.1 macrophage cells were evaluated.

A scheduling model of thermal power units based on cultural algorithms is proposed to minimize the optimization of the objective function. The algorithm uses the good individual information stored in the Knowledge Space to control the iteration of Population Space. Thus the individuals can inherit the better features of previous generation in the iteration process, to improve the search efficiency and the search quality. An example proved the cultural algorithm is superior to the traditional intelligent algorithm with single evolution space, and can get a better result.

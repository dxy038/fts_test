The flow shop problem with multiple objectives is always difficult to find optimal solutions, especially in large-scale problem. However, the ant colony optimization algorithms (ACO) is an effective method for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. Therefore, we want to use the ACO algorithm to search optimal schedules of two machines flow shop problem under multi-objective constraint. Then our ACO algorithm is proposed to optimize the solutions under multi-objective constraint and the improved performance of solutions from our ACO algorithm will display in our experimental results

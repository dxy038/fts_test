Background: Meta–analysis is a strong approach, but sometimes leads to wrong and misleading answers. Objective: To conduct case studies of clinical trials and observed cases regarding factors that affect the credibility of meta-research, such as the effect size, the number of analyses, data scale, analyses’ flexibility, method of reporting, and conflict of interest. Research Method: The meta-analysis method was adopted in this research. A case study of corticosteroid therapy in acute bacterial meningitis was discussed in this paper. In addition, the meta-analysis progressed in a step-by-step manner with 6 researches out of 11 ones. Results: The results of the meta-analysis of acute bacterial meningitis indicated that numerous studies have been carried out under such a title in different places. Each author has identified reasons for the use of steroid treatment. Although their reasons were sometimes incomplete, it must be noted that their researches have some things in common.

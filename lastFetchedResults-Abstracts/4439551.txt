In this article, a novel architecture for full duplex wired and wireless network with optical fiber backbone network is proposed. We employ a dual drive dual port Mach-Zehnder modulator to simultaneously modulate the CW laser source with wired and wireless data, for the downstream link. Light remodulation technique using RSOA is utilized in the upstream link to provide a reliable bidirectional optical channel. WDM is used to further increase the capacity of the system. Simulation of the proposed scheme demonstrates a 2.5 Gb/s wired and wireless downlink datastream and 1 Gb/s uplink.

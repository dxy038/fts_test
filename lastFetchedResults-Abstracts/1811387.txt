The main objective of this paper is to decorate carbon multiwall nanotubes surface with TiO2, ZnO and Al2O3 in view of radical catalytic application for these nanocomposites. In this work oxide liquids were used to wet the surface of nanotubes to decorate nanotubes. Under ionizing irradiation various nanooxides decorated multiwall carbon nanotubes shows different catalytic activity. The results showed that the nanooxides decorated nanotubes catalyzed reactions are accelerated more by the decrease in decorated nanotubes concentration, dose and pH. Among these three kinds of nanooxide decorated nanotubes, nano-TiO2 decorated multiwall carbon nanotubes displayed relatively high catalytic activity.

The objective of this paper is to introduce the basic concepts underlying the area of adaptive filtering from a philosophical and theoretical point of view. It reviews the concepts of linear adaptive filters and provides an indication of some of the many, choices available by way of adaptation algorithms. The basic application structures are introduced and some of the classical &#8220;real-world&#8221; applications linked to these. Linear adaptive systems are discussed, a description is included of optimum linear estimation, adaptive structures, and algorithms and examples of current application are presented. Current research directions in adaptive signal processing are also indicated

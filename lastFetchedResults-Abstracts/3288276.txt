Cloud computing is a paradigm for large-scale distributed computing that makes use of existing technologies such as virtualization, service-orientation, and grid computing. In cloud environment, pool of virtual resources is always changing. Thus allocating the resources for particular job in this dynamic environment is challenging. Objective of this paper is to present a load balancing, specifically resource allocation scheme in cloud computing environment. This paper proposes a novel load balancing algorithm for allocation of the jobs. Allocation is made on the basis of the requirement submitted by the consumers or clients and finally a service level agreement is made between cloud service provider and cloud consumer.

The objective of this article is to present a precise calibration method-Poling Calibration Method (PCM) for 3D motion analysis. The main content covers basic principle, decision-making process, co-ordination arrangements, control point measurement, PCM algorithm and the creation of calibration space. A 10.00cm long rod with 2 reflective makers was used to test the calculation error after calibration through PCM. The top error was 0.37cm, minimum error was 0.00 cm, and average error was 0.12cm. All maximum errors showed up at 20% rim area of calibrated space. The result showed that the computational error after calibration was greatly declined, and effectiveness of the calibration method was validated. Therefore, PCM is an effective calibration method, especially for fixing cameras under the indoor lab settings.

Many organizations adopt cyclical processes to articulate and engineer technological responses to their business needs. Their objective is to increase competitive advantage and add value to the organization´s processes, services and deliverables, in line with the organization´s vision and strategy. The major challenges in achieving these objectives include the rapid changes in the business and technology environments themselves, such as changes to business processes, organizational structure, architectural requirements, technology infrastructure and information needs. No activity or process is permanent in the organization. To achieve their objectives, some organizations have adopted an Enterprise Architecture (EA) approach, others an Information Technology (IT) strategy approach, and yet others have adopted both EA and IT strategy for the same primary objectives. The deployment of EA and IT strategy for the same aims and objectives raises question whether there is conflict in adopting both approaches. The paper and case study presented here, aimed at both academics and practitioners, examines how EA could be employed as IT strategy to address both business and IT needs and challenges.

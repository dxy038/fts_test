When disaster happens, it is necessary to employ efficient and accurate methods to select the best service from many service backed sites to control DR (Disaster Recovery) activities. Aim at the service deployment algorithm is not suit for MultiObjective DR of policy and target distinct. This paper presents a novel algorithm MOGOSD (MultiObjective Global Optimal Service Deployment) to resolve service deployment with QoS global optimal Based on Improved AntNet-CO algorithm in above DR system. The theory of intelligent optimization of MultiObjective genetic algorithm is utilized to product a set of optimal Pareto service select, with means of optimizing various objective functions simultaneously. Experimental results indicate the feasibility and efficiency of this algorithm.

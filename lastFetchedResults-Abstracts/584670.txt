Background and Objective: Thalassemia major has severe clinical symptoms with craniofacial defects that produce esthetic problems in patients. Orthodontic treatment and surgical reconstruction in these patients have had good esthetic results and therefore satisfying pschycosocial effects. Researches have shown an increase in the level of life quality corresponding to health improvement in thalassemic patients. More knowledge and information is necessary for better treatment of skeletal problems in thalassemia. 
Subjects and Methods: This descriptive and analytic study was performed on 48-beta thalassemia major patient and 48 normal samples. They were divided into two groups (24 persons) based on their genders. Including criteria for samples were : being more than 15 years  old, not being affected by special disorders, not having orthodontic and orthopedic treatment, having Cl I profile, normal facial height, Cl I molar relationship, normal overbite and over jet and the presence of all permanent teeth (except third molar). Cephalometric analysis was used for evaluation of cephalograms. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistical and paired sample T-test (P < 0.005). 
Results: SNA angle did no significant increase, but SNB and ANB angles significantly decreased (P < 0.005). 
The angle between SN-Occlusal plans, Frankfort - y-axis plans and basal plans showed increase, but the angle between Frankfort - facial plans (P < 0.005) and the distance between pog-NB plan showed decrease (P < 0.005).
Conclusion: Beta thalassemia major induces Cl II malocclusion and long face growth pattern due to decrease in mandibular growth and decrease in posterior facial height.

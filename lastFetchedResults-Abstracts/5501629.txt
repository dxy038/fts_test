The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of an ultra wideband (UWB) system for in-body wireless communications of biomedical applications. We first designed an implanted elliptic disc dipole antenna with a UWB frequency band in a human body. We then calculated the channel characteristics for UWB signal propagation from the implanted antenna to the out-of-body using a frequency-dependent finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. Based on the in-body channel characteristics we optimized the UWB pulse shape. We then proposed a UWB system with bi-phase modulation for the in-body wireless communications, and derived the bit-error rate (BER) of the proposed system under the additive Gaussian noise environment. The results show the feasibility of the UWB system for in-body wireless communications of biomedical applications

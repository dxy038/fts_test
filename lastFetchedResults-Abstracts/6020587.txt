Well into the System-on-Chip era, power consumption has emerged as one of the most critical challenges to design complexity scaling. Moving from a critical assessment of current technologies and architectures, we survey the distinguishing features of a design methodology that aims at energy consumption reduction, under guaranteed quality of service (QoS), as a main objective in system design.

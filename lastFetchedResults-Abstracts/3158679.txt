Teachers in a university do not only lecture, but also many other things, such as educational research, scientific research, etc. The comprehensive evaluation on the results of teaching and research with one teacher is required in a university. However, there is more qualitative but less quantitative, more soft but less hard index for the teacher with assessment criteria. A full range system for teacher performance assessment and the novel quantized method are both developed in this paper. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluation process and evaluation model have been also shown here. The application results for performance review assessment demonstrated its high operability and achieved more accurate, more objective.

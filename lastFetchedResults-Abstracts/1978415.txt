Background and objective: Skin cancer is the most frequent malignancy in Iran.
Exposure to excessive ultraviolet radiation is an important risk factor in creating
skin tumors. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the
Health Belief Model (HBM) on the health education of Farmers in Sirjan.
Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental study. Two hundred Farmers attending
health centers in Sirjan city, were selected to participate in this study
(100 in intervention group and 100 in the control group). The intervention was
conducted over two sessions in 60 minutes. Data were collected by a validated
and reliable questionnaire (49 questions) before intervention and three months
after the intervention. Data was analyzed by chi-square, Fisherâ€™s exact, paired
t-tests and independent t-test.
Results: After intervention, knowledge scores increased significantly in both
intervention and control group, which was probably due to the routine education
program in that center. Perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived
benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy increased
significantly in the intervention group (p < 0.001). But, there was no increase or
significant difference in the control group.
Conclusion: HBM was effective in educating the Farmers. Therefore, it is proposed
to use HBM along with the traditional training methods in training farmers.

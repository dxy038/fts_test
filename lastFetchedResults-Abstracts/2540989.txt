Abstract
Aim: Obesity and overweight along with metabolic disorders associated with them is one of the very important concerns in todayâ€™s world. According to the fact that chihdren and adolencrs bodies are in asensetive stage of growth and preparation for aduhthood, we aim  to review the effects of high intensity interval training over the course of 12 weeks on testosterone, cortisol and lipids profiles levels in obese and overweight.
Method:  In this study 20 boys were selected based on per- post test in to control and high intensity interval training (HIIT) groups.Anthropometric measures, maximal aerobic speed (MAS), cortisol and testosterone levels, and lipid profile were measured in all subjects before and after training. Training group participated in a training program at 100 to 110% of MAS and 3 times per week during 12 weeks. Independent t-test and Paired t-test with a significance level of (P?0/05) was used to analysis variables. 
Results: Following the training program, in training group, anthropometric measures including weight, BMI, percentage body fat and waist-hips ratio and cortisol resting level, TC, TG, LDL-C decreased, and HDL-C increased but no effect on testostron resting levels. In control group, anthropometric measures and TC, TG, LDL-C increased, while HDL-C decreased.
Conclusion: Prescribing ideal training course to help obese boys has not been recognized yet But, the finding in this research shows that periodic intence work out has a economic potential, and the efficiency of training Protocol for overweight and obese people, especially children and adolescents.

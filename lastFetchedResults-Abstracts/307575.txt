Objective:
To determine whether daily dimethylglycine supplementation affects plasma homocysteine concentrations.
Design and methods:
A randomized, blinded, crossover design was used. Seven pre-dialysis chronic renal failure patients consumed 400 mg of dimethylglycine or placebo daily for 28 days. Fasting blood samples and 12-h urine samples were collected at baseline and at the end of each treatment period for analysis.
Results:
No significant differences were observed in plasma homocysteine (P = 0.624), glycine betaine (P = 0.452) and methionine (P = 0.457) concentrations between dimethylglycine and placebo treatments.
Conclusion:
Daily supplementation with dimethylglycine does not affect plasma homocysteine.

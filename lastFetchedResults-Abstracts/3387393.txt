An in-service supervisory repeaterless bidirectional wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) transmission system using optical fiber amplifiers is demonstrated for the first time. The system supervision by an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) is achieved without degrading the 2.5 Gb/s service over a bidirectional six-WDM-channel 200-km single-fiber link. Negligible system penalties of dispersion and counter-directional transmission crosstalk are observed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

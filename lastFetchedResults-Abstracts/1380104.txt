A general theoretical approach based on theory of elasticity is presented in order to define the structural behaviour of riveted and spot welded joints. The new closed form solutions lead to the definition of a joint element useful to FE models of riveted or spot welded multi-spot structures. The objective is an accurate evaluation of the local elastic stiffness of spot joints in FE analysis, which is fundamental to perform a reliable simulation of multi-joint structures and, consequently, a good estimate of loads acting on spots; this makes it possible to introduce structural stress or new general criteria allowing, for example, to predict fatigue behaviour. On the other hand, a low entry of degrees of freedom is needed when several spot joints are present in a complex structure. The goal is to reach a reliable spot region model which can be used as the basis to develop a spot element in FE analysis. In the present paper, based on new closed form solutions, a spot element is introduced, so as to precisely evaluate both local and overall stiffness both of spot welded joints and riveted joints. Based on the stress function approach and the Kirchhoff plate theory in linear elastic hypotheses, closed-form in-plane stress, displacement, moment and transverse shear force solutions are derived for a new bidimensional model, subjected to various types of loads. The capability to simulate spot welds or rivets depends on the definition of two elastic parameters intrinsic in closed form solutions, that tunes the theoretical model according to actual joint behaviour.

oposed joint element combines the precision in the simulation with a very limited number degrees of freedom in the overall finite element model of an actual multi-spot structure.

sults obtained using the introduced theoretical framework and spot element approach perfectly match those obtained using very refined FE models and experimental data.

IN MANY electric energy storage applications the objective is to store energy slowly over a relatively long interval and than withdraw the energy quickly to obtain a very high peak power. For certain applications of this type, inductance coils have significant advantages over capacitors or rotating machinery. The inductive storage method is particularly advantageous in situations where millions of watt-seconds are to be stored and the energy is to be expended in a time interval of a few milliseconds.

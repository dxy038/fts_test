Objective: Nasal obstruction resulting from inferior turbinate hypertrophy (ITH) was treated with KTP laser inferior turbinoplasty (KIT). The effectiveness of the procedure was assessed. Methods: A prospective clinical trial was carried out in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from October 1, 1998 to September 30, 2000. Forty-eight patients with chronic nasal obstruction underwent KIT. Nasal obstruction was pre- and postoperatively assessed, based on 4-point scale, by the patient and investigator. The scores were compared by paired t-test. The correlation of assessment by the patient and investigator was also demonstrated by weighted Îº test. Pre- and postoperative rhinomanometric evaluations were performed in 29 patients and were compared with paired t-test. Results: Significant reduction of nasal obstruction was obtained from assessment by the patient (P<0.000) and by the investigator (P<0.000). The symptoms of sneezing, itching and rhinorrhea were significantly reduced postoperatively (P<0.000). The cure and improvement rate of nasal obstruction were at 70.8 and 100% (assessed by the patient) and at 77.1 and 100% (assessed by the investigator) respectively, and they showed a moderate correlation (Kw=0.65). Rhinomanometrically, the total airway resistance decreased but of not statistic significance (P=0.219), however, the inspired nasal airflow at 150 Pa and the volume of nasal cavities were significantly increased (P<0.00 and P<0.001, respectively). Conclusion: KIP was shown to effectively reduce the symptom and sign of nasal obstruction as well as other nasal symptoms without any significant complications. It should be an alternative method in treating the patients with nasal obstruction resulting from hyperplastic inferior turbinate.

Objective Several issues relevant to the
care of Asian Indian patients remain poorly explored.
Little is known about the practice patterns of psychiatrists
in India, such as daily practice routines or
treatment approaches, which we describe in New
Delhi, India. Methods We focused on psychiatric
practice, as perceived by Indian psychiatrists, using a
sample from the USA as a comparison group. We
used triangulated, qualitative methods from data
gathered in India (ethnographic interviews with 16
Delhi psychiatrists, observation of treatment in India,
and treatment of Indian patients) to design and validate
a survey distributed to a sample of 34 psychiatrists
in New Delhi and 34 in Baltimore, Maryland
who treat Indian patients. Results Delhi psychiatrists
saw more patients daily (24.3 vs. 11, P < 0.001), and
spent less time on new evaluations (33.3 vs. 69 min,
P < 0.001). Both groups had similar approaches to
major disorders. But, Delhi psychiatrists were less
likely to combine medication treatment with psychotherapy
(P < 0.05), and more likely to advise
families to secretly administer medications in treatment
refusal, such as in acute schizophrenia
(P < 0.001) or major depression (P < 0.01). Conclusions
These differences highlight the salience of local
cultural context in the practice of psychiatry and in
the treatment of Indian patients. Delhi psychiatrists
are overwhelmed by the epidemic levels of untreated
illness, spend less time with patients, and rely more
heavily on medication treatment. Delhi psychiatrists
employ unique approaches to handling difficult
treatment issues, such as treatment refusal, intensive
involvement of the family, and recommendations to
the family about suitability for marriage for a patient

The main objective of the supply chain manager is global optimization through the chain. In this paper, for the first time, the different approaches to prevent or reduce just the inflated orders as an inefficeincy in a supply chain are studied. The main effect of inflated orders in the supply chain is variability in demands. This causes other negative impacts on the supply chain performance for upstream stages. In order to implementation of these approaches be effective, the chosen strategy(ies) must be in place dominantely.

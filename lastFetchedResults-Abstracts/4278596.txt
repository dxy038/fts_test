At the same time, an improved entropy weight method and the minimum information discrimination theory are used to determine the objective weights and combined weights, which could eliminates one-sidedness caused by single weight method. The calcation results, with Guanzhong irrgated areas as the example, indicate that variable fuzzy assessment method applied to drought evaluation of irrigated areas is reasonable and feasible.

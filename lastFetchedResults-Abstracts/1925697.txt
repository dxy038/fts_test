Elevated natriuretic peptides provide strong prognostic information in patients with heart failure (HF). The role of novel biomarkers in HF needs to be established. Our objective was to evaluate the prognostic power of novel biomarkers, incremental to the N-terminal portion of the natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in chronic HF. Concentrations of circulating NT-proBNP, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), galectin-3 (Gal-3), and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) were measured and related to all-cause long-term mortality. Of 209 patients (age 71 ± 10 years, 73% male patients, 97% New York Heart Association class III), 151 (72%) died during a median follow-up of 8.7 ± 1 year. The calculated area under the curve for NT-proBNP was 0.63, GDF-15 0.78, hs-CRP 0.66, Gal-3 0.68, and hs-TnT 0.68 (all p &lt;0.01). Each marker was predictive for mortality in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, elevated concentrations of GDF-15 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 178, p = 0.005), hs-CRP (HR 1.38, CI 1.15 to 1.67, p = 0.001), and hs-TnT (HR 1.27, CI 1.06 to 1.53, p = 0.008) were independently related to mortality. All novel markers had an incremental value to NT-proBNP, using the integrated discrimination improvement. In conclusion, in chronic HF, GDF-15, hs-CRP, and hs-TnT are independent prognostic markers, incremental to NT-proBNP, in predicting long-term mortality. In this study, GDF-15 is the most predictive marker, even stronger than NT-proBNP.

The paper discusses two benchmark cases to facilitate the study of compact thermal models for the purpose of component thermal characterization. The benchmarks represent idealised concepts of respectively a leaded package (PFQP-style) and an area-array package (BGA-style). Two different boundary conditions sets are included because both package types require such. The objective of the paper is to formulate a framework that can be used by everyone working in the field. In this way, comparison of results emerging from alternative approaches in defining compact models becomes much easier. The benchmarks are also prepared for the study of time-dependent compact models, but in this paper only steady state models are discussed. The paper also proposes a definition of Boundary-Condition-Independence and discusses a possible division of thermal characterization responsibilities between component manufacturers and their customers

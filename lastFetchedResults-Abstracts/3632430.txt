In this paper, a new method for low bit-rate content-adaptive mesh-based video coding is proposed. Intra-frame coding of this method employs feature map extraction for node distribution at specific threshold levels to achieve higher density placement of initial nodes for regions that contain high frequency features and conversely sparse placement of initial nodes for smooth regions. Insignificant nodes are largely removed using a subsequent node elimination scheme. The Hilbert scan is then applied before quantization and entropy coding to reduce amount of transmitted information. For moving images, both node position and color parameters of only a subset of nodes may change from frame to frame. It is sufficient to transmit only these changed parameters. The proposed method is well-suited for video coding at very low bit rates, as processing results demonstrate that it provides good subjective and objective image quality at a lower number of required bits.

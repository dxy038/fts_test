This paper presents a new way to formulate and solve the distribution system optimal reconfiguration problem. The system equations representing the network topology, power flow equation and objective function equation are transformed into an artificial dynamic model formulated by using only differential equations, on the basis of an error function defined into a Lyapunov space domain. Possible inequality constraints are handled by using additional slack variables to transform them into equality constraints. The solution of the optimal reconfiguration problem is obtained at the convergence of the artificial dynamics and is based on dynamic optimal power flow formulation. Starting from a time domain continuous problem, a mixed continuous integer solution in Lyapunov space domain is obtained. The results obtained on a test system are shown and discussed.

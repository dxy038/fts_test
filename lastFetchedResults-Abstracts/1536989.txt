This paper deals with the global analysis of a dynamical model for the spread of tuberculosis with a general contact rate. The model exhibits the traditional threshold behavior. We prove that when the basic reproduction ratio is less than unity, then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and when the basic reproduction ratio is great than unity, a unique endemic equilibrium exists and is globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions. The stability of equilibria is derived through the use of Lyapunov stability theory and LaSalleâ€™s invariant set theorem. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.

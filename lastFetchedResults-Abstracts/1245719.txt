Main objective of this study was to determine the interspecific relationships between two dominant species in terms of root distribution in a typical arid tree-herbage (Elaeagnus angustifolia–Achnatherum splendens) community at Xidatan, Pingluo County, Ningxia Autonomous Region, Northwest China. Eight concentric zones (namely, Z1–Z8) were set from the bases of E. angustifolia individuals to the open lands and five soil profiles were excavated in each zone. Each soil profile was divided into five layers at the depths of 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–100 cm and 100–150 cm. Roots were collected for each species, and soil water content (SWC) and soil bulk density (SBD) were measured for each layer. We found noteworthy roots layer separation in the sub-canopy zones (Z1–Z4). The soil layers with highest fine root biomass density (FRBD) of A. splendens was primarily in the 0–10 cm, which were significantly shallower than those of E. angustifolia; whereas in the inter-canopy zones (Z5–Z8), inconsistent separation, or even overlapping of highest-FRBD-layers emerged between the two dominant species. Correlation analyses showed that negative correlations of FRBD between the two species mainly occurred in those soil layers with relatively higher FRBD and lower SWC. In contrast, positive correlations corresponded with relatively lower FRBD and higher SWC.

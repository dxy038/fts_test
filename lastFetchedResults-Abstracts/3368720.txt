Ionization phenomena will continue to occur in a growing variety of critical situations in electric power systems, and some understanding of this area is therefore required in many power engineering positions. The inductive educational technique, in which basic principles are developed from study of specific examples, is presented as a favorable method for covering this material in modern electrical engineering curricula. To achieve this objective, a course is suggested which includes five interrelated parts: introduction of the several specific examples which will be treated, preliminary consideration of some underlying physical principles, intensive study of the examples, laboratory exercises, and term reports.

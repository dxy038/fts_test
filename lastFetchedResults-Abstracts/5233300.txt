The objective of this paper is to provide the middle school students and teachers with the adaptive mathematic e-learning study system by using Microsoft .NET framework technique, MathML plug-in and dynamic mathematical graph-maker which is the tool to analyze and construct the middle school mathematical dynamic graph-maker in order to help middle school students in better understanding and mastering of the combination of middle school mathematics equation and mathematical graphs. The entire system basically involves four components namely student learning model, teacher teaching model, test model, and system assessment model. The combination of the four components builds the overall middle school mathematic e-learning system.

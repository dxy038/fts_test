We consider the multi-objective optimization of a multi-service arrayed-waveguide grating-based single-hop metro WDM network with the two conflicting objectives of maximizing throughput while minimizing delay. We develop and evaluate a genetic algorithm based methodology for finding the optimal throughput-delay tradeoff curve, the so-called Pareto-optimal frontier. Our methodology provides the network architecture (hardware) and the medium access control (MAC) protocol parameters that achieve the Pareto-optima in a computationally efficient manner. The numerical results obtained with our methodology provide the Pareto-optimal network planning and operation solutions for a wide range of traffic scenarios. The presented methodology is applicable to other networks with a similar throughput-delay tradeoff.

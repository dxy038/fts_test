In liver tissue matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their specific inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs) play a pivotal role in both, fibrogenesis and fibrolysis. The current knowledge of the pathophysiology of liver fibrogenesis with special emphasis on MMPs and TIMPs is presented. A systematic literature search was conducted. All experimental models of liver fibrosis that evaluated a defined anti-fibrotic intervention in vivo or in vitro considering MMPs and TIMPs were selected. The methodological quality of all these publications has been critically appraised using an objective scoring system and the content has been summarized in a table.

To deal with the high complexity of the products and processes in the microdomain a design for microassembly (DF&#956;A) Methodology is introduced which aims to facilitate the efficient assembly of complex three-dimensional miniaturised devices. Currently neither the literature nor any of the common design for assembly (DFA) tools provide sufficient solutions for the microworld. The methodologyÂ´s objective is to enable an increased transfer of products from the research laboratory into industrial practice.

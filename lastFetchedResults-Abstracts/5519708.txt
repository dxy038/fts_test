The paper presents a proposal of a new multicast routing algorithm for finding a multicast tree in packet-switched networks. The objective of the MLRA (Multicast Routing Algorithm with Lagrange Relaxation) is to minimize the cost of paths between the source and each destination node using Lagrange relaxation, and eventually, minimize the total cost of multicast tree. A wide range of simulation experiments carried out by the authors for many network topologies and parameters confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

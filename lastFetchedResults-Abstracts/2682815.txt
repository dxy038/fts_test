Background and Aim: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common disorder that can cause various conflicts in the central nervous system (CNS). One of the important abilities of the CNS is the temporal processing. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of temporal processing in patients with T1D and normal subjects using the gap in noise (GIN) test.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 25 T1D patients aged 20 to 30 years old and 25 normal subjects in the same age range were selected through available sampling method and were evaluated by gap in noise test. The level of HbA1c shows how the quality of metabolic control of diabetes has changed over the past 2 to 3 months. The relationship between the approximate threshold (ATh) values and the percent correct answers to the GIN test with HbA1c was investigated.
Results: Both ATh and percent correct responses were significantly different between patients with T1D and normal subjects in both ears and in both sexes (p < 0.05). Moreover, the results showed a significant correlation between HbA1c with ATh and the percent correct responses. Also, there was no significant correlation between the duration of the disease with the ATh and the percent correct responses to GIN test.
Conclusion: Patients with TID have a weaker outcome than their normal counterparts during the GIN test. These results may indicate a defect in the ability to temporal processing in these subjects.

Distributed generation (DG) has an important role in power distribution system planning because of its modularity, small size and low investment cost. Due to environmental concerns, interests to use renewable energy as primary resource of distributed generation have been increased. Reliability improvement, operational cost reduction and power loss decreasing are some of the main benefits of DG allocation in distribution systems. In this paper, a probabilistic method for optimal sitting and sizing of renewable energy based DG in distribution systems is presented. The proposed approach is based on multi-objective model including installation and operation costs of DG, cost of power losses and cost of unsupplied load. Time variation of load and uncertainty in load forecasting also are considered in the proposed approach.

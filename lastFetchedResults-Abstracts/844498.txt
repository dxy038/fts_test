In this paper, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium point for delayed
Cohenâ€“Grossberg bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with impulses,
based on nonsmooth analysis method. And we give the criteria of global exponential stability
of the unique equilibrium point for the delayed BAM neural networks with impulses
using Lyapunov method. The new sufficient condition generalizes and improves the previously
known results. Finally, we present examples to illustrate that our results are
effective.

Based on the strategic management theory, BSC and the budget management theory, this paper attempts to design a mode of enterprise strategic budget management. Comprehensive analysis reveals that the substantial differences between the BSC-based mode strategic budget management and the traditional budget management mode lie in budgeting and implementation. With the help of BSC, strategies can be gradually converted into practicable enterprise budget; therefore, BSC-based mode of enterprise strategic budget management is of both theoretical and practical significance. In the implementation procedure, enterprises can employ BSC to depict corporate strategies, namely to covert strategies to strategic map, and clarify strategic stage objectives. Besides, enterprises can set flexible objective for each strategy, clarify strategic guiding plan and resource demand, authorize human and financial resources as well as incorporate these settings into the budget to form a detailed budget sheet".

The INTEGRATION simulation model is being enhanced and applied at QueenÂ´s University, on behalf of General Motors Research Labs, as a tool to perform a dynamic traffic simulation study of the TravTek route guidance experiment in Orlando, Florida. While there were several different ways in which the INTEGRATION model itself was adapted, to be able to model the dynamic and route guidance features of the TravTek system, this paper focusses specifically on describing the associated dynamic modelling routines which needed to be modified and/or developed in order to generate the dynamic inputs to the INTEGRATION model. The objective of this paper is to describe the need and role of these supporting routines and to illustrate that the quality of the TravTek simulation study results are ultimately highly dependent on the capability of the supporting routines to properly generate the extensive dynamic input data that are required to properly utilize dynamic traffic simulation models such as INTEGRATION.

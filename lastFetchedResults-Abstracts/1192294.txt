When algorithms solve dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems (DMOOPs), performance measures are required to quantify the performance of the algorithm and to compare one algorithmâ€™s performance against that of other algorithms. However, for dynamic multi-objective optimisation (DMOO) there are no standard performance measures. This article provides an overview of the performance measures that have been used so far. In addition, issues with performance measures that are currently being used in the DMOO literature are highlighted.

Objective speech quality measures are very important for evaluating speech codecs and VoIP systems. Recent speech quality measures are based on psychoacoustic facts. In this paper we incorporate ideas from auditory scene analysis in the computation of speech quality measure. Specifically, use notions of harmonicity, dynamics, and onset times. Both relative and absolute metrics are proposed.

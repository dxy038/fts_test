We investigate optimal call admission control (CAC) policy for multicast streaming services (MSS) in 3rd generation (3G) and beyond wireless mobile networks. Several MSS sessions are supported simultaneously in a bandwidth-limited network. Active sessions are those that are currently serving some users, and inactive sessions are those that are currently not serving any users. An admission decision in MSS is required only when an inactive session is requested, unlike in unicasting. For this reason, if a user request for an inactive MSS session arrives, we should make an admission decision in anticipation of (i) the possible reward earned based on users served during a session active time generated by accepting it, and (ii) the influence of the session active time upon the future status of network bandwidth and admission decisions. Our objective is to determine when to admit or block a user asking an inactive MSS session to achieve the optimality in rewards. We formulate this problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP), and a value iteration algorithm is used to obtain an optimal stationary deterministic policy. We also derive the user blocking probability of the optimal policy by analyzing an embedded Markov chain induced by it.

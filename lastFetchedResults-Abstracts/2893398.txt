Rice planthopper is the main destructive and long-distance migratory insect pest of rice in Asia and is becoming a threat to the grain yield and food security of China. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is potentially useful for regional and national mapping of planthopper damage due to its advantage of moderate spatial resolution and high revisited periods. Our primary objective of this study was to estimate the historical magnitude of rice planthopper damage to the rice plant in Yangtze River Delta region during 2005-2007 by using MODIS imageries. In this study, the MODIS 8-day composite surface reflectance product with 500 m spatial resolution was used to extract potential rice planting area in Yangtze River Delta region in China. Annual spatial distribution of single, early and late rice planting regions in the period of 2004-2012 were mapped using MODIS data based on the analysis of time series MODIS data of different typical land cover types in the study region. NDVI was chose as the best indicator to detect the damage degree of rice planthopper by analyzing the seasonal variation of NDVI derived from MODIS 500 m reflectance data corresponding to amount of rice planthopper per 100 hills of rice in the typical fields in the study area. Pixels that depart significantly from the long-term mean NDVI were flagged as potential area infected by rice planthopper. According to the standard deviation, there were three different degrees of severity of rice planthopper, including light, moderate and severe damage. The dynamic spatial distribution of rice planthopper hazard in the optimal bio-window for rice planthopper in Yangtze River Delta region during 2005-2007 were mapped and analyzed. The results indicated that the time series NDVI was a useful tool for monitoring land cover/use change detection and providing near real time damage maps for government to make decision and evaluate grain losses.

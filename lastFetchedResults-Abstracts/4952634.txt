We present an algorithm for analyzing the human body 3-D motion of golf swing from single-camera video sequences. As the first step, the human body used for the analysis is automatically extracted using a video object segmentation technique. Once human body is extracted, this two-dimensional information is utilized to obtain a three-dimensional body model consisting of head, upper arms, lower arms, body trunk, upper legs, lower legs and feet using an iterative 3-D fitting algorithm and dynamic Bayesian networks. The ultimate objective of the system is to obtain the 3-D motion information for golf swinging and comparing this information for different players regardless of the great variability caused by different camera viewing perspectives. 3-D body motion during the golf swing is computed for all segments of the body. This system will allow the spatial-temporal relationship of each body segment, as they make their transition, be thoroughly studied, and enable the parameters for different players to be compared, as well

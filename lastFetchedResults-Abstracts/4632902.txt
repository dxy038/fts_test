We present a class of new parallel algorithms for solving large sparse linear systems with special structure on distributed memory multiprocessor systems such as PC clusters. The objective of these algorithms is to reduce the communication between processors so that they could be efficiently implemented. These algorithms are implemented on a cluster of PCs. The experiment results are presented and discussed.

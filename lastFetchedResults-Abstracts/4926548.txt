A passive filter often becomes a key component in radio frequency (RF) receivers. Analytical component modeling of passive filter suitable for RF front-end applications is dealt with. This analytical analysis has been used to calibrate the optimal values of passive components in order to obtain the maximum image rejection. In this paper, the formula of calculating the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix is presented. Based on this formula, the optimization for the objective function in the problem of lossy filter design is derived and then the circuit optimization technique is extended into with the composing optimization algorithms suitable. The flexibility and effectiveness of this technique to passive filter design is proved with examples given.

Objective: To compare in-hospital left ventricular function in patients with unsuccessful and successful thrombolysis presenting with acute myocardial infarction treated with streptokinase. Methodology: This comparative study was conducted at department of Cardiology, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, from October 2006 to October 2007. Two hundred patients with first acute myocardial infarction were divided into two groups: group A (successful thrombolysis) and group B (unsuccessful thrombolysis), using ECG criteria. To determine Left Ventricular Function, 2-D Echo was used. Results: Group A included 136 (68%) patients and group B included 64 (32%) patients. Impaired left ventricular function was found in 41 (30.1%) patients in group A and 41 (64.1%) patients in group B (p< 0.001). Left ventricular failure was present in 31 (22.8%) patients of group A and 30 (46.9%) patients of group B (p=0.001). Cardiogenic shock was diagnosed in 2 (1.5%) patients in group A and 6 (9.4%) patients in group B (p=0.008). Conclusion: Presence of LVF is strongly associated with unsuccessful thrombolytic therapy in this group of patients.

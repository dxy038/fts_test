The objective of this study is to relate textural and surface characteristics of selected microporous activated carbons to their methane storage
capacity. In this work, a magnetic suspension balance (Rubotherm, Germany) was used to measure methane adsorption isotherms of several
activated carbon samples. Textural characteristics were assessed by nitrogen adsorption on a regular surface area analyzer (Autosorb-MP, by
Quantachrome, USA). N2 adsorption was analysed by conventional models (BET, DR, HK) and by Monte Carlo molecular simulations. Elemental
and surface analyses were performed by X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS) for the selected samples. A comparative analysis was then
carried out with the purpose of defining some correlation among the variables under study. For the system under study, pore size distribution and
micropore volume seem to be a determining factor as long as the solid surface is perfectly hydrophobic. It was concluded that the textural
parameters per se do not unequivocally determine natural gas storage capacities. Surface chemistry and methane adsorption equilibria must be
taken into account in the decision-making process of choosing an adsorbent for gas storage.

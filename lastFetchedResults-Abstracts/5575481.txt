One of the main items on the eHealth agenda of the European Community is the design and promotion of electronic patient summaries as an instrument to facilitate the pervasive delivery of healthcare, thus ensuring the right to patient mobility and increasing the productivity and quality of health service delivery. From a technical point of view this objective requires middleware technology which is able to cope with the stringent interoperability, multi-lingualism, security and privacy requirements arising in eHealth settings. In this paper we present triplespace computing, a coordination middleware for the semantic Web and demonstrate its relevance to the realization of the European patient summary infrastructure.

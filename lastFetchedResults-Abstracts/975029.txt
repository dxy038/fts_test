Background and Objective: An imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant defense system components can lead to oxidative stress. Resvin is a plant derived antioxidant that can reduce the production of free radicals. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of one period of Resvin supplement consumption on the total serum antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase and creatine kinase in elite women volleyball players.
Materials and Methods: This study was an experimental trial in which 20 subjects were divided into two groups of supplementation with Resvin and placebo (lactose). Resvin supplementation was done following a stage of specific exercises. The trial group received Resvin in the form of a 400mg capsule in a single period after lunch. The control group also received the placebo in the form of a 400mg capsule in a single dose after lunch. A blood test was taken from all subjects prior to the study. Then, a second blood test was taken from both groups of Resvin and placebo supplement consumption 24 hours after the first test. 
Results: The results indicated that Resvin supplement consumption led to a meaningful increase in total antioxidant capacity and a decrease in creatine kinase in elite women volleyball players (P < 0/05).
Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, it can be concluded that Resvin supplement consumption while improving antioxidant indicators can prevent subsequent muscle damages and may simultaneously enhance recovery.

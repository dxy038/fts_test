A practical means of constructing select mortality tables is described. It involves the graduation of the ultimate experience coupled with the modelling of the log crude mortality ratios for individual select experiences relative to the ultimate experience. The methodology is formulated within the generalised linear and non-linear modelling framework. The method is illustrated with reference to the UK assured lives' experience. An objective comparison with other methods is made.

Current follow-up and outcome studies of Legg Calvé Perthes disease (LCPD) are based on subjective measures of function, clinical parameters and radiological changes [Herring JA, Kim HT, Browne RH. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. Part II: prospective multicenter study of the effect of treatment on outcome. J Bone Joint Surg 2004;86A:2121–34; Aksoy MC, Cankus MC, Alanay A, Yazici M, Caglar O, Alpaslan AM. Radiological outcome of proximal femoral varus osteotomy for the treatment of lateral pillar group-C. J Pediatr Orthop 2005;14 B:88–91; Kitakoji T, Hattori T, Kitoh H, Katho M, Ishiguro N.

Salter innominate osteotomy in the treatment of severe Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease: clinical and radiographic results in 32 patients (37 hips) at skeletal maturity. J Pediatr Orthop 2004;24:257–64.]. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frontal plane kinematics and the effect on hip joint loading on the affected side in children with a radiographic diagnosis of LCPD.

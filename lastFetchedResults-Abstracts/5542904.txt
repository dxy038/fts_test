Being sustainable is now a source of competitive advantage and a question of survival for the supply chains. Indeed, several researches were conducted about this topic by covering several aspects such as the design of the supply chains, their optimization and the evaluation of their performance. However, concerning the performance evaluation of the sustainable supply chain, the models suggested are generally limited to some indicators of performance. In this regard, the objective of this article consists in presenting a framework for the economic, environmental and social performance evaluation within the supply chain. To this end, we proposed a model of performance evaluation of the supply chains relying on indicators which reflect the three dimensions of sustainable development. Then we resorted to the PROMETHEE method which allowed us to attain a ranking of some best practices of the supply chain management based on the simultaneous improvement, and according to various strategies, of the economic, environmental and social performances. This research enabled us to identify the best practices to be implemented to obtain sustainable supply chains.

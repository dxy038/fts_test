Mesoscale eddies are frequently observed in the Greenland and Barents SeasÂ´ marginal ice zone (MIZ). The objective of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that acoustic hotspots along the ice-edge region are due to mesoscale eddy currents interacting with the broken-up ice floes in the MIZ. To test this hypothesis, ambient-noise case studies were carried out during the MIZEX 85-87 and SIZEX 89 field experiments. In each experiment, ice-edge eddies were localized visually from aircraft and by use of satellite remote-sensing data obtained in near real time. Sonobuoys were, thereafter, deployed by fix-wing aircraft and helicopters in selected eddy areas. Ambient-noise data, recorded over several hours by aircraft, were analyzed estimating averaged ambient-noise levels at four selected frequencies: 40, 100, 315, and 1000 Hz. The analysis showed high mean levels and large gradients in ambient noise near ice-edge eddies and during strong wind and wave forcing against the ice edge. The conclusion of this study is that mapping of the ice edge and localization of mesoscale ocean processes using remote sensing from space will provide important input to ambient-noise prediction in the MIZ.

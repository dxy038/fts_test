 Introduction Hydatid cyst is a zoonotic disease, affecting humans
                            and other mammals worldwide. It is caused by tapeworms of the genus
                            <i>Echinococcus</i>, which is most frequently encountered in
                            the liver and lungs. Although involvement of the central nervous system
                            and spine is rare, it can lead to severe neurological deficits due to
                            direct compression. Case Presentation We report a case of intradural
                            extramedullary hydatid cyst in the lumbar region with a sudden onset,
                            causing progressive paraplegia and areflexia over the past 20 days.
                            After surgical removal, the cyst was sent for histopathological
                            examination. The results showed inner laminated membranes and an outer
                            fibrous layer, surrounded by foreign-body giant cells. The primary
                            objective during surgery was to avoid perforation of the cyst, thereby
                            reducing the risk of systemic dissemination and local seeding of the
                            parasite. During the postoperative period, there was a steady
                            improvement in the neurological deficit, and the patient was discharged
                            with anthelmintics to prevent any distant dissemination. Conclusions An
                            accurate and precise diagnosis is necessary when dealing with cystic
                            pathologies.

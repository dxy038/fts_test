This paper presents a wireless power transmission system with a new protocol and connection establishment based on Amplitude-Shift keying (ASK). A simplified equivalent circuit modeling for wireless power transmission system is established. Theoretical analysis shows that the transmission distance where output voltage reaches the maximum between transmitter and receiver under the resonant frequency of 6.85MHz is calculated. The simulation results are consistent with the theoretical analysis. Methods to optimize the circuit design about the maximum transmission power are discussed. A protocol based on Amplitude-Shift keying has been introduced to realize the bidirectional communication of the system.

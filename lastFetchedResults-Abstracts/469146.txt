Objective
The aims of our study were to determine the basal platelet activation state in women with preeclampsia compared with normotensive pregnant women and nonpregnant women and to investigate the platelet reactivity on in vitro stimulation with adenosine diphosphate or thrombin receptor activation peptide.
Study design
Platelet expression of CD61 (fibrinogen receptor), CD42a (von Willebrand factor receptor), CD62P (P-selectin), CD63 (Glycoprotein 53), and PAC-1 binding (activated fibrinogen receptor) were determined in 20 pairs of women with preeclampsia/normotensive pregnant women and in 12 nonpregnant women, with the use of flow cytometry.
Results
Basal platelet expression of CD61, CD42a and CD62P, and adenosine diphosphateâ€“stimulated CD62P expression were increased in women with preeclampsia compared with normotensive pregnant women. Platelets from women with preeclampsia and normotensive pregnant women differed from platelets from nonpregnant women by expressing higher basal CD63 levels and being more responsive to in vitro agonist stimulation, which was demonstrated by increased expression of CD61, CD62P, and CD63.
Conclusion
This study supports the notion that platelets are important in the pathophysiologic condition of preeclampsia.

A rolling-horizon approach was proposed, which aims at the problem of berth allocation and quay crane assignment. Then a dynamic allocation model using objective programming was initially developed for berths allocation and quay crane assignment, which more closes realistic as result of basing continuum quayside. The model objective function was subject to the minimization of the total berthing location deviation, the total penalty and the energy consumption of quay cranes. Then, a hybrid parallel genetic algorithm (HPGA) was employed for solving the model, which combines parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) and heuristic Algorithm. Furthermore, a simulation model integrating HPGA was developed for evaluating this HPGA and executing gene repair techniques to repair the unfeasible individuals generated by HPGA. Finally, case study on a specific container terminal was used for system illustration, and then verified the validity and usefulness of this model and algorithm.

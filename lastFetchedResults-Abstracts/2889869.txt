The proposed paper presents a Hybrid AC-DC microgrid to chop the process of multiple conversions in an individual AC microgrid or DC microgrid. The proposed hybrid microgrid compose of both AC microgrid and DC microgrid connected together by multilevel inverter. This paper concentrates on developing a control system for the hybrid AC-DC microgrid to manage power flows, which is more difficult than previously developed systems only for AC microgrid or DC microgrid. The objective is then to makeup a co-ordinated control system for power sharing within the sources in the hybrid AC-DC microgrid in proportion to the power ratings. The droop control technique is presented in this paper to control the hybrid microgrid. The droop control concept uses a suitable normalization technique for combining both the subgrids. The co-ordinated operation of DC and AC sources and multilevel inverter are investigated. Analysis of power sharing on hybrid AC-DC microgrid is done using MATLAB/SIMULINK.

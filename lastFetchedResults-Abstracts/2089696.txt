A novel fractional order (FO) fuzzy Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller has been proposed in this paper which works on the closed loop error and its fractional derivative as the input and has a fractional integrator in its output. The fractional order differ-integrations in the proposed fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are kept as design variables along with the input–output scaling factors (SF) and are optimized with Genetic Algorithm (GA) while minimizing several integral error indices along with the control signal as the objective function. Simulations studies are carried out to control a delayed nonlinear process and an open loop unstable process with time delay. The closed loop performances and controller efforts in each case are compared with conventional PID, fuzzy PID and PIλDμ controller subjected to different integral performance indices. Simulation results show that the proposed fractional order fuzzy PID controller outperforms the others in most cases.

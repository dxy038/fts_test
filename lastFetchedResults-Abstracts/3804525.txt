This paper presents the essential elements for developing objective methods of assessment of the performance of time-frequency signal analysis techniques. We define a measure for assessing the resolution performance of time-frequency distributions (TFDs) in separating closely spaced components in the time-frequency domain. The measure takes into account key attributes of TFDs, such as components mainlobes and sidelobes and cross-terms. The introduction of this measure allows to quantify the quality of TFDs instead of relying solely on visual inspection of their plots. The method of assessment of performance of TFDs also allows the improvement of methodologies for designing high-resolution quadratic TFDs for time-frequency analysis of multicomponent signals. Different TFDs, including the modified B distribution, are optimized using this methodology. Examples of a performance comparison of quadratic TFDs in resolving closely spaced components in the time-frequency domain, using the proposed resolution measure, are provided.

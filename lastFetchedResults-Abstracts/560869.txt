Background and Objective: Cardiorespiratory endurance and resting heart rate is the proper guide for cardiorespiratory fitness of people. The aim of this research was to survey the effect of training intensity and volume changes on cardiorespiratory endurance and resting heart rate.

Materials and Methods: Forty-five non-athletic healthy B. Sc male students (with an average age of 25±1/87 years, weight 71±1/95 kg and height 175±2/30 cm) were randomly divided into three groups including: 1G, 2G and 3G groups. In first six weeks, 1G (n=15) run for 15 min with an intensity of 70% maximum reserve heart rate (MRHR), 1day/week; 2G (n=15) (at 15 min, 60% MRHR, 2 days/week); and 3G (n=15) (at 15 min, 50% MRHR, 3days/week) for 8 weeks. At the last two weeks, 1G run at 75% MRHR, 2G at 65% MRHR, and 3G at 55% MRHR.

Results: Findings showed that there was a significant difference in vo2max change in 1G and 3G groups. Also, 3G showed a more significant reduction in resting heart rate than 1G.

Conclusion: Based on these findings, it seems that aerobic training with low intensity and long period has more effects on cardiorespiratory fitness and resting heart rate than high intensity and short period training.

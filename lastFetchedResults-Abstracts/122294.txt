Objective: The liver is the key organ of the metabolic, secreatory and excretory functions in the body and, accordingly, its disorders are numerous and varied. In folk remedies the plant Fumaria parvflora Lam is used for liver diseases. In this study, protective effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Fumaria parvflora L was determined on isolated rat hepatocytes to develop new remedies with liver protective effects.
Material and Methods: After isolating hepatocytes by collagenase, several concentrations of ethanolic extracts were added to the suspension of freshly isolated rat hepatocytes incubated in Krebs-Henscleit buffer under a flow of 95% 02 and 5% CO2i 20-minutes before the addition of 10 mM of CC14. Then the percentage of cell death was investigated after 0.5, 1, 2, 3 hours by Trypan Blue Exclusion test.
Results: The extract with concentrations of 0.7 to 4.2 mg/ml protected the cells against CC14-induced cytotoxicity, but concentrations of 7 mg/ml and higher increased the CCI4-induced cytotoxicity.
Conclusion: The results of the present study support the traditional beliefs on hepatoprotective effects of Fumaria parviflora, however; high concentrations were hepatotoxic.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis D virus is a defective RNA containing virus that only infects human in the presence of HBV either as a coinfection or as superinfection in HBV carriers. Hepatitis D may accelerate the progress of chronic HBV infection to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. More than 3% of population in our country is chronic HBV carriers. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anti HDV in asymptomatic HBV carriers in Babol.
METHODS: This prospective study was performed on all HBV carriers who were diagnosed by Babol blood bank center and also their infected family members during 2000-2002. In all cases, anti HDV were assayed by Elisa. Proportions were compared by T-test, Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.
FINDINGS: From 546 cases of HBV carriers, 319 (58.4%) were male and 227 (41.6%) were female. 489 (89.6%) cases of anti Hbe+ (mean age±SD; 32.13±11.9 years) and 57(10.4%) cases of HbeAg+ (mean age±SD; 23.7±11.24 years) were studied. Anti HDV was positive in 6 (1.9%) of males and 5(2.2%) of females (p= 0.769). Anti HDV was positive in 7(1.4%) cases of Anti Hbe+ and 4(7%) of HbeAg+ cases (p=0.02). In total, the prevalence of anti HDV was 2% in all patients.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that HDV is endemic in our area and its prevalence is higher in HbeAg+ cases. The study of prevalence of anti HDV in high-risk groups is recommended.

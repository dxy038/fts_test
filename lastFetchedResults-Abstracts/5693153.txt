UnderWater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UW-ASNs) are experiencing a rapid growth, due to their high relevance to commercial and military applications such as oceanographic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster prevention, and tactical surveillance. However, the design of efficient communication protocols for underwater sensor networks is still an open research problem due to the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic communication channel such as limited bandwidth, high and variable propagation delays, and significant multipath and scattering. In this paper, we consider multimedia underwater monitoring applications with heterogeneous traffic demands in terms of bandwidth and end-to-end reliability. Distributed routing algorithms are introduced for delay-insensitive and delay-sensitive applications, with the objective of reducing the energy consumption by i) leveraging the tradeoff between multiplexing and diversity gain that characterizes MIMO links, and ii) allocating transmit power on suitable subcarriers according to channel conditions and application requirements. To achieve the objective above, each node jointly i) selects its next hop, ii) chooses a suitable transmission mode, and iii) assigns optimal transmit power on different subcarriers to achieve a target level of Quality of Service (QoS) in a cross-layer fashion. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed protocol is adaptive to the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic communication channel, and achieves excellent performance through local cooperations between transmitter and receiver.

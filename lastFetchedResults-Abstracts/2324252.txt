This research's question is about Islam's strategies to contribute and facilitate relations with the non-Muslims. By Islam, we mean the Quran and Sunna, and in some cases we have referred to Imam Ali's approach. Pragmatic strategies are the ones which are objective and practical and play a significant role in facilitating the relations between Muslim and non-Muslims and can lift the impediments. These strategies are discussed under three categories centering around negotiations and dialog, agreement, and implementation.

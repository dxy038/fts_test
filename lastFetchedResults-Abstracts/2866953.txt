The main Objective is to suppressed Ground bounce noise in ultra wide band (UWB). A modified uniplanar compact EBG (Electro magnetic band-gap) structure which integrates meandered Bridges replace with meandered lines to improve inductance effect in the existing Uniplanar Compact (UC-EBG). The lower frequency of band gap depends on inductance of the EBG structure. If the Inductance increases, then the F<sub>L</sub>(lower) frequency decreases to obtain wide bandgap. An improvement in the band gap is observed over 450 Mhz to 10 Ghz, simulation results is carried out by CST microwave studio.

The problem of accessing some coordinates from others in the case of an accident is not trivial. Congestion due to the current state of traffic or certain traffic signal states, frequently delays emergency services in their objective to arrive at the scene of the incident in the shortest time frame possible. The aim of this paper is to provide an introduction to this subject, and introduce a technique which applies the use of intelligent agents. A prototype implementation is under development. Preliminary results of the application of a memetic algorithm for calculation of routes used by agents are promising.

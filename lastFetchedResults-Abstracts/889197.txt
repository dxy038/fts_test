Background: Nurses experience stress of conscience when they are not satisfied by providing care to patients. Nurse dissatisfaction may be due to duties that are dictated by him/herself and others (patients, managers and organization). 
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate nurses’ experiences of the factors lead to commit unconscionable acts.
Methods: This phenomenological descriptive study was performed on 9 nurses who worked at Kermanshah educational centers. Unstructured interviews were tape-recorded and later transcribed. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi’s method. 
Findings: By analyzing the data from the interviews four themes emerged including organizational factors (management and equipment), factors related to conditions (exhaustion, work overload and time limits), individual factors (individuals' characteristics and inexperience) and human factors (inappropriate nurse to patient ratio).
Conclusion: Organizational, individual and human factors and factors related to conditions can lead to commit acts inconsistent with conscience in nurses. So while considering solutions to solve or reduce these factors, further specific studies is needed in specialized wards and hospitals.

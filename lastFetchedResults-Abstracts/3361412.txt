The paper aims at describing the nature of numerical models used in EMC studies and their inherent assumptions and limitations. The ultimate objective is to elucidate the manner in which, together with measurements, they can be used to get a better understanding of EMC phenomena and assist in the design of EMC compliant systems. The general more formal aspects of numerical modeling were addressed in Part I. In Part II we focus on more detailed technical aspects and the importance of exploiting synergies between modeling and testing.

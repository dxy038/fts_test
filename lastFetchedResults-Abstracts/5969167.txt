Disciplinary construction assessment is a means to promote the development of the disciplines, and also it is an important basis to manage the disciplines scientifically. The assessment index system of disciplinary construction for teaching-oriented universities was built. The principle of maximum agreeable distinction was proposed. The objective weight calculating model was established based on the principle and using merely the assessment data itself. The subjective weight of each index was calculated by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The subjective weight was combined with the objective weight and thus the synthetic weight of each index was confirmed. Then the disciplinary construction assessment model based on synthetic weight and TOPSIS was built. An example is shown to highlight the procedure of the proposed model. The results of the example show that the proposed model is effective for the disciplinary construction assessment of teaching-oriented universities.

Started in June 2010, the TanDEM-X satellite joined the TerraSAR-X satellite in space to perform the conjoint interferometric TanDEM-X mission to acquire a truly global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of unprecedented accuracy [1]. Since the very first interferometric acquisitions, the Integrated TanDEM-X Processor (ITP) delivered operationally &#8220;Raw&#8221;-DEMs and complex products of mono- and bistatic data. The RawDEMs are scenes of about 50 km &#215; 30 km, generated for a dedicated DEM Mosaicking and Calibration Processor (MCP) which produces the final DEM. The so-called Coregistered Single-look Slant-range Complex (CoSSC) products are provided for each of these scenes in different flavors for production internal purposes and system performance monitoring as well as for scientific use. The capabilities of the ITP go far beyond the primary mission objective of DEM generation alone: it also provides the operationally available end-user products from different experimental modes as e.g. pursuit monostatic, dual polarization bistatic data, alternating bistatic in single and dual polarization and different bistatic and alternating bistatic spotlight modes. This paper focuses on the accuracy of the generated products, the ITPs contribution to the achieved accuracy of the data and the direct effect of it on the use and interpretation of RawDEM heights for temporal change detection. Also the basic characteristics of the operational experimental products are introduced..

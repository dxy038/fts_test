Network survivability has been a crucial concern in wavelength-routed WDM networks. Due to the huge transmission capacity, a single network failure may cause a large amount of data loss, which would greatly degrade and even disrupt network services. In the paper, a destination initiating path restoration protocol is proposed for surviving single-link failures in wavelength routed WDM networks. Unlike existing path restoration protocols, the proposed protocol allows the destination node of a broken connection to initiate a connection restoration process. The objective is to reduce the connection restoration time so that a backup path can be provisioned rapidly for each broken connection that traverses a failed link. The major procedures of the protocol are described and its performance in terms of the connection restoration time is evaluated

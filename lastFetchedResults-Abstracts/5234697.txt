The first satellite of the Brazilian Full Space-Mission will host a solar cell experiment (SCE) whose objective is to qualify the solar cells developed at the University of Sao Paulo. The solar cell array consists of six p-n junction single-crystal silicon, 10-&#937;-cm, n-type phosphorus-doped substrate, 2&#215;2 cm<sup>2</sup> area cells. The development of the SCE is described together with the mathematical procedures used for the determination of the <e1>I</e1>-<e1>V</e1> curve output parameters. This novel method is based on the numerical fit of the voltage versus temperatures curve of the SCE cells as telemetered by the satellite. A laboratory simulation of the electrical behavior of the SCE has shown that the analytical method is excellent for the interpretation of the telemetered SCE signal. The parameters obtained from the <e1>V</e1>-<e1>T</e1> curves match satisfactorily the <e1>I</e1>-<e1>V</e1> curve parameters obtained by direct measurements. The results demonstrate that a low-cost experiment which uses passive electric circuits can be used to obtain the complete <e1>I</e1>-<e1>V </e1> solar cell curves during the satellite mission lifetime

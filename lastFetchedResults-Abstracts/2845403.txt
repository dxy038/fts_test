Planning and operation of power systems with large amounts of wind power is a challenging topic in nowadays power system researches. These studies assess the impact of wind power´s variability and uncertainty on power system. Wind power uncertainty has some characteristics such as interdependent uncertainty between adjacent regions. This paper evaluates the effect of wind power´s uncertainty and its interdependent characteristic between adjacent regions on cross-border lines investment in multi-region transmission systems. Transmission planners are the responsible bodies in each region and maximise their own region social welfare considering the transmission planning decisions of other transmission planners. In order to accomplish this task, the model developed in [1] for non-cooperative transmission planning and uncertainty modeling is used with some modifications according to the objective of this paper. The approach is simulated on a 9-bus network consisting of three inter-connected transmission systems for two cases of (1) independent uncertainty between wind resources and (2) complete interdependent uncertainty between wind resources.

The error concealment (EC) technology attempt to recover the lost blocks by utilizing correlation block information (spatial or temporal). This paper introduces an adaptive spatial EC algorithm selection framework for block-based image/video coding systems. By using surrounding blocks information, fuzzy classifier can adaptively select the suitable EC method for each damaged block, and fuzzy rule are obtained from the labeled training image data. Our experimental results show that the proposed EC selection strategy obtains better subjective and objective quality.

Thirty-four therapeutic temporomandibular arthroscopies were done during a 24-month period for patients with debilitating joint disorders (mainly disc displacements with or without reduction) who had not responded to non-invasive treatment. Lysis and lavage with prediscal section and retrodiscal coagulation were the techniques used. Analysis of the results indicated subjective improvement of pain in 71% of cases, noise in 78%, jaw opening in 88% and diet in 97% and objective evidence of disappearance of noise in 29% and improvement of jaw opening in 94% (mean 9.24 mm). In jaw opening, improvement was highly significant, compared with the preoperative results, P < 0.01. We conclude that temporomandibular arthroscopy is safe and indicated in disc displacements and joint luxation if medical treatment has failed.

[emim]PF<sub>6</sub>(emim=1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium), [emim]BF<sub>4</sub>, [emim]HSO<sub>4</sub> and corresponding PtB ionic liquid systems were synthesized from [emim]Br, respectively. The results of infrared spectrometry, HPLC and <sup>1</sup>HNMR show that the products are objective ionic liquids. TEM of the prepared nanometer PtB in [emim]PF<sub>6</sub> exhibits a uniform particle size of 10 nm. The methylcyclohexane (MCH) dehydrogenation reactions were processed at the normal pressure, and in the temperature range of 240~300&#176;C with the mass ratio of methylcyclohexane to PtB ionic liquid 100:1. The results show that [emim]PF<sub>6</sub>-PtB exhibit excellent dehydrogenation performance.

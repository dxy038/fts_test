In this paper, a new superstructure for heat integration of an eco-industrial park is proposed. Intra and inter-plant heat exchange for the process streams is allowed. For a proper reuse of the waste heat at low temperature, a set of organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) can be integrated inside the eco-industrial park. This way, the proposed superstructure allows proper heat integration to reduce the use of external cooling and heating utilities as well as the consumption of external electric energy. The proposed superstructure is modeled through a mathematical programming formulation where the objective function considers the simultaneous minimization of the operating and capital costs for the units involved in the system as well the possible revenues from the sales of electricity. The model is formulated in such a way that avoids numerical complications during its solution. Results from the application of the proposed approach show that the interplant-integration offers significant savings compared to the traditional single-plant integration with and without considering ORCs.

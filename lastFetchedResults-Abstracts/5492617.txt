Learning objects have arisen in response to the need of high-quality and reusable instructional materials. The repositories that hold learning objects allow educators to create and share their instructional contents in an organized infrastructure and where information should be easily searchable. Therefore, a key point of these repositories is the way learning objects are categorized. In this paper, we present an approach for classifying semantically learning objects whose metadata are described in Dublin Core. Specifically, our objective is to annotate automatically the subject of the learning object with instances of the DBpedia ontology, that is, to annotate the learning objects repository with linked open data. The syntactic and semantic analysis of the learning object will drive the selection of the most appropriate categories in the linked data repository.

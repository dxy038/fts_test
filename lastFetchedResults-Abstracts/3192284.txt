Energy System Problem represents variety of commonly used energy systems in buildings, cars or even small-scale power grid networks. In this paper, we formulate a set of useful Energy System Problems using linear and mixed integer programming. The objective is to minimize total cost of energy system while satisfying operational constraints such as, energy generation capacity, saving capacity and users demands. This model is completely flexible to changes in demand and energy price over time. The efficiency of energy systems using data envelopment analysis is also presented. Numerical examples are also shown for presented models.

We have applied a multiobjective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) based on a vector immune system (VIS) algorithm to determine the optimal sequence of parallel cables in a multiconductor three-phase system. We build the objective function in a way that minimizes the magnetic stray field and the current unbalance of a bunch of rectilinear power cables. Our principal aim is to extend and verify the ability of the VIS algorithm to solve combinatorial problems represented by nonlinear objectives that are not usually solved in MOCO problems.

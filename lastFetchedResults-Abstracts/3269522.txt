This paper looks at DC to DC conversion for high power applications. After having briefly reviewed the domain, a resonant bidirectional DC/DC converter already suggested in the literature is closely studied using a novel mode of operation, dubbed Alternate Discontinuous Mode. This operating mode alternates the two halves of the converter in such a way that the two DC grids are never connected. This alternative operating principle ensures the converters fault blocking capabilities and, by operating in discontinuous conduction mode, the switching losses are minimized. This operation principle is presented and subsequently confirmed through simulation of different DC grid scenarios that would necessitate the use of a DC/DC converter, using either highly rated or fast switching thyristors.

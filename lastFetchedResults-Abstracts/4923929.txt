Our objective is to provide a theoretical foundation for multidatabase transaction management that deals with global concurrency control and global deadlocks in a uniform manner. We first propose rigid conflict serializability as a sufficient condition for the global transaction management to ensure global serializability in multidatabase environment. Subsequently, it is shown that the enforcement of rigid conflict serializability through a rigid method at the time each global subtransaction begins its execution avoids global deadlocks. The deadlock-free policy in the paper seems to be attractive due to the simple and uniform approach it takes. The basic advantage of the approach is that the global transaction manager can allow any interleavings among normal database operations belonging to global transactions without any mechanism at global level

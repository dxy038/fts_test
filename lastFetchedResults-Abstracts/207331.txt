Objective: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most common diagnoses in hospitalized patients in industrial countries. Today it is revealed that microorganisms may be implicated in the pathogenesis of AMI. One of these organisms is Chlamydia pneumoniae. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of this organism with development of AMI.
Methods: in this case-control study 116 individuals were recruited and divided into two groups: 40 patients with diagnosis of AMI (test group) and 76 individuals (control group) who had no pervious history of myocardial infarction and/or ischemic heart disease. Serum antichlamydial antibody was measured in both groups. Odd's ratio was used for statistical comparison.
Results: The results showed that 32.5 % of patients with acute myocardial infarctionand 18.4 % of control group had positive anti-chlamydial antibody, which was not significantly different (OR = 2.3).
Conclusion: The findings from this study demonstrated that there was no significant relationship between Chlamydia pneumonia and AMI. These findings come in agreement with other similar findings conducted in Taiwan, Ostrich and Seri Lanka.

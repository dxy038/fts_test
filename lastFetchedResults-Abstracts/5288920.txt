We propose a new gray relational measurement whose gray relational coefficient is called the gray relational coefficient of order k. Gray relational coefficient of order 1 is the traditional gray relational coefficient. With this new gray relational measurement, we can compute the gray relational matrix of order k for variables of systems. If k is large enough, the matrix would show the clusters of variables and the result is objective

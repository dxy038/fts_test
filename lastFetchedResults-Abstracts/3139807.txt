Only a simple gray or fuzzy evaluation method can not evaluate the risk of the overall project, objectively and accurately, so use Grey Clustering to get the statistic of gray indicator, construct the fuzzy matrix of project risks, and then establish a risk comprehensive evaluation method, which is a combination of gray and fuzzy matrix. This method can make full use of gray and fuzzy that experts judged the information gray to enable the project risk evaluation is more objective and accurate. This method is applied to the integrated logistics supply chain in the China Coal Construction1First Group and the project risk evaluation results show that this method is feasible and effective.

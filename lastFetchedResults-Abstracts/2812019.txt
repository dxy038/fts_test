The desire to increase the share of renewable energies in the electricity mix induces a significant rise of volatile energies. A solution to manage these non-dispatchable renewable resources is to deploy new energy storage and demand response systems, gathered together within a smart grid. Our overall objective is to propose an approach to manage smart grids like any other power plant in order to integrate them to the short-term power markets. In this paper, we propose a multi-level architecture and an optimization approach to compute the production plan of every kind of manageable systems. The next step will be to optimize the production plan of the smart grid.

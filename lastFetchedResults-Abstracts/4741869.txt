This paper presents an introductory overview and tutorial in simulation modeling and control of serial Kanban and CONWIP (Constant Work In Process) pull systems using ARENA/SIMAN 3.5/4.0. Card level estimation is discussed for both types of pull systems, and a heuristic method to adjust card levels controlling system WIP (work in process) is provided. The objective is to present a tutorial for students and practicing engineers familiar with the basics of simulation, but unfamiliar with pull system fundamentals

The essential goal of air traffic control is to allow an efficient flow of aircraft while maintaining safe aircraft operation. However, safety is the primary objective and can never be compromised in any way. Air traffic delays occur when demand for airports or airspace exceeds available capacity. Effects of these delays can be lessened by increasing capacity or by modifying demand. Of course, increasing capacity is an intersecting solution, but it is a long-range option which is done by construction of new airports, expansion of existing airports and new landing procedures. Therefore, a short-term decision making needs a tactical optimization model to reduce delays at available facilities. In this paper, we present a modeling framework that is a generalization of dynamic network model with uncertain capacities.

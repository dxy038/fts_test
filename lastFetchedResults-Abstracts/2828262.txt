The problems of influence of hindrances on an error of distance measurement by a range finder with frequency modulation at signal processing in a spectral area are considered. Considerable influence of a kind of weight function (WF) on result of processing is shown. For an objective choice of kind WF it is offered to add traditional system of WF parameters in a new parameter - a relative error of frequency estimation. The comparative analysis of some traditional WF is carried out.

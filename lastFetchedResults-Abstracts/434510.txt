Background
One of the perceived major contraindications to early extubation after pediatric cardiac surgery is preoperative pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The objective of this study is to present the results of early extubation (within 6 hours after open heart surgery) in children who had varying degrees of preoperative pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Methods
We reviewed the charts of 100 consecutive children who underwent subaortic ventricular septal defect closure and also had preoperative PAH. Outcomes measured included early extubation rate, clinical status of patients, and hospital costs.
Results
The median age at surgery was 2.5 years (range, 0.4 to 30). Sixty-five patients were extubated successfully in the operating room; 25 additional patients were extubated in the intensive care unit within 6 hours from surgery, increasing the early extubation rate from 65% to 90%. Postoperative complications were present in 12 patients; 10 of these patients required mechanical ventilation for more than 6 hours, and 1 of them died postoperatively in septic shock. Two patients required reintubation 25 and 26 hours, respectively, after initial extubation in the operating room, for causes unrelated to pulmonary hypertensive crises or ventilatory failure. The mean cost of procedures in patients who had successful early extubation was US $3,786.50 Â± 302.45. Every additional day in the intensive care unit, in case of delayed extubation, increased the overall cost of the procedure by 10%.
Conclusions
Pulmonary artery hypertension does not seems to be a contraindicating factor to early extubation in patients who underwent ventricular septal defect closure, and may be considered a feasible way to decrese postoperative intensive care unit stay and hospital costs.

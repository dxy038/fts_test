Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is an area of research which deals with the recognition of speech by machine in several conditions. ASR performs well under restricted conditions (quiet environment), but performance degrades in noisy environments. This paper presents a brief survey on Automatic Speech Recognition on Malays Corpus and multi-modal speech recognition on others Corpus. The audio only speech recognition has been done by many researchers few decades. After years of research and development the performance of automatic speech recognition remains one of the important research challenges (eg., variations of the context, database, and environment). The criteria for designing Speech Recognition system are pre-processing filter, end-point detection, feature extraction techniques, speech classifiers, database, and performance evaluation. The existing problems that are in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)-noise environments and the various techniques to solve these problems had constructed. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well know methods used by previous researcher.

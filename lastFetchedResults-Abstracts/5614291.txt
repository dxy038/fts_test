The design of steering linkage must meet Ackerman steering characteristic, and the change of toe-in angle during wheel jumping should be the smallest. The virtual prototype model of McPherson suspension and steering linkage is established by using the ADAMS software. Due to the ADAMS softwareÂ´s limitation in optimized method, an optimize method that combine MATLAB genetic algorithm toolbox with ADAMS software is used, the steering linkage is optimized which take the Ackerman steering error and the change of toe-in angle during wheel jumping as optimal objective function. The simulation result indicates that the Ackerman steering characteristic and the toe-in angle characteristic are both improved after the optimization.

Future WSNs are expected to carry different traffic such as voice and video as well as data to serve both real and non-real time applications. Therefore, the reliability and quality of the data delivered to support diverse applications is very important. Also, service differentiation is an essential component of QoS that should be supported by routing protocols. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reliability and multi-objective routing in WSNs. We present Multi-objective Reliable and Fault-Tolerant Multipath routing protocol (MRFTM) that estimates link quality before making a routing decision to provide a reliable transmission environment for data delivery. Simulation results show that MRFTM outperforms existing schemes with respect to the data delivery ratio where data can be delivered at high levels of reliability and assuring quality of services required by different applications. Using erasure coding to transmit data on the selected paths also enables very high reliability.

In the scope of digitized speech signals with severe pathologies, as the esophageal voices are, it is impossible the objective assessment of the voice based on a set of parameters accepted by the scientific community like pitch, jitter, shimmer or HNR. This impossibility is due to healthy voices or with slight pathologies can be only evaluated with commercial applications. However, this paper presents a robust and precise algorithm that allows the automated calculation of pitch and jitter on very noisy and low quality voice signals. Therefore, both the improvement achieved due to medical treatment and the evaluation of digital signal processing algorithms will be measurable based on objective criteria.

The sufficient conditions of exponential string stability for a few class of nonlinear composite stochastic systems are established. The excitations are assumed to be parametric white noises. In this case the objective is to analyze composite systems in their lower order subsystems and in terms of their interconnecting structure. The cases of exponential string stability for weak coupling systems, vehicle-following systems and l2 string stability for weak coupling systems are considered.

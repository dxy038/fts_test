The objective of this study is to estimate the efficiency of laser cleaning for oxide layer and monitor the concentration of each acid for the pickling liquor under existing steel-pickling process. It was carried out that laser removal of surface oxides and small particles from steel surfaces by using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. In order to optimize and cut costs, it is important the optical detection of concentration for mixed acids in the pickling process. For this reason, we studied the cracks through electrochemical laser process and measure components of surface by using Raman microscopy and measure the concentrations of mixed acid by using NIR spectroscopy.

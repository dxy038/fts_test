Intradomain routing in IP networks follows least-cost paths according to administrative link costs. Routing optimization modifies these values to minimize an objective function for a network with given link capacities and traffic matrix. An example for an objective function is the maximum utilization of all links under failure-free conditions or also after rerouting in case of network failures. Many papers have provided heuristic algorithms for routing optimization using different objective functions, but the investigation and comparison of various objective functions has not attracted much attention so far. In this work we present several objective functions for resilient IP routing. We also propose a new combined optimization approach which can simultaneously optimize different objective functions with almost no additional computation effort and describe new techniques to minimize overall computation time. The different objective functions and combinations thereof are then analyzed and compared experimentally.

In this paper, maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control strategy is proposed for a special machine called dual mechanical ports (DMP) electric machine. In the conventional hybrid electrical vehicles (HEV), this machine is replaced to planetary gear box and two electric machines and makes their structures simpler. The proposed MTPA strategy fully utilizes the reluctance torque and maximizes the torque capacity of the machine. Farther more MTPA method is equivalent to the objective of minimum copper loss. Sound theoretical basis is given in the context. Simulation results are presented. It will be proved that proposed MTPA method can increase machine torque capacity about 50% in one rotor and 100% in the other.

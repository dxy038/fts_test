The primary objective of this study was to investigate the performance of ferrofluids under the combined influence of surface roughness and a magnetic field generated by a concentric finite wire. The distribution of pressure was obtained and used to calculate the characteristics of the bearing. The results of this study indicate that the combined influence affect the distribution of film pressure, which enhances loading capacity and reduces the modified friction coefficient. The effect of longitudinal roughness was particularly significant and we expect these findings could further enhance the design of short journal bearing within a magnetic field.

The Dommel-Tinney approach to the calculation of optimal power-system load flows has proved to be very powerful and general. This paper extends the problem formulation and solution scheme by incorporating exact outage-contingency constraints into the method, to give an optimal steady-state-secure system operating point. The controllable system quantities in the base-case problem (e.g. generated MW, controlled voltage magnitudes, transformer taps) are optimised within their limits according to some defined objective, so that no limit-violations on other quantities (e. g. generator MVAR and current loadings, transmission-circuit loadings, load-bus voltage magnitudes, angular displacements) occur in either the base-case or contingency-case system operating conditions.

The main objective of this work is to present the analysis of the behavior of synchronous generators of an electrical energy independent power producer, with their respective automatic voltage regulators (AVRs) and speed governors, in parallel with a power authority distribution system, for the distributed generation studies. It is highlighted that this generator is driven by a steam turbine with regulators and governors modeled in &#8220;ATP-Alternative Transients Program&#8221;, through the use of TACS subroutines. Among the analysis to be made are, the monitoring of voltage levels at the Common Coupling Point (CCP), before and after the Independent Producer (IP) entry point, as well as the analysis of the opening of the interconnection breaker and balanced three-phase fault. Moreover, the analysis of responses for the synchronous machines controls, voltage regulator and speed governor, are also the subject of analysis in this paper. The impacts of such generators in distribution networks are determined and compared through the use of a model of a distribution network, also modeled in ATP. This work presents, clearly and in a well defined manner, the main modifications in the power electrical system, more specifically in distribution networks, due to the presence of an independent power producer with two synchronous machines.

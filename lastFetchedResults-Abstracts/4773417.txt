In this paper, we apply a distributed genetic-algorithm (DGA) to the design of bended film antenna operating at the 2.4/5 GHz wireless local area network. The DGA is performed by selection, crossover, mutation and migration of individuals in sub-populations (islands) grouped by bending angles. Multi-objective optimization for antenna characteristics is solved. Several methods are proposed for the migration and the effect is demonstrated by comparing their simulated results.

The present article addresses structural and semantic-syntactic deviations in TV football reports. It aims to not only shed light on verbal abnormalities of the reporters but also put forward measures to reduce such shortcomings and standardizing football reports language. To reach this objective, a corpus containing 15 last minutes of all football reports broadcast over the last year was collected and then the deviations were found. The criterion for selecting the reporters in this research was the frequency of their reporting matches over the last 10 years. Findings indicate that despite frequent speech mistakes made by the reporters, the structure of their language has been close to the standard language.

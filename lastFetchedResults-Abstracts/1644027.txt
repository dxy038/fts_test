Loess deposits of Kopeh Dagh area usually occur patchy, with low thickness and should be identified and differentiated from other deposits for environmental planning and landscape evolution studies. The objective of this study was to identify distribution and determine the characteristics of loess deposits and investigate their formation in the Sarakhs area. Thirty surface samples were collected from the study area and analyzed for particle size distribution. Coarse silt and very fine sand are the dominant fraction of the sediments and overally exceed 70%. Dominance of coarse silt and very fine sand, lack of coarse fragments and abrupt boundary of these sediments with underlying materials are evidences of eolian origin. With decreasing very fine sand and increasing coarse silt, sand dunes in the east and center of the area gradually change to loess deposits from Sarakhs city towards Dousti dam (along Hariroud River) and Kopeh Dag heights in the south and west. The maximum thickness of loess sediment occurred around the Dousti dam.  Dominance of coarse silt and very fine sand in the sediments and gradual boundary between sand dunes and loess deposits shows the local source of the particles. Kopeh Dagh heights in southern and western parts of the area, like a barrier have trapped eolian sediments and caused their formation.

Background and Objective: Fetal Weight and gestational age are important factors in evaluation of neonatal safety and basic prediction factors in outcome of prengnancy and satisfactory criterion in decision of management in obstetrice and neonatalogy. Therefore finding a method for pridiction of fetal weight is critical. The present study employs, detect on value of Jahnson's formula in prediction of fetal weight.
Materials and methods: In this analytic study, 223 pregnant women who had a safe, live, singlton fetus. with cephalic presentation were admithed to labor ward at Dezyani hospital. Medical or obstetrical complication was excluded. Subjects selected by purposive sampling. For collecting data: first, using the same flexible tap measure calibrated in centimeters by using this tap, the fundul height was measured. The fundul heigh was also taken in Jahnson's formula and estimated weight was also calculated each cases. The actual weight of post delivery was measured immediately. Data analysis was done by corrolation test paired t test.
Results: This study shows mean estimated fetal weight (3730+546) were higher than the actual birth weight (3270Â± 429).
Conclusions: This study indicates that Janson's formulal is not a good way to estimate fetal weight.

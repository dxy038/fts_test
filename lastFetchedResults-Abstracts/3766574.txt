We propose a computationally efficient synthesis procedure for a class of bidirectional associative memories. Networks are described by a system of first-order ordinary difference equations which are defined on a closed hypercube of the state-space with solutions extended to the corner of the hypercube. The proposed algorithm possesses several advantages since it is possible: 1) to exert control over the number of spurious states; 2) to estimate the basins of attraction of the stable memories; and 3) under certain constraints, to effectively store a number of desired stable memories which by far exceed the order of the network. The applicability of the present results is demonstrated by means of a specific application in reconfigurable control of flexible structures

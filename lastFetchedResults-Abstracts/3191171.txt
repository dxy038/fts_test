This paper proposes fuzzy multi objective optimization to determine the optimal size and location of conventional and renewable distributed generation in distribution network. In this paper the random generation of renewable DG is represented with a probabilistic-fuzzy approach. Operating constraints in DG placement are considered and the amount of ENS and current/voltage constraints evaluated using by fuzzy load flow. Objective function consists of ENS, economical advantage of DGÂ´s and also environmental benefits of renewable based DGs.

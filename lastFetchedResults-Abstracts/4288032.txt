We address the maximum lifetime routing problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and propose two online routing algorithms based on fuzzy logic, namely fuzzy maximum lifetime algorithm and fuzzy multiobjective algorithm. The former attempts to maximize the WSN lifetime objective, whereas the latter strives to simultaneously optimize the lifetime as well as the energy consumption objectives. The distinguishing aspect of this work is the novel use of fuzzy membership functions and rules in the design of cost functions for the routing objectives considered in this work. A range of simulation results obtained under various network scenarios show that the proposed approach is superior to a number of other well-known online routing heuristics, both in terms of the obtained network lifetime as well as the average energy consumption.

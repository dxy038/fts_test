In this paper, the queueing delay and packets loss performance of multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) systems is analyzed through the nonpreemptive M/M/m/K finite queueing model with bulk arrivals, where the traffic burstiness characteristic is considered. The analytical results reveal the queueing time relation of different priority classes of data traffic due to the MPLS classification, queueing, and scheduling (CQS) operations, which provide design guidelines for future label switching routers (LSRs). The objective of this paper is to provide an analysis of MPLS routers and network traffic streams for various system server topologies applying the nonpreemptive priority M/M/m/K queueing model.

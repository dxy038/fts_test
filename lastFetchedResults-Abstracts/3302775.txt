This paper discusses the design and comparison of zero order Takagi-Sugeno type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers for posture stabilization of wheeled mobile robot. Three two input, two output (TITO) type-1 fuzzy controllers having the same rule base but different membership functions are proposed with the objective of achieving better response for position stabilization task. The uncertainties are then introduced in the membership functions to get the corresponding interval type-2 fuzzy controllers. The response of the controllers is finally analyzed by experimentation on Lego Mindstorms in MATLAB environment.

Intelligent information retrieval and data credibility is maintained by the use of Provenance in semantic web. However there is still a need to embed provenance data in a simpler form so that it is trusted and is easily available for human consumption. This Objective is achieved by the use of PROV-ASN that provides multiple expression assertions for the use of abstract notations to represent provenance information on the semantic web. In this paper we have made an endeavour to create valid PROV-ASN instances by embedding entity, agent and activity expressions with reference to University People Program Ontology.

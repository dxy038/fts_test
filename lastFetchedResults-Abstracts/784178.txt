Objective Although the association between age and
depression has been previously demonstrated, uncertainty
remains because of the confounding relationship existing
between age and cohort. A study by Yang (J Health Soc
Behav 48(1):16, 2007) has evidenced important cohort
effects and age-by-cohort interactions in depressive symptoms
among US citizens. A crucial limitation, however, is
that this study confines itself to elderly population. The
objective of the present study is to bring further clarification
to the association between age, cohort membership
and depressive symptoms, by analyzing a sample with a
wider age range.
Methods The Panel Study of Belgian Households is a
prospective longitudinal survey, following adults ages
25–74, annually from 1992 to 2002. Missing data were
replaced using multiple imputation, allowing for a complete
dataset (N = 7,000) at each wave. Respondents were
classified into one of five birth cohorts: 1918–1927;
1928–1937; 1938–1947; 1948–1957; 1958–1967. Frequency
of depressive symptoms was reported using a
modified version of the Health and Daily Living form.
Growth curve modeling was used to determine the effect of
age and cohort on depression trajectory.
Results All cohorts differed significantly from one
another, with recent cohorts always obtaining the highest
mean HDL-depression score. The intensity of depressive
symptoms increases linearly with age, but significant ageby-
cohorts interactions were detected, indicating that the
relationship between age and depression varies across
cohorts. No evidence of a WW2 effect was found.
Conclusion The association between age and depression
has to take cohort membership into account. Cohort
replacement effects explain the increase in depression in
Belgium.

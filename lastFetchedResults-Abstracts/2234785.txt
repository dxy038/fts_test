The objective of this study is to reduce V content of Ni-base dual two-phase intermetallic alloy, with keeping the dual two-phase microstructure and also without sacrificing their mechanical and chemical properties. The dual two-phase microstructure was maintained when Cr and Nb instead of V were added to the alloy and their valence electron concentration (e/a) ranges from 8.59 to 8.43. Consequently, the contents of V in the dual two-phase intermetallic alloy were reduced by 8 at%, 8 at%, and 3 at% by Cr substitutions for V-site, both of Ni- and V-sites, and Ni-site, respectively. The density of the modified alloys slightly increased from that of the base alloy. Hardness was higher in the modified alloys than in the base alloy. The flow strength of the modified alloys is much improved from that of the base alloy in a wide range of temperatures. Also, oxidation resistance of the modified alloys was superior to those of the base alloy.

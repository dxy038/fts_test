The San Diego Oceans Foundation sank the HMCS Yukon in 100 feet of water, 1.85 miles off Mission Beach, California as a haven for sea life, an attraction for scuba divers, a platform for environmental education, and a research site for marine scientists. Commissioned in 1963 as a Canadian Mackenzie-class destroyer escort, the HMCS Yukon was towed out to the site to be scuttled. Unfortunately, the HMCS Yukon sank prematurely on July 14, 2000. Monitoring the Yukon is an essential part of its creation as an artificial reef. Without proper study and evaluation, we have no way to accurately assess the impacts of this new reef. Are new fish populations being created increasing the number of these species overall, or is the reef only attracting and concentrating fish from other areas? Because artificial reefs may have a strong negative impact, data is needed to make valid judgments to lay controversy to rest. The main objective of this study is to determine the rate of colonization by fishes, invertebrates, and plants and to determine whether fish remain resident or if they travel between reefs.

Objective Previous studies have associated mental distress
and disorders with increased health care utilization
and costs. However, most studies have selected subjects
from treatment facilities or have applied retrospective
designs.
Methods N = 3,300 subjects from the baseline cohort of
the Study of Health in Pomerania were followed up 5 years
later. Mental distress was assessed with the SF-12 Health
Survey and the Composite Diagnostic Screener for mental
disorders. Two-part econometric models were applied
adjusting for medical confounders and baseline services use.
Results At 5-year follow-up somatization at baseline
predicted an increase of inpatient (?39.9%) and outpatient
costs (?11.9%). Depression predicted an increase of inpatient
(?24.1%) and outpatient costs (?8.9%). Comorbidity
of somatization and depression and somatization and anxiety
predicted an increase in overall health care costs of C50%.
Conclusion Simple and time-efficient screening procedures
for mental disorders may help to identify subjects at
risk for increased future health care utilization. Standardized
therapeutic interventions should be evaluated in
subjects at risk in primary care.

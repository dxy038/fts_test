Objective To discuss the clinical diagnosis value of Multislice helical CT in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and angiomyolipomas (AML). Methods 93 patients (78 were RCC and 15 were AML by pathologic diagnosis through postoperative examination of specimen) were retrospectively analyzed. CT number in ROI (region of interest) of these masses was recorded, CT number in ROW (region of whole mass) of these masses was recorded at the same time. CT number includes the mean, maximum, minimum and the range between the maximum and minimum. Comparison between groups RCC and AML CT number, analyzes the difference of each index in the area under the ROC. Results Only the mean CT number in ROI had difference between groups RCC and AML in unenhanced (p&lt;;O.05), 6 indexes of CT number in ROW had difference between groups RCC and AML (P&lt;; 0.05).The area under ROC curve of the mean CT number in ROI in unenhanced was 0.857, every area under ROC curve of 6 indexes of CT number in ROW was beyond 0.857. Conclusion The way of measuring CT number of tumor in this study can effectively improve the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing renal cell carcinoma.

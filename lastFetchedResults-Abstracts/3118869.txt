In this paper, the objective video quality assessment has been used to the mobile application. We propose a set of objective video quality assessment model to evaluate the video transmission quality over a wireless channel. By this way, we can rate the quality of the multimedia wireless transmission more objectively and economically. This objective video quality assessment model can be sensible to most of the usual video distortion and have good correlation with the subjective assessment.

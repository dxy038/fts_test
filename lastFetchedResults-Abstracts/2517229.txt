In this paper, energy environmental economic management in a microgrid means the determination of the extent of contribution in each of distributed Generation resources for supplying the demand of local loads so that the reduction of costs and environmental pollution can be achieved. The capacity of installed units in micro grid usually supplies the portion of load demanded energy through the utility. In this case, planning of charge and discharge in the energy storage system has done on the basis of the way of microgrids’ contribution with upstream network. The effect of electricity markets’ fluctuations and the extent of pollution according to the received energy from the utility for optimization are the purposes of the paper. The methodology goes for the multi objective optimization of HBMO based on Pareto criterion and fuzzy logic in order to resolve the energy environmental economic management problem. The salient features of this method could be pointed to the proper searching, proper selection, advancement and parting of generations for fining new answers. The results of this process are presented for three various scenarios and they are compared with the results of other Methods. The comparison confirms the superiority of this method for determination of contribution extent for each of distributed generation resources in feeding local load and for planning of optimal charge and discharge in energy storage system.

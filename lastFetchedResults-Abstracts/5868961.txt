The objective of this work is the development of DMC for a shell and tube heat exchanger and to address the difficulties in tuning a DMC. Although the PID controller is widely used for these types of applications there is still a need for optimization of conservation of energy. In this paper a model based predictive algorithm is used for controlling a temperature of a fluid stream using the shell and tube heat exchanger and the associated difficulties in tuning are analyzed. The transients and steady state results obtained using a DMC is compared with a conventional PID and IMC-PID controller.

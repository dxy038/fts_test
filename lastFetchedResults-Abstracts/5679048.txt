An effort to maintain the availability of partially failed manipulator is addressed based on redundant trajectories obtained by primitive constraints. The objective is to facilitate the existing manipulators to continue their point to point motion tasks when a non catastrophic fault occurs into a joint. The fault is assumed as a joint locked failure. This is achieved through fault to primitive constraints mapping which gives the primitive constraints due to the faults. Then they are applied to update the manipulator constraints for the trajectory planning. Then it purposes a new trajectory in the case of availability. Finally the method is applied for a 6DOF manipulator and validated under a fault scenario within a simulation study and the results are presented.

Background: Uterine natural killer (uNK) cells are the most abundant leukocytes in pre-implantation endometrium and early pregnancy deciduas in humans and rodents. They are associated with structural changes in maternal spiral arteries but regulation of their re-cruitment and activation is incompletely understood. The major subpopulation of uNK cells in humans expresses CD56, the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)-1 while their counterpart in mouse expresses asialoGM1, a brain ganglioside. Sympathetic nerves ex-press NCAM-1 which mediates homotypic binding. Sympathetic fibers innervate the me-sometrial vasculature but their relationship to the myometrial and decidual uNK cell re-cruitment is unknown. Objective: The present study aims to explore positional relation-ship between natural killer cells and distribution of nerves in decidualized mouse uterus. Methods: Immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression for the enzyme tyrosine hy-droxylase were used to map sympathetic nerve fibre distribution within C57BL/6 implan-tation sites and to address a relationship with uNK cells. Results: Tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons were identified in the mesometrium closely associated with uterine arter-ies. Staining became gradually vanished as the nerves crossed the myometrium and en-tered the decidualized uterus. No neuronal stain was associated with the spiral arteries. Periodic Acid Schiffâ€™s reactive uNK cells were absent from the mesentery, but abundant in decidua basalis where they are associated with non-innervated vessels. Conclusion: Data suggest that the recruitment of uNK progenitor cells to the uterus is unlikely to be dependent on signaling by the sympathetic nervous system

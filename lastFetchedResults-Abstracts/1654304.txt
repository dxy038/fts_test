Background and objective: Critical thinking is an important aspect of the nursing profession and is considered particularly critical in clinical activity. However, it has not been given due attention. It seems that it is necessary to assess barriers tocritical thinking in nurses and nursing students. This study investigates the barriers to critical thinking skills by nurses, nursing educators and nursing students.
Materials and Methods:  This crossâ€“sectional was done on three groups of teachers, students and nurses. Sampling methods for teachers was census, but for students and nurses stratified randomization was used. We used a researcher-made tool whose validity and reliability was approved by a panel of experts and test-retest method respectively. We used descriptive and analytical statistics to analyze the data. 
Results: The comparison of individual, organizational and personality dimensions was made by One way ANOVA test and showed no significant difference between the three groups (p > 0.05). However, this difference was significant in educational dimension (p < 0.02).  Tukey-test showed a difference between the students and nurses group (p=0.031).
Conclusion: The use of critical thinking is undeniably necessary for patient care; therefore, its barriers must be removed. Learning critical thinking is not sufficient by itself; the barriers to it must also be removed.

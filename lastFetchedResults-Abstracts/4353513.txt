Summary form only given. The objective of this effort was to investigate both parametrically and experimentally the properties of the Explosive Driven Ferroelectric Generator (EDFEG). The parametric investigation was conducted using a simulation developed by the Institute of Electromagnetic Research and the experimental investigation using the explosive test facilities at Texas Tech University. Both efforts were conducted synergistically in order to fully understand the characteristics of the EDFEG and to optimize their operation. Results of both studies will be presented.

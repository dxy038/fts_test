A non-isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter is presented in this study. The configuration of the proposed converter is simple. The voltage gain of the proposed converter is higher than the conventional bidirectional DC-DC buck/boost converter in the step-up mode. In addition, the voltage gain is lower than the conventional buck/boost in step-down mode. Because of better gain performance of the proposed converter in comparison of the conventional converter it can work in wide voltage range than conventional converter. Therefore the proposed converter is applicable than the conventional bidirectional converter. Owing to simple structure, the control of the proposed converter is quite easy. The operation principle and steady-state analyses of the proposed converter in step-up and step-down modes are explored. Finally the laboratory prototype circuit is implemented to justify the validity of the theoretical analysis.

The paper deals with the classical problem of the resource allocation in geostationary satellite scenarios where fading may negatively impact the communications. In more detail, we consider the case in which different performance metrics, such as Packet Loss and Power, are simultaneously taken into account. Starting from the wide literature in the field, this work tries to categorize the available and well-known resource allocation approaches into three groups: i) the capacity maximization with constrained power group, ii) the power minimization with constrained capacity group and iii) the multi-objective programming group. For each group a general mathematical formulation has been proposed and the main differences among the groups have been highlighted. The performance of the three listed groups are compared through simulations where two Earth Stations, afflicted by different fading conditions, have been considered. The comparison takes into account all the mentioned metrics (i.e., loss and power) and the computational complexity of the allocation approaches.

The work examines the feasibility of minimizing a linear objective function subject to a max-t fuzzy relation equation constraint, where t is a continuous/Archimedean t-norm. Conventional methods for solving this problem are significantly improved by, first separating the problem into two sub-problems according to the availability of positive coefficients. This decomposition is thus more easily handled than in previous literature. Next, based on use of the maximum solution of the constraint equation, the sub-problem with non-positive coefficients is solved and the size of the sub-problem with positive coefficients reduced as well. This step is unique among conventional methods, owing to its ability to determine as many optimal variables as possible. Additionally, several rules are developed for simplifying the remaining problem. Finally, those undecided optimal variables are obtained using the covering problem rather than the branch-and-bound methods. Three illustrative examples demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional schemes. Its potential applications are discussed as well.

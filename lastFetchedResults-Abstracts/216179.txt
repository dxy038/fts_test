Background: The process of wound healing involves integrated
events including inflammation, granulation tissue formation,
matrix deposition and remodeling. Growth factors
playa key role in the process. Among them transforming
growth factor-131 (TGF-I3I) is known to accelerate tissue repair
by promoting the synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix
proteins. However, persistence or overactivity of TGF-131
during the remodeling phase can potentially lead to fibrosis.
The primary objective of this study was, therefore, to determine
the effects of TGF-131 inactivation, by its latency associated
peptide (LAP), on the cutaneous healing wounds.
Methods: Excisional wounds were generated on the back of
male adult rats. Wounds received TGF-131 or LAP during the
post-inflammatory phase. Expression of type I collagen and asmooth
muscle actin was evaluated by Western blotting.
Wound maturation was further assessed by histology and immunohistochemical
methods using specific antibody for proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (peNA),
Results: Wounds treated with TGF-131 showed a marked increase
in the level of type I collagen, whereas no significant
changes were observed in the wounds treated with LAP as
compared to that in control. Expression of a-smooth muscle
actin was markedly reduced in the wounds treated with LAP
but was slightly increased in the wounds treated with TGF -131.
Both neodermis and newly-formed epidermis exhibited a
higher degree of maturation in the LAP-treated wounds as
compared to TGF-131 treated wounds.
Conclusion: Local administration of LAP seems to be beneficial
to tissue remodeling. It promotes wound maturation and,
may prevent fibrosis and hypertrophic scarring.

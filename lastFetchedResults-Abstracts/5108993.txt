In some applications, as part of a mobile agent mission, there may be the necessity of meeting a firm end-to-end deadline, although with some itinerary flexibility due to optional resources. In this paper it is considered an execution model where agents do not previously know their itineraries. The objective is to propose and to evaluate heuristics to be used by pairs of imprecise mobile agents that must accomplish a mission within a firm deadline.

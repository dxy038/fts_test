We have researched for the applicability of the genetic algorithms (GA) to issues such as multi objective optimization, time series prediction, the analysis from observed noisy data and the solution of implicit functions. Concerning these problems, we reported that GA is effective for the tracking of the moving ships, and for the tracking of the objects orbiting the earth from observed time series bearing and distance data. In this paper, we report on the analysis for the movement characteristics of an object in sea water from an observed time series sound signal. This analysis is more complex than those of earlier reports. To analyze the movement characteristics, we applied a two-step GA analysis. The first step GA analyzes harmonic frequencies and their phases of the sound signal radiated by the moving object. The second step GA analyzes the movement characteristics by using output of the first step GA. We could prove the applicability of GA to this analysis through a computer simulation.

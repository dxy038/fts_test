The tutorial presented an approach that leverages well-known economic and financial concepts for evaluating the cost effectiveness of software development processes and techniques. Software engineering studies often report separately on the costs and benefits of a phenomenon of interest, and rarely adequately address the combined bottom line implications. In particular, tensions between quality and productivity are hard to reconcile, making objective, high-level insights elusive. To address this need, the tutorial focused on quantitative methods for synthesizing co-dependent cost-benefit effects and analyzing the resulting behaviors.

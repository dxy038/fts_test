The objective of this paper is to propose a three input boost converter for the hybrid system in order to simply the power system reduce the cost. The proposed converter interfaces two unidirectional input ports and bidirectional port for storage element in the unified structure. Supplying the output load, charging or discharging the battery can be made by the PV and the wind power sources individually or simultaneously. The proposed structure utilizes only four power switches that are independently. Depending on utilization state of the battery, three different power operation modes are defined for the converter. In order to design the converter control system, small-signal model is obtained in each operation mode. Converter performances are verified by simulation for different operation conditions.

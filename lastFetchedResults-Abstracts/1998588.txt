The main design objective of axial compressor is the efficiency increasing, pressure ratio and weight loss. These three parameters are used as an objective function and they are computed according to adopted design procedures. In this paper, a design method is presented that named quasi-three-dimensional. Physical flow conditions are applied to design by some constraints to avoid irrational results. Some of these constraints help designer to impose considered requirements. In this paper, Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) is used for achieving the best design parameters that they construct a complex and non-linear design space. The radial distribution of several parameters is evaluated.

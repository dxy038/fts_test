OBJECTIVE: Immune interferon gamma adversely affects mouse embryo development and has been proposed as a mediator of reproductive failure involving T-helper 1 immunity. We hypothesized that one mechanism by which interferon gamma could exert an adverse effect on embryos was by altering plasma membrane organization and transmembrane protein mobility. STUDY DESIGN: The fluorescence photobleaching recovery technique was used to measure the effect of the T-helper 1 cytokine interferon gamma on the translational mobility of a specific embryonic surface glycoprotein recognized by the monoclonal antibody S75. RESULTS: Compared with controls interferon gamma significantly decreased the fractional mobility of fluorescein isothiocyanate S75 in one- and two-cell mouse embryos. CONCLUSION: Interferon gamma may alter plasma membrane domains or cytoskeletal organization in early-stage embryos. By restricting plasma membrane protein mobility interferon gamma could effect T-helper 1 - mediated reproductive failure. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:282-7.)

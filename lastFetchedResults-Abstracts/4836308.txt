To meet the demand of urban parking and decrease the parking cost, the study of a location model about the curb parking facilities and the off-street parking facilities by analyzing the matching relationship is necessary. It surely can improve the overall efficiency of urban dynamic and static traffic. Firstly, comparison of the off-street parking with the curb parking about characteristics of parking behavior is given. Second, by analyzing the impact of the curb parking facilities to the dynamic traffic, a model using delay as the evaluation indicators is built. Then basing on assuming that the parking demand and off-street parking facilities are known, considering the effect of curb parking on traffic delay, circuitous distance, walking distance and supply of berths synthetically, it builds an multilevel and multi-objective optimization model to set the 2 types of car parking facilities coordinately, in which the relationship between the two types of car park facilities is highlighted . Finally, an example is given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model.

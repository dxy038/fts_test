The work described is based on a bidirectional phase-shifted DC-DC converter that conventionally suffers from the restricted load range and nonlinear control of the output voltage. The concepts developed are used to extend the load range of the converter by applying both zero current switching (ZCS) and zero voltage switching (ZVS). In addition, the control to output voltage characteristics of the converter is improved to be more linear over the large load range.

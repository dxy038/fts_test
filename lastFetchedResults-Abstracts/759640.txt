This longitudinal study examined bidirectional
paths between perceived parent-adolescent relationship
quality and depressive symptoms, as well as the moderating
role of sex, age, and personality type. 1313 Dutch
adolescents (51% girls) from two cohorts (923 12-year
olds and 390 16-year olds at Wave 1) reported on their
personality, depressive symptoms, and perceived relationship
quality to parents in four waves. Consistent with a
relationship erosion perspective, depressive symptoms
negatively predicted perceived relationship quality with
parents. Relationship quality to mothers predicted depressive
symptoms for boys and girls, but relationship quality to
fathers predicted depressive symptoms only for boys.
Personality type only moderated initial associations between
relationship quality with mothers and depressive
symptoms, which were stronger for Overcontrollers and
Undercontrollers than for Resilients. Results thus reveal a
pattern of mutual influence between perceived relationship
quality and depressive symptoms that is moderated by the
interplay among parent and adolescent sex and adolescent
personality type.

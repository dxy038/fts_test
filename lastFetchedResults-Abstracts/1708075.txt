The objective of this work was to demonstrate the utility of lignin-based resins designed for application as an adhesive in the production of particleboard. Bond qualities of lignin-phenol-formaldehyde resins, phenolated-lignin-formaldehyde resins and commercial phenol-formaldehyde (PF-com) resin were assessed by using an automatic bonding evaluation system, prior to production of particleboards. In order to evaluate the quality of lignin-based resins, particleboards were produced and physical and mechanical properties were investigated. These physical properties included internal bond, modules of rupture and modulus of elasticity. Thickness swell and water absorption properties of particleboards bonded with lignin-based resins were also determined. The lignin-based resins have been reported previously in Part I of this study. The results showed that particleboards bonded with phenolated-lignin formaldehyde resins (up to 30% lignin content) exhibited similar physical and mechanical properties when compared to particleboards bonded with PF-com. The work has indicated that phenolated-lignin formaldehyde resins (up to 30% substitution level) can be used successfully as a wood adhesive for constructing particleboard. The performance of these panels is comparable to those of boards made using PF-com resin.

The stream control transmission protocol has recently been standardized as a new transport layer protocol in the IP protocol suite. SCFP is based on the TCP protocol, but incorporates a number of advanced and unique features that are not available in TCP. Although the suitability of TCP over satellite networks has been widely studied, the suitability of SCTP over satellite networks remains to be evaluated. The objective of this article is to investigate the suitability of SCTP for data communications over satellite networks. We focus on the advanced features of SCTP that enhance its performance in satellite networks. Finally, we provide recommendations on the use of SCTP over satellite networks.

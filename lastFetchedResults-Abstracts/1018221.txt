In the first part of this work, we develop a model to compute linkage fields in Outer Rotor Permanents Magnets synchronous machines (OR-PMSM), a structure which is often used in the automotive traction motors. To carry out such a design, we usually employ Finite Element analysis (FEA) software even if it is time consuming. Other designers prefer the Permeances Network Method (PNM) which is less accurate and needs offline FEM results to evaluate the unknown air-gap permeances. Comparatively, between FEM and BEM, the first method is more precise whereas the second is faster in computing times. We propose here a new technique using the hybridization of both the methods in order to gain the advantages of the two techniques, i.e., a relatively accurate and fast methods, so the high ratio fast of running/computing errors has been checked out. The second part deals with the multi-objective design optimization of the studied motor. To do this, we choose the decrease of cogging torque and the increase of torque as objectives applied to multi-objective optimization (MO) process.

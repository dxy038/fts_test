Objective: The present investigation aims to determine the various possibilities in which using MODS could describe second tier FRBR.
Methodology: A comparative method was employed in which the main and ancillary components, features and measures for MODS and also 2nd Tier FRBR entities were used
Findings: Considering the possibilities, a person or corporation could be responsible as the creator, author or compiler of a work, or hold ownership or even be the borrower of a title. It may be used in construction of an arbitrary title or be preferred to other names or be considered as the topic for the resource in question. A person or corporation could be part of the working title or establish a metadata record. It seems that given the results obtained through superimposing of two schemes studied, it is very possible to describe the various roles of persons or corporations in various resources, within MODS using XML syntactical basis. One could deploy this syntactical basis to describe second tier entities in various descriptive levels

Objective: The goal of the current research was to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipid profile in overweight-obese women with subclinical hypothyroidism.
Methods: This study enrolled 23 women who suffered from subclinical hypothyroidism. Patients' average age was 41.08Â±6.56 years and BMI was  > 25 kg/m2. Subjects, following medical screening, were objectively selected and randomly divided into two groups, control (N=13) and experimental (N=10). Initially, patients' height, weight, BMI, waist ratio, and WHR were measured in addition to serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C, CRP, T4 and TSH. Then, the experimental group participated in aerobic exercise. The control group received no intervention other than follow up. After 12 weeks all variables were remeasured. For intra group comparison of data t-test was used and for group comparison, we used the independent t-test (P?0. 05).
Results: After 12 weeks of symphonic aerobic exercise in the experimental group, body composition that included weight, BMI, waist ratio, WHR, and levels of cholesterol, LDL-C, CRP and TSH were significantly reduced. There was no significant change in triglycerides, however we observed increased T4 and HDL-C levels. In the control group LDL-C and CRP were significantly increased.
Conclusion: The reduction of cardiovascular disease through reduction of body composition and low density cholesterol among over weight-obese subclinical hypothyroidism women is possible through weight reduction with aerobic exercises.

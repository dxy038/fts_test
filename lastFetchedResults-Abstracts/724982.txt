The main objective of this study is to conduct a comparative test program on unmodified and
modified bitumen containing nanoclay, and assessing the effects of asphalt properties on performance
of the pavement. In order to meet this objective, the main targets of this study are: finding
out if the nanoclays alter the critical properties of bituminous binders and influence the ageing and
rheology of the bituminous binders. The first task performed was studying the nanoclay modifiers
at nanoscopic level and the test performed in this area is x-ray analysis of the nanoclay modifiers.
The second task is studying the influence of nanoclay modifiers on bituminous binder characteristics.
The tests performed related to this target are rheological studies of fresh (non aged ) and aged
bitumen types by dynamic shear rheometer (DSR). Findings of the tests performed on bituminous
binders proved that the cloisite-15A nanoclay modifications help to increase the stiffness and also
improve the rutting resistance of the standard bituminous binder. This is especially true if the %4
cloisite modification is used. The nanofil-15 modification helps to improve the ageing resistance
of the bituminous binder in the short and long terms. However, the nanoclay modifications were
observed to negatively influence the fatigue resistance performance of asphalt bituminous binders,
especially at low temperature values.

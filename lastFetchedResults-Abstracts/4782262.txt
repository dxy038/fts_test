The rise of ´e-government´, both as a recognized field of practice and an identifiable and legitimate field of study, has occurred extraordinarily rapidly throughout the world. The term ´e-government´ has come to capture and de-limit into what might be termed the agenda for government in the age of the Internet. This article questions the value of the orthodox interpretation, the paradigm that has so rapidly emerged around e-government, in particular the casual assumption that e-government is ipso facto ´citizen-centric´. In so-doing this article reveals a concern that different questions must be asked in order to understand ´egovernment´ and its implications fully and fundamentally. The driving objective of this paper is to identify different approaches to measure the development of e-government.

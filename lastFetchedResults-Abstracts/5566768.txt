Factors influencing the public\´ risk perception have already been investigated since the 70s of the last century. With the increased use of mobile telecommunication and the increased public attention to potential health risks from electromagnetic fields, the risk perception and society\´s dealing with the topic &#8220;mobile telecommunication&#8221; came into focus. From 2002 to 2008, the German Mobile Telecommunication Research Programme was carried out under the leadership of the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS). Aim of the research programme was to investigate the adequacy of the current limit values regarding the protection against adverse health effects caused by electromagnetic fields. Within the research program also studies on risk perception were conducted. They had the objective to highlight society\´s perception of the subject &#8220;electromagnetic fields of mobile telecommunication in Germany" as a whole and in specific groups, e.g. electromagnetic hypersensitive persons. The paper describes central findings.

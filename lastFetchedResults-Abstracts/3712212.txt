In this paper, we present a new paradigm of searching optimal strategies in the game of iterated prisonerÂ´s dilemma (IPD) using multiple-objective evolutionary algorithms. This method is more useful than the existing approaches, because it not only produces strategies that perform better in the iterated game but also finds a family of nondominated strategies, which can be analyzed to decipher properties a strategy should have to win the game in a more satisfactory manner. We present the results obtained by this new method and discuss sub-strategies found to be common among nondominated strategies. The multiobjective treatment of the IPD problem demonstrated here can be applied to other similar game-playing tasks.

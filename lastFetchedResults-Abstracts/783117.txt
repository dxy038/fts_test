Objective We examined the lifetime prevalence
of violence in Mexico and how different characteristics
of the violent event effect the probability of meeting
criteria for lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD). Method We interviewed a probability sample of
2,509 adults from 4 cities in Mexico (Oaxaca, Guadalajara,
Hermosillo, MÃ©rida) using the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results Lifetime
prevalence of violence was 34%.Men reported more single-
experience, recurrent, physical, adolescent, adulthood,
and stranger violence; women more sexual, childhood,
family, and intimate partner violence. Prevalence
was generally higher in Guadalajara, though the impact
was greater in Oaxaca compared to other cities.Of those
exposed, 11.5% met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. Probabilities
were highest after sexual and intimate partner
violence, higher for women than men, and higher in
Oaxaca than other cities. Conclusions It is important to
consider the characteristics and the context of violence
in order to develop effective prevention and intervention
programs to reduce the exposure to and impact of
violence.

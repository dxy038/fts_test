Background: Infection with metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing organisms, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is associated with higher mortality and morbidity rates and health care costs.
Objective: In this study, we aimed to determine the etiology of burns and the incidence and susceptibility patterns of metallo-beta-lactamase producers among P. aeruginosa samples that were isolated from burn patients in Kurdistan province.
Patients and Methods: A total of 176 clinical specimens were received for P. aeruginosa testing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, determination of MIC, and detection of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa strains were performed per CLSI guidelines.
Results: During the study period, 145 burn patients were admitted to the burn unit of Tohid Hospital. Their mean age and total body surface area (TBSA) were 29 years and 37.7 %, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay was 10 days. Kerosene was the most common cause of burns (60 %), followed by gas (30 %). In the 176 clinical specimens from burn patients, 100 P. aeruginosa isolates were identified. The antibiotic to which most bacteria were resistant was ampicillin (100 %), and the most effective antibiotic was meropenem. Of the 100 P. aeruginosa isolates, 22 (22 %) were positive for MBL production, of which 8 were resistant to imipenem.
Conclusions: Of all burn injuries, 87 (60 %) patients were caused by kerosene, which is used primarily by people in low-income groups to light lamps. Our results demonstrate the serious threat of the spread of metallo-beta-lactamase producers; thus, systematic surveillance for detecting MBL producers is necessary.

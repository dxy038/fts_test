In this paper, we consider the coupled-task scheduling problem, to schedule n jobs on a single machine. Each job consists of two coupled tasks which have to be processed in a predetermined order and at exactly a specified interval apart. The objective is to minimize the makespan. The problem was shown to be NP-hard in the strong sense even for some special cases. We analyze some heuristics with worst-case bounds for some NP-hard cases. In addition, we present a tabu search meta-heuristic for solving the general case. Computational results show that the meta-heuristic is efficient to solve the problem in terms of solution quality and running time

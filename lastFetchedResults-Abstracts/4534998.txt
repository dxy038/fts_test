Designing and planing next generation power grid systems composed of large power distribution networks, monitoring and control networks, autonomous generators and consumers of power requires advanced simulation infrastructures. The objective is to predict and analyze in time the behavior of networks of systems for unexpected events such as loss of connectivity, malicious attacks and power loss scenarios. This ultimately allows one to answer questions such as: &#8220;What could happen to the power grid if ...&#8221;. We want to be able to answer as many questions as possible in the shortest possible time for the largest possible systems. In this paper we present a new High Performance Computing (HPC) oriented simulation infrastructure named Next Generation Network and System Simulator (NGNS<sup>2</sup>). NGNS<sup>2</sup> allows for the distribution of a single simulation among multiple computing elements by using MPI and OpenMP threads. NGNS<sup>2</sup> provides extensive configuration, fault tolerant and load balancing capabilities needed to simulate large and dynamic systems for long periods of time. We show the preliminary results of the simulator running approximately two million simulated entities both on a 64-node commodity Infiniband cluster and a 48-core SMP workstation.

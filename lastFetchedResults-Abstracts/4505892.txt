A maximum likelihood array element location (ML-AEL) algorithm was developed for estimating the relative AEL of a sonar array in 3 dimensions. The information was used after the array development to improve the performance of an adaptive beamformer. The algorithm minimizes an objective function over the estimated AEL, and parameters pertaining to plane waves incident on the array from unknown directions and multipaths. Results obtained from computer simulated and experimental data are presented. The performance of the algorithm applied to experimental data was evaluated using an enhanced version of the adaptive beamforming algorithm called minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)

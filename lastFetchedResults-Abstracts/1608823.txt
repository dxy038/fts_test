In this paper, we perform Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm for optimizing size of a PV/wind integrated hybrid energy system with battery storage. The proposed methodology is a heuristic approach which uses a stochastic gradient search for the global optimization. In the study, the objective function is the minimization of the hybrid energy system total cost. And the decision variables are PV size, wind turbine rotor swept area and the battery capacity. The optimum result obtained by SA algorithm is compared with our former studyâ€™s result. Consequently, it is come up with that the SA algorithm gives better result than the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The case study is realized for a campus area in Turkey.

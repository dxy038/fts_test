The objective of this paper is to make the arcane of multilevel inverters more lucid for the fresh researchers and young students of the under graduate and post graduate course at UIT-RGPV, Bhopal. A Single Phase Cascade connected H-Bridge Five Level Voltage Source Inverter is realized, using Pulse Generator and Sine PWM Firing Technique. The Inverter is of type fixed voltage and variable Frequency converter.

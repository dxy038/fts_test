We consider a berth allocation and quay crane assignment problem (BACAP) to concurrently optimize the two objectives: operation cost and customer satisfaction. We formulate the multi-objective BACAP as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. The latter objective is based on vessel departure tardiness which is measured from the perspective of behavioral operations research. A multi-objective genetic algorithm with a novel decoding scheme is proposed. Several efficient solutions can be obtained to facilitate the decision making in the terminal to trade-off the terminal cost and customer satisfaction.

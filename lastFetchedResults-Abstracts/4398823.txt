How to realize the capacity configuration optimization of distributed generation and energy storage system in micro-grid is a problem that shall be solved in micro-grid planning. In this paper, combining with practical engineering design experience and the latest theoretical research results, one micro-grid capacity allocation method based on multi-objective optimization is proposed. Software DGPO (Distributed Generation Planning and Optimization) is also developed. The method enables joint problem solving by taking distributed power supply capacity and energy storage system capacity in micro-grid planning into consideration at the same time, and then realizes configuration optimization. This method can be applied to both isolated-island and grid-connected micro-grid. The feasibility and effectiveness of this method is proved through a micro-grid demonstration project in Jiangsu Province.

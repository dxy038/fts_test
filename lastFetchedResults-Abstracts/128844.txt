Objective(s): Thrombophlebitis from superficial catheters is one of the common and important problems in hospitals. The prevalence is between 2.3% - 30%. Risk factors include age>60, underlying disease, burns, infectious diseases, urgent catheterization, lower extremity catheterization and size. The aim of this study was to determine the phlebitis incidence and evaluation of some risk factors in semnan hospitals.
Methods: We observed 300 patients who had catheters for at least 72 hrs. They were checked daily for symptoms of phlebitis such as erythema, pain or tenderness, warmness and swelling. We excluded patients who were discharged or had their catheters removed before completing 3 days of catheterization. A logistic regression model was used for data analysis.
Results: in this study, 26% (95% CI: 21-31%) of patients developed thrombophlebitis. There were significant relationships between phlebitis and catheter size (OR=3.3), type of catheterization (OR=2.1), underlying infectious diseases (OR=6.2), diabetes mellitus (OR=7.8), Gender (OR-1.5) and bum (OR=4.0). The risk of phlebitis was greater in females and in cases where catheters were placed in emergency settings. Also, catheterization of lower limbs was associated with a greater risk of phlebitis.
Conclusion: We detected a high prevalence of phlebitis in this study. Like the other studies, most risk factors had a significant relationship with the outcome variable. Diabetes was also an important risk factor in our study. There is a need for more education and better sanitary conditions in catheterized patients. It is suggested that were possible, one should avoid the use of catheters in diabetic patients.

Background
The adoption of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in 2004 marked a critical achievement in efforts to stem the tobacco epidemic in Mexico. The Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) findings are useful for evaluating achievement of FCTC articles and designing tobacco control programs.
Objective

To use data from the GYTS conducted in 21 Mexican cities between 2000 and 2005 to monitor Articles in the WHO FCTC.
Methods

The GYTS uses a two-stage cluster sample survey design that produces representative samples of students aged 13–15 years enrolled in public, private and technical schools. The survey was undertaken at 542 schools in 21 cities. The GYTS surveyed 43,950 students during 2000–2005.
Results

The current smoking rate ranged from 10.7% to 29.4%. Among never smokers, susceptibility to initiate smoking ranged from 20.2% to 34.4%. Among current smokers, the percentage who bought their cigarettes in a store was above 40% in 6 cities, but significantly declined over five years in the only city with two assessments (Monterrey). Exposure to secondhand smoke in public places was greater than 50% in 15 of the 21 cities. Over 80% of students in all 21 cities reported that they saw of advertisements for cigarettes on billboards.
Conclusion

Using determinants measured by GYTS in Mexico, the government can monitor the impact of enforcing various provisions of the National Health Law and the progress made in achieving the goals of the WHO FCTC and the Regional strategy. When these goals are met, tobacco consumption and exposure in Mexico will have declined substantially.

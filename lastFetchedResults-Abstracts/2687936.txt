The main objective of this work is to simulate the behavior of superconducting fault current limiters (SFCLs) in the electric power grid. We investigate the transient behavior of SFCL devices when subjected to a fault current in a simple network. The simulated devices are a resistive SFCL and an air coil SFCL, both equipped with 2G HTS conductors. Simulations are performed in EMTP-ATP by means of a thermal-electrical analogy model. The limiting performance, voltages at buses, resistance, and the temperature rise of both devices are obtained. The results suggest that both SFCLs are able to protect the proposed network.

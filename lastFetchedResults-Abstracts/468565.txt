Objective: Between 1986 and 2000, 204 cases of endometrial carcinoma were managed at Good Samaritan Hospital and Samaritan Regional Cancer Center, both located in Corvallis, Ore. Too often in the private practice setting, accurate outcome data and critical review of appropriateness of care are insufficient or lacking. The current review is the first in-depth examination of endometrial malignancies treated in Corvallis since the author's arrival in 1985. Study Design: Data were retrieved through confidential review of hospital, Cancer Center, and office charts of all patients treated for endometrial carcinoma during the previous 15 years. Results: Treatment modalities included surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and combinations thereof. Seventy-six percent of the cases were surgical stage I, 9% were stage II, 10% were stage III, and 5% were stage IV. Tumors were predominantly grade 1 or 2, which accounted for 69% of the total. Twenty-seven percent were grade 3 or undifferentiated. The overall 5-year disease-free survival was 86%. Conclusion: The outcomes for this patient population compare favorably with previously published survival data from larger studies. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1573-8.)

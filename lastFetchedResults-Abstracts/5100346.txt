It is a typical economic rule that productivity of science and technology is allocated on different levels by the effect of technology elements, and the flow of scientific and technological is one of hot problems in academic circles. Based on the perfect mechanism, the paper establishes a linear programming model of effect of technology elements flow, under the restrict conditions of resources available, environmental bearing capacity, system constraints extent and the amount of scientific and technological elements. To maximize the objective function, the optimal solution is also presented in the condition of network with unipolar city. The paper tries to discover the optimal scale, the optimal path, and the optimal distribution for the most effect, and it is concluded that, the change of regional allocation of productivity of science and technology is the result of the space flow of technology elements.

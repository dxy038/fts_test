Crashes in intersections caused by a violation of traffic signals or stop signs amount to a significant portion of all vehicle crashes. The percentage of fatal crashes that occur at intersections remains constant over the years at nearly 22% of all crashes. Vehicle-to Infrastructure (V2I) communications is a powerful technology that can address some of these crash scenarios. In order for tV2I based vehicle safety systems to be tested for correct functionality, and Field Operational Test (FOT) readiness, Objective Test Procedures (OTP) have to be adopted. The Vehicle Safety Communications 2 (VSC-2) Consortium developed a Cooperative Intersection Collision Avoidance System Violations (CICAS-V) and, in cooperation with the Research and Innovative Technology AdministrationÂ´s Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT). Using cooperatively developed OTP the performance of the CICAS-V was tested to determine if the system could be driven by naive drivers on open roads. The CICAS-V was tested against all the OTP and successfully passed every test.

Proposes the CBLO (clustering-based linear ordering) algorithm, which consists of both global ordering and local ordering. In the global ordering, the algorithm forms clusters from n given vertices and orders the clusters. In the local ordering, the elements in each cluster are linearly ordered. The linear order thus produced is used to obtain optimal k-way partitioning based on a scaled cost objective function. Experiments with 11 benchmark circuits for k-way (2&#10877;k&#10877;10) partitioning showed that the proposed algorithm yields an average of 10.6% improvement over MELO (multiple-eigenvector linear ordering) for k-way scaled cost partitioning

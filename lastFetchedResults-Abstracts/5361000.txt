The master-slave control scheme for uniform current distribution among converter modules in a parallel connected converter system is presented in this paper. The objective of the paper is to introduce a fuzzy logic control application, develop the associated mathematical theory and prove the concept and its advantages through comparative simulation with existing, classical methods. A stable fuzzy logic controller for the master-slave current distribution loops of a paralleled DC-DC system is demonstrated. Simulation results show a good parameter insensitive transient response over a wide range load-step responses and no current fluctuation. Load resistance has step form 15 Omega, to 10 Omega.

The objective is reliable digital communications over fading channels with severe time-dispersion. Three short-block data detection techniques based on linear, nonlinear decision-directed, and maximum likelihood estimation principles are investigated. Short alternating blocks of data and training symbols are used. The training blocks are useful for both channel tracking and data block detection. In contrast to the recursive symbol-to-symbol equalization approaches usually employed, each data block is detected as a unit. Previous restrictions imposed on short-block detection schemes have been removed, resulting in reduced complexity algorithms and higher throughput efficiency. Performance is presented for BPSK and QPSK type signaling using a Rayleigh fading channel model with severe time-dispersion

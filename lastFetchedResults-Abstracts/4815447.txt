An innovative conversion system called synchronous active front-end (SAFE) is considered one of the most efficient solutions that successfully manages the well known trade-off between high power handling and good power quality. In wind energy applications switching converters are used to transfer the captured power to the grid. Their non-linear behavior must be considered, since the injected power must respect strict condition of power quality (PQ). SAFE bidirectional behaviour also permits high performance active parallel compensation and the voltage level regulation. A point of common couple (PCC) voltage regulation method is presented, also characterized by a new feed forward action

An ultra-wideband (UWB) pulse generator using a pulse combination method is analyzed. The proposed analytical model characterizes the transient behavior of the pulse generation circuit. The spectral response of the analytical model shows high relevance with the objective Gaussian pulse, which can be used to modify the spectral response of the UWB signal. Also the pulse combined UWB pulse generator is designed and tested with standard 0.18 mum CMOS technology. The test results show that the peak amplitude is 181.14-mVpp, and the pulse-width is 500 ps.

This paper develops a hybrid system for solving a service restoration problem in distribution systems using expert systems and genetic algorithms. The main objective in service restoration procedure is to restore as many loads as possible by transferring de-energized loads via network reconfigurations to other supporting distribution feeders without violating operating and engineering constraints. The expert system determines switch operations to expand the supply margin of power sources in a case where the total power source capacity is not enough to restore the whole out-of-service areas. The genetic algorithm determines a part of out-of-service area for each power source. The feasibility of the developed algorithm for service restoration is demonstrated on a distribution network with promising results

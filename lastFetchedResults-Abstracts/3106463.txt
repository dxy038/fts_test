The Passive A-Band Wind Sounder (PAWS) project is funded through NASAÂ´s Instrument Incubator Program (IIP). The objective of PAWS is to demonstrate an instrument concept for measuring wind speed profiles in the troposphere using Doppler shifts in selected oxygen absorption lines. PAWS is a daytime-only approach, but has the potential to provide better wind data than is currently available with significantly lower cost, risk, and platform requirements than lidar. This paper will provide an overview of the PAWS approach and progress on the instrument development.

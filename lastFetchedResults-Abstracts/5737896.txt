In this paper, a flow of characterization of embedded operating systemÂ´s energy consumption is presented. The objective is to determine the energy overhead of the services of the embedded OS, we interest particularly on the context switch service. The modeling is based on measurements on the hardware platform OMAP35x EVM board, running Linux omap. Based on the analysis results, a relationship between energy overhead and a set of hardware and software parameters is established.

Grid workflow scheduling in large scale e-Business applications is a complex optimization problem which may require consideration of different scheduling criteria to achieve various quality of service (QoS) requirements. Meanwhile, the researches on grid workflow scheduling mainly focus on the constraint of time and cost, the key requirements about trustworthiness arenÂ´t considered adequately. Aiming at this problem, a new trustworthiness-based scheduling model is proposed for the grid workflows scheduling which is multi-objective optimization problem in general, meanwhile, A integer genetic algorithm (IGA) is presented to optimize the scheduling performance. The simulation results show that as a robust, multi-criteria scheduling algorithms, the performance of IGA is very promising. The scheduling can succeed in open and dynamic grid environments, and its result in e-Business Application is trustworthiness and robustness.

The main objective of the paper is to present the computational model of a bi-cable aerial ropeway, which provides a scope for investigating the nonlinear interaction between the carrying cable motion and the swaying motion of traveling passenger carriers, depending on cable track inclination. To solve nonlinear equations of motion of two coupled sub-systems: multi-span cable and carriers idealized as physical pendulums, the special numerical method is developed, where initial vibrations of carriers (before entering a cable track) are used as a base for predicting further history of motion. Numerical analysis performed for different inclinations of a cable track led to the conclusion that nonlinear interaction effects are not significant and can be neglected to simplify the computational procedure in further research.

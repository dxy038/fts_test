A delay-differential equation modelling a bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural network with three neurons is investigated. Its dynamics are studied in terms of local analysis and Hopf bifurcation analysis. By analyzing the associated characteristic equation, its linear stability is investigated and Hopf bifurcations are demonstrated. The stability and direction of the Hopf bifurcation are determined by applying the normal form theory and the center manifold reduction. Numerical simulation results are given to support the theoretical predictions.

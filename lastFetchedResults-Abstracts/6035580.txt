The control problem of bi-directional (back-to-back) converters is approached in this paper. The controller design is carried out by following the so-called Interconnection and Damping Assignment - Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) technique. The contribution is two-fold, namely, the solution of the mixed, regulation and tracking, control problem imposed by the converter and the illustration that the passivity methodology can be also applied when more complicated loads than simple resistances are considered. The proposed controller is numerically evaluated considering its operation when bidirectional energy flows are introduced.

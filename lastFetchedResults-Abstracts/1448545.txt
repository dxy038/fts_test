Background and Objective: Long period risk of gastric carcinoma in people affected with chronic
Helicobacter pylori gastritis is 5 times more than normal people. Perhaps histological changes due
to helicobacter pylori infection could be used for screening people at risk of gastric carcinoma and
peptic ulcer.
Materials and Methods: This study has been carried out as a cross-sectional process and we
compared histological changes observed in Helicobacter pylori chronic gastritis in 30 patients with
peptic ulcer and 30 patients without the ulcer and then classified them according to Sydney scoring
system, and after collecting data, we analyzed them by SPSS software.
Results: Sixty percent of patients with ulcer were male and forty percent were female. In addition,
56.7% of patients without ulcer were male and 43/3% were female without a statistically significant
difference (p = 0.793). Mean age in ulcer group was 56.4 years and in non-ulcer group was 48.9
years that there was no significant statistical difference (p = 0.057). Chronic gastritis frequency
increases within people in their sixth decade and after that. There was no significant difference for
degree of infection with Helicobacter pylori (p = 0.346), metaplasia (p =0.885), chronicity (p = 0.796)
and degree of activity (p = 0.249), atrophy (p = 0.781) in patients with or without ulcer.
Conclusion: There was no significant difference in any of the variables of the study including
degree of infection with Helicobacter pylori, chronicity, disease activity and intestinal metaplasia
between both groups with and without peptic ulcer.

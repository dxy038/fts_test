The DG systems are quickly becoming an energy management solution that saves money, resources, and environment in one compact and scalable package - be it stationary or mobile, remote or interconnected with the utility grid. The Distributed generation based on microturbine technology is new and a fast growing business. In this paper the detailed model of a single-shaft MTG system suitable for both grid connected and islanding operation has been presented, which is practically feasible. The developed model allows the bidirectional power flow between grid and MTG system. For the purpose of modeling, a dynamic model for each component in the system, including microturbine, PMSM, m/c side converter controller, line side controller and LCL filter is developed. The results are validated in MATLAB/SIMULINK.

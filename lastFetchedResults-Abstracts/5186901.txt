In multiple antenna systems, the impact of concurrent systems depends on the spatial signature of the noise plus interference. We model a two player game in which the user and the jammer have independently fading MIMO channels with different types of channel state information. The objective function is the average performance measured as the trace of an arbitrary matrix-monotone function. For no and perfect CSI, we characterize the saddle-point. For statistical channel information, the optimal transmit strategies are characterized.

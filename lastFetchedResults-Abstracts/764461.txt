A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2008 to June 2009 with the objective of estimating the prevalence of camel trypanosomosis (surra) and identifying the species of trypanosome involved in Jijiga Zone.  The method employed was the Buffy coat examination under microscope. The overall prevalence of camel trypanosomosis was found to be 3.9% (14/362), and the only species identified was Trypanosoma evansi.  The prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi was not significantly (P  < 0.05) varied between males (3.6%) and females (3.9%) camels. Higher prevalence of trypanosomosis observed in adult camels (4.5%), and no young camel (0 to 4 years) was found positive. The mean PCV was significantly (P  < 0.05) lower in parasitaemic camels (24.7%) than in aparasitaemic camels (28.9%). The result of his study showed that camel trypanosomosis is prevalent in Jijiga zone and it is a disease of major economic importance in the area.

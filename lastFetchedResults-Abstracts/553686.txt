Calling followers of other religions to Islam (<dawa) has mostly been accompanied by one of these three alternatives: to accept Islam, to pay Jizya, or to enter into a war. Proposing to accept Islam upon to Iranians is reported by various sources. The content of these reports are of two distinctive aspects: the formal and objective aspect of the events, the religious spiritual aspect associated with approaches and insights of the reporters. Different reports of the same event and contradictory ideas in these reports raise some questions: Were the Muslims able to invite the Sassanids forces to accept Islam before any war? What kind of options may have come up regarding the three alternatives? And why the main sources have considered "dacwa" as a main issue? What is the reason for the differences between the reports, and what are the motivations of the contradictory ideas? The present article investigates kkdacwa" of Iranians or more precisely of the Sassanids to Islam with the purpose of revealing the difficulties of historical reports.

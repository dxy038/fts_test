Our objective in this work is to synthesize dynamically consistent motion for a simulated humanoid robot in acyclic multi-contact locomotion using multi-objective control. We take as an input a planned sequence of static postures that represent the contact configuration transitions; a multi-objective controller then synthesizes the motion between these postures, the objectives of the controller being decided by a finite-state machine. Results of this approach are presented in the attached video in the form of playback motions generated through non-real-time constraint-based dynamic simulations.

Objective To analyze sequence characteristics and genetic polymorphisms of nine new Y-chromosomal short tandem repeats (Y-STR) in Han population from Hangjiahu Plain in east China, and to evaluate their applications of forensic science. Methods Blood samples of 159 unrelated male individuals from Hangjiahu Plain Han population were genotyped by PCR. The allele and haplotype frequencies of nine Y-STR loci were calculated by the counting method. Results 9 Y-STR loci (DYS522, DYS549, DYS556, DYS565, DYS568, DYS570, DYS594, DYS593, DYS588) are single copy, and 7, 5, 5, 4, 6, 9, 4, 4, 8 alleles were detected respectively. The gene diversity (GD) value ranged from 0.1434 to 0.7994. A total of 136 haplotypes were found, and the haplotype diversity was 0.997. None of Y-STR allele mutation was observed in the 30 father/son pairs with demonstrated paternity. Conclusion The identifying power of 9 Y-STR loci was higher. Nine Y-STR loci developed by us are suitable genetic markers for forensic applications.

Objective

Febrile seizures are the most common cause of seizure in children. Identification of risk factors is very important. This study was conducted to determine the association between the serum copper level and simple febrile seizure in children.

Materials & Methods

In this study, 30 children with simple febrile seizures (case group) were compared with 30 children with febrile illness without seizures (control group) regarding serum copper level. This study was conducted in Qazvin children’s hospital (Qazvin, Iran).

Results

The mean serum copper levels in the case and control groups were 141.41±30.90 and 129.43±18.97 mcg/dl, respectively. This difference was not significant statistically.

Conclusion

This study revealed that there is no association between serum copper levels and febrile seizures. It seems that copper deficiency is not a risk factor for febrile seizures in children.

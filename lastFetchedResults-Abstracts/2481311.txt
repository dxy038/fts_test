     In this study, the effect of hot water and Alkaline treatment of wood on the physical and mechanical properties of polypropylene-wood flour composites was investigated. To meet this objective, first the wood flour was placed under the hot water and alkaline treatment in the bathroom in 60 0C for 60 minutes. After the treatment of wood, the polypropylene and wood flour with mass ratio of 60/40 and 4 phc coupling agent were combined in hake internal mixer. The samples were made by injection molding. Then physical and mechanical properties such as flexural, tensile, impact, water absorption and thickness swelling of treated and control samples were tested according to ASTM standard. The FTIR spectroscopy was used to ensure the hot water and alkaline treatment of wood flour. Results indicated that the flexural strength, flexural modulus, tensile strength, tensile modulus and impact strength increased by hot water and alkaline treatment. However, the water absorption and thickness swelling decreased by hot water and alkaline treatment. The hot water and alkaline treatment led to a decrease of OH group absorbance on 3420-3425 cm-1 which shows the treatment of wood flour. The sharp peak in 1740 cm-1 was shown in the control samples which decreased in the hot water treatment and disappeared in alkaline treatment. In addition, the results revealed that the highest mechanical properties and dimensional stability was reached in the samples which were treated with alkaline component.

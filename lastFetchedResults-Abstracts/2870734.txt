The schedule set is an important part in the cold rolling process, which directly affects product quality and production efficiency in the production of steel rolling. Due to the low precision of traditional rolling force model, a model of rolling force was founded by the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) method though analyzing the influencing factors of rolling force. Considering the diversity of optimization goal on rolling schedule of cold tandem rolling, the rolling schedule was optimized by competitive coevolution algorithm (Comp-CEA). A rolling schedule of steel cold rolling mill in Tangshan was optimized by selecting the power distribution, excellent flatness and the slip rate as objective functions. The experiment results show that Comp-CEA has the advantages such as high accuracy, rapid convergence and so on, and three objective functions can be improved in varying degrees.

Cooperation is the fundamental characteristic of multiagent system and, cooperation structure is central to the study of multiagent cooperation. At present, all the previous studies focus on the description to the negotiation, the conflict, the benefit distribution, the cooperation process and the cooperation evolution with game theory or multimodal theory and, very little is known about the analysis of the multiagent cooperation structure. Two kinds of multiagent cooperation structures were provided in literature: the complete cooperation structure and the incomplete structure, but the objective exchanging and the number of both sides were neglected. This paper begins with an introduction of the current status of research on the multiagent cooperation and definition of multiagent cooperation, then sixteen cooperation structures are provided according to the three dimensions, whether cooperation is complete, whether the objective exchanging of both sides exists, and the number of both sides. Furthermore, a set of communication primitives is designed for multiagent cooperation. Finally, algorithms of realizing the cooperation structures that presented in this paper were described.

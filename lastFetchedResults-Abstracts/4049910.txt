The main objective of the paper is the determination of the partial-fraction-expansion coefficients in matrix form for systems having any number of distinct and multiple poles anywhere in the complex plane. The aim is to avoid the conventional Heaviside technique which involves repeated differentiations. The use of matrix equation makes the method most general and adaptable for the simulation of single-input/single-output systems, and, furthermore, it can also be extended to multivariable-systems modelling.

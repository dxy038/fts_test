The paper presents a Predictive Direct Torque and Flux Control (PDTFC) of an induction machine fed by a Direct Matrix Converter (DMC). The method combines the merits of Finite States Model Predictive Control (FSMPC) with the ones of DTC control. The proposed control algorithm selects the switching state of the DMC that minimizes the error between torque and flux predictions to their computed values for all different voltage vectors. The optimal voltage vector that minimizes a cost function is then applied to the terminal of the induction machine. Moreover, the proposed predictive control is easily extended to minimize the reactive power in the voltage source side. The control method uses only one sample time and it is very intuitive since it is simple, multi-objective and provides best performances compared to other control laws (fast dynamic response, simple implementation).

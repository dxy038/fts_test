This paper aims to give an overview of the recent development and benefits of model predictive control in wind turbines and its future potential. For a modern large wind turbine, the main objective of control is to maximise the power production while maintaining the fatigue loads to be minimal. With such multiple objectives, a multivariable system and actuators constraints the popular PI controller may become ineffective or hard to tune whereas MPC provides a systematic approach for designing a multivariable controller incorporating the knowledge of actuator constraints. This paper reviews the wind turbine control problem and in particular gives a survey of the use of model predictive control on wind turbines.

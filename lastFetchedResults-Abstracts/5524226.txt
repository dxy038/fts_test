Due to the heterogeneity and versatility of emerging services and applications in wireless networks, it has been a great challenge on improving the network utility by taking advantage of the spatial and temporal diversity of radio resource consumption. This paper is committed to solving this problem by introducing a service-aware spectrum sharing algorithm (SSA) in a joint radio resource management (JRRM) architecture, where a spectrum pool is adopted for leisure spectrum resource management in heterogeneous wireless networks. Based on an objective utility function, the JRRM unit could optimize the spectrum scheduling decisions for the composing networks with awareness of the related supporting services. Moreover, to facilitate a precise decision process, we illustrate an transmission rate requirement prediction model (TRPM) that is adaptive to the system condition variants to forecast service requests. Experiment results show that the proposed SSA can solidly enhance the system performance in terms of radio resource usage ratio, system throughput, user service access ratio, and eventually achieve better network utility.

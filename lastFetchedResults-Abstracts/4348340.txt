In orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, efficient resource allocation is very important to improve the performance of the OFDMA system. The general principle of resource allocation in an OFDMA system is to assign each subcarrier to the user with the best channel condition for that subcarrier. However, in delay tolerant traffic, current work did not consider that packets on retransmissions may have different allocation criteria from those on their first transmissions. In this paper, the resource allocation scheme is investigated by considering different criterions to packets on first transmissions and on retransmissions. Under a bit error rate (BER) constraint, the objective is to maximize the throughput of packets on first transmissions, meanwhile decreasing the longest packet delay caused by retransmitted packets and guaranteeing all packets on retransmissions to be sent out. A low-complexity suboptimal algorithm that separates allocation for packets on retransmissions and on first transmissions is proposed. Adaptive modulation scheme is adopted to guarantee the BER constraint, except the modulation for each retransmitted packet remains the same. In order to improve retransmission liability, the retransmitted packets are combined with its failed packets in previous transmission.

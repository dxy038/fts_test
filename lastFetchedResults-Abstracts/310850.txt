Objective.  The purpose of the study was to describe a new static triaxial dynamometer designed to monitor the lateral bending and axial rotation moments during trunk extension efforts.

Background. Most studies on back muscle function using electromyographic spectral analysis have not controlled moments produced about the three orthopaedic axes during trunk extension efforts. Criteria to control lateral bending and axial rotation moments during extension efforts have not been proposed in the literature.

Methods. Fourteen healthy subjects performed three trunk extension ramp contractions (0â€“100% of the maximal voluntary contraction). Triaxial L5/S1 moments at 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% of the maximal voluntary contraction in extension were extracted.

Results. During the extension efforts, the lateral bending and axial rotation moments at L5/S1 increased significantly across the force levels and reached 6.2 Nm (SD: 6.6) and 6.1 Nm (SD: 4.5), respectively, at 80% of the maximal voluntary contraction. Tolerance limits were proposed to control these associated efforts in the context of the electromyographic analysis of back muscles.

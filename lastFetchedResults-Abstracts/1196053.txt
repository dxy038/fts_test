This study is made with an aim of prediction satisfaction of psychological wellbeing

standards and irrational beliefs. Statistical community of the research
includes students of five major universities in Iran. These universities were of
Tehran University, Shaheed Beheshti University, Al-Zahra University, Qum
University, and Garmsar University totaling 1,036 subjects altogether. The
instrument of the research was Jones' life satisfaction with psychological wellbeing

criteria and irrational beliefs experiments. Results showed that on the
psychological well-being there were meaningful correlation between self and
interrelations with others with an objective life and commitments over
environment and an unmeaning relation with dimensions of character
development and autonomy with reference to life satisfaction. Of the tenfold
dimensions of irrational beliefs too, there were meaningful correlations on the
aspects of 'Demanding to be approved by others, High self-expectation, Blaming
proneness, Frustration reactive, Anxious over-concern, Problem avoidance,
Dependency, Helplessness for change, and Perfectionism' but just on 'Emotional
irresponsibility' there was an unmeaning relation on establishing life satisfaction.

Objective: We sought to establish an association between preeclampsia and the methionine to threonine polymorphism at amino acid residue 235 (Met235Thr) in angiotensinogen in a Hispanic population. We looked for a relationship between this allele and the allele in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (NOS3) that produces the A form (NOS3*A) with respect to preeclampsia. Study Design: Clinical data were collected from 87 patients with preeclampsia and 53 control subjects. Patients and controls were genotyped for the angiotensinogen polymorphism allele (AGT*T) and the NOS3*A polymorphism. We then compared patients with preeclampsia and control subjects and investigated disease severity within the preeclampsia group as a function of genotype. Results: The AGT*T allelic frequencies among patients with preeclampsia and control subjects were 0.72 and 0.70, respectively (P = .84). The blood pressure of patients with an AGT*T allele who also carried a NOS3*A allele was higher at earlier gestational ages (r = â€“0.052; P = .02). Analysis suggested that the systolic blood pressure differences were due to gestational age effects and the presence of a NOS3*A allele (P< .10). Conclusion: The AGT*T allele was not associated with the development of preeclampsia. Independently of the presence of an AGT*T allele, the NOS3*A allele was associated with a higher blood pressure at an earlier gestational age. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:1345-51.)

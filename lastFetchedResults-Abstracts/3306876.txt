The aim of this paper is to see and analyze different product development methodologies specifically on SWET Concept &amp; Green product design Manufacturing. Companies can achieve and be benefited by waste management and material management, saving through the reuse of original product, reduce time to market, reducing human efforts and ecological risks, cost effectiveness, improving process efficiency, and creating products and processes that are Environmental friendly throughout its life. Green design system implementation in every field is very necessary as the whole world is feared of global warming. Therefore it is necessary to think about green designing process and SWET design. The main objective of green design reduce or minimize the use of non-renewable resources, Manage renewable resources to insure sustainability and reduce with the ultimate goal of eliminating, toxic and otherwise harmful emissions to the environment, including emissions contributing to global warming.

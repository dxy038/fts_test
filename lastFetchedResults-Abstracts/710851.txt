Study Objective
To explore the effect of young age on the outcome of teenage pregnancies by studying teenage deliveries in our unique population.
Design, Setting, and Participants
Retrospective chart review of teenage gravidas (age 19 and younger), who had delivered in our hospital.
Outcome Measures
Mode of delivery, gestational age at delivery, newborn's weight and Apgar scores and maternal and neonatal complications.
Results
We recruited 565 teenage delivery cases from the hospital's computerized database. Mean maternal age was 18 (14–19). Most (96%) were married. Fifty-one percent were Jewish and 44% were Muslim. Most of the girls were nulligravidas. Mean gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks (33–44 weeks). A normal vaginal delivery ensued in 72.7%, while 9% had a cesarean section and 17.4% instrumental deliveries (compared to 85.75%, 10% and 4.25% in our adult population, respectively) and 1% underwent vaginal breech delivery. Mean birth weight was 3108 g (1450–4980 g). Apgar score of 9 at 5 minutes was recorded in 97.8% of the newborns. Prenatal care included a mean of 6 prenatal visits with a range of 1–18. The main complication was anemia; 41% had hemoglobin levels of less than 11 g/dL. The rate of other complications was low.
Conclusions
In our homogenous group of teenagers, there was a similar complication rate as in the adult population. The only significant complication was anemia (less than 11 g/dL). There was a higher rate of instrumental deliveries and the cesarean delivery rate was slightly lower than in our adult population. Teenage pregnancy should not be considered as a high-risk situation as long as it is planned and followed with the normal routines of prenatal care.

Data transmission between an inverter and a motor is usually ensured through dedicated cables. However, for many applications and especially in aircraft, the weight of the wiring is becoming critical. One possible technique to decrease the number of wires is to implement a power line communication (PLC) on the 3-phase power cable connecting the inverter and the motor. The objective of this paper is first to present experimental results on noise measurements, both in the frequency and in the time domain. Secondly, a software tool has been built to simulate a PLC communication based on the HomePlugAV specifications or on the OPERA specifications. A parametric study was performed to outline the influence of the impulsive noise on the link performances.

Methods: S<sub>180</sub> entity-tumor mice as study model were used to investigate effects of Geranium Wilfordiitannin on tumor inhibition rate and indices of immune organs of S<sub>180</sub> mice; kits were used to determine SOD activity and T-AOC activity in red blood cells and MDA content of red blood cells in the whole blood of S<sub>180</sub> mice. Results: Geranium Wilfordiitannin could significantly inhibit growth of S<sub>180</sub> entity-tumor, significantly increase thymus index and spleen index, significantly increase SOD activity and T-AOC activity in red blood cells of S<sub>180</sub> mice and significantly reduce MDA content of red blood cells in the whole blood of S<sub>180</sub> mice. Conclusion: Geranium Wilfordiitannin could significantly inhibit the growth of entity-tumors of S<sub>180</sub> mice and its effect mechanism was possibly associated with increase of antioxidant function of S<sub>180</sub> entity-tumor mice.

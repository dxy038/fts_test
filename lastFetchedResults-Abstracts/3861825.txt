The multiscale method has become a promising tool that could make a significant contribution to the fields of nano-science and technology. The objective of the multiscale method makes it possible to treat ever larger systems.Current study proposes a new model that combines the atomistic and continuum approaches. The continuum model is built on the lattice view and its critical deformation extent is defined for refinement (broken down into smaller lattices or atoms). Both the lattice and atoms can be calculated together using atomistic and coarse potentials without a calculation interface. This coarse particle model was applied to a nanocontact study and the results were compared to a traditional contact model.

Fast-running response surface models that approximate multivariate input/output relationships of time-consuming physical-based computer models enable effective finite element (FE) model updating analyses. In this paper, a response surface-based FE model updating procedure for civil engineering structures in structural dynamics is presented. The key issues to implement such a model updating are discussed such as sampling with design of experiments, selecting the significant updating parameters and constructing a quadratic polynomial response surface. The objective function is formed by the residuals between analytical and measured natural frequencies. Single-objective optimization with equal weights of natural frequency residual of each mode is used for optimization computation. The proposed procedure is illustrated by a simulated simply supported beam and a full-size precast continuous box girder bridge tested under operational vibration conditions. The results have been compared with those obtained from the traditional sensitivity-based FE model updating method. The real application to a full-size bridge has demonstrated that the FE model updating process is efficient and converges fast with the response surface to replace the original FE model. With the response surface at hand, an optimization problem is formulated explicitly. Hence, no FE calculation is required in each optimization iteration. The response surface-based FE model updating can be easily implemented in practice with available commercial FE analysis packages.

Background and Objective: The effect of Cynara scolymus L. (CS) feeding on serum glucose and lipids was investigated in an experimental model of diabetes mellitus. 

Materials and Methods: Female rats were divided into equal-sized control CS-treated control, diabetic, and CS-treated diabetic groups. To induce diabetes, Streptozotcin (STZ) was intraperitoneally administered (60 mg/Kg, single dose). CS-treated groups received CS mixed with standard pelleted food at a weight ratio of 6.25% for 6 weeks. Serum glucose and lipid levels were measured before the study and at weeks 3 and 6. 

Results: Serum glucose level showed a significant increase in diabetic animals (P<0.0001) and at 6th week, this was significantly attenuated in CS-treated diabetic group (P<0.005) compared to the untreated diabetics. Moreover, serum triglyceride level was inappropriately higher in CS-treated diabetic group compared to diabetics. In addition, serum total cholesterol level was non-significantly lower in CS-treated diabetic group compared to the diabetic one. On the other hand, HDL-cholesterol level was significantly higher in CS-treated control and the diabetic groups as compared to the untreated control and diabetic groups (p<0.005-0.001). In addition, LDL-cholesterol reduced in treated diabetic rats compared to the diabetics (p<0.005).

Conclusion: Oral administration of CS has hypoglycemic effect and leads to appropriate changes in serum HDL- and LDL-cholesterol in diabetic rats.

This paper presents a coordinated control technique that allows heterogeneous vehicles to autonomously search for and track multiple targets using recursive Bayesian filtering. A unified sensor model and a unified objective function are proposed to enable search-and-tracking (SAT) within the recursive Bayesian filter framework. The strength of the proposed technique is that a vehicle can switch its task mode between search and tracking while maintaining and using information collected during the operation. Numerical results first show the effectiveness of the proposed technique when a found target becomes lost and must be searched for again. The proposed technique was then applied to a practical marine search-and-rescue (SAR) scenario where heterogeneous vehicles coordinated to search for and track multiple targets. The result demonstrates the applicability of the technique to real search world scenarios

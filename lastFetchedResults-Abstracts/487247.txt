Objective(s): The present study was aimed to design a knowledge transfer model that would provide a conceptual framework for linking the different components of a knowledge translation cycle. Such a theoretical model will enable us to organize and evaluate the current situation and design further studies on the transfer of research generated knowledge.
Methods: This research, performed in 2006-7 in Tehran University of Medical Sciences, utilized two distinct methodologies: the first part was a narrative review with the goal of identifying the existing knowledge transfer models; the second part included focus group discussions to find out the views and opinions of researchers and decision-makers concerning the factors that promote or hinder knowledge translation within the health system.
Results: The two studies have provided the input for designing a "Knowledge Translation Cycle" with five domains: Knowledge Creation, Knowledge Transfer, Research Utilization, Question Transfer, and the Context of University. Within each domain, the model includes two components (with the exception of the university context).
Conclusion: This model offers a theoretical basis for identifying the basic requirements and the linking mechanisms for the translation of knowledge.

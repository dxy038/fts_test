This paper reviews some popular techniques to harvest energy for implantable biosensors. For each technique, the advantages and drawbacks are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the inductive links that are able to deliver power wirelessly through the biological tissues and enable bidirectional data communication with the implanted sensors. Finally, high-frequency inductive links are described, focusing also on the power absorbed by the tissues.

The multi-angle capabilities of WorldView-2 are discussed in the framework of the GRSS Data Fusion Contest. Multi-angular surface reflectance measurements of grass, trees, and water are derived from the atmospherically corrected image sequence and compared to top of the atmosphere reflectance values. If the atmospheric effects are ignored, the top of the atmosphere values show significant spectral distortions for higher off-nadir acquisitions not resulting only from the bidirectional reflectance effects. The contest will be open for approximately another month. So far, more than 700 participants from 95 different countries have downloaded the imagery.

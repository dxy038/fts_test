The performances of light-weight and the anti-damage are a pair of conflicting optimization goals. Basing on the damage data of explosion simulation, it studies multi-objective optimization of cantilever box girder about lightweight and anti-damage. Firstly, the method of PCA is introduced to mine the damage data of simulation experiments. Secondly - the regression function about the damage of cantilever box girder is established. Finally, a multi-objective optimization problem is put forward and a calculating example is solved. The introduction of PCA for damage data mining makes a convenient combination point for two different research domains (the battle damage simulation and the structure optimization of equipment).

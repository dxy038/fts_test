ABSTRACT:The main objective of this study was to determine the effects of vermicompost and plant density on morphological traits and biomass productionof mungbean (Vigna radiata). The experiment was conducted during the growing season of 2010 at the Agricultural Research Station of Sarab Changaiee in Khoramabad. The Treatment groups consisted of vermicompost (0, 5, 10 and 15 tonha-1) and plant density (D1= 6, D2= 12 and D3=18 cm between plants on the rows). The experimental design was a factorial experiment based on Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. The present results have shown that vermicompost and plant density had significant effects on measured traits, except for plant height. According to the results of this investigation 10 ton vermicompost per hectare and 33.3 plants per m2 caused highest increase in plants characteristics.

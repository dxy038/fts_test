An intelligent control of the automated highway system for the guidance of four wheeled vehicles is proposed. The control objective is to find one control law that can automatically guide the new-generation smart vehicles when driving in the highway under the effects of uncertain disturbance as wind gust, etc. We successfully propose one control law for designing the intelligent control of four wheeled vehicles based on concepts of GPS, fuzzy control, and robust control.

The main objective of the present study was to gain insights into factors contributing to increased crime rate in suburban areas. Research evidence has shown that, in spite of problems created by suburban areas, it is possible to use these areas as an opportunity to help reduce urban problems. Living in suburban areas is both a threat and an opportunity. The population of the present study was those living in suburban areas. To collect the data, we made use of lawsuit cases and interviews with prisoners. The results indicate that the contributing factors are high rate of unemployment, lack of services, lack of recreational and health-related facilities, and not being used to urban life. The research design was descriptive and every attempt was made to take into consideration all the suggestions received.

The Massively Parallel Processing Project started in 1992 as a priority area of research for the Ministry of Education in Japan. The objective of this research project is to establish the basic technology of massively parallel processing which is expected to be the fundamental tool to develop the high-level technologies of the 21st century. The main goal of this project is to build up a system prototype of a massively parallel processing system. This paper describes the organization of this project and discusses the research results up to this time

We present a bidirectional wireless bridge in the W-band enabling the seamless convergence between the wireless and fiber-optic access networks. In the downlink, a 16 Gbit/s QPSK signal is photonically up-converted at the wireless transmitter and electrically down-converted at the wireless receiver. The down-converted signal is re-modulated on to the lightwave and transmit further through the fiber-optic system. In the uplink, both up-and down-conversion are performed by electrical means. Furthermore, we investigate both passive and active wireless transmitters in this work for both downlink and uplink transmissions. With an active wireless transmitter, up to 15 meters wireless transmission is successfully achieved with a BER below the 7% FEC limit in the downlink.

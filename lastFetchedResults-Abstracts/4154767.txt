Computer-Assisted transurethral laser resection of the prostate (CALRP) is a treatment modality that was designed and developed based on an integrated system of computer, robotics and laser technology in association with a minimally invasive surgery known as laser transurethral resection of the prostate (LRP), CALRP possesses complementary capabilities that could remedy many of the problems faced by surgeons in conventional LRP by delivering a treatment with repeatability and reliability. The work deals primarily in determining the feasibility study of the computer-assisted lasing motion plan (planned motion sequence controlled by a program) for LRP. A theoretical motion plan that analyzes numerically the lasing motion of the fiber was designed by calculating the profile removal rate and in vitro experiments conducted on human cadaveric prostate to verify and validate the designed motion plan. The novel motion plan, which was executed experimentally using the LaserTrode lightguide, accomplished the objective of resecting the enlarged prostate with the aid of computer and robotics technology

Quantum Mechanics is supposed to be a general theory that applies to everything from subatomic particles to galaxies. If this were indeed to be so then Nature would be governed by the well-established reductionist principles of linearity and superpositions and the non-linear holism of emergence, self-organization, and complexity that we manifestly observe all around us would be absent. This paper seeks to explore these issues in relation to the theory of ChaNoXity [A. Sengupta, Chaos, nonlinearity, complexity: A unified perspective, in: A. Sengupta (Ed.), Chaos, Nonlinearity, and Complexity: The Dynamical Paradigm of Nature, in: Stud Fuzz, vol. 206, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2006, pp. 270â€“352] and proposes that Quantum Mechanics is an effective linear representation of the fully chaotic, maximally ill-posed negworld that manifests itself only through a bi-directional, contextually objective, inducement of the real world in adapting to the strictures of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

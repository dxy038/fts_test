Wideband radar with high range resolution can provide a wealth of objective information, but large volumes of data and calculations as a constraint to the problem of Wideband radar signal processing. Sub-band signal processing can decompose high-speed broadband signal to a low-rate narrow-band signals, greatly reducing the complexity of radar signal processing. The modulated filter design is the key of sub-band signal processing. Base on the research of modulated filter banks, M-band modulation filter applied to the sub-band pulse compression, a new optimization algorithm - Lagrange multipliers was presented. This method has higher efficiency, it is able to design filter banks of different lengths and same length.

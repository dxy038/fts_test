Objective: The recent study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic aerobic activity on the plasma levels of orexin A, leptin, glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance in males with type 2 diabetes.
Materials and Methods: Twenty subjects randomly assigned into control and experimental groups, involving 10 people in each group. Exercise protocol consisted of eight session aerobic exercise. Each session was done between 15 to 30 minutes so that in earlier weeks started with 50% of maximum heart rate for 15 minutes per day and continued with 80% of maximum heart rate for 30 minutes per day in last week. The heart rate was measured using heart rate monitor. Before the start of training and 48 hours after the last training session, blood samples were taken from both groups. 
Results: the mean age of participants was 45.40 ± 5.42 year, mean weight was 80.91 ± 6.35 kg, the mean of body mass index was 25.41 ± 2.76 kg/m2.The analysis of findings in the P?0.05 indicated that chronic aerobic exercise caused a significant increase in plasma leves of orexin A and significant decrease in insulin and insulin resistance, and leptin.
Conclusion: Chronic aerobic exercise can decrease the insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes via increasing the plasma levels of orexin A and decreasing in plasma level of glucose and insulin.

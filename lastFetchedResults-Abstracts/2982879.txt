In this article, a recently developed on-line subspace modal parameter estimation algorithm is modified for online structural damage detection. Simulations show that this method is able to detect small changes in the structural properties through an innovation vector. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the technique accomplishes the objective of rapidly detecting the occurrence of a change in the dynamic system using multiple sensors. The time-varying behavior is captured in real-time via a graphical display of the norm of the innovation vector of the system. Details of the digital signal processor implementation and the measurement system are also presented

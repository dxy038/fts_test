Objective: This research compares the Neurofeedback treatment and medication effects on Continuum performance improvement in male students with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Method: For this quasi-experimental method, 30 students (boys) with ADHD (ages 7-14) were randomly assigned to Neurofeedback treatment and medication groups. The Neurofeedback treatment group was treated in twenty 45-minute sessions for a period of 2 months and the medication group received Ritalin during that time. Results confirmed the efficacy of neurofeedback and medication in attention improvement and impulsivity reduction. No significant differences in Continuum performance improvement between the two treatment groups was found.

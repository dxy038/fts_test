Transient stability assessment (TSA) of a power system pursues a twofold objective: first to appraise the systemÂ´s capability to withstand major contingencies, and second to suggest remedial actions, i.e. means to enhance this capability, whenever needed. The first objective is the concern of analysis, the second is a matter of control. For the time being, the on-line TSA is still a totally open question. Indeed, none of the existing two broad classes of methods (the time domain and the direct methods) are able to meet the on-line requirements of the analysis aspects, nor are they in the least appropriate to tackle control aspects. The methodology we are introducing aims at solving the above stated on-line problem by making use of decision rules, preconstructed off-line. To this end, an inductive inference method is developed, able to provide decision rules in the form of binary trees expressing relationships between static, pre-fault operating conditions of a power system and its robustness to withstand assumed disturbances. This paper concentrates on this latter problem, which is the most difficult task, and also the kernel of the overall methodology. The proposed inductive inference (II) method pertains to a particular family of Machine Learning from examples. It derives from ID3 by Quinlan [1], tailored to our problem, where the examples are provided by numeric (load flow and stability) programs [2, 3]. According to the method, a decision tree (DT) is built on the basis of a preanalyzed learning set (LS), composed of states or operating points (OPs).

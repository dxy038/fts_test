In this paper we have proposed a non-linear mathematical model for a wind turbine. The objective function maximizes the power of the wind turbine and the constraints are related to the rotor and tower costs. Rotor diameter and hub height are the variables which affect on power of the wind turbine, so we have considered them as decision variable in our mathematical model. By increasing rotor diameter and hub height the power of the turbine will increase but the costs donÂ´t let the infinitive increase in rotor diameter and height. The model applied for a typical case study and the results of solving the model for it have shown in the paper.

Magnetic levitation technology has been receiving increasing attention because it helps to eliminate frictional losses due to mechanical contact. Some engineering applications include high-speed maglev trains, magnetic bearings and high-precision platforms. The objective is to model and control a laboratory-scale magnetic levitation system (MLS). Simulation results of conventional PID controller are compared with simulation results of Model reference adaptive controller. Conventional PID controller is implemented in online.

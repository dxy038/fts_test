The TestSmart program was developed in response to the High Production Volume Chemical Challenge, a voluntary initiative under which chemical producers provide basic toxicity data on chemicals produced in greater than one million pounds annually. Specifically, under the Challenge, chemical producers will generate data as needed to complete the Screening Information Data Set (SIDS), as defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The TestSmart program is a collaborative effort of the Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing, the Environmental Defense Fund, Carnegie-Mellon University, and the University of Pittsburgh. The goal of the TestSmart program is to provide a humane and efficient approach to collecting SIDS data. The program has two objectives, one immediate and the other more long term. The immediate objective has been to make recommendations to reduce the number of animals used in collecting SIDS data under the Challenge. This was accomplished, through a group process, by examining the current status of alternative methods for SIDS endpoints and by providing an assessment of the “state of readiness” of current and potential future alternatives. The long-term objective is to provide a model for other programs to follow the TestSmart concept of a more efficient and humane approach to obtain toxicological data of interest to regulators and the public.

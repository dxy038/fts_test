Distributed generation expansion planning (DGEP) has been frequently reported in the literature around the world. However, no studies have been published yet that include type of distributed generation technologies and environmental constraints in the planning process. In this paper, a multiobjective optimization algorithm is applied to produce a Pareto set of optimal planning schemes by taking into account different objective functions. The best planning scheme among the Pareto set is chosen by using a Monte Carlo simulation of uncertain situations in the planning process. The major contribution of this paper is to develop a distributed generation expansion planning considering various technologies and environmental issues. The proposed promotion strategy includes an encouraging mechanism in favor of clean technologies. To assess the ability of the proposed method, a grant function of pollution not emanated as well as emission constraints are applied under three case studies.

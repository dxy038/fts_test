In this paper, an empiric radio coverage model for indoor wireless LAN is presented. This model has been tried out in a vast series of large extension buildings obtaining successful results. The objective of the model is to facilitate the radio design work of a wireless LAN by means of straightforward calculations, because the use of statistical methods is very time consuming, and difficult to put in practice at most situations. Our model is based on a derivation of the free field propagation equation taking into account the building structure and its materials and it has been tested on a large scale design of a WLAN network of over 400 access points. Finally, the paper includes the guidelines to setup a home, building, university campus, or city wireless LAN easily in three simple steps.

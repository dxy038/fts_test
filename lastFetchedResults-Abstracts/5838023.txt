We study the control of a boiler-turbine coordinated system using multiple-model predictive strategy which integrates constrained model predictive algorithm with stability assurance into multiple-model approach based on piecewise linearization. The control algorithm is a receding horizon scheme with a quasi-infinite horizon objective function and uses multiple linear models in its predictions. Simulation shows that the boiler-turbine coordinated system can be successfully controlled by this methodology.

This paper describes a conceptual framework for implementing Intelligent Tutoring Systems using SCORM 2004. The main objective is to discuss how the SCORM 2004 sequencing and navigation specification can allow the development of Intelligent Web-Based Learning Environments using the sequencing and navigation tracking data, and rule set. Our main argument is that SCORM 2004 sequencing and navigation specification can be used to implement the two main functionalities of an ITS, (1) the inner loop and (2) the outer loop.

Objective: To obtain abnormalities in quantitative Electroencephalography (QEEG) and to observe connectivity between electrodes in children with Asperger disorder. Method: In this study, spectrogram criteria and coherence values are used as a tool for evaluating QEEG in 15 children with Asperger disorder (10 boys and 5 girls aged between 6 to 11 years old) and in 11 control children (7 boys and 4 girls with the same age range). Results: The evaluation of QEEG using statistical analysis and spectrogram criteria demonstrates that the relaxed eye-opened condition in gamma frequency band (34-44Hz) has the best distinction level of 96.2% using spectrogram. The children with Asperger disorder had significant lower spectrogram criteria values (p<0.01) at Fp1 electrode and lower values (p<0.05) at Fp2 and T6 electrodes. Coherence values at 171 pairs of EEG electrodes indicate that the connectivity at (T4, P4), (T4, Cz), (T4, C4) electrode pairs and (T4, O1) had significant differences (p<0.01) in the two groups in the gamma band. Conclusions: It is shown that gamma frequency band can discriminate 96.2% of the two groups using the spectrogram criteria. The results demonstrate that there are more abnormalities in the prefrontal and right temporal lobes using spectrogram criteria and there are more abnormalities in the connectivity of right temporal lobe with the other lobes in the gamma frequency band.

Objective(s): Pharmaceutical industries are leading to improved medications that can target diseases more effectively and precisely. Researchers have intended to reformulate drugs so that they may be more safely used in human body. The more targeted a drug is, the lower its chance of triggering drug resistance, a cautionary concern surrounding the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The aim of this paper is to introduce efficient drug delivery vehicles which can perform both targeted and controlled antibiotic release by synthesis of magnetic pH-responsive polymer.    Materials and Methods: Iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical co-precipitation technique and primary coated with 3-trimethoxysilylpropylamine (APTS). APTS coated MNPs was used in the reaction medium for synthesis of a pH-responsive poly (MAA-co-AAc)-grafted PVP. The prepared vehicle was characterized by TEM, XRD, FT-IR, TGA, DSC and elemental analysis. Drug loading, release, kinetics and mechanism of the system were evaluated.Results: The results for drug release showed that the release of antibiotics in pH 5.5 and 7.2 could be effectively sustained, while about 92 % of the drugs were released at pH 1.2. Considerations demonstrate the tendency of drug release by Fickian mechanism and diffusion controlled release.Conclusion: The results indicate that the prepared magnetic nano-carrier could be suitable for site-specific antibiotic delivery through oral administration.

In this paper, we study the aggregating problem of swarm system with guaranteed connectivity in 2-dimensional environment, and propose an individual-based swarm model composed of the state information about the individualÂ´s farthest neighbors. In our approach, we formulate the following two steps at each time as distributed control strategy: (1) determining several available positions for every individual; (2) selecting the optimal position as objective position based on PSO algorithm, in which the optimal function consists of the distance between the available position and the farthest neighbor of individual. The scale of the swarm will not be limited because only local individual information is used for modeling. Simulation shows that the swarm system can aggregate with guaranteed connectivity as all individuals in the swarm system are initialized mutually connective.

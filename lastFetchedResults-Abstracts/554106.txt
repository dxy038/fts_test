The main objective of this study was to develop optimal cropping pattern for producers of Marvdashat district. Determination of optimal cropping contains providing the objectives of reducing production variance or risk, reducing water usage, and providing a special amount of gross margin, simultaneously. Regarding the fluctuations in coefficients used in objective function and constraints and fuzziness of the coefficients, the coefficients were used in fuzzy form. Considering the objectives and applying fuzzy values jointly was resulted in multi objective fuzzy programming. Current pattern of selected producers contains rice, wheat, maize, hay maize, tomato, sugar beet and canola with area of 2, 2.8, 0.2, 0.3, 1, 0.4, 0.2 and 0.2 hectares, respectively. Gross margin of the current pattern is 109.44 billions rials. Variance of gross margin and water consumption in the current pattern were 1387xl013 and 142130 m3, respectively. In fuzzy optimal pattern, rice, wheat, tomato and canola had priority over other crops, getting area of 0.3, 1.3, 1.5 and 4 Hectares, respectively. Gross margin, variance of gross margin and water consumption in fuzzy optimal pattern were 119.99, 916xl013 and 95784 m , respectively. The results also revealed that increased uncertainty in water availability results in reduction of wheat area in favor of rice and canola.

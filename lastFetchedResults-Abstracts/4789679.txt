This paper deals with the problem of active damping of driveline oscillations having the objective to improve driveability and passenger comfort. Precisely longitudinal vibrations occur during transient changes in driver demand (tip-in and tip-out maneuvers), on clutch engagement or on backlashes traverse, and negatively affect the driveability. The paper proposes a robust and efficient control of the engine that actively damps the driveline oscillations. A complete methodology based on the prediction and compensation of the shaft torque at critical frequency is presented. The resulting controller is both effective and &#8220;readable&#8221;. Hence, it can be easily adapted to the vehicle specificity, without re-design, thanks to three tuning parameters.

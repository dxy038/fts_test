Background & Objective : Air pollution is considered as one of the the most important risks of uncontrolled growth of cities, economic development and energy consumption in the last century. In large cities, such an increasing trend seriously threatens the health of residents. 
This study aims to evaluate the health effects of PM10, PM2.5 and SO2, and estimate the mortality and morbidity rate of cardiovascular, respiratory and Chronic obstructive pulmonary, attributed to the aforementioned pollutants, using AirQ model in metropolis of Tehran in 1392.
Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional study, Data required were collected from environmental protection organization and air quality control center of Tehran. These data were analyzed by Excel, and the processed data entered AirQ model. Then relative risk, basis risk and attributable  fraction were estimated. Finally, the gained results, being  mortality and morbidity rate, were presented in tables and graphs.
Results: The results showed that the average annual concentration of PM10, PM2.5 and SO2, were 73, 43 and 41 ?g/m3, respectively, being 3.65, 4.3 and 2.05 times higher than the national standard of  Iran and WHO guidelines, correspondingly. Total number of mortalities attributed to the PM10, PM2.5 and SO2, were about 2187, 2842 and 721, respectively, being 3.65%, 4.75% and 1.20% of total deaths of Tehran city (except accidents), correspondingly.
Conclusion: The results showed the health effects of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide pollutants, including total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, respiratory, hospitalizations due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and myocardial infarction in Tehran. So, it’s obviously clear that the proportion of mentioned pollutants are being increased  in Tehran’s atmosphere that requires more attention of officials and experts to control air pollution.

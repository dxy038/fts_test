Objective:  This study explores the relationship between the extent of polymerization and the radiant energy (dose) applied during the photopolymerization of resin-based composites.

Method: FTIR was used to measure the 5-min and 24-h conversion of four resin-based composites prepared in a thin film and polymerized under conditions of decreasing intensity and a constant exposure time (30 s) using a tungsten halogen curing light. The measured conversion was obtained over a wide range of applied radiant energy. Additionally, samples for two of the materials were polymerized at various intensities and exposure times such that the dose remained constant. This process was performed at four dose levels representing approximately 75% of the conversion range.

Results: The curing profiles (percent conversion versus applied radiant energy) depict a gradual decrease in conversion with decreasing energy followed by a rapid descent. Though there are differences in the maximum conversion attained between the materials, when conversion is represented as a fractional conversion relative to the maximum 24-h value, their 5-min and 24-h curing profiles appear quite similar. Additionally, very similar conversion was measured when the films were exposed using equivalent doses providing evidence for a reciprocal relationship between irradiance (power density) and exposure time. For the 24-h measurements, statistical equivalence (Fishers protected LSD at the 0.05 level) was noted for most of the combinations of exposure time and power density within a given dose. Generally, the exceptions occurred with the shortest exposure times.

Significance: A reciprocal relationship between exposure time and power density adds significance to the study of conversion as a function of the total applied dose. This relationship establishes the curing profile as a universal correlation between exposure time and power density.

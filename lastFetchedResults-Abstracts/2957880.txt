An image segmentation approach based on modified fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm is developed. This method deals with the global and local image information at a gross scene level, which incorporates the local information including the edge map and the spatial relationship of the pixels into the parameters of its objective function. But the current clustering based segmentation methods usually incorporate the local information into the feature space, or integrate the global and local information at a local level. In addition, we also propose a fuzzy Gaussian basis function neural network to complete fuzzy clustering on the grey-histogram of image as the initial solution, which can automatically determine the number of clusters, and is strong and robust

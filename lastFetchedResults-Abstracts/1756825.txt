Inroduction & Objective: Intestinal microflora play an important rolein maintaining the balanced of immune response saga instinfectious agents. Probiotics like microflora effect on the immunesystem and increasere sistancetoa variety of pathogens micro organisms.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of probiotic bacteria,contain Lactobacillus brevis isolated from tarkhineh on the induction of antibody responses in chickens Vaccinated with infectious Bursalfabricius virus vaccineas well as its effects on chicken’sbody’s weight.
Materials and Methods: 1-day-old broiler chickens (Cobb 500strain) were randomly divided in 3 groups. Two control groups with and without vaccine, respectively and one trial group which received vaccine and probiotic (1 ml with 1×109cfu/ml). Vaccines were given orallyon days17 and 26. The rate of total antibody against the virus was determined with ELISAtest, after each week bleeding. Body weight was also weekly determined.
Results: Our results showed that the titers of antibodies were equivalent in all groups (5257±0.169.6 u/ml) which gradually decreased until day 25 (p < 0.05). The antibody titers on day 25 were 1428±162.6, 640.7±55.38 and 1125.46.87 u/ml respectively. It was obvious the antibody titers were decreased greater in groups 2 and 3 which significantly differed from control group. The antibody titer gradually decreased in group 1 until day (32 884.6±90.44 u/ml) whereas in groups 2 and 3 it increased up to 3236±251.5 and 2912±121.4 u/ml, respectively. Although administration of the probiotic appeared to improve the antibody responsescompare to negative control group by increasing the stability of it, but the antibody titer didn’t significantly higher than vaccine treated group on day 32. Our results showed that administrating of probiotic was significantlyenhanced broiler performance by improving body weight (1754±13.49 gr).
Conclusion: Probiotic administration could enhance the antibody responses in vaccinated against infectious bursa of fabricius diseases, but it doesn’t significantly increase the antibody titer compare with vaccinated group. Administrated probiotic could enhance the broiler performance and decrease food conversion ratio (FCR) which is the main factor affecting the profit of broiler industry.

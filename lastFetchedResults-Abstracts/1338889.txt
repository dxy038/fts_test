Endocrine diagnoses of granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) in the mare are frequently based upon determination of serum concentrations of inhibin, testosterone, and progesterone (GCT panel). In the present study, we examined results from 2,253 samples submitted for determination of GCT panel. In an additional subset of samples (n = 75), diagnosis of GCT was confirmed based upon surgery or necropsy. The objective of the current study was to examine the agreement between serum inhibin and testosterone concentrations in mares with serum progesterone concentrations less than or ≥1 ng/mL. Across all samples, elevations in serum inhibin or testosterone were noted in 15.2% or 17.3% of samples, respectively. For samples with progesterone <1 ng/mL, more (P = .001) samples had elevated inhibin than elevated testosterone, whereas for samples with progesterone ≥1 ng/mL, more (P < .0001) samples had elevated testosterone than elevated inhibin. For samples with progesterone <1 ng/mL, the agreement between elevated inhibin and testosterone was greater than that for samples with progesterone ≥1 ng/mL. In a subset of 53 samples with progesterone ≥1 ng/mL, 28 samples had endocrine evidence of a granulosa cell tumors based upon elevations of serum anti-Müllerian hormone, and 4 of these samples had endocrine evidence of pregnancy based upon estrone sulfate concentrations. For samples from mares with confirmed GCTs, 85% and 55% had elevated inhibin or testosterone, respectively. Based upon endocrine diagnosis, GCTs occur in mares with elevated progesterone and/or estrone sulfate, albeit at a low rate.

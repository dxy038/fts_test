The objective of this paper is to put forward an intelligent system to assist and enable potential users who intend to make investment on micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) products. The system functions as a decision support system to help users the potentiality of investment in MEMS industry by predicting future sales and profitability based on past knowledge. In this paper work fuzzy logic system (FLs) is proposed, as it is conveniently adaptable to solve such problems. Among the many factors that are important for predicting MEMS industry potential, are sales, price, profit, earning, P/E ratio, PEG, P/S ratio. Some of these factors may be related, but some act independently. These factors are combined together into a finalize result. Data Fusion is the process of combining multiple economic factors in order to produce information of tactical value to the user. Briefly, in this project, the behaviour of an intelligent system is simulated by the fuzzy logic toolbox. In fact, the output variable and valuation scale is dasiainvestmentpsila. It is fuzzy variable and compared this output rate with actuality.

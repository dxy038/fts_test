Since vegetation in urban areas delivers crucial ecological services as a support to human well-being and to the urban population in general, its monitoring is a major issue for urban planners. Mapping and monitoring the changes in urban green spaces are important tasks because of their functions such as the management of air, climate and water quality, the reduction of noise, the protection of species and the development of recreational activities. In this context, the objective of this work is to propose a methodology to inventory and map the urban tree spaces from a mono-temporal very high resolution (VHR) optical image using a Random Forest classifier in combination with object-oriented approaches. The methodology is developed and its performance is evaluated on a dataset of the city of Strasbourg (France) for different categories of built-up areas. The results indicate a good accuracy and a high robustness for the classification of the green elements in terms of user and producer accuracies.

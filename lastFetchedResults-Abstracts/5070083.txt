The development of mobile robot software presents challenges that are uncommon to information system development. In this context, creating a domain-specific language (DSL) to build applications in that domain is a process that needs specific guidelines. To the best of our knowledge, current DSL engineering processes do not address such issues. This paper presents a DSL engineering process to that domain. The process roughly consists of extracting domain abstractions from existing robot applications and transforming them into elements of a graphical DSL. It was specified from our experience in building one robot application, however, different applications might be built with the resulting DSL. The main objective is to show a possible starting point that could be taken for creating DSLs.

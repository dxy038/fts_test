This study was carried out in Melehgavan protected area (app.160 ha) located in northwestern of Ham
city. The main objective of the study was to survey the ecological species groups in relation to some
physiographic attributes and soil physico-chemical properties. The field data were obtained using 67
sample plots (20mx20m) in a systematic random grid. The attributes including tree and shrub species
type, number of each species and canopy coverage, which were recorded by measuring their small f large
crown diameters in each sample plot. In order to record the herbaceous speeies, the Whitaker's snail plot
method was applied, which resulted in 81 m2 of the minimum plot area. The Canonical Correspondence
Analysis (CCA), Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and TWINSPAN methods were used for the site
classification, determining of the relationship between species composition and environmental properties
and also definition of ecological species groups, respectively. Results indicated that there were three
ecological species groups in the study area. The first group had a positive correlation with the soil pH.
There was no indicator tree species in this group but Stipa eapensis, Fibigia macrocarpa and Medieago
rigidula could be detected as indicator herbaceous species. The second group was established in the
higher elevation and its site had more moisture and mineral nutrients than the sites of other groups in the
area. Quercus brantii and Bromus tectorum were identified as the indicator species for this group. Daphne
mucronata and Euphorbia macroclada species were defined as the indicator species for the third group,
which was established in.the low elevation above sea level. The mineral nutrients of this group were less
than the second group

The objective of this paper is to explore the survival model of casualty in wartime using expert questionnaires and survival curve fitting. First, the survival probability data of wartime casualty were collected using expert questionnaires. Then, these data were fitted by the Weibull survival function with MATLAB and the casualty survival functions based on type of medical treatment facility (MTF) and treatment delay were obtained. At last, on the basis of above research, the final casualty survival model based on any treatment delay was obtained. The survival model developed will contribute to timeliness treatment and wartime medical evacuation simulation.

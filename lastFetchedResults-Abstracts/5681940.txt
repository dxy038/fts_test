A general approach to linearizing robot dynamics models is presented, and the trajectory-generation problem is illustrated. The robust eigenstructure assignment approach is then used for robot motion control. The objective of the eigenstructure assignment is to meet the following design specifications: (1) decoupling of link dynamics, (2) fast settling time, and (3) local stability about each point along the trajectory. The robustness of the controller is used to reduce the updating rate of the feedback matrix as the robot moves along the trajectory or to take care of the payload changes. A simulation study in which the control algorithm is applied to the first three joints indicates that the difference between the desired and the actual trajectory is within a specified limit

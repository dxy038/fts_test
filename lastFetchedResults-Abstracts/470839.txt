Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether common polymorphisms of key genes that control the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) pathway are associated with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
Study design
The study sample comprised 53 women with clinically diagnosed premenstrual dysphoric disorder (age range, 27-46 years; mean age, 37.7 years) and 52 healthy control subjects (age range, 22-48 years; mean age, 36.2 years). Eight polymorphisms that encode the 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (LPR, VNTR-2, and 3â€² UTR G/T), tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1 G-6526A, G-5806T, and A218C), and monoamine oxidase A (monoamine oxidase A promoter VNTR-1 and exon 8 Fnu 4H1) were genotyped. Genotype and allelic frequencies were analyzed by chi-square test and stepwise logistic regression analysis.
Results
There was no significant association between any genotype and clinical category and no significant allelic distribution profiles in either the premenstrual dysphoric disorder group or the control group.
Conclusion
These findings do not support a major role for common 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter, TPH1, and monoamine oxidase A polymorphisms in contributing to susceptibility to premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

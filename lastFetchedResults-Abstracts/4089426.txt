The objective of this article is to investigate phase relations between heart beat and breathing cycles and their dependence on sleep states. Furthermore, the appearance of phase synchronizations between these signals is proved statistically by analyzing the phase relations between breathing and heart beat periods. The phase synchronizations between these signals are searched for by testing appropriate parameters of surrogate data with similar power spectra but randomly shuffled phase relations.

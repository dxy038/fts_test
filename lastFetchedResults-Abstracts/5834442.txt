This paper presents an energy management system (EMS) of a smart grid. The EMS consists of some input modules such as load forecasting, generation forecasting, and market information which give necessary data to optimization module. The aim of this article is improving the optimization module and modeling the effect of demand side management on optimal energy management system. The proposed EMS minimizes the cost of smart gridÂ´s operation with consideration of responsive loads for a day ahead and time interval of operation is considered 1 hour. Finally the objective function is solved by genetic algorithm and the program has been solved in Matlab software environment.

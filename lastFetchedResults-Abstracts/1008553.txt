Since the chip-formation mechanism in orthogonal machining of composites is different from that of metals, the cutting theories developed for metals cannot be directly used for orthogonal machining of composites. The objective of this research was to develop a new analytical method using energy method to predict the machining forces for orthogonal machining of unidirectional polymer–matrix composites (PMCs) for fiber orientations ranging from 90° to 180° Experiments were conducted to verify the validity of the proposed model using tools with rake angles of 5°, 10°, 15°, and 20°.

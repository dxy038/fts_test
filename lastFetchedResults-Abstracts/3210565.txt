Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) got larger objective function value at the beginning of iteration and easily fell into local optimum at the end of iteration. in view of this, the article proposed an improved Artificial Bee Colony algorithm guided by complex method. the results of function test and example test showed that the improved Algorithm overcome the flaw of ABC in a certain extent.

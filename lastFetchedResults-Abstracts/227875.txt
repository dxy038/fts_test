Multiport DC–DC converters are of potential interest in applications such as generation
systems utilising multiple sustainable energy sources. A family of multiport bidirectional DC–DC
converters derived from a general topology is presented. The topology shows a combination of
DC-link and magnetic coupling. This structure makes use of both methods to interconnect multiple
sources without the penalty of extra conversion or additional switches. The resulting converters
have the advantage of being simple in topology and have a minimum number of power devices.
The proposed general topology and basic cells show several possibilities to construct a multiport
converter for particular applications and provide a solution to integrate diverse sources owing to
their flexibility in structure. The system features a minimal number of conversion steps, low cost
and compact packaging. In addition, the control and power management of the converter by a
single digital processor is possible. The centralised control eliminates complicated communication
structures that would be necessary in the conventional structure based on separate conversion
stages. A control strategy based on classical control theory is proposed, showing a multiple PIDloop
structure. The general topology and a set of three-port embodiments are detailed.

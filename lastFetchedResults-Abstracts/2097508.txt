In active packaging, active agent can change organoleptic properties of food or package condition. Objective of this study was to determine effect of active packaging and absorber agent on optimum shelf life condition of button mushroom (Agaricus Bosporus). Two type of packaging, stretch Polyvinyl Chloride and Biaxially oriented polypropylene, and four type absorbers, silica gel 1.25 g, silica gel 2.5 g, silica gel 1.25 g with sodium chloride 1.25 g, silica gel 1.25 g with foam, on quantitative and qualitative properties of button mushroom were considered. The qualitative result showed that Biaxially oriented polypropylene and control and silicagel 1.25g had lowest loses weigh. The maturity index results  showed that silica gel 1.25 g and 2.5 g with Biaxially oriented polypropylene had significantly higher score than all other samples and they had best rating after 8 days.  The lowest rating was for polyvinyl cholorid film and mix treatments after 16 days

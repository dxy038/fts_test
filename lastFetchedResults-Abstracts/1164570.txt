The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different gamma radiation doses on the growth of Alternaria alternata and on the production of toxins alternariol (AOH), and alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) in sunflower seed samples. After irradiation with 2, 5 and 7 kGy, the spore mass was resuspended in sterile distilled water and the suspension was inoculated into sunflower seeds. The number of colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) was determined after culture on Dichloran Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol and Dichloran Chloramphenicol Malt Extract Agar. The presence of AOH and AME was investigated by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The radiation doses used resulted in a reduction of the number of A. alternata CFU/g and of AOH and AME levels when compared to the nonirradiated control group. Maximum reduction of the fungus (98.5%) and toxins (99.9%) was observed at a dose of 7 and 5 kGy, respectively. Under the present conditions, gamma radiation was found to be an alternative for the control of A. alternata and, consequently, of AOH and AME production in sunflower seeds.

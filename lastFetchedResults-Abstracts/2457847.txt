Introduction & Objective: Cox model is a common method to estimate survival and validity of the results is dependent on the proportional hazards assumption. K- Nearest neighbor is a nonparametric method for survival probability in heterogeneous communities. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of k- nearest neighbor method (K-NN) with Cox model.
Materials & Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in Hamadan Province, on 475 patients who had undergone kidney transplantation from 1994 to 2011. Data were ex-tracted from patientsâ€™ medical records using a checklist. The duration of the  time between kidney transplantation and rejection was considered as the surviv al time. Cox model and k- nearest neighbor method were used for Data modeling.  The prediction error Brier score was used to compare the performance models. 
Results:  Out of 475 transplantations, 55 episodes of rejection occurred. 5, 10 and 15 year sur-vival rates of transplantation were 91.70 %, 84.90% and 74.50%, respectively. The number of neighborhood optimized using cross validation method was 45. Cumulative Brier score of k-NN algo-rithm for t=5, 10 and 15 years were 0.003, 0.006 and 0.007, respectively. Cumulative Brier of score Cox model for t=5, 10 and 15 years were 0.036, 0.058 and 0.058, respectively.  Prediction error of k-NN algorithm for t=5, 10 and 15 years was less than Cox model that shows that the k-NN method outperforms.
Conclusions: The results of this study show that the predictions of KNN has higher accuracy than the Cox model when sample sizes and the number of predictor variables are high.

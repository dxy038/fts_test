Although several theoretical and experimental models have been developed for abrasive waterjet machining (AWJM), the exact nature of erosion is not yet understood. This paper presents an attempt to model AWJM using the finite element method (FEM) in order to explain the abrasive particleâ€“workpiece interaction process. Also, the model predicts the depth of deformation as a result of abrasive particle impact. The main objective is to develop an FE model which would enable the prediction of the depth of cut without any cutting experiments. The new model takes into account the precise representation of the constitutive behavior of the workpiece material under AWJ dynamic loading conditions which was ignored in the previous AWJM models. In the present model, forces acting on the abrasive particle need not be initially determined, as in previous AWJM studies, as they are automatically calculated at each time step. The results show that plastic deformation is very localized. Finally, the present FE results are consistent with experimental results.

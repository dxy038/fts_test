Physical Layer (PHY) abstraction aims to model link performance and accelerate system-level analyses of communication systems by reducing simulation complexity and their associated computational costs. We examine a Physical Layer (PHY) abstraction approach based on Stochastic Dynamic Systems (SDS) for easing the requirement of expensive Monte Carlo system-level evaluations. We present the framework, recently applied in simplified models for Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers in the finite and large user limits, and refine the analysis for a related scheme named Successive Interference Blocking (SIB), with the objective of evaluating performance metrics such as the Packet Error Rate using a probability particle algorithm for approximating the equivalent SDS.

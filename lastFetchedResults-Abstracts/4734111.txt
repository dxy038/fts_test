The definition of the procedures required to validate computational electromagnetic models is an area of particular interest in the automotive industry. A suitable simulation strategy for vehicle environments will enable a considerable reduction of the EMC testing costs during the design stage. One of the main obstacles to go beyond in the profit of this objective is the lack of standard validation methodologies that allow assessing a suitable level of simulation accuracy. The different ways adopted to validate computational electromagnetics (CEM) could be grouped into three main categories, analytical-to-code, code-to-code and simulation-to-measurement validations. This paper describes the issue of the simulation-to-measurement procedure applied to complex structures such as vehicle environment from the final user point of view. The paper introduces the model description, it includes the numerical technique selected, the modelling strategy adopted and the main characteristics of the models, and later the validation experience is presented.

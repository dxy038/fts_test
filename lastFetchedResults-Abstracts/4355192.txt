A systematic design methodology for low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) is introduced. This methodology follows a bottom-up approach that employs a multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm, which is used at two levels. First, it is used to generate Pareto-based performance models for integrated planar inductors. To do so, an electromagnetic simulator that takes into account the inductorÂ´s layout, thus providing highly accurate performance evaluations, is coupled to the optimizer. Unlike foundry-provided inductor libraries, these Pareto-based models offer a detailed insight of the trade-offs between inductance, quality factor and area. Afterwards the Pareto-based models for the inductors are used as design variables to generate the LNA Pareto surface, thus providing highly accurate performance trade-offs of the LNA.

Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to present a descriptive analysis of the responses given by two-and-a-half year-old Farsi-speaking children to the “Persian Picture Naming Test” carried out on a statistically significant sample of subjects.
Materials and methods: Sixty two-and-a-half-year-old children were chosen from 32 kindergartens through multiple cluster sampling method and then evaluated. The raw data obtained from the Persian Picture Naming test were analyzed on the basis of descriptive statistics (including: mean scores, standard deviation, maximum and minimum scores and percentage of correct answers).
Results: The study revealed that in the above age group the highest percentage of correct answers related to “body part” and “clothes” categories. Conversely, abstract items, items which have little practical value and items with which the subject had had little experience showed a low percentage of correct answers.
Conclusion: The persian picture naming test is a potent tool for documenting subject’s underlying knowledge of nouns in the above-mentioned age group; however this test is also lacking due to incompetencies such as the inadequate number of items in most pictorial categories and the unacceptable quality of pictures in some cases, issues which need be addressed. In addition, on basis of the statistical results of the study, the features of items suitable to be taught can be determined.

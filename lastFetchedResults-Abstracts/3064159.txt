The small satellite constellation for environment protection and disaster monitoring (HJ constellation) is a national project proposed by National Committee for Disaster Reduction and State Environmental Protection Administration of China, to construct a network of eight affordable small satellites (two optical satellites and one SAR satellite will be launched in 2006).The payload instrument on board includes a CCD camera, an infrared camera, a hyper-spectrum camera and an S-band SAR. The average revisit time is 48 hours. By the end of 2010, HJ constellation (4 optical satellites and 4 SAR satellites) will be constructed entirely. The objective is to establish an operational system for disaster monitoring and mitigation using remote sensing technology and improve the efficiency of disaster mitigation and relief. Accompany with the construction of the small satellite constellation, a long term and stable national-level disaster reduction operational system in China will be established, as well as the network system at regional and province level. The network system will be a powerful support system for rapid-response disaster monitoring and mitigation.

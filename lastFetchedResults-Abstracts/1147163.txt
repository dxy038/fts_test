Due to reduction of water resources and increasing demand for water saving, optimum use of available water is necessary. One of the irrigation methods with low water consumption and good efficiency is drip irrigation. The objective of this study is to investigate the technical drip irrigation systems (micro irrigation) in Fars Province, in 124 gardens and farms which have different climate conditions. The values of CU,DU,EU,AELQ,PELQ and CV in Fars province were in range of 61-97%, 50-95%, 43-93%, 34-93%, 30-84% and 5-52%, respectively, with average of 86%, 80%, 75%, 72%, 65% and 18%, respectively. The pressure in emitters were between 0.3-22.9 m with mean of 8 m. In about 64% of systems the pressure was less than 10 m. The discharge of drippers was between 0.6-55.1 lit/hr with mean of 5 lit/hr. But in 74.1% of systems the discharge was less than 3 lit/hr. The mean of wetted area was between 8.9-47.3% with average of 27.8%.

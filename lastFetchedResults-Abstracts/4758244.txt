Management consultant scheduling problem in management consulting service enterprise is a NP-hard problem. This paper studies the problem of management consultants scheduling problems with time window. We formulate the problem where the primary objective is to minimize the makespan. This paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithms (HGA) based on taboo search to solve the problem. It adopts a novel two-chromosome-encoding method for genetic algorithms. A case study with the MATLAB 7.0 platform is carried to test this method. Computational results are reported, which show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding desirable solutions.

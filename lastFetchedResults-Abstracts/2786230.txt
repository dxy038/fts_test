In this paper, an event-based controller design scheme is proposed for a class of Lipschitz nonlinear systems. Using a delay system approach, the event-based system is modelled in a continuous time form. Then, the controller and event generator design methodology is formulated as a convex multi-objective optimization problem with LMI constraints, where the admissible Lipschitz constant of the system is maximized and data communication between plant and controller is minimized simultaneously. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated via simulations.

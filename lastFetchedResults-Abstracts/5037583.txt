The objective of our hospital-based study was to identify dietary meat and preparation type factors as well as meat-derived mutagens that are associated with risk of pancreatic cancer (PC). Data collected on 99 case-control pairs matched by age, gender and region, enrolled in the international Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry (PCCR), were analyzed. Conditional logistic regression produced adjusted (AOR) and unadjusted (UOR) odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for tertiles determined from the control subjects, as well as P values for trend (P<sub>trend</sub>) using the medians for the tertiles. PC was associated with dietary intake of processed meat (P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.0495) in a non-linear fashion as well as increased intake of the mutagen MeIQX (P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.0444, AOR = 2.327) and, to a lesser extent, with frying (Ptrend = 0.1337) in a non-linear fashion, and the increased dietary intake of the mutagen BaP (Ptrend = 0.0687, AOR = 2.212).

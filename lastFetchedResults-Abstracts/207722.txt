Background and Objective: Obesity is associated with cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, type 2
diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia. The present study aimed to the evaluate status of blood pressure and its
association with obesity and abdominal obesity in students of Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences (RUMS).
Material and Methods: In this cross-sectional study 694 respondents were recuited using census method. Hypertension
and obesity were detected using JNC7 and WHO classification, respectively. X' test and Pearson coefficient were
applied where appropriate.
Results: Results of this study demonstrated that 27.4% and 28% respondents had systolic (>120 mmHg) and diastolic
(>80mmHg) high blood pressure, respectively. Forty point five of overweight students and 60% of obese students had
high blood pressure. These differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). Additional high diastolic blood pressure
was found in 36.5% and 60% of overweight and obese students, respectively (p<0.05). According to BMI scores, 10.7%
and 1.4% of students were overweight and obese. 8.8% of girls and 3.17% of boys had abdominal obesity. There was a
significant correlation between abdominal obesity and systolic (r=0.28, p~O.OI) and diastolic (r~0.18, p=O.OI) blood
pressure.
Conclusion: This study showed that hypertension, obesity and abdominal obesity are health problems in students.
Interventional approaches for changing in life style and university nutritional programs are needed.

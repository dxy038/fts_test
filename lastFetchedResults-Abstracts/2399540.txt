Objective
luate the effect of the specimen design on the flexural strength (σf) and failure mode of ceramic structures, testing the hypothesis that the ceramic material under tension controls the mechanical performance of the structure.
s
ceramics used as framework materials for fixed partial dentures (YZ – Vita In-Ceram YZ; IZ – Vita In-Ceram Zirconia; AL – Vita In-Ceram AL) and two veneering porcelains (VM7 and VM9) were studied. Bar-shaped specimens were produced in three different designs (n = 10): monolithic, two layers (porcelain-framework) and three layers (TRI) (porcelain-framework-porcelain). Specimens were tested for three-point flexural strength at 1 MPa/s in 37 °C artificial saliva. For bi-layered design, the specimens were tested in both conditions: with porcelain (PT) or framework ceramic (FT) layer under tension. Fracture surfaces were analyzed using stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Young's modulus (E) and Poisson's ratio (ν) were determined using ultrasonic pulse-echo method. Results were statistically analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis and Student–Newman–Keuls tests.
s
 for VM7 and VM9, significant differences were observed for E values among the materials. YZ showed the highest ν value followed by IZ and AL. YZ presented the highest σf. There was no statistical difference in the σf value between IZ and IZ-FT and between AL and AL-FT. σf values for YZ-PT, IZ-PT, IZ-TRI, AL-PT, AL-TRI were similar to the results obtained for VM7 and VM9. Two types of fracture mode were identified: total and partial failure.
icance
chanical performance of the specimens was determined by the material under tension during testing, confirming the study hypothesis.

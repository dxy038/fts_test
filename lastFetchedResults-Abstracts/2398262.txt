Background: Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate (CC)
vs. letrozole (L) plus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) in gonadotropin releasing
hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol in poor prognosis women with previous failed
ovarian stimulation undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included cycles with CC
and L plus hMG/GnRH antagonist protocols of 32 poor responders who had failed to
have ideal follicles to be retrieved during oocyte pick-up (OPU) or embryo transfer
(ET) at least for 2 previous in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles with microdose flare
protocol or GnRH antagonist protocol from January 2006 to December 2009. Main
outcome measures were implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates per cycle.
Duration of stimulation, mean gonadotropin dose used, endometrial thickness,
number of mature follicles, serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) levels on the
day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration, number of retrieved
oocytes and fertilization rates were also evaluated.
Results: A total number of 42 cycles of 32 severe poor responders were evaluated. Total
gonadotropin consumption was significantly lower (1491 ± 873 vs. 2808 ± 1581 IU,
P=0.005) and mean E2 level on the day of hCG injection were significantly higher in CC
group than L group (443.3 ± 255.2 vs. 255.4 ± 285.2 pg/mL, P=0.03). ET, overall pregnancy
and live birth rates per cycle were significantly higher in CC than L protocol (27.2
vs. 15%, 13.6 vs. 0% and 4.5 vs. 0%, respectively, P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Severe poor responders who had previously failed to respond to microdose
or GnRH antagonist protocols may benefit from CC plus hMG/GnRH antagonist protocol
despite high cancellation rate.

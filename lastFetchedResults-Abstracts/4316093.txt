The purposes or functions of the commercial car suspension system are to take care on the car body weight, to isolate the car body from road profiles disturbance and to maintain the grip force between the wheel and road profiles. The Composite Nonlinear Feedback (CNF) control law is proposed in this comparative study between conventional linear model and Macpherson model. The control performance consists of velocity of car body, suspension deflection, wheel deflection and velocity of a car wheel. The main measurement in this study is the acceleration of the car body. The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and passive model are involved in this control performance is for comparison purposes. The mathematical model of linear model and MacPherson model are focused on the quarter car model active suspension system. The simulation work is done by using MATLAB and SIMULINK to see the control performance on the quarter car active suspension model. In this paper we can conclude that the CNF achieved the main objective of active suspension which is the ride comfort and road handling.

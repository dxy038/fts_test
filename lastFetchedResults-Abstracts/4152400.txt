We demonstrate digitized duplex transmission of 64-QAM signals using pulsed optical communications. Bidirectional data transmission is achieved over a single 25 km optical fibre using a single optical pulsed source. The choice of suitable parameters for bandpass sampling technique used for the digitization of the 16 MSamples/s 64-QAM signal are discussed. It is demonstrated that using digitized transmission of RF signals, long distance transmission can be supported at a performance close to that of the back-to-back analogue benchmarker.

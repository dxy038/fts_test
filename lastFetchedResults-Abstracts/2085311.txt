This paper introduces a new conceptual framework for understanding peopleâ€“environment transactions as they occur within the hybrid and polyfunctional settings (settings that incorporate both physical and digital elements) of the Twenty-First century. Four alternative modes of environmental experience with respect to individuals' connectedness to real (R) and virtual (V) settings, the focus of their identity, and satisfaction of socio-emotional needs are presented: Placeless, Place-Based, Place-Cyber Based, and Cyber-Based. Focusing on the Place-Cyber and Cyber-Based environmental orientations, new constructs for characterizing individuals' place-cyber and cyber-orientations are developed and key objective and subjective criteria are identified to distinguish between these two forms of virtual life. New questions for further investigation regarding the psychological and health consequences of alternative modes of virtual life are raised.

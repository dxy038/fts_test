The development of principles that might ease writing software for thermodynamic calculations with any participating solutions has been considered as the objective of this paper. To this end, the object-oriented programming is suggested to apply, which, in fact, allows the creation of a new specialised algorithmic language, rather universal and flexible, for programming of sophisticated thermodynamic applications. This also makes it possible to represent any thermodynamic property by arbitrary user-supplied analytical functions and furnishes a new way for the storage of thermodynamic properties in a data bank.

This paper presents a methodology based on a genetic algorithm guided by a multiobjective index to evaluate the optimal siting and sizing of Distributed Generation in an electrical system. The objective function consists in improving the voltage profile, minimizing active power losses, emissions and reducing the investment costs. The proposed methodology was tested on a 34bus system showing satisfactory results.

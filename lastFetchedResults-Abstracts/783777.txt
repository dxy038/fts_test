Objective To estimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders
in preadolescents aged 11–12 years from a birth
cohort in a southern Brazilian city.
Methods This is a cross-sectional investigation nested in a
cohort study with a two-phase design: screening and diagnosis.
In the screening phase, 4,452 preadolescents and their
mothers were interviewed with the Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire (SDQ). In the diagnostic phase, all
preadolescents with a positive SDQ (n = 122) and their
mothers answered the Development and Well-Being
Assessment for Children and Adolescents (DAWBA). A
sample randomly selected among the cohort participants
with a negative SDQ served as a control group (158 subjects
and their mothers) and was also assessed using theDAWBA.
Results After adjustment for the performance of the
screening instrument, 10.8% (95% CI 7.1–14.5) of the
preadolescents showed at least one psychiatric disorder
according to either the DSM-IV or the ICD-10. The most
prevalent disorders were disruptive behavior (prevalence
rates were 8.5% according to the DSM-IV and 7.1%
according to the ICD-10) and anxiety disorders (prevalence
rates were 6.0% according to the DSM-IV and 6.2%
according to the ICD-10).
Conclusion Both overall and individual prevalence rates
of psychiatric disorders found in this study are in the same
range of other international studies, although slightly
higher than findings from developed countries. The results
corroborate previous findings from other epidemiological
studies in children and adolescents suggesting the universality
of psychiatric disorders across cultures.

The objective of the current work is the design and development of a data acquisition, processing and storage system for condition monitoring. This system is used by an application that uses mathematical models for predicting potential failures in the functioning of power electric transformers. Applying data warehouse techniques and virtual instruments, a measurement system was created in four working power transformers of 40 MVA. The application that handles the prediction models was provided with an abstraction of the sensors the authors have called virtual acquisition cards. The acquisition system was designed for being scalable and easily reconfigurable. The prediction application experimented a great reduction in system complexity and development time, being able to focus on the prediction algorithm exclusively

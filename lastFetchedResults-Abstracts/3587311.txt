A stability criterion is developed for linear, asynchronous multirate sampled-data systems. Such systems typically include a linear, time variant, continuous-time plant and several unsynchronized digital controllers. The analysis method uses a time-domain approach based on the closed-loop state transition matrix. The result is sufficient stability criterion which gives an objective measure of long-term and short-term stability. A simple example illustrates the method

Due to the nature of a MANET, it is much more vulnerable to attack than a wired network. As a result, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for MANETs is designed to detect anomalous behavior and misuse. Swarm intelligence is a relatively novel field. These algorithms, like their natural systems of inspiration, show the desirable properties of being adaptive, scalable, and robust. The objective of this project is to detect and perform defense mechanism for packet replication attack. A Packet replication problem reduced by the NS2 simulator for MANET, each data packet is replicated in the IP layer at its source. The number of replication times is determined by the number of route entries for the destination, each data packet is uniquely identified with the tree-id provided by NS2 and the redundant packets are discarded in the IP layer at the receiver. The Performance of the Intrusion Detection system is verified using the parameters like Throughput, Packet-Received, Packet-Delivery Ratio, End-to-End Latency, Bandwidth and Latency.

This paper addresses a multi-objective order allocation problem in the production planning stage of labor-intensive industry. An evolution strategy-based decision-making model is developed to provide timely and effective solutions for this problem by integrating radio frequency identification technology. In this model a novel (&#956;/&#961; + &#955;) -evolution strategy process is integrated with effective non-dominated sorting and pruning techniques to generate pruned Pareto optimal solutions for real-world production planning practice. Experiments based on industrial data were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively solve the investigated problem by providing order allocation solutions superior to industrial solutions.

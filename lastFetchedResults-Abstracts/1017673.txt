Objectives: Low back pain is one of the most prevalent disorders of musculoskeletal system and around 80% of people have had at least one experience of lumbago. One of the several factors suggested for low back pain, which has been focused recently, is pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. Good judgment about the function of these muscles needs a reliable measurement tool. The objective of this study is to determine the reliability of trans-abdominal ultrasonography measurement of pelvic floor muscles function during 3 different abdominal maneuvers with and without pelvic floor muscles contraction in healthy people and chronic non-specific low back pain patients.
Materials & Methods: This methodological study was conducted on 22 non-low back pain and 15 non-specific chronic low back pain subjects. The amount of bladder displacement, as an index of pelvic floor function, from resting position during 3 different abdominal maneuvers (with and without pelvic floor muscles voluntary contraction) was recorded. It was repeated twice for every test in a session, with a 30-minute interval between 2 sessions. We used Intra-class Correlation Coefficient and Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) in order to evaluate reliability.
Results: Reliability for all of the tests was excellent except hallowing maneuver in healthy subjects, which ranged from fair to good. Standard error of measurement was greater than mean difference in all tests.
Conclusion: Trans-abdominal ultrasonography can be used as a reliable method for evaluation of pelvic floor muscles function.

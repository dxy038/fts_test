In sensor networks, secure communication among sensor nodes requires secure links and consequently secure key establishment. Due to resource constraints, achieving such key establishment is non-trivial. Recently some random key pre-distribution techniques have been proposed to establish pair-wise keys. Pair-wise key establishment is a fundamental security service in sensor networks; it enables sensor nodes to communicate securely with each other using cryptographic techniques. Some of these approaches assume certain deployment knowledge prior to deployment and nodes are deployed in groups/bundles. The analysis shows that when certain deployment knowledge is available, the performance of existing key pre-distribution techniques can be improved significantly. The objective of this paper is to analyze and compare the security level of the different deployment knowledge based schemes.

The proposed method has been developed according to the requirements of surveillance application scenarios, aiming at achieving bit-rate optimisation and adaptation of surveillance videos for storing and transmission purposes. For every frame between two successive intra refresh frames, the motion affected blocks are statistic analyzed and the error sensitive ones are selected as intra refreshed macroblocks. To suppress the potential spatial and temporal error propagation, constrained intra prediction with limited DC prediction (LDC) is used for the intra refreshed macroblocks, and the reference number of an inter predicted frame which behinds an intra refreshed frame is limited. Experimental results show that compared with traditional methods, the proposed method can achieve a considerable improvement on both objective peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) and subjective visual quality.

Switching stresses on the MOS-controlled thyristor (MCT) under zero voltage resonant switching were studied. The MCT was used as a bidirectional switch in an AC/AC pulse density modulated inverter. Current and voltage spikes were observed and analyzed with variations in the timing of the switching. Different snubber circuit configurations were investigated to minimize the effect of these transients. Failure modes of the device are presented. A generalized voltage and current snubber was found to be useful in reducing the stresses such that soft switching could still be maintained

Objective:
There is controversial evidence on a matrix influence on the measurement of NT-proBNP.
Design and methods:
We compared results of Elecsys NT-proBNP measurement on serum, K2 EDTA plasma and lithium heparin plasma.
Results:
Samples collected in K2 EDTA showed a marginally significant underestimation when compared to serum and heparin, whereas no significant difference was observed between serum and heparin plasma.
Conclusions:
Serum, heparin and K2 EDTA plasma may be suitable for NT-proBNP measurement.

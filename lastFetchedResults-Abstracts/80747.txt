Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata Braun) is a potential oil crop for the Mediterranean area. The objective of this study was to develop an efficient system of mutagenesis using ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation of isolated microspores from Brassica carinata. From the survival curve based on embryo yield after irradiation of the microspores with UV light, the LD50 was estimated to be an exposure of 8 min. Total content of glucosinolates and fatty acid composition were analysed in the seeds of the doubled haploid homozygous plants with the purpose of selecting lines with modified glucosinolate and erucic acid contents. Three groups of doubled haploid lines exhibiting low and high glucosinolate contents, and high erucic acid content have been identified from a population of 270 doubled haploid lines. In eight lines, the content of glucosinolates was reduced from an average of 80.6 (MU)mol g-1 seed to 37.5 (MU)mol g-1 seed, whereas in four lines, the content of glucosinolates was increased up to 99.2 (MU)mol g-1 seed. In six additional lines, the content of erucic acid was increased from 42.8% in the nontreated lines to 49.5% of the total fatty acid composition in some of the mutant lines. All lines showed stable levels of erucic acid in two generations, the M2 and M3.

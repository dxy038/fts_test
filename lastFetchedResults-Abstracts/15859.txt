The objective of this paper is to present an overview and brief discussion of the published literature on the basic principles of predictive testing of cord-rubber composites, with particular emphasis on the fatigue testing of the rubber matrix and angle-ply cord-rubber laminates. Cord-rubber composites behave quite differently from conventional stiff polymer matrix composites and their response to stresses is more complex than that of an isotropic material. Hence, the testing of cord-reinforced, rubbermatrix composites presents major challenges, particularly when the experiments are conducted under fatigue loading conditions. Our literature survey suggests that in the study of cord-rubber composites fatigue failure an integrated and multi-disciplinary approach is desirable. Such approach comprises a deterministic approach (fracture mechanics, fracture mechanisms), a stochastic approach (S-N curves), as well as the application of both phenomenological and structural theories.

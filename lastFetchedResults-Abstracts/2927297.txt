The objective of this research work was to investigate the effect of the inclusion of visual cues in the decision making process when using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). An important aspect of this research was to investigate the sensitivity of consistency as measured by AHP when visual cues were incorporated. An experiment was designed in the application area of Speech Pathology. The research design included the development of a hierarchical representation of the factors; stress, rate, intonation and articulation; involved in the problem of evaluating the intelligibility of speakers and a multimedia application based on the devised hierarchy to support the decision making process. The control group used audio alone while the experimental group used both audio and full motion video to judge the speakers. The statistical analysis of the results show that the inclusion of visual cues significantly improve the consistency of the decision maker for the research problem selected

Construction project is regarded as a complex network system in which quality reliability is an important index to express quality grade, so quality -cost Optimization is one of the most crucial aspects of construction project planning, which in fact is a multi objective optimization problem. A mathematical model is established and an evolutionary algorithm genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to solve the quality reliability-cost optimization problem. In the application of GA, penalty function is used to handle the constraint. In the selection strategy of GA, Sorting on the evaluation function and optimal conservation strategy are adopted which improve the convergence performance of GA. Finally, a test example is given to verify the advantage of the new method which combines quality reliability with cost in the construction which is benefit for the cost optimization research.

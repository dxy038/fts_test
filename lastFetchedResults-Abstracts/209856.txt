Objective: It has been seen that wild waterfowls stop breeding during captivity. In the longterm,
this may put their species in danger and there would be a need to find a way for artificial
reproduction .
In this study, a common medication for human controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH)
was tested on wild waterfowls to answer the question of whether this application can cause
ovarian follicular recruitment and does it help the fowl ovulate and lay eggs.
Materials and Methods: The animal experimental model was the adult female Mallard .
The timing of research was scheduled for mid-July through mid-August which counts as outofseason
for Mallard breeding .
75 IUlbird/day was injected 1M for 10 days. After completion of injections, the ovarian tissues
were retrieved and considered for morphological and histological assessments.
Results: The results show a positive effect for human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) on
most of the evaluated parameters. In the experimental group; ovarian size, number of differentiating
oocytes (vitellogenic and post-vitellogenic) and theca layer diameter were significantly
more than the control group (p<0.05). Differences in the other parameters (the number
of undifferentiated and pre-vitellogenic oocytes, nucleus and arteriole diameter) compared
between control and experimental groups were not statistically significant.
Conclusion: It seems that hMG has a positive and meaningful effect on ovarian follicular
recruitment and its administration will be an effective method for ovulation induction in female
Mallards. Thrs may especially be combined with artificial insemination to help the laying eggs
become fertilized.

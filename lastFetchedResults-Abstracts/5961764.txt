Methods DPPH free radical scavenging test and ultra-weak chemiluminescence assay were applied to measure the antioxidant capacity of the bamboo leaves extract; MTT assay was used to detect the cell proliferation effect of the extracts and PM<sub>2.5</sub>; Comet assay was applied to the DNA strand breakage detection of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, induced RAW264.7 and anti-DNA damage of BLE. Western blot method was used to detect the expression of NF-kB in A549 cell. Results (1) BLE had the abilities of removing DPPH free radicals and IC<sub>50</sub> was 7.02mg/L, which was lower than that of ascorbic acid (2.43mg/L). (2) BLE decrease and delay the DNA damage significantly in CuSO<sub>4</sub>-Phen-Vc-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-DNA reaction of ultra-weak chemiluminescence system. (3) The tail DNA content was decrease by BLE significantly on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced RAW264.7. (4) BLE showed little cytotoxicity for A549 cell and can resist the changes in cell viability that caused by different concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. (5) 100mg/L of PM<sub>2.5</sub> could cause a significantly high expression of NF-kB in A549 nuclear, but 40mg/L BLE could resist the activation of NF-kB stimulated by PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Conclusion BLE have the potential ability of DPPH free radical sca- enging, anti-DNA strand breakage by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced, anti-inhibitive effect on cell proliferation induced by the PM<sub>2.5</sub> and anti-inflammation by decreasing the activation of NF-kB stimulated by PM25.

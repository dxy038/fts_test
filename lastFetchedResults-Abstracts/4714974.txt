The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) is one of three instruments flown on the first Earth Observing mission (EO-1) under NASAÂ´s New Millennium Program (NMP). The primary NMP mission objective is to flight-validate advanced technologies that will enable dramatic improvements in performance, cost, mass and schedule for future, Landsat-like, Earth remote sensing instruments. ALI contains a number of innovative features, including all the Category 1 technology demonstrations of the EO-1 mission. These include the basic instrument architecture which employs a push-broom data collection mode, a wide field of view optical design, compact multispectral detector arrays, non-cryogenic HgCdTe for the short wave infrared bands, silicon carbide optics and a multi-level solar calibration technique. The Earth Observing-1 spacecraft was successfully launched on November 21, 2000. During the first sixty days on orbit, several Earth scenes were collected and on-orbit calibration techniques were exercised by the Advanced Land Imager. This paper presents the status of ALI radiometric performance characterization obtained from the data collected during that period

This paper introduces a new set of objective functions and presents a design flow for near-perfect reconstruction (NPR) analysis and synthesis filter-bank based transmultiplexer. The effects of design constraints in terms of filter order and coefficients quantization are analysed for their effect on overall response and cross-channel interference; this leading to an optimum choice of the prototype filter with an iterative process. Using this method, a 16-channel transmultiplexer was designed for an onboard transparent processor to suit the requirement of multi-channel satellite communication.

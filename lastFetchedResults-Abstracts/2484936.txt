Background and Objective: Injection is one of the most stressful dental procedures. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of video glasses in reducing anxiety and pain during inferior alveolar nerve block injection.

Materials and Methods: This experimental study was performed on 40 children 6-8 years old. Children were randomly assigned to two groups. Each group was treated in three sessions. Children’s inherent anxiety was assessed in the first session and prophylaxis and fluoride therapy was performed for all children without anxiety. In the second session in the first group, injection was applied with glasses and in the second group, injection was applied without glasses. In the third session, in the first group injection was applied without glasses and in the second group, injection was applied with glasses. Visual analog scale pain assessment methods were used. Assessment of anxiety was done using the Modified Children Dental Anxiety Scale. The data were analyzed with Mann-Whitney and using SPSS 15 software.

Results: Average pain in the first group of video glasses was 1.89+_0.65 that this amount increased in the second session without glasses to 3.00±0.81. In the second group, the mean pain in the first session without glasses was 3.05±0.60 and this amount in the second session with glasses declined to 2.05±0.60. The difference between the two sessions in the two groups was statistically significant (P  < 0.001).

Conclusion: Based on our findings, the use of audio-visual glasses is effective in reducing pain and anxiety during dental treatments.

Objective: It has recently been suggested that white women who are homozygous for the allele of the gene for wild-type p53 protein (TP53) that encodes arginine at position 72 are more susceptible to human papillomavirus–associated cervical carcinoma than are women who are heterozygous for this polymorphism and women who are homozygous for the allele that encodes proline at that position. This study was undertaken to analyze whether the TP53 codon 72 single-nucleotide polymorphism might be correlated with the risk of cervical cancer among Korean women. Study Design: Peripheral blood samples from patients with invasive cervical carcinoma yielding a positive result for human papillomavirus 16 (n = 100), patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (n = 134), and healthy control subjects (n = 100) were examined. The presence and genotype of human papillomavirus in cancerous cervical tissues were determined by E6, E7–based nested polymerase chain reaction. Germline genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and examined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the specific allele assay as described by Storey et al. Deoxyribonucleic acid samples from patients whose TP53 sequences had been determined by direct sequencing were used as positive control preparations. Results: The respective proportions of individuals who are homozygous for the arginine allele, homozygous for the proline allele, and heterozygous for the 2 alleles were 40%, 12%, and 48% among women with invasive cervical carcinoma, 52%, 9%, and 39% among women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III, and 52%, 11%, and 37% among the control group. No significant differences in the frequency of codon 72 alleles were found among the 3 groups (χ2 = 4.414; P = .353; degrees of FREEDOM = 4). Conclusion: This finding suggests that the risk of cervical cancer may not be increased for Korean women with the allele of TP53 encoding arginine at codon 72. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:55-8.)

The purified ag85a-mpb63 fusion gene was subcloned into the expression vector pET28a(+), and the prokaryotic expression vector pET-85a-63 was constructed. Plasmid containing pET-85a-63 was transformed into competence Escherichia coli BL21(DE3).The bacterium was induced by isopropyl-&#946;-D-thiogalactopyranoside(IPTG) and its lysates were loaded directly onto sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(SDS-PAGE), approximately 49 ku exogenous protein was observed on the SDS-PAGE. The protein was analyzed by using Western-blotting. The results indicated that the protein was of antigenic reactivity of Mycobacterium bovis. These results could serve as a basis for further studies on the usefulness of the fusion gene and its expression productin the development of subunit vaccine, DNA vaccine and diagnostic reagents against bovine tuberculosis.

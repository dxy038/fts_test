Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate a new needle electrode for conization of the cervix that was developed in my department. Study Design: This was a prospective study of 58 unselected women with histologically verified cervical intraepithelial neoplasia who underwent conization with the diathermy needle. The operations were performed with local anesthesia as outpatient procedures. Follow-up time was 5 years. Results: All cones were removed in one piece and were of high histologic quality. Mean (±SD) operating time, including anesthesia, was 7.9 ± 2.7 minutes. Mean depth of thermal damage was 0.29 ± 0.21 mm, and mean blood loss was 12.5 ± 9.4 mL. No late complications have been noted, and 94.8% of patients have required no further treatment. Conclusion: Needle excision of the transformation zone is a simple and effective outpatient procedure that yields a one-piece cone specimen of high quality and carries a success rate of 94.8%.

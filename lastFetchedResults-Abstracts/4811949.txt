The research focuses on airborne SAR geometric calibration. Based on Range-Doppler (RD) model, mathematical model of airborne SAR image pixel direct geolocation was derived and objective calibration parameters were determined. A whole geometric calibration procedure was proposed, whose critical techniques had been studied. Through the experiment in Guizhou province, China, the calibration parameters were calculated and validated.

In this paper, optimization of Boeing 747 wing has accomplished for cruise condition (Mach number=0.85 and flight altitude=35000 ft) and an optimal wing shape have been proposed. Optimization problem has two objectives and is constrained for this research. Objective functions are minimization of wing weight and drag force that as well as confining design parameters, two functional constrains are applied. The first functional constrain is fuel tank volume in the aircraft wing that supply the required fuel. The second functional constrain is lift coefficient that should be equal to initial lift coefficient. Design parameters are root chord, wing span and wing sweep angle. Non-dominating genetic algorithm has been used in optimization process until finding one optimal solution; set of solutions (pareto front) are obtained for two objective functions. Finally a criterion for selecting a best solution for the aircraft on the pareto frontier is addressed.

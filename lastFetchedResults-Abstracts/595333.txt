Objective: The objectives of the study were to determine the age and sex distribution as well as types of glaucoma in hospitalized children and adults. Material and Methods: The study was conducted at Khyber Institute of Ophthalmic Medical Sciences, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, from January 01, 2005 to June; 30th 2006.The study was approved by the ethical committee of KIOMS. We had a total of 300 admitted patients (100 children and 200 adults) diagnosed with glaucoma, out of these patients,100 patients were included in the pediatric group and 200 in the adult group (17 years and above). This was a prospective hospital based descriptive study. A comprehensive performa was designed incorporating detailed history and a thorough ocular examination. Humphrey visual field analyzer was used for doing visual fields. In children, examination under anesthesia (EUA) was carried out. There was no follow-up. Statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used, for data analysis. Results: There were more males in the pediatric group (64% versus 36% females). Secondary glaucoma (60%) was more common than primary glaucoma (40%). Steroid induced glaucoma was the commonest glaucoma (17%) followed by hyphaema (14%), and uveitic glaucoma (13%),There were more males in the adult group (56.5% versus 43.5% females). In adults, primary glaucoma was the commonest glaucoma (56.5%) as compared to secondary glaucoma (43.5%). Primary open angle glaucoma constituted 35% followed by primary angle closure glaucoma (21.5%). In the secondary glaucoma, secondary angle closure glaucoma was the commonest (24.5%), followed by secondary open angle glaucoma (19%). Conclusion: In hospitalized patients, glaucoma was more common in males in both groups. Secondary glaucoma was more common in children whereas primary glaucoma was more common in adults.

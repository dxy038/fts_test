Mesoscopic modelling covers a wide range of ideas and models. The objective is to study length-scales and time-scales that are not easily accessible to either atomistic or macroscopic continuum methods. ‘Grand-challenge’, large-scale atomistic simulations push at the boundary of the mesoscale at the lower end, while increasing sophistication in micromechanics push at the boundary from the upper end. The increase in computing power is also responsible for the increasing number of 3D as opposed to 2D calculations. Obtaining well-defined, well-validated models remains difficult despite some recent successes.

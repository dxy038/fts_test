This paper presents an approach to integrate structure and control design. The objective of the problem is to find: (i) the optimal values of the structure parameters, e.g. stiffness, damping ratios, and actuator location parameters, etc.; (ii) an optimal stabilizing state feedback controller such that the active control energy is minimized subject to: (a) the prespecified RMS constraints on the outputs, and (b) the constraints on structure parameters. The algorithm is given in terms of LMIs, and the convergence is guaranteed. The solution is optimal in the &#8220;local sense&#8221;. An example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm

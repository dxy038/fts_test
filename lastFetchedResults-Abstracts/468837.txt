Objective
This study was undertaken to estimate the reliability and validity of an objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) for midline episiotomy repair using a lifelike anatomic model.
Study design
Eighteen residents were administered an episiotomy OSATS. Two evaluators independently completed an objective score sheet assessing six key components of the repair, seven global surgical skills, and a pass/fail score for each resident. Residents also completed an anonymous self-assessment.
Results
Reliability indices were 0.95 for the checklist and global surgical skills rating. Construct validity found significant differences on the checklist, global surgical skills, and pass/fail score sheets by residency level. Residents more often assessed their own global surgical skills performance lower than the independent evaluators. Surprisingly, 61% (11/18) of the residents failed the assessment, including all postgraduate year 1 and postgraduate year 2 residents.
Conclusion
Episiotomy OSATS that used task-specific and global checklists provide a reliable and valid method of assessing resident skills in this anatomic model, and performance correlates with resident year level of training.

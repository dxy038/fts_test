The software metrics decision support system (SMDSS) methodology was developed to address the problem of selecting the &#8220;best&#8221; set of values for quantifiable software project goals commensurate with various constraints and managementÂ´s desires. The methodology was prototyped in a proof-of-concept tool, called MAUS, which uses multi-attribute utility theory (MAU). The MAU-based decision-making methodology is designed to aid software and systems managers in the use of a systematic, objective, and documentable quantification method. MAUS implements some novel aspects and extensions of the MAU methodology. MAUS uses MAU to explore a &#8220;space&#8221; of possible choices, and it utilizes a constraint equation to generate alternatives. The SMDSS methodology and the supportive MAUS tool promote implementation of the guidance provided in Practical Software Measurement: A Guide to Objective Program Insight

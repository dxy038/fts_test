Most conventional approaches to electromagnetic conflict (EC) are "hard" in nature, which presume EC to be a static, predictable encounter. This forms the basis of the standalone design philosophy for EC equipment adopted to date, from which flow various EMI/EMC and MIL standards. This reductionist approach is doomed to failure in complex electromagnetic environments. The ultimate objective of EC is to affect the man, preferably the decision maker, and not the individual system(s) per se. In modern conflict, any model of the prevalent EC environment also depends on non-quantifiable factors, such as training, morale and the uncertainties of combat, which contribute to system entropy and emphasize the importance of the human decision maker. The EC subsystem of a C<sup>2</sup>W system can therefore be classified as a human activity system (HAS). The authors propose a holistic system design philosophy for EC systems, based on the system dynamics (SD) approach, incorporating the soft systems methodology (SSM), to achieve a realistic representation of the futuristic electromagnetic environment. The SSM-SD paradigm is systematically developed, using the CATWOE model, system root definition (RD), cybernetic holons and system dynamics archetypes.

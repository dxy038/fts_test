How to determine location and scale of electric vehicle charging station is a new problem for many researchers. A comprehensive objective function considering geographic information, construction cost and running cost is built in this paper. In objective function, construction cost consists of land cost, and investment in distribution transformer. Running cost includes power supply losses and with traffic flow as constraint conditions, which scientifically and comprehensively reflects the substance problem of locating and sizing of electric vehicle charging station. Electric vehicle charging station locating and sizing is a non-convex, nonlinear, and combinatorial optimization problem. On the basis of the established objective function, an adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem in this paper. The proposed algorithm and optimization model are tested by a planning example of charging station for electric vehicle to verify the feasibility and effectiveness.

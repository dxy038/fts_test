High definition television (HDTV) video delivery services over IP networks have recently started. To make the delivered high-quality HDTV video comfortable to view, we need to design appropriate delivery systems and then monitor the quality of experience. Currently, subjective assessment is the main method used to quantify video quality. However, it is unsuitable for real time monitoring of video quality. Therefore, we need an objective video quality assessment method that can effectively estimate subjective video quality from the video characteristics. We propose a full-reference-type objective video quality measurement method that is applicable to the evaluation of coding distortions in HDTV. We analyzed the results from applying the conventional method (J.247 Annex A) to HDTV video and improved the conventional method on the basis of those results. We applied fuzzy measure to the conventional method so as to consider the interaction effects of each parameter because the conventional method tends to obtain different characteristics between high quality and low quality regions of video content.

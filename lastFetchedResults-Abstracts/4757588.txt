The objective of this study is to identify, catalog, and relate surface phenomena observed in SAR imagery of the Delaware Bay with concurrent environmental conditions (tides, winds, currents, river discharge, etc). To accomplish this objective, we examined a sequence of RADARSAT-1 SAR containing approximately 176 standard mode scenes collected over the Delaware Bay and adjacent coastal waters between May 1997 and February 2004. In this paper we report on 58 standard mode-2 scenes collected during ascending orbits. Unique to this RADARSAT image time sequence is the contemporaneous set of in situ meteorological and oceanographic observations that were collected from shipboard platforms and fixed stations throughout the Delaware Bay during the image acquisition period.

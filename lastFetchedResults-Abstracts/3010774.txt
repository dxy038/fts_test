This contribution addresses the estimation problem of holding times in timed event graphs. Based on the known Petri net topology the holding times are determined such that an equation error is minimized. The paper investigates the important issue of convergence of the estimated parameters to the true parameter values and shows that this objective can be achieved by applying particularly chosen input signals. A new iterative estimation procedure is proposed using these suitably designed input signals.

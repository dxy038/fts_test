Chronical releases of tritium from the helium primary coolant into the water secondary coolant is a fundamental safety issue in the design of a fusion reactor steam generator. It is well known that the steam/water circuit of a fusion reactor would be considered not relevant from a radiological point of view, while if a strong permeation of tritium will be present it will be released together with incondensable gases in the condenser. The permeation of hydrogen isotopes through candidate steam generator materials in different conditions was studied in the past. Further experiments demonstrated that nickel alloys of nuclear interest are always covered by a thin and adherent oxide layer able to reduce permeation of orders of magnitude. The major objective of this work is the evaluation of the permeated flux through nickel alloys, when exposed to pure hydrogen and to an oxidant gas stream, to verify the real permeability of these materials in conditions close to those foreseen in the helium side of the steam generator.

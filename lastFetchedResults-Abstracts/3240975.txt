With consideration of the increased costs for maintaining power system stable due to the incorporation of wind power, in this paper, an economic/environmental dispatch stochastic optimization model for power system integrated with large scale wind farms was formulated based on in-depth analysis of the random nature and probability calculations of overestimation and underestimation of available wind power output. The optimization goals are to minimize both the total polluting emission and operational cost as much as possible. An excellent multi-objective optimization algorithm based on the non-dominated sorting differential evolution was proposed to solve this model, and entropy weights and fuzzy set theory were employed to extract the comprehensive optimal solution. The simulation results on a power system with large scale wind farms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the impacts of wind power to power systems optimal dispatch were analyzed from the points of energy saving and emission reduction.

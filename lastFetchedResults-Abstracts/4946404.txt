The integration of lightpath topology design and IP/MPLS traffic engineering provides greater flexibility for next generation networks. In this paper, we consider the integrated design problem of configuration of lightpath topology and optimal routing of IP/MPLS tunnels on this lightpath topology for time- varying traffic. A mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to design an optimal configuration of lightpath topology, which takes time-dependent traffic demand as an input to the model for IP/MPLS traffic engineering. We consider two variants of the problem: in the first variant, re-routing of IP/MPLS tunnels is not allowed from one-time period to another while reconfiguration rerouting is allowed in the second variation. We also consider various traffic engineering objectives and study their impact on different performance measures. In particular, we propose a composite objective function to combine the benefits of various objectives. Through computational results, we quantify the benefit of the configurable option over the static option.

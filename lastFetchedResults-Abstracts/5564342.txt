The role of the personal computer and software in science and engineering applications has expanded to include all aspects of the scientific or engineering process, including modeling/hypothesizing, experimenting/measuring, and documenting/concluding. There are fundamental issues in scientific computing that need to be addressed and one of the more critical issues is application software integration. Currently users copy, paste, or transfer data through files between different software applications. However, emerging technologies, such as interapplication communication and object linking and embedding (OLE), are making applications easier to use and more productive. The paper shows an example of how current application software technology can be used to predict and experimentally verify the rate at which two chemicals react. In addition, features of OLE version 2.0 for scientific application software integration are presented. In the model of the scientific/engineering process, application software is used in each step of the process to solve a chemical rate equation problem. The objective is to find a mathematical model for the reaction rate of two chemicals. HiQ for Macintosh is used in the hypothesis/model phase, LabVIEW for Macintosh and a plug-in data acquisition (DAQ) board in the experiment/measure phase, and then HiQ is used once again in the document/conclude phase

Image interpolation is a technique of producing a high-resolution image from its low-resolution counterpart, which is often required in many image processing tasks. In this paper, we propose an edge-directed bicubic convolution (BC) interpolation. The proposed method can well adapt to the varying edge structures of images. The experimental results show that it reduces common artifacts such as blurring, blocking and ringing etc. and significantly outperforms some existing interpolation methods (including BC interpolation) in terms of both subjective and objective measures.

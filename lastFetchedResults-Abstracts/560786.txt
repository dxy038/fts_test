Background and Objective: The rate of cesarean section is higher than standard of WHO (15%) in Iran. This theory-based study was carried out to identify factors related to elective cesarean labor amongst pregnant women.

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was done and 342 mothers referred to public maternal health care centers and private clinics were randomly selected in Ahvaz in 2010. Data gathering was done using a structured based Health belief model and theory-planned behavior questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS through logistic regression, chi-square and independent t tests. 

Results: Mean age of women was 23.95Â±4.07 years. There was a significant correlation among income, ethnicity, job and education with choosing delivery mode. The results of t test showed that tendency to the mode of delivery was significantly related to perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, subjective norms and self efficacy (p < 0.001). Using multivariate regression, three constructs including perceived barriers, subjective norms and self efficacy were significantly related to elective cesarean section (p < 0.001).

Conclusion: Promoting self-efficacy to overcome barriers such as pain can encourage pregnant women to select vaginal delivery. However, important factor is subjective norms that are influenced by husbands and mothers. In this regard, researchers suggest applying subjective norms in other theory-based studies.

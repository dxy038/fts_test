Detailed finite-element modeling of the human body has been carried out for the evaluation of implanted electrode potential distributions and defibrillation fields. Modeling details have been achieved in 2-D and 3-D down to the arbitrary topologies of the human body and its organs. This type of analysis requires 2-D and 3-D mesh generators that can be used to discretize arbitrary shapes. The main objective of this study is to develop a highly accurate clinical tool to be used by physicians to determine the adequacy of operation of an implanted device across the human heart before surgery. Furthermore, the model could determine the optimum sizes and locations of the stimulation electrodes for achieving a successful defibrillation according to the physiological requirements regarding shock uniformity and strength

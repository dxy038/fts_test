Several extensions and improvements to surface merging procedures based on the extraction of isosurfaces
from a distance map de ned on an adaptive background grid are presented. The main objective
is to extend the application of these algorithms to surfaces with sharp edges and corners. In order to
deal with objects of di erent length scales, the initial background grids are created using a Delaunay
triangulation method and local voxelizations. A point enrichment technique that introduces points into
the background grid along detected surface features such as ridges is used to ensure that these features
are preserved in the  nal merged surface. The surface merging methodology is extended to include other
Boolean operations between surface triangulations. The iso-surface extraction algorithms are modi ed
to obtain the correct iso-surface for multi-component objects. The procedures are demonstrated with
various examples, ranging from simple geometrical entities to complex engineering applications. The
present algorithms allow realistic modelling of a large number of complex engineering geometries using
overlapping components de ned discretely, i.e. via surface triangulations. This capability is very useful
for grid generation starting from data originated in measurements or images

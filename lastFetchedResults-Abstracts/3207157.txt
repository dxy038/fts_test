This paper presents the recent update on IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area network (WRAN) working group activities, especially IEEE 802.22b task group (IEEE 802.22b) for enhancement for broadband services and monitoring applications in TV whitespace (TVWS). As an action to extend and enhance IEEE 802.22 applications, a new IEEE 802.22b task group has been formed and approved by the IEEE 802 executive committee. The objective of IEEE 802.22b specifies new amendment of IEEE 802.22-2011 to include low complexity monitoring applications, as well as enhance the currently available broadband services. In this paper, we briefly introduce use cases and technical topics, as well as future direction on system design, system classes such as introduction of low complexity devices, possible access methods, throughput improvement options etc.

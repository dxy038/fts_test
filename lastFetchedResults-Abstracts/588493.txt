ackground: The relationship between handedness, intelligence and cognitive abilities has been of interest of many researchers for a long time.
Objective: The aim of this study is to compare intelligence (verbal and practical) and its subscales scores based on handedness between two groups, left and right-handed.
Method: The sample comprised 120 graduate students who were randomly selected and measured by Edinburg's Handedness Inventory and Wechslerâ€™s Adult Intelligence Scale. 
Results: test and Multivariate analysis of variance showed that there is significant difference between the left-handed and right-handed in overall intelligence score (t=2.63, P < 0.05), verbal intelligence (F=61.13, P < 0.01), three of verbal intelligence subscales (Information, Digit span and comprehension) and some of practical intelligence subscales (picture completion, picture arrangement, block design). The total and verbal intelligence of the left-handed is more than the right-handed. But, the practical intelligence (F=0.021, P > 0.05) and its two subscales (Object Assembly and coding) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusion:This research could create appropriate learning environments and sensitivity to the complexity and the combination of cognitive, psychological and neurological excelled in terms of learning and intelligence help.

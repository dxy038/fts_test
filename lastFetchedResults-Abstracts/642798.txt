Objective
We evaluated the effects of soy isoflavone supplementation on hemostasis in healthy postmenopausal women.
Methods

In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 47 postmenopausal women 47–66 y of age received 40 mg of soy isoflavone (n = 25) or 40 mg of casein placebo (n = 22) once a day for 6 mo. Levels of factors VII and X, fibrinogen, thrombin–antithrombin complex, prothrombin fragments 1 plus 2, antithrombin, protein C, total and free protein S, plasminogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and D-dimers were measured at baseline and 6 mo. Urinary isoflavone concentrations (genistein and daidzein) were measured as a marker of compliance and absorption using high-performance liquid chromatography. Baseline characteristics were compared by unpaired Student’s t test. Within-group changes and comparison between the isoflavone and casein placebo groups were determined by a mixed effects model.
Results

The levels of hemostatic variables did not change significantly throughout the study in the isoflavone group; however, the isoflavone group showed a statistically significant reduction in plasma concentration of prothrombin fragments 1 plus 2; both groups showed a statistically significant reduction in antithrombin, protein C, and free protein S levels. A significant increase in D-dimers was observed only in the isoflavone group. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels increased significantly in the placebo group. However, these changes were not statistically different between groups.
Conclusion

The results of the present study do not support a biologically significant estrogenic effect of soy isoflavone on coagulation and fibrinolysis in postmenopausal women. However, further research will be necessary to definitively assess the safety and efficacy of isoflavone.

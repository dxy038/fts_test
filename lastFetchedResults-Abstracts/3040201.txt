The objective of the project is to design a harmonic monitoring system to monitor the harmonic components, as well as the existing frequencies and to design a graphical user interface (GUI) to observe and analyze different signals using digital filters and MATLAB/sup /spl reg// software to find out the harmonic components. From the monitoring system results, it can be seen that the content of the harmonics and high frequencies in any equipment can be obtained as graphs and compared in a few cases for the same load as shown for the UPS on its load and no-load conditions.

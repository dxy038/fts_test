In order to determine the sort and amounts of spare parts for the long voyage vessel which is usually difficult, the paper firstly analyzes the characteristics of spare parts supply and maintenance on the sea. Then based on the theory of multi-objective programming and law of diminishing marginal returns, a multi-weighted optimization model for the storage of spare parts and its algorithm flowchart are designed. At last an example of calculation is also offered.

Earthworks of assumed age and their initial and current morphologies provide an ideal basis for developing and testing models for long-term landform erosion. Inca agricultural terraces abandoned at ∼ 1532 A.D in the drylands of southern Peru may be used to document morphological changes since the abandonment. The objective of this research is to determine the erosion pattern and process to estimate the erosion rate.

velopment of rills and channels on the Inca agricultural terraces is evidence for erosion by wash processes on slopes where the anchoring effect of vegetation is absent and loose material is available for removal. The pattern and amount of erosion from 1532–2005 A.D. is estimated by comparing elevation models of the observed morphology and reconstructed models of the original morphology of the Inca terraces. The results show that in areas of sediment accumulation surface elevation increased up to 0.5 m. Elevation lowering on the terrace treads was 0.7 m at maximum, and a temporally and spatially averaged lowering rate was 0.094 mm yr− 1. This gives insights about how the rate of erosion occurs on currently disturbed lands in arid environments where soil resources are scarce and lands are prone to desertification.

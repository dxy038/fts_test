Introduction: An article with a clear message can transfer research
knowledge better. However, this is the case when the message suits
the type of study methodology (research design) and its results.
The objective of this study was to assess the presence of message
articles and the type of study methodologies.
Methods: Articles published between 2001 and 2006, on
maternal care, diabetes, and tuberculosis, which were based on
studies performed on the Iranian population were investigated. A
systematic search was performed in foreign databases ‘Pubmed,
Medline, and Embase’, and national databases ‘Iranmedex, SID
(Scientific Information Database), and Iranpsych’. Seven hundred
and ninety?five articles were examined for the type of study
methodology and presence of an actionable message (one that
specifies what and how an action should be carried out).
Results: Among the 795 articles accessed, cross?sectional studies
were the most frequent (50.9%) and systematic reviews were the
least frequent (0.4%). Cohort cases were observed in 6.9% of the
cases. Actionable messages were observed in 22.1% of all the cases
and 24.7% of the cross?sectional studies.
Conclusions: Cohort studies increased from 5% in 2001 to 6.9%
in 2006, but the shortage of systematic reviews represented a major
weakness in the country’s knowledge production process. Studies
with a higher level of evidence such as systematic reviews, and
cohort and interventional studies should be among the priorities
of knowledge production in the country.

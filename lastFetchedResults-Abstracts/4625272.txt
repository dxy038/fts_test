Modeling aims to reduce the time to design and to manufacture. This is especially true for real-time applications. Transportation is one of the most constrained areas for these applications. Thus, any designed system must be modeled and verified in order to prevent troubles and dysfunctionings. In addition, in the transportation area, a lot of embedded devices are used. Then efficient communications are badly required and will ensure the end-to-end interoperability. Therefore, it reduces the waste of hardware and software resources underused. This paper presents a concept of an interoperability channel between embedded devices. This channel named C2A &#8220;Connect to All&#8221; is modeled using two complimentary tools: UPPAAL and SDL. The objective is not only to check the validity of our new proposed concept (using simulation and properties verification), but also to compare the use of these two approaches in order to help any future user of these formalisms to make judicious choices according to their applications.

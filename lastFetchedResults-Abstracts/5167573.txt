The tight coupling between the data and the layout of the spreadsheets is one of the important problems in spreadsheet systems. The existing solutions are lack of flexibility and inefficiency in data retrieval. To improve the performance, a concept of data semantic object is introduced which encapsulate the data and its semantic in an object. The objective is to decouple the data and structure in the spreadsheet system. Based on the data semantic object, a spreadsheet system model is proposed and the related technique details are described. Finally, we verified the efficiency of the system in the petroleum domain.

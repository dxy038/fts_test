The use of computers in education has greatly increased during the last two decades. At the same time, technology advances have opened new spaces and possibilities for the field of computer-based edutainment-education in the form of entertainment - where learners can achieve their learning goals while having fun. Games on mobile phones have become a significant part of the contemporary culture experienced by young people. Research indicates the potential of mobile games to encourage learning in young adults. The 3-year EC-supported project mGBL (mobile game-based learning) had the objective to prototype a platform for the development and deployment of mobile learning and guidance games, able to support the learning process and the support of decision making in critical situations not only in a cognitive but also in an emotional way. This paper describes key issues emerged in development phase of the Mogabal game engine within mGBL framework in both technical and pedagogical aspects, showing technologies, strategies and methodology adopted. A number of game prototypes based on such engine were devised and some were tested during the project user-trials. These games prototypes demonstrate the capabilities of the devised engine to cover a wide range of different games types and educational contents.

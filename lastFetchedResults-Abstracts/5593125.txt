This paper explored on the video´s potential in assisting lecturers to sustain students´ concentration and enhance students´ enthusiasm in and outside the classroom. The driving educational belief, as idea and practice, is that by bringing ideas to life in design, hence with good-quality technology infrastructure, effective information and communication technologies (ICT) integration in and outside the lecture room is accessible. This study goes some way in bridging this gap by exploring the students´ engagement and motivation toward video application. Findings demonstrated positive content learning outcomes as measured by objective tests and anecdotal evidence. The video approach facilitated connections to content, student motivation and commitment in learning development identity.

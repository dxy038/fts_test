Development of distribution systems is
requested in high system losses and poor voltage
regulation. Consequently, an effective distribution system
has become more urgent and important structure. Hence
proper selection of conductors in the distribution system
is important as it determines the current densities and the
resistance of the lines. This paper examines the use of
different evolutionary algorithms, imperialist competitive
algorithm (ICA), to optimal branch conductor selection in
planning radial distribution systems with the objective to
minimize the overall cost of annual energy losses and
depreciation on the cost of conductors and reliability in
order to improve productivity. Furthermore, the
backward-forward sweep iterative method was adopted to
solve the radial load flow analysis. Simulations are
carried out on 69-bus radial distribution network using
ICA approach in order to show the accuracy as well as
the efficiency of the proposed solution technique.

The theory of international relationship is concerned with how to cope with the problems arising in the international arena and/or try to bring order among nations. Hence, the science of the international relationships can be defined as the study of systematic order. In the discussion of international order, we must distinguish between the demand and the supply of order and that is because some of the world actors are demanding order rather than trying to provide it. It is also noteworthy that in the discussion of international actors, international order depends more on the governments rather than nongovernmental organizations and individual actors. The role playing of great powers such as the United States, Russia, China and the European Union in bringing order in the international arena becomes determining factors. The present study aims to the role of Russian pattern of order in the post- cold war period in the international system. To understand the objective of Russia in this period, we analyze the Russian pattern of the international order in the framework of the concept of "balanced-oriented order" which is intended to create political-military equilibrium of power.

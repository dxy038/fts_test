Objective: Our goal was to compare the efficacy of azithromycin with that of amoxicillin for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection during pregnancy. Study Design: A randomized controlled trial of pregnant women with cervical C trachomatis infection receiving care at two inner-city, university-based prenatal clinics. Pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin, 500 mg, three times daily for 7 days, or oral azithromycin, 1 g, in a single dose. Partners were referred for treatment. Tests of cure were scheduled 4 weeks after initiation of treatment. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Student t test and Ï‡2 analysis. Results: One hundred twenty-nine pregnant women were enrolled, and 110 (85%) completed the protocol. There was similar treatment efficacy between amoxicillin and azithromycin (58% vs 64%, respectively,P = .56). In the amoxicillin group 3 women (5.5%) were intolerant, compared with 6 (10.9%) in the azithromycin group (P = .31). Conclusion: Amoxicillin and azithromycin are equally efficacious in the treatment of cervical C trachomatis during pregnancy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:1352-6.)

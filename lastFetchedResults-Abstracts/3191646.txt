The electric vehicle is the main development direction for future new-energy vehicles. And the charging stations´ planning and construction are the premise to promote the electric vehicle´s use. In the light of the intensive traffic on the urban trunk road and its great charging demand of electric vehicles, this paper constructs a planning model of charging stations on the trunk road. The impact of the power distribution and the mileage of electric vehicles on the charging station planning is considered in the model. The maximum expectation of electric vehicles coming to stations for recharge from the trunk road is chosen as the objective function for locating the charging station. The number of chargers in the station is optimized according to the minimum sum of the stations´ service cost and the customers´ waiting fees. In addition, this model analyses the service level of the charging station and its operational efficiency by using the queuing theory. After all, the feasibility and effectiveness of this model are verified by the example.

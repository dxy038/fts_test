Objective: With an ovine model in which growth restriction was induced by exposure to heat stress, our aims were as follows: (1) to describe the normal gestational age–related changes in Doppler velocimetry in the ovine fetal aorta and umbilical artery and (2) to compare Doppler velocimetry between heat-stressed and non-heat-stressed fetuses. Study Design: Five ewes were exposed to heat stress for 55 days beginning at 35 days' gestation. Five ewes were not exposed and served as controls. Aortic and umbilical artery pulsed Doppler velocimetry was obtained, including the systolic/diastolic ratio, pulsatility index, and resistance index. Data were obtained between 50 and 120 days' gestation. Linear regression analysis was used to analyze gestational age–related changes in velocimetry. Comparison of mean index values between heat-stressed and non-heat-stressed fetuses were made with analysis of variance. Results: Heat-stressed fetuses demonstrated significantly higher systolic/diastolic ratios and pulsatility index values for both umbilical artery (p< 0.025; p< 0.033) and aorta (p< 0.017; p< 0.022) compared with controls. The umbilical artery and aortic resistance index values were not different between groups (p< 0.079; p< 0.28). The slopes for each of the Doppler index values were negative in both normal and heat-stressed fetuses. Umbilical artery and aortic end-diastolic flows remained absent through the first 70 days of gestation in both groups. Conclusion: Doppler velocimetry index values decrease with increasing gestational age, reflecting decreased placental bed vascular resistance. The higher Doppler index values seen in the heat-stressed group are consistent with increased placental vascular resistance. The normal absence of diastolic flow until 70 days' gestation is similar to the pattern described in humans. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;178:451-6.)

Generally, the vertical roll process is used to achieve extensive width reduction in hot strip mill. However, it is difficult to avoid the defects such as dog-bone and seam-defect. The sizing press has been developed in response to the defects mentioned above. Especially, this study is carried out to investigate the deformation of slab by two-step sizing press. The deformation behavior in the width sizing process is more favorable than that in conventional vertical rolling edger. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal anvil shape parameters in the sizing press with two-step die from the viewpoint of forming load and edge-seam length. In the sizing press with two-step die, to minimize forming load and dog-bone profile anvil shape parameters are considered as. The optimal combination of the parameters is determined by FE-simulation and artificial neural network (ANN). In general, the edge-seam defect occurs parallel to the rolling direction at both edges in horizontal rolling process after sizing press. The slab deformation in sizing press with convex anvil is analyzed by FE-simulation. The most suitable profile of the anvil is also discussed for the improvement of trimming loss because of the side seam defect by FE-simulation and ANN.

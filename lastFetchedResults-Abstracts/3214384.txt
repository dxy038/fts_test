Grid computing, inspired by electrical power Grid, is an emerging trend for making easy access to computing resources. Its main objective is to solve computationally hard problems which otherwise cannot be solved by single CPU. This extremely high computing power is achieved by optimal utilization of geographically distributed heterogeneous resources which are lying idle. Load balanced task scheduling is very important problem in complex Grid environment. So task scheduling which is one of the NP-Complete problems becomes a focus of research scholars in Grid computing area. The traditional Min-Min and Max-Min algorithms are simple algorithms that produces a schedule that minimizes the makespan than the other traditional algorithms in the literature. In real scenario of Min-Min and Max-Min failed to produce a load balanced schedule. The proposed method has two-phases. In the first phase the traditional Max-Min algorithm is executed and in the second phase the tasks are rescheduled to use the unutilized resources effectively.

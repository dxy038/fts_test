Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the psychologic impact and client satisfaction of routine surgical evacuation of the uterus with medical evacuation in cases of spontaneous abortion. Study Design: This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Two hundred eighteen women who were admitted to a university teaching hospital after spontaneous abortion and who consented to the study were randomized to routine surgical evacuation or medical evacuation of the uterus with the use of misoprostol. General psychologic well-being, level of depression, fatigue symptoms, psychiatric morbidity, social functioning, client satisfaction, and acceptance were measured in the 2 groups. Results: The 2 groups did not differ in any of the measured psychological outcomes. Significantly more participants who experienced successful evacuation of the uterus with the misoprostol protocol would choose the same mode of treatment if they were able to choose again. However, participants for whom the medical treatment failed to evacuate the uterus and subsequent surgical evacuation was required are significantly less satisfied with the treatment. Conclusion: Medical treatment of spontaneous abortion with misoprostol is psychologically safe and more compatible with the ethnomedical beliefs of our Chinese participants. Client satisfaction and acceptance should be taken into consideration in the evaluation of treatment outcomes. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185: 953-8.)

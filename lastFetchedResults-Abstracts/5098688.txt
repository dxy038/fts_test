The objective of this paper is to investigate the optimal periodic positioning problem using Fourier series methods. Examples of periodic positioning systems are manufacturing machines that perform repetitive assembly tasks. In such applications, the motive forces are provided by electric motors, the resulting current flow generates heat, and a tradeoff exists between achievable cycle time and corresponding temperature rise. This fundamental trade-off is explored for single-axis motion systems driven by a class of synchronous motors

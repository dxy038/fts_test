There have been previous reports of time dependent property changes in composite resins. However, the changes in material properties have not been correlated to the ratio of resin matrix/filler contents and composite morphology in previous reports. The objective of this investigation was to characterize the VickerÂ´s hardness changes in two dental composite resins with defined differences in the resin matrix to filler weight ratios as well as particulate size differences.

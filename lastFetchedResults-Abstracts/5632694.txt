A New and efficient method using interval wavelets to assess image quality of medical image is presented in this paper. This new quality index is better suited to assess medical images; therefore it explicitly focuses on the image structure. We show that this new index outperforms other methods for the assessment of image quality in medical images. In this paper, one dimensional interval wavelet have been applied to analyse the effect of various objective quality factors like Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR), Maximum Difference (MD), Normalised Correlation (NK), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Structural content (SC). The results of experimental quality investigations were fall under acceptable quality boundaries and are presented. Also the result of the proposed method has been compared with the existing fractal image compression method.

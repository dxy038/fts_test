We study survivable service provisioning under a scheduled traffic model in wavelength convertible WDM optical mesh networks. In this model, a set of demands is given, and the setup time and teardown time of each demand are known in advance. We formulate the problem as integer linear programs that maximally exploit network resource reuse in both space and time. The objective is to minimize the total number of wavelength-links used by working paths and protection paths of all traffic demands while 100% restorability is guaranteed against any single failures. Our simulation results indicate that joint optimization of resource sharing in space and time enabled by our connection holding-time aware protection schemes can achieve significantly better resource utilization than schemes that are holding-time unaware

The 3D data can be extracted by measuring healthy hip joint of patients, which are the basis of making proper artificial hip conform to right physiological characteristics. In this paper, a method based on 2D contour characteristic matching in multilayer is proposed, which extracts 3D data for outer hip, and the 3D bone information can be exactly obtained. The method consists of adaptive radiation method on bone contour, associated interframe tracing method and bidirectional contour information fusion method for every layer. In fact, the experiment for 3D shows that the method in paper can accurately extract 3D data on proximal femur in CT series images.

Eye tracking reveals a personÂ´s state of mind. Thus, representing personal cognitive states using eye tracking leads to objective evaluations of these states, and this can be applied to various fields. In this paper, we propose a model that evaluates the degree of personal distraction based on eye tracking. Moreover, we apply the proposed model to eye tracking for a person driving a car.

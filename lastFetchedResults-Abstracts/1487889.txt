The objective of this study was to determine whether the inclusion of garlic in a ration would have a negative impact on the flavour of lamb. The study used meat from 31 Merino wether lambs fed diets with varying levels of garlic (0%, 1.8% and 3.6%) for 10 weeks. Cooked samples of meat from the lambs were assessed for flavour and acceptability as lamb by an untrained consumer panel. There was no difference (P &gt; 0.05) between the treatments in flavour score, but the 3.6% garlic treatment group scored significantly higher in terms of acceptability as lamb (P &lt; 0.05) and was commented on positively by the panellists more frequently than the meat from any other treatment (P &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the inclusion of garlic into the animals' feed did not have a negative impact on the flavour of the lamb and, at the high rate (3.6%), made the meat more acceptable to the panellists.

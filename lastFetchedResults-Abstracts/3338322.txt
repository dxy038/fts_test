Networked infrastructures underpin most social and economical interactions nowadays and have become an integral part of the critical infrastructure. Thus, it is crucial that heterogeneous networked environments provide adequate resilience in order to satisfy the quality requirements of the user. In order to achieve this, a coordinated approach to confront potential challenges is required. These challenges can manifest themselves under different circumstances in the various infrastructure components. The objective of this paper is to present a multi-level resilience approach that goes beyond the traditional monolithic resilience schemes that focus mainly on one infrastructure component. The proposed framework considers four main aspects, i.e. users, application, network and system. The latter three are part of the technical infrastructure while the former profiles the service user. Under two selected scenarios this paper illustrates how an integrated approach coordinating knowledge from the different infrastructure elements allows a more effective detection of challenges and facilitates the use of autonomic principles employed during the remediation against challenges.

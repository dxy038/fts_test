One of the main goals of e-government is increasing government service capability (GSC). GSC evaluation is a required work with strategic significance. The objective of this study is to investigate a fuzzy multiple attributes decision-making model for evaluating GSC. A framework for evaluating GSC is presented, which includes two parts, one is an evaluation hierarchy with attributes, the other a judgment matrix model with two dimensions to identify the evaluation results of GSC. A fuzzy linguistic approach is proposed to evaluate the GSC of e-governments. The evaluation results of GSC obtained through the proposed approach are objective and unbiased. Through evaluation result of GSC, managers could judge the necessity to improve the GSC and determine which dimension of GSC is the most needed direction to improve.

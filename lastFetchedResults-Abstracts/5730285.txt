We describe a methodology to support variant design. This methodology was developed in an ESPRIT project called DEKLARE and its objective is to help companies facing the pressures of &#8220;customer driven design&#8221; with fast design cycles and geometric and non geometric constraints on the products, A typical example of this is from one of our DEKLARE project partners: Copreci (Spain). Copreci manufactures components for household appliances: for example, gas taps for companies such as Hotpoint and Thomson. For Copreci, all gas taps are similar, but any new order may trigger a new design variant. While conventional CAD support focuses on reuse of geometry, in gas tap engineering there are a large number of functional constraints on the design which need to be taken into consideration. Merely &#8220;cutting and pasting&#8221; CAD objects can introduce errors in a new design because there is no knowledge of, or support for, design constraints

Parametric design optimization is presented for the crashworthiness improvement of an automotive body. The
thickness of principle internal parts of the automotive frontal crumple zone was employed as design variables for
optimization. The objective was to improve automotive crashworthiness conditions according to the defined criterion
during a full frontal impact. Using the Taguchi method, this study analyzed the optimum conditions for design
objectives. The impact factors and their optimal levels were obtained by analyzing the experimental results. A full
frontal impact was implemented for simulating crashworthiness in the nonlinear dynamic code, LS-DYNA.The
controllable factors used in this study consisted of six internal parts of the vehicle’s frontal structure in a condition that
their thickness was the “design parameter". Interestingly, the optimum conditions for automotive crashworthiness
occurred with 14% improvement in the performance criterion in comparison with the baseline design while several
parts experienced mass reduction.

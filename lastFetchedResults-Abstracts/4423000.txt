To control the movement of UAV gyroscope, a design method which uses a FPGA controller to control three step-motors and gyroscopes is described. The method can realize digital pulse continue adjustment and control step-motor bidirectional rotate. The system´s mechanism and contracture, emphasis on the FPGA controller´s design and the Verilog HDL coding method is introduced. The system possesses features of simple constructer, lower cost, apply to others easily.

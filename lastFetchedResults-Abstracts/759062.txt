Variational design sensitivity analysis is a
branch of structural optimization. We consider variations
of the material configuration and we are interested
in the change of the state variables and the objective
functional due to these variations. In the same manner
in configurational mechanics we are interested in
changes of the material body. In this paper, we derive
the physical and material residual problem by using
standard optimization procedures and we investigate
sensitivity relations for the physical and material problem.
These sensitivity relations are used in order to
solve the coupled physical and material problem. Both
problems are coupled by the pseudo load operator,
which play an important role for the solution of structural
optimization problems. Furthermore, we derive
explicit formulations for the variations of the physical
and material problem and propose different solution
algorithms for the coupled problem.

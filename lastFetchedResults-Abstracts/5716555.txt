Knapsack problem is a problem that arises when determining what items should be included in a storage area, which has a maximum storage capacity. A metaheuristic algorithm, Viral Systems, is applied to overcome the weaknesses of optimization methods. There are 3 hypothetical cases, which the basic difference is the number of items involved. The cases are used for parameter testing. Based on the experimental results, no Viral Systems parameters influence the objective function value in Case 1. The interaction between LIT<sup>0</sup>, p<sub>r</sub>, and p<sub>lt</sub> influences the objective function value in Case 2. LNR<sup>0</sup>, p<sub>lt</sub>, the interaction between p<sub>r</sub> and p<sub>lt</sub>, and the interaction between LIT<sup>0</sup>, LNR<sup>0</sup>, and pi influence the objective function value in Case 3. This research shows that Viral Systems is found to be promising, since it successfully reaches optimal solution for the first two cases. Nevertheless, parameters selection should be investigated more thoroughly.

In this paper, a novel objective no-reference model for evaluating video quality of experience (QoE) based on pattern matching of radar chart is proposed. With the input of N-dimensional data, the novel model may have the various video QoE with the different shapes of radar chart patterns. By discriminatory analysis of the patterns, the proposed model makes an effective and visual evaluation for video quality. Experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed model.

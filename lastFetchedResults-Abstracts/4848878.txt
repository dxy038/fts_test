Basically, scheduling concept for mixture policy of preventive with corrective maintenance is scheduled under the least assigned workers whose have high utilization of their maintenance responsibilities. Whereas, scheduling algorithm will be exploited and applied for determining the cyclic shift work and workers scheduling in according to entirely response to the activities of preventive and corrective maintenance. Additionally, every worker will have similar of the amount day-work and day-off with the equivalency vacancies on their weekend. The thinking on the basis of probabilistic failure rate concept is the main objective of this research study, whilst the algorithm is thought on basis of mixture policy of preventive and corrective which is to be useful for all industries to do their maintenance actions.

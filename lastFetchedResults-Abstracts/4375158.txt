A multi-objective fuzzy dynamic programming model for Three Gorges cascaded hydropower is presented in this paper. Three Gorges cascaded hydropower is a multifunctional reservoir, and it plays a great role in power generation, shipping, ecology, etc. Many methods have being developed to solve the conflict among them. In this paper, we develop a single-objective fuzzy dynamic programming model firstly, then we extent the model to multi-objective fuzzy dynamic programming model. Considering the actual conditions of Three Gorges cascaded hydropower, we take maximization of Three Gorges reservoir´s power generation and minimization of Gezhouba reservoir´s surplus water as the two objectives, and the optimal problem is solved satisfactorily.

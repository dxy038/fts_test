Some real-world optimization problems have hundreds or even thousands of decision variables. However, the effect that the scalability of parameters has in modern multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms has not been properly studied (the current benchmarks are normally adopted with ten to thirty decision variables). In this paper, we adopt a benchmark of parameter-wise scalable problems (the ZDT test problems) and analyze the behavior of six multi-objective metaheuristics on these test problems when using a number of decision variables that goes from 8 up to 2048. The computational effort required by each algorithm in order to reach the true Pareto front is also analyzed. Our study concludes that a particle swarm algorithm provides the best overall performance, although it has difficulties in multifrontal problems.

Regarding the poor performance of distribution canals in irrigation networks, offering effective methods to improve performance and optimal operation is considered necessary. Water distribution and delivery scheduling is a complex, multi- objective, multi- variable, and multi- constraint problem, which requires powerful optimization methods to be solved. In this study, ACS Algorithm is used for solving water delivery problem in AMX canal of Varamin irrigation network with 11 intakes. Three irrigation blocks were considered for temporal distribution of water delivery intakes. Intake classification in the blocks and scheduling of water delivery was determined so that intake demand water in irrigation duration is delivered by minimum of canal capacity. Based on research results, the maximum canal capacity achieved 1.15 m3/s. compared to PSO, the canal capacity was 490 l/s less than ACS. Also, the number of upstream gate regulations obtained 1 regulation less than PSO method. Results indicates the preferably of ACS method to PSO method.

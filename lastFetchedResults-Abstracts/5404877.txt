In cognitive radio networks, secondary users can share frequency spectrum with primary users, where the primary users charge secondary users for radio resource usage. Pricing schemes adopted by primary users is crucial to both primary users and secondary users. In this paper, we investigate three different pricing models in a cognitive network. Under the Bertrand competition, all sellers make decision simultaneously in terms of price. Under the Stackelberg competition, leader offer the price before followers. In the cooperative pricing, the objective is to maximize the total profit and we have utilized an N-person coalition game formulation for revenue sharing. We achieve the pricing solutions of these different pricing models and illustrate them with numerical examples.

Readers are welcomed to the first issue of the new IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology (T-CPMT). The new Transactions is a merger of the IEEE Transactions OF Advanced Packaging, IEEE Transactions on Components and Packaging Technologies, and the IEEE Transactions ON Electronics Packaging Manufacturing. In merging the Transactions, the objective is not to decrease the scope of CPMT, but to consolidate the publishing of our industry??s premier, peer-reviewed papers into one publication.

This paper studies the synchronization of complex chaotic systems in series expansion form by Lyapunov asymptotical stability theorem. A sufficient condition is given for the asymptotical stability of an error dynamics, and is applied to guiding the design of the secure communication. Finally, numerical results are studied for the Quantum-CNN oscillators synchronizing with unidirectional/bidirectional linear coupling to show the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization strategy.

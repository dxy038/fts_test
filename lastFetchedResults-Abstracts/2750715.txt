This study studies the fault-tolerant control (FTC) design based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system models and terminal-sliding-mode control (TSMC). This hybrid scheme can keep the advantages of both methods. By using the T-S fuzzy models to approximate the original non-linear system, the online computation burden can be alleviated since most of the T-S parameters can be offline computed. Moreover, TSMC not only owns the merits, including robustness to uncertainties and/or disturbances, fast response and easy implementation, but also performs better than conventional sliding-mode control (SMC) since the system states of TSMC will converge in finite time to the control objective point, that is, equivalent point, after the system states intersect sliding surface. Both of the active and passive FTC design schemes are presented. The proposed analytical results are also applied to the FTC for the attitude stabilisation of a spacecraft. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed scheme.

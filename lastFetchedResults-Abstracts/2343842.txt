Processes of severe plastic deformation (SPD) are defined as metal forming processes in which a very large plastic strain is imposed on a bulk process in order to make an ultra-fine grained metal. The objective of the SPD processes for creating ultra-fine grained metal is to produce lightweight parts by using high strength metal for the safety and reliability of micro-parts and for environmental harmony. In this keynote paper, the fabrication process of equal channel angular pressing (ECAP), accumulative roll-bonding (ARB), high pressure torsion (HPT), and others are introduced, and the properties of metals processed by the SPD processes are shown. Moreover, the combined processes developed recently are also explained. Finally, the applications of the ultra-fine grained (UFG) metals are discussed.

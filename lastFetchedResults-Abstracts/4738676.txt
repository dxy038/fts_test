The objective of this paper is to present the tested data of a submerged cryogenic induction generator and show its connection to the corresponding theoretical formulas used for predicting the performance of a standard induction generator. This is done to present these formulas as a model to electrical designers that will aid them in design of such an application and to demonstrate the application of the correction factors needed to predict induction generator performance in a cryogenic environment

Based on WordNet, we do some research on the co-occurrence phenomena of semantic relations in objective knowledge system. According to the structural characteristics of semantic relations in objective knowledge system, a co-occurrence degree function for pairs of semantic relations was proposed. We calculate co-occurrence degree from the data obtained by making statistical tests. Some useful conclusions and co-occurrence regularity has been summarized from the analysis of co-occurrence degree test results. The research will lay a good foundation for the next step of research on the compositional validity and relativity between semantic relations in objective knowledge system.

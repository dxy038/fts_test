This study considers multi-objective optimal design of the fiber reinforced symmetric-balanced laminated composites using genetic algorithms. MATLAB Genetic Algorithm and Direct Search Toolbox is used to obtain Pareto-optimal design for three different model problems. The objectives of the problems are to maximize the YoungÂ´s moduli and minimize the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) simultaneously for 8 and 16 layered carbon/epoxy composites. Simplified micromechanics equations and classical lamination theory are used in order to obtain the fitness functions of the problems. Stress and strain distributions are presented through the thickness of the laminates for the optimized problems under mechanical and thermal loadings.

In this paper, we propose a new single image dehazing approach based on information fidelity and image entropy. The global atmospheric light is estimated by quadtree subdivision using transformed hazy images. Then, transmission is estimated by an objective function which is comprised of information fidelity and image entropy at non-overlapped sub-block regions. This is further refined by a Weighted Least Squares (WLS) optimization procedure to alleviate block artifacts. We compared performance of the proposed method with conventional methods to validate its effectiveness in an experiment.

The paper presents the implementation of a realtime control algorithm for digital motor control. The steps required for the implementation of the control algorithm on an embedded computing system are described in detail. A DC motor is identified and a cascade control topology is proposed in order to control the speed of the motor. A practical application using a Stellaris LM3S8962 microcontroller for the control of a DC motor is presented. For real-time bidirectional data exchange between the microcontroller and the PC a USB to Controller Area Network converter is used.

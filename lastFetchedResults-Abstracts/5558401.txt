According to the connotation of Scientific Outlook on Development, this paper constructs the social development evaluation indicator system through the selection and rational analysis of social indicators. Through determining the optimal indicator weights by combining the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and G1 method, it establishes a comprehensive evaluation model on social development and analyzes Chinese social development during year 2001 to 2007. The contribution characteristics lie on four aspects. Firstly, through taking Gross National Happiness into evaluation system, the requirement of people-oriented is reflected and the existing research without considering peopleÂ´ s happiness feeling is changed. Secondly, by determining the weight coefficient through the principle of sum of deviation in largest between the subjective and objective evaluation results, it avoids the groundless practice of equal distribution among subjective and objective evaluation weight. Thirdly, through evaluation from living quality and population and employment criteria, the basic idea of scientific development concept on people-oriented is reflected. Lastly but not least, the research results indicate that the sustainable development tendency of Chinese society during year 2001 to 2007 is remarkable.

Qamishloo area has been selected to study the structure of Sanandaj-Sirjan zone. This area cosists of group of sedimentary rocks with age range between middle and upper Cretaceous, underlain unconformaly by recent sediments. Based on the processes of satellite images and field studies, 12 fault were discovered. Some minor fault were also discovered during the field studies.
The main objective of this paper is to understand the fault structures and related geometry of faults by using mentional data, attempts have been made to analyse the structural patterns and stress and strain systems of the studied area.

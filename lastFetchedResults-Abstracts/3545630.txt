Established in 1990, the CIMTEX project has been used to research the application of CIM and CAM in the apparel industry. With the aim of aiding this sector in becoming more competitive, CIMTEX has covered techniques from the simple to the sophisticated. The project is also used as an industrial demonstration and training centre and runs a small garment production unit. The research work at CIMTEX is divided into 5 work cells (CAD-pattern design; fabric spreading/cutting/stripping; operator-centred/automatic sewing; pressing/finishing; knitted blanks) and 3 linking or support cells (integration; automatic vision inspection; objective assessment of textile materials)

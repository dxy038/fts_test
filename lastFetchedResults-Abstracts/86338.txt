This paper considers the problem of joint optimization of "preventive maintenance" and "spare-provisioning policy" for system components subject to wear-out failures. A stochastic mathematical model is developed to determine the jointly optimal "block replacement" and "periodic review spare-provisioning policy." The objective function of the model represents the s-expected total cost of system maintenance per unit time, while the preventive replacement interval and the maximal inventory level are chosen as the decision variables. The objective function of the model is in an analytic form with parameters easily obtainable from field data. The model has been tested using field data on electric locomotives in Slovenian Railways. The calculated optimal values of the model decision variables are realistic. "Sensitivity analysis of the model" shows that the model is relatively insensitive to moderate changes of the parameter values. The results of testing and of sensitivity analysis of the model prove that a trade-off exists between the replacement related cost and the inventory related cost. The jointly optimal preventive replacement interval defined by this model differs appreciably from the corresponding interval determined by the conventional model where only replacement related costs are considered. Also, the results of the sensitivity analysis show that even minor modification of the value of each model decision variable (without the appropriate adjustment of the value of the other decision variable) can lead to important increase of the s-expected total cost of system maintenance. This indicates that separate optimization of preventive maintenance policy and spare-provisioning policy does not ensure minimal total cost of system maintenance. This model can be readily applied to optimize maintenance procedures for a variety of industrial systems, and to upgrade maintenance policy in situations where block replacement preventive maintenance is already in use.

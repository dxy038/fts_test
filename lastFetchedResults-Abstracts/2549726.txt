Objective (s): Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a set of illness symptoms that happen in people who experience or witness a traumatic event. Various factors may have a role in the intensity of these symptoms. This research was conducted with the aim of finding the role of attachment to God and perceived social support in prediction of the intensity of these symptoms. Also, the two variables of age and the time passed since the traumatic event were taken into consideration.
Methods: The population included all mothers in Tehran who received rehabilitation and welfare services. One hundred and three mothers were selected via the purposeful (qualitative) sampling method. Data were collected using a PTSD questionnaire, a questionnaire on attachment to God and a questionnaire on perceived social support. The stepwise regression model was used to analyze the data.
Results: Results showed that attachment to God and social support from friends was predictors of reduced PTSD. It was also determined that age and the time since the traumatic event have no meaningful relationship with PTSD.
Conclusion: It seems that spiritual and social factors with multiple functions can be largely effective in reducing PTSD.

This paper reflects the advances and results of two research projects supported by the Basque Government. The objective of this work is to build a device which allows the driver to communicate with his vehicle, with other vehicles and the infrastructure on the road. This Intelligent On Board Unit will be able to learnt from driver behavior and the environment. Based on this knowledge, the OBU could advise the driver on actions to take while driving. The modules implemented and the test scenario that has been built to validate the proposed architecture, are shown in this article.

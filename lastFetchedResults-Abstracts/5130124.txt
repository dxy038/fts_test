Fingerprint segmentation is a crucial step in fingerprint recognition system, and determines the results of fingerprint analysis and recognition. In this paper, an approach for fingerprint segmentation based on modified fuzzy c-means (FCM) is presented. The proposed algorithm is realized by modifying the objective function in the SzilagyiÂ´s algorithm via introducing the gray histogram-based weighting. Experimental results show that proposed method can extract the fingerprint effectively and efficiently from original image.

This paper offers a design procedure for a robust pole-placement problem with H<sub>&#8734;</sub> objective via static output feedback control for T-S fuzzy systems with time-varying norm bounded uncertainties. Sufficient conditions for synthesis of a fuzzy static output feedback controller for T-S fuzzy systems are derived in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In comparison with the existing robust H<sub>&#8734;</sub> fuzzy static output feedback controllers we also employ pole-placement method in order to drive the closed loop poles into a suitable sub-region of the complex plane, and to improve the transient behavior of the system.

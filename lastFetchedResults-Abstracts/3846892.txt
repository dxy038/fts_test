The experimental design method is applied to the construction of a response surface based on diffuse elements as preliminary steps in the optimisation process of the magnetic torque of a switched reluctance motor. The experimental design method is used to find and choose the most significant parameters related to the magnetic torque of the motor, reducing the number of parameters to be optimised. The diffuse element method is used to build a response surface that represents an approximation of the real objective function. The optimised values of the parameters are obtained after the application of genetic algorithms in the response surface, reducing drastically the final computation time.

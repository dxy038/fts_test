In each organization, management pursues implementing systems for attaining his objectives until provides suitable environment for presenting services. Call centers are one of the service centers that have been investigated in recent years. The development of call center industry resulted in complicating these systems that has leaded to complicated management and design of these systems. The objective of this paper is the evaluation of call center systems. For this objective, first with the understanding most important problems in call center units, the simulation model of this system is designed and then validity of this model for adapting it with real system is analyzed. At the end, some solutions are presented for improving the performance of system by using design of experiments. The proposed scenarios are simulated and improved model is introduced.

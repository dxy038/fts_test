Reset controllers are standard linear compensators equipped with a mechanism to instantaneously reset their states. With respect to pure linear control, there is evidence that this reset action is capable of improving control system tradeoffs. In Beker et al. (1999) we established stability conditions for SISO reset control systems and this paper extends these results to the MIMO case. The paperÂ´s objective is to analyze the stability of such reset control systems when excited by constant inputs. Our main result gives conditions under which the equilibrium point of the closed-loop dynamic is asymptotically stable

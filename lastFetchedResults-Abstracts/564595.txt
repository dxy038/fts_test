Multiphase broiler nutrition is important from the standpoint of nutrition optimization, economical efficiency of production and protection of the environment. Objective of research is to investigate the effect of multiphase nutiriton, i.e. different mixtures used in broiler nutrition, whse protein content has been reduced in several phases during first fattening stage, on production performances of broilers. Investigation was carried out on 608 individually tagged male chickens, Ross 308 strain, divided into 4 groups: T1 (control group) -nutrition with mixture containing 23% of protein from 1-21st day; T2 - nutrition with mixture containing 23% of protein from 1st to 7th day, and from 7th to 21st day diet containing 21.5% protein; T3 - nutrition with mixture containing 23% of protein from 1st to 14th day and from 14th to 21st day diet containing 21.5% protein and T4 - nutrition with mixture containing 23% of protein from 1st to 3rd day, from 4-6th day with 22.55% protein, 7-9th day with 22.10% protein, 10-12th day diet with 21.65% protein, 13 - 15th day with 21.20% protein, 16-18th day with 20.75% protein and 19th-21st day diet with 20.30% protein. Main production parameters were registered during the trial period (from 1 to 21st day).Through processing of obtained data it ewas established that chickens of the T4 group (2092.42g), had realized statistically significantly higher body mass compared to T2 (2025.00g) and T3 (2020.07g), but not in relation to control group T1 (2055.16g), during trial period of 42 days. Also, it can be concluded that in regard to daily gain in period up to 21st day, no statistically significant differences between trial groups were established, however, for the entire trial period, average daily gain of chickens in T4 group (48.84g) was statistically considerably higher compared to T2 (47.24g) and T3 (47.13g), whereas in relation to T1 no differences were established T1 (47.99). Feed conversion differed between groups, precisely in favor of the application of multiphase broiler nutrition, i.e. feed conversion of the trial group T4 (1.870) was the best compared to T1 (1.918), T2 (2.005) and T3 (1.970). Based on obtained results it can be concluded that multiphase nutrition had effect on production performances, primarily level of food utilization

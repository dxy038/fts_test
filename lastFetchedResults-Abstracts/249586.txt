Unknown boundary conditions for natural waters are estimated using an inverse problem methodology.
In the formulation of the inverse problem, expressed as a non-linear constrained optimization problem,
its objective function is given by a square di erence term, between experimental and computed data,
added to a regularization operator. The computed data are obtained by solving the radiative transfer
direct problem using the LTSN method. A key aspect to get a good reconstruction is played by observed
data quality. The reconstruction strategy is examined for in situ radiance and irradiance data for many
arrangements of the experimental grid of the measurement devices, in order to plan good designs for
experimental works

Background Various studies have revealed
the existence and negative consequences of
stigmatization of persons receiving professional
mental health care. Less attention is generally paid to
factors affecting these stigma experiences. The influence
of the immediate treatment context, especially, is
largely neglected. Objective In this article, a multilevel
design is used to explore the link between characteristics
of the treatment context and stigma experiences,
controlling for client characteristics. Method Data of
366 clients from 42 wards in psychiatric hospitals are
used to investigate the relationship of individualized
treatment, group atmosphere and ward size to selfrejection.
Results The results reveal significant
differences in self-rejection between the wards. Furthermore,
they show that individualized treatment in
a ward is related to less self-rejection, but only if it
does not worsen the group atmosphere. A positive
group atmosphere seems to reduce self-rejection. Finally,
clients of larger wards report more self-rejection.
Conclusion The connection between ward
characteristics and stigma experiences has important
research and policy implications. It brings together
the domains of stigma research and mental health
services research, which have mostly been developed
on a separate basis. In terms of policy, this kind of
study could highlight factors in the immediate treatment
that could be changed to reduce stigma experiences
for clients of mental health services

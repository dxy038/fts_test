Objective: This study was undertaken to determine pregnancy outcome in women who have preterm labor symptoms without cervical change according to fetal fibronectin status. Study Design: Patients who were examined at the obstetric emergency department with symptoms of preterm labor but without cervical change underwent fetal fibronectin collection. Pregnancy outcome and fetal fibronectin results were analyzed after delivery. Results: Of the 235 patients sampled, 20% (n = 48) had positive fetal fibronectin results. The mean ± SD gestational age at delivery was lower in women with positive fetal fibronectin results (34.2 ± 4.1 vs 37.7 ± 2.3 weeks; P< .001); these women were more likely to deliver preterm as a result of preterm labor than women with other obstetric indications (46% vs 19%; P< .001). Infants born to these women demonstrated lower birth weight (2317 ± 895 g vs 2877 ± 557 g; P = .003), were more likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (42% vs 14%; P< .001), and were more likely to die in the neonatal period (11% vs 0%; P< .001). Conclusion: Patients with symptoms of preterm labor but without cervical change who have negative fetal fibronectin results are less likely to deliver preterm. Therefore in women with symptoms but without cervical change fetal fibronectin should be considered for risk assessment. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:1004-7.)

CP Rail, in conjunction with a machine-tool manufacturer, is designing, building, and installing a semiautomated refurbishing system to reclaim freight-car truck side frames and bolsters. The semiautomated refurbishing cell is primarily a series of CNC (computerized numerically controlled) machines and welding robots integrated by a palletized transfer line and controlled by a PLC (programmable logic controller). The objective of the facility is to introduce automation to a low-volume and labor-intensive repair operation. The advantage of the semiautomated refurbishing system is that it combines the features of automation with the flexibility of the necessary job shop or repair operations required in side-frame and bolster repair. The benefits and consequent savings are increased rail, wheel, and bearing life, and reduced fuel consumption

The operational cost of an in-house distribution system (IDS) has been formulated as a multi-objective function to minimise the overall cost of MW, Mvar and MVA intakes. The reconfiguration investigations have been carried out considering different load types and a comparison is made with the commonly assumed constant load type used in such studies. Different tariff situations are simulated on 33-node test systems. The results obtained establish that load type is a major deciding factor in reconfiguration and cannot be represented by constant load models as used in such studies in case of IDS.

The objective of the present study was to examine the possible generation of allylnitrile from commonly consumed cruciferous vegetables, and to determine the long-term behavioral effects of its oral administration at levels comparable to or greater than human dietary exposures. On the basis of gaschromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses, allylnitrile generation was observed in eight out of twelve vegetables, broccoli, broccoli (young stems and leaves), brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, chinese cabbage, komatsuna and kaiware-daikon (young stems and leaves). The daily dietary intake of allylnitrile was estimated to be at least 0.12 μmol/kg body weight for Japanese, based on its generation from the vegetables, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and Chinese cabbage and their daily dietary consumption. Mice received oral doses of 2, 20, 200, 500 and 1,100 μmol/kg allylnitrile once a day, 5 days per week for 13 weeks. Mice in the lower dosage groups of 2, 20 and 200 μmol/kg exhibited no behavioral changes. Mice dosed at the level of 500 μmol/kg showed restlessness, and one of them displayed alteration in tail hanging. These abnormalities were seen around seven days following the beginning of the treatment period. Animals in the highest dosage group elicited behavioral abnormalities, and their degree increased with increasing dosage. These results suggest that allylnitrile intake levels through daily vegetable consumption is below the level producing behavioral abnormalities.

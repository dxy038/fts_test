Objective (s): Newborn screening program is an essential public health program to identify genetic diseases and congenital disorders. Abnormal screening test results should be followed immediately through health centers; otherwise there would be a delay in the process of diagnosis and treatment. As the number of studies related to the use of newborn screening information systems in Iran is few, in this study, general issues related to newborn screening system and the necessity of using information technologies in newborn screening process are reviewed.
Methods: In this study, the relevant literature from 2000 to 2013 was reviewed. The electronic databases including Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, Medline, Ovid and MagIran were used to find relevant literature. Data related to the newborn screening information system in the selected countries (America, England and Australia) was gathered using electronic databases and the official websites of the organizations involved in newborn screening programs.
Results: The results showed that not only newborn screening information system integrates screening processes among blood sampling centers, hospitals and referral centers, but also reduces the amount of manual processes. While in some countries national or regional newborn screening information systems are used, in Iran, newborn screening data are collected in several forms to be sent to the higher authorities.
Conclusion: It seems that the use of a newborn screening information system that is able to gather screening information along with other personal health data will increase productivity and help managers to make effective decisions.

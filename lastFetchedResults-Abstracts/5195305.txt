Summary form only given. High power microwave generation by virtual cathode oscillator has been studied both experimentally and by numerical simulation. The research objective is development of high-power microwave source that has relatively simple structure and matches well with typical pulsed-power generators. The lifetime and stability of the electron-beam diode is also tested in repetitive operation. The experiments were carried out by using repetitive pulsed-power generator "ETIGO-IV", with typical experimental parameters of diode voltage 400 kV, diode current 10 kA, and pulse width 150 ns. The results have shown maximum microwave power of ~120 MW giving beam-to-microwave efficiency of 3%. The microwave frequency is nearly 2 GHz with dominant microwave mode of TM<sub>01</sub>. In the experiments, different cathode materials were tested and compared with each other in performance for hundreds of shots. Computer simulations were carried out by using three-dimensional, particle-in-cell simulation code "MAGIC". Numerical investigations involved studies of diode behavior, beam-field interaction, and configuration optimization. The simulation results were compared with the experimental results to give a combined evaluation for the performance of virtual cathode oscillator.

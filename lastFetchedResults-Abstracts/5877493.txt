An ongoing challenge in automatic sea-ice monitoring using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is the automatic segmentation of SAR sea-ice images based on the underlying ice type. Given the intractability of obtaining ground-truth segmentation data from polar regions, the evaluation of automatic SAR sea-ice image segmentation algorithms is generally limited to tests using real SAR imagery based on pseudo-ground truth data (e.g., manual segmentations) and simple synthetic tests using basic shape primitives. As such, it is difficult to evaluate automatic segmentation algorithms in a systematic and reliable manner using realistic scenarios. To tackle this issue, a novel image synthesis system named IceSynth is presented, which is capable of generating a variety of synthetic sea-ice images that are representative of real SAR sea-ice imagery. In IceSynth, SAR sea-ice textures for each ice type are synthesized via stochastic sampling based on non-parametric local conditional texture probability distribution estimates. A stochastic sampling approach based on non-parametric local class probability distribution estimates is used to generate large-scale sea-ice structures of various ice types based on ice classification priors extracted from real SAR sea-ice imagery. Experimental results show that IceSynth is capable of generating realistic-looking SAR sea-ice images that are well-suited for performing objective evaluation of SAR sea-ice image segmentation algorithms.

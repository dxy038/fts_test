Empirical models of minimum (Tmin), average (Tavg) and maximum (Tmax) air temperature for Singapore estate have been developed
and validated based on a long-tem field measurement. There are three major urban elements, which influence the urban temperature at
the local scale. Essentially, they are buildings, greenery and pavement. Other related parameters identified for the study, such as green
plot ratio (GnPR), sky view factor (SVF), surrounding building density, the wall surface area, pavement area, albedo are also evaluated
to give a better understanding on the likely impact of the modified urban morphology on energy consumption.
The objective of this research is to assess and to compare how the air temperature variation of urban condition can affect the building
energy consumption in tropical climate of Singapore. In order to achieve this goal, a series of numerical calculation and building simulation
are utilized. Atotal of 32 cases, considering different urban morphologies, are identified and evaluated to give better a understanding on the
implication of urban forms, with the reference to the effect of varying density, height and greenery density. The results show that GnPR,
which related to the present of greenery, have the most significant impact on the energy consumption by reducing the temperature by up
to 2  C. The results also strongly indicate an energy saving of 4.5% if the urban elements are addressed effectively.

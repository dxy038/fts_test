In this paper, the fuzzy morphological gradients from the fuzzy mathematical morphologies based on t-norms and conjunctive uninorms are deeply analyzed in order to establish which pair of conjunction and fuzzy implications are optimal, in accordance with their performance in edge detection applications. A novel three-step algorithm based on the fuzzy morphology is proposed. The comparison is performed by means of the so-called PrattÂ´s figure of merit. In addition, a statistical analysis is carried out to study the relationship between the different configurations and to establish a classification of the conjunctions and implications considered. Both the objective measure and the statistical analysis conclude that the pairs nilpotent minimum t-norm and the Kleene-Dienes implication, and the idempotent uninorm obtained with the classical negation as a generator and its residual implication, are the best configurations in this approach, because they also obtain competitive results with respect to other approaches.

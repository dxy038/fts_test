This study develops an approach for engineering knowledge refinement to facilitate engineering knowledge management. This approach is basically a refinement process that includes the steps of knowledge capture, knowledge representation and storage, and knowledge compilation. This study involves the development of a semantic graph for describing product related information, design intent and know-how, a tag-based scheme for representing various types of captured product information and engineering knowledge, a case-based representation for a designed entity, and the design of a knowledge compilation model and algorithm. The objective of this study can be achieved by performing the following tasks: (i) developing engineering knowledge management framework, (ii) establishing engineering knowledge refinement process, (iii) developing levels of knowledge representation schemes, and (iv) implement engineering knowledge refinement mechanisms.

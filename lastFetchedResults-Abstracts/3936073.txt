This paper deals with the problem of monitoring the performance of digital communication links, with the objective of detecting the on-line signal failures as rapidly as possible. The problem of monitoring the performance of data communication links is inherent to data transmission. This paper describes a method of generating a measurable pseudoerror that can be used in a variety of applications. Some of the theoretical ideas of this technique were taken from Ref. 1. By developing a Pseudo Error Region (PER), the on-line error rate can be estimated much more rapidly without distrubing the data. The design of hardware and measurement results are presented, along with a comparison with theoretical predictions.

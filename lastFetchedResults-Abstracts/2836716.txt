This paper investigates the use of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to achieve the stability of nonlinear single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system with an AC/DC converter added to the model. The control objective is to improve the SMIB stability by bringing the system from a perturbed state to the equilibrium state and keep it there. The purpose of using NMPC is to handle the nonlinearity of the model and to satisfy the imposed constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed controller is capable of enhancing SMIB stability when compared to approaches reported in the literature.

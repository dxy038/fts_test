In this paper, the general boundary element method and the parallel computation are employed to solve laminar viscous flows in a driven square cavity, governed by the exact Navier-Stokes equations. Using the solution at Re=0 as the initial approximation, the convergent numerical results for high Reynolds number at Re=7500 are obtained, for the first time, by the boundary element method. This verifies the validity and great potential of the general boundary element method for highly non-linear problems, which may greatly enlarge application regions of the boundary element method in science and engineering.

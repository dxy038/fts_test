Packet loss is a common problem in Internet protocol (IP) networks. Delayed, misrouted or corrupted packets all introduce a gap in the information stream being transmitted. This gap is even more critical in the case of real time voice transmission that does not tolerate delay. The receiver in this case is obliged to generate a signal to play instead of the missing speech segment. This paper introduces a high performance speech concealment algorithm for PCM coded speech. The proposed algorithm implements a combination of linear prediction model and reverse order replicated pitch period (RORPP) implemented as in the ITU-T G.711. The new algorithm produced better objective MOS scores when compared to both the commercial tool of packet repetition and to the above mentioned ITU-T long term prediction standard.

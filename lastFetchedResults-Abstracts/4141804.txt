A guided workshop in editing can give students and report writers an objective means of evaluating their drafts to improve the quality of writing. In each of four steps, the workshop uses three processes (identification, analysis, rewriting) to examine overall logic, verb usage, sentence openings, and conjunctions. Practical tips for objectively examining drafts provide the greatest improvement in editing oneÂ´s own work.

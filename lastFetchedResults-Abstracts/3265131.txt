There are many uncertainties in multiple-factors decision making problems so that the reliability and correctness of decision making results depend on the scientifically and reasonably confirmation of attribute weights, especially for C<sup>4</sup>KISR system. Combination assigning method based on optimal eigenvectors which uses multi-objective optimization to integrate subjective and objective weightings was presented in the study so that the limitations of both subjective assigning method and objective assigning method have been overcome. Furthermore, decision making model based on TOPSIS method was also established to obtain more reasonable and scientific method of weightings confirmation method for Multi-factors intelligence analysis problems.

Background There is intense political interest
in retaining older workers in the workforce, to fund
lengthening retirements. While health is important in
early exit from work, the health of early retirees has been
little studied. Objective The aim of this study was to
compare the health status of economically active 50- to
64-year-olds with economically inactive former workers
(termed early retirees).Methods A total of 1,875 respondents
to the 2000 Psychiatric Morbidity Survey of Great
Britain were included in the analysis. Current common
mental (neurotic) disorder presence was based on the
revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). Results In
all, 71.2% of men and 66.4% of women early retirees reported
having a long-standing illness. Of early retired
men, 22.2% have a common mental disorder compared
to 8.2% of those still in work (p value of difference
<0.001). In contrast, the respective figures for women
were 18.2% and 16.9%. In fully adjusted regression
models for men, early retirees were more likely to have
generalised anxiety disorders (OR 3.1: 95% CI: 1.2–7.8)
and depressive disorders (OR 4.3: 95% CI: 1.7–11.0).
Conclusion There is a substantial burden of specific
mental health disorders in early retiree men. Understanding
the mechanisms of this excess of mental disorders
in early retiree men may be a prerequisite to increasing
the numbers seeking or staying in work up to
age 65.

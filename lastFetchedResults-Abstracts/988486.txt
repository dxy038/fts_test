A simulation of a combined Rankineâ€“absorption cycle is presented in which the boiler flue gases of the Rankine cycle are used as an energy source to the absorption cycle that is used to cool the Rankine cycle condenser to offset the performance degradation of the Rankine cycle when operating under high ambient temperature conditions. The results indicate that there is insufficient energy in the flue gases for a single effect absorption unit to improve the overall cycle performance to that of an ISA day case. The analysis concludes by indicating the level of coefficient of performance (COP) that would be needed to achieve the desired objective.

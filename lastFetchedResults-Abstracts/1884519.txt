In this paper, a newly developed assessment platform Odyssey is introduced. This platform is dedicated to perform comprehensive techno-economic assessments of energy systems comprising renewable energy sources and energy storage units. The major strengths of this platform are described and it is then illustrated on an application example with the objective to provide elements of validation of the platform. This application case is related to the electrical energy supply of a weather station by the mean of a PV-hydrogen hybrid energy system combining PV modules and a hydrogen chain. Experimental results obtained on the fuel cell and electrolyser systems are confronted to simulation results.

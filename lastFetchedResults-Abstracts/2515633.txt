Background and Objective: Hemoglobinopathies are the most common monogenic disorders with remarkable frequency in certain regions of the world, including Iran. At least 5.2% of world population is carrier for a main hemoglobin (Hb) disorder. More than 900 Hemoglobin variants were reported due to globin gene mutations that cause structural changes in globin gene products which ultimately affect the performance and stability of hemoglobin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in premarriage men referred to the laboratories of Health Centers in the Shushtar City during the years 2011-2013.
Subjects and Methods:  Hematological parameters in blood samples containing EDTA were measured by Hematology Analyzer (Sysmex KX-21). Hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed by Sebia capillary electrophoresis and types of hemoglobinopathies were determined.
Results: 111 cases from total 8806 cases were has abnormal bands of hemoglobin. From this total, 3 cases (0.03%) were with heterozygous hemoglobin E and 1 case (0. 01%) was heterozygous hemoglobin C. Also, 74 cases (0.84%) had hemoglobin D, and 28 patients (0.32%) containing hemoglobin S were with different genotype status; homozygous or heterozygous types. In this study, uncommon Hemoglobin variants (with the prevalence of 0.05%) such as hemoglobin O- Arab and constant spring was observed.
Conclusion: This study showed that from 8806 individuals, 111 subjects (1.25%) have hemoglobinopathies. HbD with 0.84% and HbC with 0. 01% of total have highest and minimum frequency.

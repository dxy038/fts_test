The objective of this paper is to implement SPIHT and WDR image coder. We have used here two different images Natural and Artificial. Artificial image stand for image on which enhancement techniques have been applied e.g Wallpaper whereas Natural image is an image on which no enhancement technique has been applied e.g image captured by camera directly. SPIHT stands for Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) Coding. The SPIHT coder is a highly refined version of the EZW algorithm and is a powerful image compression algorithm that produces an embedded bit stream from which the best reconstructed images in the mean square error sense can be extracted at various bit rates. Some of the best results -- highest PSNR values for given compression ratios for a wide variety of images have been obtained with SPIHT. Hence, it has become the benchmark state-of-the-art algorithm for image compression. One of the defects of SPIHT is that it only implicitly locates the position of significant coefficients. This makes it difficult to perform operations which depend on the position of significant transform values, such as region selection on compressed data. Region selection, also known as region of interest (ROI), means a portion of a compressed image that requires increased resolution. Such compressed data operations are possible with the WDR algorithm of Tian and Wells. The term difference reduction refers to the way in which WDR encodes the locations of significant wavelet transform values. Although WDR will not produce higher PSNR values than SPIHT. With the implementation of these algorithms we have calculated the various parameters e.g. CR, PSNR, BPP &amp; MSE to analyze PQS (picture Quality Scale). We have analyzed our results using various wavelet filters such as Biorthogonal, Coif lets, Daubechies and Symlets etc.

High performance SoC requires nonblocking interconnections between an array of processors built on one chip. With the advent of deep sub-micron technologies, switches are becoming much cheaper while wires are still expensive. Therefore, optimization efforts should focus on the wire resources. In this paper, we devise air objective function to balance the interconnect topology between routing area and power dissipation. Based on the objective function, we find the best one-dimensional and two-dimensional nonblocking interconnect architectures. Furthermore, we define a derivative benefit and devise a strategy for improving the performance of hierarchical nonblocking interconnect architectures and derive optimized results.

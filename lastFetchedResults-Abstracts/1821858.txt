Objective
luate the immunohistochemical expression of MMP-1, -2, -7, -9 and -26 in oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) according to tumour site and histological grade of malignancy.
design
n cases of SCC of the lower lip and 15 cases of tongue SCC were selected and divided into low grade malignancy (n = 17) and high grade malignancy (n = 13).
s
 immunohistochemical expression of MMPs by neoplastic cells was observed in tongue SCCs, with a statistically significant difference for MMP-9 (P &lt; 0.05). High-grade SCCs showed a higher expression of MMPs, except for MMP-2, with a statistically significant difference for MMP-7 (P &lt; 0.05) and MMP-26 (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, a direct association was observed between morphological scores of malignancy and MMP immunoreactivity, with the association being significant for MMP-7 and MMP-26.
sion
esent results demonstrate the important role of MMPs in the development of SCCs of the lower lip and tongue.

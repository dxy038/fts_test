We present an objective reduced-reference image quality assessment method based on harmonic gain/loss information through a discriminative analysis of local harmonic strength (LHS). The LHS is computed from the gradient of images, and its value represents a relative degree of the appearance of blockiness on images when it is related to energy gain within an image. Furthermore, comparison between local harmonic strength values from an original, distortion-free image and a degraded, processed, or compressed version of the image shows that the LHS can also be used to indicate other types of degradations, such as blurriness that corresponds with energy loss. Our simulations show that we can develop a single metric based on this gain/loss information and use it to rate the quality of images encoded by various encoders such as DCT-based JPLG, wavelet-based JPLG 2000, or various processed images. We show that our method can overcome some limitations of the traditional PSNR.

Background.
Aprotinin has recently been approved for clinical use in cardiopulmonary bypass. Although unfractionated heparin has been the only anticoagulant widely used for cardiopulmonary bypass, disadvantages involving heparin have led to ongoing investigations of alternative anticoagulant agents.
Methods.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of aprotinin in combination with other anticoagulant agents, specifically low molecular weight heparin and recombinant hirudin, using a dog model of cardiopulmonary bypass.
Results.

The blood conservation resulting from the use of aprotinin was observed only with unfractionated heparin. Efficacy of anticoagulation as measured by protein deposits in the bypass circuit filter revealed an unexpected reduction in the quantity of deposits when aprotinin was used in combination with low molecular weight heparin.
Conclusions.

As alternative anticoagulant agents are sought, the potential benefits of aprotinin in the reduction of operative blood loss must be evaluated independently for each anticoagulant agent.

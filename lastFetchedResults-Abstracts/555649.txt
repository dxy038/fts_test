Background and Objective: Trace elements have been documented to play an important role in the determination of fetal outcome. It has been reported that the pregnant women in developing countries consume diets with a lower amounts of minerals and vitamins. Zinc is an essential trace element and its deficiency can lead to a variety of disorders.
Materials and Methods: This case-control study was carried out at Alavi hospital in Ardabil (Iran) from August 2008- August 2009. Fifty six women who had delivered low- birth- weight infants (<2500gr) were taken as the case group and 56 women with infants with normal birth weight (>2500gr) were selected as the control group. Venous blood sample were obtained from the mothers. Serum zinc level was determined by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer method.
Results: Mean of birth weight in infants, maternal age, body mass index in mothers and socioeconomic or demographic factors did not differ between case and control groups. Maternal zinc concentration did not differ between Cases and Controls; 55.84 ± 14.40 (ig/dl vs.52.16 ± 8.84 jig/dl respectively. Conclusion: Results of this study showed that maternal zinc concentration has no impact on neonatal birth weight deliveries.

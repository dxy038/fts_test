This paper proposes a multi-agent scheduling system for dynamic job-shop problem. The negotiation mechanism between agents controlling resources and tasks is discussed. First, a hybrid MAS framework is built to satisfy the requirements of the agile scheduling. Then an intelligent algorithm is designed to reason environment encountered and recommend adaptive scheduling algorithm for resource agents. And multi-objective function considering tardiness, waiting time and cost is designed for task agents as an evaluation criteria of resourcesÂ´ bids. The results obtained show the effective and good performance of this system in total flow time, total waiting time and makespan

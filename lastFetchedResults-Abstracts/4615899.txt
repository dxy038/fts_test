Enabling broadband internet connectivity of 30 mbps and more is an ambiguous goal of the European Digital Agenda, particularly in rural and remote regions. Not relying on a single access technology but using multiple simultaneously is believed to be a promising option to meet this objective. However, simply using the available connections in parallel and distributing traffic arbitrarily among them despite their different characteristics might still lead to an unacceptable service quality due to the heterogeneity. Instead, methods that are sophisticated are required, which on one hand takes the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of the various applications into account and on the other hand is aware of the different network characteristics. In this work, we discuss the main challenges which occur when utilizing multiple access technologies in parallel and we propose an architecture addressing those issues. Moreover, we present some preliminary validation results, which show the benefit of our approach.

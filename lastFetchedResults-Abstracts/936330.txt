Background and Aim: Routine diagnostic methods of Vesicoureteral reflux
(VUR) are invasive and can cause exposure to radiation and may increase risk of
urinary tract infections. Therefore, introducing reliable, non invasive methods
might be more interested in pediatric nephrology. The objective of this
perospective case control study was to evaluate the prognostic value of urinary
neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin (uNGAL) on antenatal hydronephrosis
(AH) with and without VUR.
Methods: A total of 50 patients diagnosed with AH; 78% males with mean age
5.71± 2.1 years, including 27 AH with VUR and 23 AH without VUR, and 19
normal healthy children; 78.9% males with mean age 5.63 ± 1.89 years, were
enrolled in this study. Urinary NGAL levels were measured by enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Results: There was a significant difference in uNGAL concentration between
AH patients and controls (0.80 ± 0.26 and 0.29 ± 0.27 ng/ml, p < 0.0001).
However, the levels of uNGAL was not significantly deviated between AH
patients with VUR compared to those without VUR (0.84 ± 0.34 vs. 0.75 ± 0.13,
p=0.419). Standardization of NGAL based on urinary creatinine (uNGAL/uCr)
showed a significantly difference between AH neonates with VUR compared to
those without VUR (2.43±1.61 vs. 1.91±0.79, p < 0.0001). Receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed higher prognostic power of uNGAL for
identifying AH with a sensitivity; 95.7%, and specificity; 84.2%. Meanwhile,
the levels of uNGAL or NGAL/uCr ratio did not correlate with reflux grade or
laterality.
Conclusions: The urinary level of NGAL and NGAL/Cr ratio might be a
surrogate non invasive, reliable tool to distinguish hydronephrosis.

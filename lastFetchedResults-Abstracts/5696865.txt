In this paper, we propose a new method for camera calibration that is an extension of the visual servoing technique. The basic objective of visual servoing is to control the camera motion so as to obtain the goal image which is given a priori. In this paper, we consider the case where intrinsic camera parameters are not known. First, we compose the goal image with initial guesses of the parameters. Then, in addition to the control of the camera motion, we dynamically modify the goal image according to the estimated intrinsic camera parameters. When the same image with the modified goal image is obtained, both the true intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters are determined. We describe this new method with theoretical details and experiments using synthetic and real images

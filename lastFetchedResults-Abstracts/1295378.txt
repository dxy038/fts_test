In this paper we consider online scheduling of malleable parallel jobs on two identical machines, where jobs arrive over time. Each job JjJj has an execution time tj=pj/kj+(kj-1)cjtj=pj/kj+(kj-1)cj when it is processed on kjkj machines, where pj>0pj>0 and cj>0cj>0 are the length and setup time of job JjJj. The objective is to minimize the makespan. For the problem with two machines, we present an online algorithm with competitive ratio of 1+α1+α, where View the MathML sourceα=(5-1)/2. We show that 1+α1+α is a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm for the problem with View the MathML sourcem(m⩾2) machines. So our algorithm is optimal for the case of two machines.

Background and objective: Nowadays, probiotics are one of proposed methods in prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal tract infections. Isolation origin of probiotics (food or human) and the geographical area of isolation are parts of main factors in probiotics beneficial effect, probiotics in our country are almost commercial. Determination antimicrobial effect of a new probiotic is one of basically grades to present it. Evaluating probiotics effect isolated from intestinal flora of children from Isfahan, this study was done to present new probiotics against prevalent pathogens of gastrointestinal tract.

Materials and methods: In this empirical study , the antibacterial effect of the Lactobacillus^ L. Rhamnosus (L519), L. Acidophilus (SH5) ,L. Plantarum (A7) , isolated from intestinal flora of children was evaluated against prevalent pathogens of alimentary tract included Shigella Dysentery (PTCC 1188), Salmonella thyphimurium (PTCC 1622) , Escherichia Coli enteropatogen (PTCC1270) with the diffusion agar method , by making well. Reducing rate of error , each test repeated 3 times and mean of inhibition zone of 3 probiotics was compared with statistical software SPSS(version 13).

Reasults: Mean inhibition zone for all three probiotics were 13.4 +- 1.57mm. L. Plantarum had the most restrictive effect against S thyphimurium (16.33 +- 0.57mm CI95%=14.89_17.76) and L. Rhamnosus had the least restrictive effect against E. Coli Enteropatogen (11.33+-0.57mm CI95%=9.89_12.76).

CONCLUSION: All 3 species of Lactobacillus probiotics had great restrictive effect against prevalent pathogens of alimentary tract and they had more effect in comparison with researches done by nutritional and economical origin probiotics, so it is recommended that the origin of isolation and the geographical area of probiotics should be observed for selection and use of them.

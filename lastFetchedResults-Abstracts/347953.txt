Objective
To investigate the effects of loading and unloading of the lower limb joints on the soleus H-reflex in standing humans.
Methods
H-reflexes were elicited in the soleus muscle in subjects standing on a force platform in a water tank under the following loading conditions of the ankle and knee joints: control condition; reduced loads of −10 and −20 N; imposed loads of 10 and 20 N. The joint loading was altered by changing the combinations of buoys and weights attached to the lower limb segments, while total body weight was kept constant.
Results
As the ankle- or knee-joint load was reduced, the H-reflex was significantly enhanced compared to that under the control condition. In contrast, the H-reflex was decreased as the ankle- or knee-joint load was increased. In both cases, similar levels of background activity were recorded.
Conclusions
The present results suggest that joint afferents might mediate the suppression of the soleus H-reflex in standing humans. However, the identification of the receptors and/or the mechanisms cannot be addressed under the current experimental set up.
Significance
The results of this study give some basic insights into reflex control in an upright posture.

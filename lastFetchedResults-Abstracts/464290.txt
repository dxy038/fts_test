OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether viral deoxyribonucleic acid is detectable in the amniotic fluid of pregnancies at low risk for fetal viral infection.
STUDY DESIGN: Amniotic fluid samples were prospectively collected from 277 patients. Selected primer pairs amplified deoxyribonucleic acid sequences unique to adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and parvovirus. Amplified deoxyribonucleic acid was detected by gel electrophoresis. Sensitivity of the adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus primers were determined by serial dilution of 103 PFU/ml controls.
RESULTS: Of the 277 extracted samples, 243 had detectable deoxyribonucleic acid. None of these samples had detectable viral deoxyribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction. The sensitivity of the adenovirus primer pairs was 10−3 PFU/ml, cytomegalovirus 10−2 PFU/ml, and herpes simplex virus 10−1 PFU/ml.
CONCLUSION: This study did not detect viral deoxyribonucleic acid in a low-risk population, supporting the clinical significance of detecting viral deoxyribonucleic acid in pregnancies at risk for infection.

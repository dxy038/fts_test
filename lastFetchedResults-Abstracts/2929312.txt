The viability of distributed control restoration using digital cross-connect systems (DCSs) depends on its capability for restoring services within specified time requirements. A Bellcore study of the impact of the DCS architecture on distributed restoration is reported. It is concluded that currently proposed distributed control DCS self-healing schemes may not meet the two-second restoration objective, regardless of the distributed algorithm, if the present DCS system architecture (i.e., serial processing and serial cross-connection) remain unchanged. Several DCS architecture options which may improve the restoration time are discussed

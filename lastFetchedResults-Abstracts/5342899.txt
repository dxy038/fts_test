A multi-objective genetic algorithm, based on NSGA-II, is implemented to find an optimal condition of minimum voltage deviations, minimum power losses and minimum number of control actions of a transmission network system. The system used as model is a IEEE 14-bus system. Generators, tap position of transformers and a shunt capacitor are the devices to controlling. The results show a succesful performance of the implemented algorithm. Also, different probability of mutation factors are compared and it is proved that a more important mutation factor can improve the velocity of convergence without fall into a random searching.

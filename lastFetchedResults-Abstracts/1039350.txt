The following undesired leakages are inherent in operation of fixed matrix regenerators: gas pressure leakages due to pressure difference such as leakages through the valves and through cracks in regenerator housing for very high temperature heat recovery, and carryover leakages from the hot gas to cold gas and vice versa. The objective of this paper is to present a methodology for evaluation of the leakages and to determine quantitatively the detrimental influence of pressure leakages on the regenerator heat transfer performance. In this respect, a drop (reduction) in actual regenerator heat transfer effectiveness due to various leakages is presented in the paper. The results clearly suggest that a drop in the effectiveness due to leakages can be significant and depends on the category of leakages. The flow leakages due to the cracks in the regenerator housing have the most impact on reducing the regenerator performance.

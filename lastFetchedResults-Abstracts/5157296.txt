With the rapid progress of electronic and information technology, an expectation for the realization of body area network (BAN) by means of ultra wide band (UWB) techniques has risen. The objective of this study is to analyze the transmission characteristics by using a high-precision human body model in order to eliminate the influence of antenna structures on channel modeling. A frequency-dependent finite difference time domain ((FD)<sup>2</sup>TD) method and a Matlab-based curve-fitting tool are employed for the modeling of channel characteristics. Based on the numerical results, the path loss and power delay profile are derived statistically.

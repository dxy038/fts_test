Objective (s): Oral health is an inseparable part of public health and is the most important component of peopleâ€™s quality of life (QOL). The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of message framing on oral health-related behaviors among medical students in Iran. 
Methods: Yhis was an experimental study. Two hundred and thirty undergraduate students of public health, nursing and allied health of a medical university in Tehran, Iran participated in the study. Students then randomly were assigned into two groups: a group receiving gain-framed message and a group who received loss framed message. Pre-test and post-test immediately and 2 weeks later were performed to compare outcomes.
Results: The results obtained from covariance analysis with repeated measures showed that the attitude, intention and behavior of using dental floss and tooth brush in students who received gain-framed message compared to those who received loss-framed message increased, although this increase was not statistically significant.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that in order to increase oral health-related behaviors, using gain-framed messages might be more effective.

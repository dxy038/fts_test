Objective(s): To determine Back Pain (BKP) associated factors in the First and the Second National Health Surveys in Iran (1st NHS and 2nd NHS).
Methods: This study is based on the information obtained from the 1st NHS conducted in the year 1991 and the 2nd NHS conducted in the year 2000 .27752 and 36945 subjects aged 15 and over were interviewed in the 1st NHS and the 2nd NHS respectively, of whom 24589 subjects from the 1st NHS and 36488 subjects from 2nd NHS were included in this study.
BKP was considered as dependent variable and number of the surveys (1st NHS, 2nd NHS), residential area, age gender, education, marital status, smoking cigarette, smoking hubble bubble, spinal fractures, mental health, skeletal deformation and Body Mass Index (BMI) were considered as independent variables. Logistic regression models have been applied for data analysis, using SPSS soft ware.
Results: It is indicated that odds of BKP in the 2nd NHS is less than odds of BKP in the 1st NHS. Odds of BKP increases with increase in age and BMI and it decreases with increase in level of education. Odds of BKP is higher in women and married subjects. Smoking, mental disorder, spinal fracture and skeletal deformation increase the odds of BKP.
Conclusion: The findings showed that higher level of education, lower BMI and quitting smoking can help controlling BKP.

Using discourse analysis theories and methods, the authors try to analyze the elements of the civil modern family pattern as an outcome and objective adequacy of the civil society in the three descriptive, interpretative and explanative levels in the perspective of the contemporary sociopolitical history of the Iranian society. To this end, the authors develop and employ a synthetic model (based on the views of Fairclough, Laclau, and Mouffe’s). Overall, the most important analytical and critical findings and accomplishments of the present study are as follow: 1) The civil modern family pattern is affected by two interpretative and critical paradigms as well as some epistemic and theoretical foundations of theorists such as J. Habermas and A. Giddens, 2) This pattern is articulated around the concepts of ‘democratic values and relationships’ and ‘individualism’ and its nodal point is ‘civil society values’, 3) The civil modern family doesn’t have compatibility and proportionality with the identity foundations of Iranian society, especially Islamic doctrines and Iranian culture.

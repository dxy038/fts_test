A multirate-filter-bank is introduced which is used as a preprocessor/postprocessor pair to improve the quality of general image coding methods such as linear predictive coding, vector-quantization, transform coding, and subband coding. Computer simulations demonstrating the versatility of this technique, are presented. In most cases tested, using the multirate filter banks provided better subjective and objective performance in coding

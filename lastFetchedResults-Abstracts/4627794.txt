This paper presents a battery energy storage system with a modular push-pull PWM converter (MPC), which is intended for grid connection to medium-voltage or high-voltage power systems. The converter is equipped with a center-tapped transformer and two arms consisting of a cascade connection of multiple bidirectional PWM chopper-cells with floating dc capacitors. This paper discusses the operating performance and control method of the MPC, to achieve voltage balancing of all the floating capacitors. Moreover, a comparison is made between the MPC and a modular multilevel converter (MMC) as the battery energy storage system. The validity of the concept and control method developed in this paper is confirmed by computer simulations using the &#8220;PSCAD/EMTDC&#8221; software package.

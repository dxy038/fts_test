A pulse width modulation-voltage source inverter (PWM-VSI) outputs distorted voltage that has a bad effect on torque and speed. Also speed range of traction motor is limited on output voltage. In order to solve problem, this paper propose the control method. It can adjust the DC-link voltage of PWM-VSI by using a two phase interleaved bidirectional DC-DC converter. Also the method can response high power of vehicle. By replacing the diode of output with the switch, the system can operate the regenerative mode. According to mode selection, Proposed topology operates buck mode and boost mode, regenerate buck mode. Proposed method is verified by the simulation and experiment result.

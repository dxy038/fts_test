This paper provides a comparison between two switching patterns of space vector modulation in direct matrix converter. These patterns are compared considering theoretical and performance aspects such as total harmonic distortion, switching numbers and spectrum analysis of input and output parameters. A simple model is proposed to represent the power circuit, including the input filter and a three-phase Y-connected RL load. Input and output parameters of direct matrix converter are presented in simulations using PSIM software for both switching strategies. The power semiconductors are modelled as ideal bidirectional switches and the MC is controlled using direct space vector modulation approach.

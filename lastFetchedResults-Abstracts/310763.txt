Objective. To quantify in vivo carpal kinematics of a normal wrist in a dynamic continuous model.

Design. The instantaneous changes in the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints during normal wrist motion were analyzed using ultrafast computed tomography (CT).

Background. Wrist injuries account for a considerable and growing proportion of work-related disorders and disability. However, little is known about normal wrist kinematics.

Methods. Ten uninjured subjects were studied using ultrafast CT to measure the continuous motion of the wrist from full flexion to full extension. Sagittal plane scanning was performed mediolaterally at six different locations as the wrists were moved slowly and repeatedly from full flexion to full extension. The data were printed to X-ray film and transferred to an independent work station with a video camera. The motion of the radiocarpal, midcarpal and wrist joints was determined by an image analyzing system.

Results. Wrist motion was expressed as a ratio of capitate-lunate (C-L) (midcarpal) motion and radio-lunate (R-L) (radiocarpal) motion. In the volar flexion of normal wrists, the contribution of the radiocarpal joint and midcarpal joint were approximately equal; while dorsal flexion of the normal wrist occurred mainly at the midcarpal joint.

Conclusions. In normal wrists, the radiocarpal joint and midcarpal joint contribute equally to volar flexion, while the midcarpal joint is more important in dorsal flexion.

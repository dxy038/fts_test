This paper deals with a multi-decision model for selecting a manipulative project of control systems and processing synthetic analysis. The model performs an objective decision evaluation of engineering systems. It gives an analytic method on control systems, which can be applied to many kinds of manipulative projects on how to select the most excellent project

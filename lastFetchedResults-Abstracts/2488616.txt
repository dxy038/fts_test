The main objective of this study was to identify the incidence of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia in patients underwent lobectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy. This randomized trial study was performed from May 2010 to July 2011 among 108 consecutive patients undergoing thyroidectomy. Patients were allocated into 3 groups based on the 3 common type of thyroidectomy. Pre and postoperative serum calcium levels were determined by using standard protocol for all patients. All patients' preoperative serum calcium levels were normal. Post-thyroidectomy hypoglycemia occurred in 0%, 8.3% and 8.3% of patients who underwent total hypocalcemia, subtotal thyroidectomy and lobectomy, respectively, which represents 5.6% of all patients who shown hypocalcemia (P=0.58). Serum calcium levels were fall in 93% patients, however within several days were returned to normal ranges. We did not find a significant relation between the hypocalcemia and thyroidectomy types. We recommended determination other alternative factors as a more effective prediction for postoperative hypocalcemia.

In this paper, performance comparison of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) such as real coded genetic algorithm (RGA), standard partical swarm optimization (SPSO), modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO), Niche particle swarm Algorithm (NPSA) on optimal design of PID controller is considered. EAs simulations are carried with minimization of ITAE as objective using one types of stopping criteria, namely, terminate iteration. Results clearly indicate the better performance of SPSO and MPSO designed PID controller on SISO system.

A power delivery system for implantable biosensors is presented. The system, embedded into a skin patch and located directly over the implantation area, is able to transfer up to 15 mW wirelessly through the body tissues by means of an inductive link. The inductive link is also used to achieve bidirectional data communication with the implanted device. Downlink communication (ASK) is performed at 100 kbps; uplink communication (LSK) is performed at 66.6 kbps. The received power is managed by an integrated system including a voltage rectifier, an amplitude demodulator and a load modulator. The power management system is presented and evaluated by means of simulations.

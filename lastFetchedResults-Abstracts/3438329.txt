The aim of this paper is to analyze the robustness of the electrostatic separation process control. The objective was to reduce variation in the process outcome by finding operating conditions (high-voltage level, roll speed), under which uncontrollable variation in the noise factors (granule size, composition of the material to be separated) has minimal impact on the quantity (and the quality) of the recovered products. The experiments were carried out on a laboratory roll-type electrostatic separator, provided with a corona electrode and a tubular electrode, both connected to a dc high-voltage supply. The samples of processed material were prepared from genuine chopped electric wire wastes (granule size &gt;1 mm and &lt;5 mm) containing various proportions of copper and PVC. The design and noise factors were combined into one single experimental design, based on Taguchi´s approach, and a regression model of the process was fitted. The impact of the noise factors could be estimated, as well as the interactions between the design and noise factors. The conditions of industry application of Taguchi´s methodology are discussed, as well as the possibility of adapting it to other electrostatic processes.

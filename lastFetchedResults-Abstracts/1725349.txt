The main objective of this work was to study the enzymatic synthesis of short chain ethyl esters, a group of relevant aroma molecules, by Fusarium solani pisi cutinase in an organic solvent media (iso-octane), and to assess the influence of different parameters on the reaction yield.

se displayed high initial esterification rates in iso-octane, which amounted to 1.15 μmol min−1 mg−1 for ethyl butyrate (C4 acid chain) and 1.06 μmol min−1 mg−1 for ethyl valerate (C5 acid chain). High product yields, 84% for ethyl butyrate and 96% for ethyl valerate, were observed after 6 h of reaction, for an initial equimolar concentration of substrates (0.1 M).

ghest product yield (97%) was observed for ethyl caproate (C6) synthesis, a compound which is a part of natural apple and pineapple flavour, for an alcohol:acid molar ratio of 2 (0.2 M ethanol concentration).

se affinity for short chain length carboxylic acids (C4–C6) in ester synthesis in iso-octane confirmed previous observations in reversed micellar system.

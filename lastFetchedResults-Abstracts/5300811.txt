The most attractive feature of sensor nodes is systematic collection of data and further transmitting the gathered data to a distant base station. The security parameter can be incurred if the data is transferred in sensitive areas like Defense, Health, Banking etc. However, the sensitivity of Wireless Sensor Networks makes them prone to attacks which lead to extraction or damage of data or information that flows between distinct nodes. The main objective of this paper is to construct an effective sensor security detection system which is adaptive to the behavioral changes of the nodes and the data flowing between various sensor nodes and hence detect the malicious node in our environment based on its skeptical behavior.

This paper focuses on the study of a frictional sliding contact problem between a homogeneous magneto-electro-elastic material (MEEM) and a perfectly conducting rigid flat punch subjected to magneto-electro-mechanical loads. The problem is formulated under plane strain conditions. Using Fourier transform, the resulting plane magneto-electro-elasticity equations are converted analytically into three coupled singular integral equations in which the main unknowns are the normal contact stress, the electric displacement and the magnetic induction. An analytical closed-form solution is obtained for the normal contact stress, electric displacement and magnetic induction distributions. The main objective of this paper is to study the effect of the friction coefficient and the elastic, electric and magnetic coefficients on the surface contact pressure, electric displacement and magnetic induction distributions for the case of flat stamp profile.

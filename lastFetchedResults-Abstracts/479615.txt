Background and Objective: Utilization of plants as antioxidants in food processing is a hope for substitution of synthetic antioxidants. Biological properties of Saturejasahendica Bornm. essential oils have not been studied yet. 

Materials and Methods: Ferrous ion chelating, nitric oxide radical scavenging and cytotoxicity of S. sahendica and commercial Satureja essential oils were studied. 

Results: Chelating reaction was dose dependent with an IC50 of 750 and 190 µg in S sahendica and the commercial oils respectively. S.sahendica oil with 39.5 fold flavonoid content exhibited nitric oxide radical scavenging with an IC50 of 6 and 195 µg in S sahendica and the commercial oils respectively. The total phenolics of Satureja sahendica and the commercial Satureja were 170.5 ± 8.53 and 23.83 ± 2.24 µg Gallic acid equivalent per mg sample. The concentrations from S. sahendica and commercial satureja oils required to exert 50% fatal effect (IC50) on healthy human normal lymphocytes and Hela cells were 253.66, 1490, 0.19, and 1.09 µg respectively. 

Conclusion: The results indicate nutritional value of these plants in preventing formation of toxic reactive oxygen species and that Satureja, as a good antioxidant, can directly scavenge NO and O2?. With a view to cancerous cells killing properties of the oils at their lower concentrations, one may conclude applicability of these oils in combating cancerous cells without having a adverse effect on normal healthy cells.

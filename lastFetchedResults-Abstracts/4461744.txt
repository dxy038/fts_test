Assessment of opioid dependent patients in a replacement program has traditionally relied on conventional methods such as urine testing or face to face examination with a physician. We are introducing new assessment techniques based on pupillometry, reaction time and slurring of speech. The pupillometry test uses a webcam, controlled lighting and customized software to measure pupil parameters. The reaction time test uses a push-button to detect time to respond to a visual stimulus. The slurred speech test involves detection of slurring of a set of individual test words. These three tests will be combined to provide the physician with an objective "sedation index" for patients. These techniques will be used with remote dispensing technology currently under development.

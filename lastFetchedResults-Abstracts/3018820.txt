In this paper, we introduce a new fully distributed algorithm for combining power and rate control in wireless communication systems. The algorithm is based on minimizing a multi-objective definition of an error function. In this paper, we defined three objectives. The objectives are: 1) minimizing the transmitted power, (2) achieving at least the target carrier to interference ratio (CIR) which id defined at the minimum data rate, and 3) achieving the maximum CIR which is defined at maximum data rate. An optimized solution can be obtained by using a multi-objective optimization technique. The suggested algorithm is simple to implement and very efficient. The simulations carried out on the UMTS specifications indicate that our algorithm give a very good performance in terms of data rate, outage probability, convergence speed and transmission power consumption.

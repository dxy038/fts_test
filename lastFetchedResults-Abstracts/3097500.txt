As assistive tools that are applied in varied circumstances such as forecasting situations, managing problems, analyzing data or information, Decision Support Systems support and improve individual and group decision making within organizations. The applications and benefits of decision support systems have expanded with the integration of web-based technologies, making it a valuable organizational tool. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that incorporates fuzzy multiple objective linear programming for individual decision making and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process for group decision making. It outlines the key features of adopting a web-based decision support system integrated with fuzzy analytic hierarchy process for supporting group decision making to deal with imprecise decision making problems.

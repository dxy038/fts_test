The paper investigates the effect of Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) and Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) on damping interarea oscillations. Supplementary controllers for each of the flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices are developed. An objective function is formulated for tuning the controller parameters of the FACTS devices. The optimization is done based on the promising technique- Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO). The performances of the proposed controllers are evaluated in a multimachine power system.

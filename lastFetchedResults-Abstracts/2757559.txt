A novel dual-stator bidirectional-flux modulated permanent magnet (PM) machine is presented in this paper. The key of the design is to locate consequent PM poles in both stator and rotor sides and the merit is that the magnetic flux produced by either the rotating or stationary PMs and dual-stator windings can be modulated by the stator teeth and rotor iron segments. It is shown that with this flux modulation effect and improved reluctance torque effect, the torque density of the machine can be increased. The bidirectional flux modulation theory and operation principle of the machine are explained and analyzed using time-stepping finite element method.

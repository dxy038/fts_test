Background: Alcea sulphurea (A.S) with various drug effects, especially on mucociliary system as dilutor drug and sputum collection is known.
Objective: This study examined the comparative effects of A.S and Bromhexine HCL (B.H) on mucociliary system chicken trachea.
Methods: In this experimental study 30 Leghorn chickens were randomly divided into five groups of six. One group was considered as Control and the other four groups during 12 days received oral B.H, oral A.S extract, nebulas normal saline and Nebulized A.S extract respectively. After 12 days the chicks were killed and the biopsy samples from the middle tracheal were taken for histopathology study using PAS methods under Light microscopy. Finally Image tools III Software were used for counting of size and number of mucous glands and cilia.
Results: Results of the analysis of data showed a significant increase of number and the size of mucous glands, also the size of cilia in Nebulized A.S group in comparison to Control group, oral B.H, normal saline .The oral A.S extract group showed the increase in numbers and sizes of cilia and mucous glands but they werenâ€™t significant.
Conclusion: According to more mucolytic effects of A.S extract than Bromhexine HCL and side effects for drugs mucolytic is recommended to be used that respiratory and inflammatory diseases of the A.S extract.

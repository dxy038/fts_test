Advanced Distribution Management Systems (DMS) functions in general and Volt/Var Optimization (VVO) function in particular are forefront tools for reliable and economic operation of distribution Networks. By using real time calculation results from VVO, there is a potential for closed-loop voltage control and sending set-points to tap changers and capacitor banks. The major challenge for such closed-loop voltage control is the possibility of larger computation time for optimization problem and also delays associated to the two-way communication platform between the VVO engine and field through the SCADA system. The objective of this paper is to develop the idea of closed-loop voltage control by utilizing a VVO engine with a full mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for solving optimization problem for real-time and planning applications. Optimization problems are implemented in GAMS and have been tested on a real small MV distribution network.

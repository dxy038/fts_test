In this paper, we consider a hybrid wireless-wired network consisting of two distinct parts: a wireless hop and a wired mesh backbone network shared by wireless and wires sources. The wireless air-interface is often modeled as time-varying fading channels, and the primary objective is to make the most efficient use of the available bandwidth and power. In this hybrid network model, trade-off between rate-power allocation local to the wireless hop and global congestion control that regulate both wireless and wired sources sharing wired links in the backbone. To resolve a potential conflict between maximizing ´global utility´ for end-to-end transmissions and achieving ´local capacity´ at the air-interface, wireless source is needed. Global and joint convergence method is used for the end-to-end resource allocation algorithm

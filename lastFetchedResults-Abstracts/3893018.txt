This paper presents the development and implementation of a new and practical fuzzy switching position controller for process industry control. Compatible with the structure of a bang-bang controller, a two-input fuzzy switching position controller with five rules is proposed. The idea is based on constructing a fuzzy switching control law which is functionally analogous to a traditional bang-bang controller. Fuzzy logic rules are used to enable an improved version of the conventional bang-bang control. The objective is to replace the conventional bang-bang controller with the proposed fuzzy switching position controller. A modified three-stage bang-bang controller is also designed and implemented. This controller is tested under the same conditions as that of the proposed fuzzy switching position controller, and its performance is used as a basis of comparison by which both controllers are measured. Both controllers are implemented in real time, using the position control of a brushless dc motor drive found in the majority of these new robotic devices. A test bed was built and tested in the laboratory using a collection of tools that include both off-the-shelf hardware (dSPACE DSP DS1104) and software (MATLAB/Simulink). Experimental results show that the fuzzy switching position controller produces adequate control performance, particularly in handling nonlinearities and external disturbances. The efficacy of the fuzzy switching position controller is demonstrated by its positive results, practicality, and feasibility in the process industry sector, when compared with a modified traditional bang-bang controller.

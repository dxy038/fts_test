This paper presents a time domain mathematical model of a three phase induction generator feeding a single-phase electrical distribution system including space harmonic effects. The objective in this work is to analyze the three-phase induction generator when working in the conditions described above. From such a model it is possible to make a more precise analysis, since some problems should be easily observed using the time domain technique, such as unbalancing of magnetomotive forces (MMF) at the machine inner magnetic circuit. This is impossible to visualize when using frequency domain modeling. A 2 HP three-phase induction generator model is used in digital simulation. Through the results it is easy to show that the proposed model is very efficient

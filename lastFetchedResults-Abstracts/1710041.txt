BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Arsenic, the king of poisons, is a carcinogenic metalloid and considered as an environmental toxicant. Mitochondrial damage, reactive oxygen species elevation and eventually apoptosis induction are some mechanisms of action and also contributed to its convenient application against some proliferative states. Since arsenic is important toxin and as a antineoplasm agent, in this study, apoptosis induction of a newly designed arsenic nanoparticles were evaluated and compared to the conventional form in order to evaluate its effect of more small size as nanoparticles on apoptosis in fresh cells.
METHODS: In this experimental study, fresh hepatocytes of 30 Wistar rats (with 180-200 gram weight) was isolated by two step collagenase perfusion method and following stabilization in rotary, exposed to 0, 10, 20, 40 and 100 microM sodium arsenite nanoparticles and also conventional form for 1 hour. Groups were divided base on type and concentration of arsenite and control (normal saline) group and treatment was triple. Viability was obtained and apoptosis determined by modified comet assay and scored accordingly and compared between groups.
FINDINGS: Percent of apoptotic cells was significantly increased by conventional and nano particles of sodium arsenite (p < 0.05) in comparison to control group. While apoptosis percent in score 3 was 22% in 100 microM concentration of conventional sodium arsenite; it was reached to 56% by 100 microM concentration of nanoparticles of sodium arsenite. Apoptosis was clearly more prominent in hepatocytes exposed to arsenic nanoparticles. 
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that arsenic nanoparticles robustly induced apoptosis that can potentially make it more toxic than conventional form.

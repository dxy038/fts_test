This paper concerns the production line capacity assignment problem with consideration of equilibrium requirement, which sources from the practical production management. The problem is to determine the utilized capacity of each production line in the iron &amp; steel complex in order to make the load of each production line equilibrated and keep the logistics between production lines straightway. To tackle this problem, a mathematical programming model is formulated. Then the quadratic objective function is linearized to obtain a linear programming model which can be optimally solved by CPLEX. Finally, the experiment results based on real operational data have been done to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.

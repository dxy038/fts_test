Background and objective: Dark chocolate has received the attention of researchers due to its cardiovascular protective effects. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 8 weeks consumption of dark chocolate on the lipid profile, apo-lipoprotein A-1 (Apo A1), apo-lipoprotein B 
(Apo B), and hs-CRP in type-2 diabetic patients. 
Materials and methods: This clinical trial was conducted on 69 diabetic patients randomly assigned to one of  two (intervention and control) groups. The intervention (n=32) and control (n=28) groups received daily, for 8 weeks, 25 gr dark chocolate (containing 450mg polyphenols) and a similar amount of white chocolate, respectively. At the beginning and at the end of the period, blood samples were collected to measure total cholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c, TG, Apo A1, Apo B, and hs-CRP. In addition, anthropometric measurements were made and data were gathered on physical activity, blood pressure and food intake and compared between the 2 groups
Results: The intervention brought about statistically significant reductions in the blood levels of TG (p=0.007), apo-lipoprotein A-1 (p=0.045), apo-lipoprotein B (p=0.01) and hs-CRP (p=0.005).There were no significant differences in either group with regard to serum total cholesterol, LDL-c or HDL-c levels at the end of the period; neither were observed any intergroup differences.  
Conclusion: The findings suggest that polyphenol-rich dark chocolate may have desirable effects on the blood triglyceride, apo-lipoproteins A-1 and B and  hs-CRP levels in diabetic patients, with no effect on the lipid profile.

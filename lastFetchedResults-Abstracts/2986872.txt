The main objective of this paper is to analyze the current usersÂ´ surfing behavior and propose efficient web navigation models for the naive users as well as experienced users. Pre-order surfing and Hamiltonian surfing are recommended for naive users since they are unfamiliar with the web sites considered. Conversely, optimal path surfing should be explored for the experienced users since their target pages have been pre-defined. Path optimization using fuzzy distance approach is proposed to compromise various criterions and identify the optimal path or sub-optimal path to a specific target page

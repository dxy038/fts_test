Objective
Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) expression and tyrosine phosphorylation is decreased during pregnancy. Pregnancy may be a suitable condition to detect any abnormalities related to IRS-1 polymorphisms. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence and metabolic impacts of IRS-1 G972R polymorphism in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
Study design
Anthropometric and metabolic variables of 62 women who were diagnosed as having GDM according to 100 g oral glucose tolerance test were compared on the basis of IRS-1 polymorphism by univariate analysis of covariance.
Results
Patients with IRS-1 G972R were more obese at the beginning of pregnancy, had higher serum fasting insulin and glucose levels. Weight gain during pregnancy and insulin and glucose levels after glucose ingestion was comparable between groups.
Conclusion
IRS-1 G972R was associated with the baseline characteristics of the patients with GDM, and might be related to insulin resistance that is seen in obese patients with GDM.

The objective of this work was to analyze the general case of an electrostatic discharge (ESD) event which occurs for the approach of two charged floating conductors. Parameters studied include body sizes, and the magnitude and polarity of the charges on the two bodies. ESD parameters including body potentials and energies before a discharge, and the charge transferred and the energy dissipated in the discharge can be calculated for typical test geometries. The methodology is applied to examine the effect of the speed of approach of the two bodies and the conditions which support multiple discharges. The results of this work provide a better understanding of the fundamental principles involved in the ESD event between two charged bodies in approach and have application in estimating the effect of ESD on electronic devices and systems.

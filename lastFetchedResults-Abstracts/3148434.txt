Generation of high resolution two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images in short range applications with the help of coherent radar is the main objective of the paper. Conventional SAR generates 2D image using combination of range compression and 1D aperture synthesis via azimuth (cross-range) compression. The range resolution is limited by the signal spectrum width, while cross-range resolution is defined by the signal wavelength to synthetic aperture length ratio. We suggest applying 2D aperture synthesis that implies cross-range compression technique in both dimensions to generate 2D coherent images. Application of noise waveform with wide enough power spectrum bandwidth enables generation of 3D images of radiotransparent objects, such as trees, bushes, interior of rooms, etc. We present results of modelling of noise waveform radar with 1D and 2D aperture synthesis having various configurations of planar 2D synthetic aperture and results of experiments aimed on SAR imaging with continuous noise waveform and 2D synthetic aperture.

The objective of the research is to find (1) The characteristic of surface leakage current of the polymer insulator under the artificial multi stress, (2) Investigating the tropical climate factors which could influence of the surface leakage current of the polymer insulator, (3) The most influential climate factor towards the characteristics of the surface leakage current of the polymer insulator, (4) A comparison of the surface leakage current of the polymer insulator with a ceramic or a glass insulator if they were used in the area tropical climate. The methods used were making design concept of chamber construction and it accessories, designing it, so it could be well functioned and useful. The tests are carried in several stages and the result of the research reveals that the characteristic of the surface leakage current of polymer insulators SIR is much smaller and more stable than ceramic insulator and glass insulator. The test, by blowing the various artificial tropical climate pressure, indicates that the surface leakage current of the polymer insulator SIR is very small for all types of the tropical climate impacts and the smallest comparison occurs when it is blown by the pollution of salty fog in which the average comparison achieves 1:3.14:4.26 towards ceramic and glass insulator. The difference of the lowest leakage current reaches the average of 72.03 % towards the ceramic insulator and 58.21% towards the glass insulator.

Using yearly data set from 1952 to 2008, this paper has proposed to use linear Granger causality to investigate the relationship between government expenditure and economic growth in China. The study finds that there is a strictly bidirectional Granger causality between the government expenditure and economic growth. The government expenditure drives economic growth and in turn is driven by economic growth. Furthermore, the bidirectional Granger causality is robust in eight years, after eight years the bidirectional Granger causality die out.

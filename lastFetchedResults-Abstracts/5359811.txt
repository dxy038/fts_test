This paper focuses on control of electron transports and switching of molecular devices (<sup>M</sup>devices). To accomplish these objectives one should control motion of charge carriers. Various phenomena and transitions, exhibited by <sup>M</sup>devices (microscopic systems) and microscopic particles, can be utilized only if specific effects, evolutions and events are controlled ensuring device functionality and required capabilities. Concentrating on molecular electronics, our objective is to develop sound and practical solutions. Molecular (nano) electronics is fundamentally distinct and cannot be compared to solid-state microelectroncs due to: (1) Distinct phenomena exhibited and utilized; (2) Device physics and functionality differences; (3) Distinct device-physics centered control principles and mechanisms; etc. We examine dynamics and control of microscopic charge carriers in <sup>M</sup>devices. In particular, for solid and fluidic <sup>M</sup>devices, the controlled motion of electrons, ions and molecules is studied. Applying sound device physics, we report theoretical and applied developments in analysis and control of <sup>M</sup>device transitions with a primary focusing on: (i) Device physics and analysis consistency; (ii) Device physics and control coherency; (iii) Device physics and technology soundness. It is possible to control the transitions and motion of microscopic particles (charge carriers) thereby control tunneling, transport, characteristics and other evolutions exhibited by <sup>M</sup>device variables (quantities of interest). The processing and memory transitions at the device level are defined by the device physics, control principles, behavior of microscopic system (device) and particles, etc. The ability to control microscopic particles means guarantying the overall device functionality. We examine the device physics and demonstrate that the device functionality, performance requirements and specified capabilities can be achieved by c- - ontrolling principles. The results are validated by examining device transitions by applying quantum mechanics. We perform high-fidelity modeling and carry out heterogeneous simulations. The quantifying and qualifying studies are reported.

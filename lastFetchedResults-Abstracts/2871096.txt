For a rapid identification of viral epidemics a mobile virus detection is needed, which can process samples without a laboratory. The application of medical biosensors, at key positions with a high passenger volume (e.g. airports) became increasingly important as epidemic early warning systems. As mobile biosensors have to fulfill various demands, like a rapid analysis and a long battery lifetime, in this study we present a multi-objective computation offloading for mobile sensors. The decision whether it is beneficial to offload work to a server, using the Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless network, can be made automatically and dynamically on the basis of conflicting objectives and several constraints.

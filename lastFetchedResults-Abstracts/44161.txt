The usual rating method for determining tuber uniformity is subjective and not suitable for parametric statistical analyses. In this work, a more objective measure of uniformity is proposed. The method associates the length, width and thickness of the tubers to the three axes of the Cartesian Co-ordinate System resuiting in a number of points in the three dimensional space corresponding to the respective tubers. The proximity of these points to one another, measured by mean square deviation, is used as a measure of uniformity.

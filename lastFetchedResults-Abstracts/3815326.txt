The problem of reducing the pulsating torque in current source inverter induction motor systems is investigated. Two typical approaches presented in recent publications are analyzed by making clear 1) the correlation among the current harmonics and the torque harmonics, and 2) the conceptual contradiction existing between these two approaches. By synthesizing the analyzed results, fundamental principles for treating the current harmonics and torque harmonics are established. In addition, the method for evaluating the degree of torque ripple is described, along with a proposed criterion for torque ripple content. By applying this criterion to these two approaches, objective estimates of degree of torque pulsations, which were unfeasible so far, are now made possible.

Use of crack propagation principles based on SIFs (stress intensity factors) is among the most common methods of fracture mechanic engineering. SIF is an important parameter in fracture analysis. In analyzing elastic fracture, SIF reveals the stress near the crack tip and substantial information about crack propagation. When loading or geometry of a structure is not symmetrical around a crack, rupture occurs with combined loading and the crack does not propagate on a straight line. Therefore, to determine the new direction of facture propagation use of twist angle criteria is necessary. The objective of this research was to propose a numerical model of crack propagation under combined loading conditions. In each crack with increased length the twist angle is assessed as a function of SIFs. This research aimed to determine SIFs for the crack propagation problem and to determine the crack development path through linear elastic fracture analysis. This study was primarily based on examination of the propagation and development of cracks on a plane under tensile loading and combined mode loading conditions. The ANSYS finite element software and FRANC3D crack propagation software were used to simulate crack propagation and to calculate the stress and SIFs

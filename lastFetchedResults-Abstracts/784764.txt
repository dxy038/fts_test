Objective: To determine the association between long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid
(n-3 PUFA) supplements intake and cognitive decline in an older Chinese population. Design: Prospective
cohort study. Setting: The Singapore Longitudinal Aging Studies (SLAS), a community-based study in urban
region of Singapore. Participants: 1,475 Chinese adults aged â‰¥55 years. Measurement: omega-3 PUFA
supplements intake and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were assessed at baseline. MMSE was reassessed
at a median of 1.5 years after baseline and cognitive decline was defined as at least 2-points drop in
MMSE score from baseline to follow-up. Odds ratios (ORs) of association between n-3 PUFA supplements
intake and cognitive decline were calculated in logistic regression models controlling for baseline
confounding variables. Results: Daily n-3 PUFA supplements intake was significantly (p=0.024) associated
with lower risk of cognitive decline (OR=0.37, 95% C.I. 0.16-0.87) after controlling for age, gender,
education, number of medical comorbidity, the presence of vascular risk factors/diseases, smoking, alcohol
drinking, depression, APOE e4 allele carrier status, nutritional status, level of leisure activities, baseline
MMSE and length of follow-up. The association remained significant (p=0.015) after excluding participants
with baseline cognitive impairment (MMSE<24), diabetes, stroke, and cardiac diseases (OR=0.23, 95% C.I.
0.07-0.75). No statistically significant association (OR=1.02, 95% C.I. 0.81-1.27) of fish consumption with
cognitive decline was found. Conclusion: Daily n-3 PUFA supplements consumption was independently
associated with less cognitive decline in elderly Chinese.

Several papers have been published recently on TPS control of dual active bridge (DAB) converter, however, no complete study of the converter operation behaviour exists, that takes into account all switching modes in both charging and discharging (bidirectional) power transfer. In this paper, six switching modes and their complements with opposite power transfer direction are defined with their operational constraints. Exact expressions for power transferred are derived with no fundamental frequency assumptions and range of power transfer for each mode is also defined to characterize mode limitations. Detailed constraints for zero voltage switching (ZVS) are also obtained. A new definition for converter reactive power consumption is introduced. This is based on calculation of inductor apparent power which avoids fundamental frequency approximations as well as the vague negative (back flowing) power definitions in recent papers. All known DAB phase shift modulation techniques including conventional, dual and extended phase shift, represent special cases from triple phase shift, therefore the presented analysis provides a generalised theory for all phase shift based modulation techniques.

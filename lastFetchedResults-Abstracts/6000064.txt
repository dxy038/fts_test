Increased ventricular repolarization dispersion (VRD) has been associated with risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Several ECG parameters have been propose to quantify the VRD, which do not Â´have definitive validation. The objective is to find and validate markers which represent the VRD more accurately. We hypothesized that VRD increment, is reflected by T-wave widening. T-wave duration (T<sub>wd</sub>) is therefore proposed as a index to quantify VRD. The Twd and the so call T-wave residuum (T<sub>wd</sub>) have been computed. An isolated rabbit heart model was used. Global VRD, at all myocardium regions, was induced by supplying d- Sotalol and by premature ventricular stimulation (PVS). Twd , showed sign@cant increase with VRD increase (78.0&#177;10.3v s 133.6&#177;29.6msw ith d-Sotaloland 95.2&#177;7.9 vs 118.5&#177;15.7ms with PVS) whileT,, didnotchange for this global VRR increase.

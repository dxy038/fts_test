The objective of the present study was to monitor the occurrence of a spectrum of trichothecene toxins in different groups of bread widely consumed by the German population. A total of 101 commercially available samples were randomly collected during 1999. Seven trichothecenes were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Detection limits ranged between 2 and 12 μg/kg. Based on all samples, the incidence of deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, HT-2 toxin and T-2 toxin was at 92%, 5%, 8%, 2% and 1%, respectively; the median contents in positive samples amounted to 134, 25, 40, 12 and 4 μg/kg, respectively. Fusarenon-X and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol were not detected in any of the samples. The DON content in positive samples of rye bread (rye content &gt;90%) was significantly lower than that of bread with a lower rye and correspondingly higher wheat content. In bread samples produced with cereals organically grown, the median values of DON resulted to be lower compared to those of conventional bread samples with a significant effect in mixed wheat bread. With bread being one of the major nutritional sources, the daily DON intake for the consumer may vary clearly according to eating habits. Based on the results of the present study it can be suggested that the temporary maximum tolerable daily intake of 1 μg/kg body weight/day of DON was not exceeded for the year and area of the survey.

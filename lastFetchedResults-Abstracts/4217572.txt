This paper reports a novel instrument for human current perception threshold (CPT) measurement. An objective galvanic skin response (GSR) method is employed to monitor subjectÂ´s response to quantitative stimuli. Experimental results show that new system is more objective and easy to operate in comparison with conventional quantitative sensory testing systems

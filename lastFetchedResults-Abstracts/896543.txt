Effective energy policy making is contingent upon availability of information about demand for electricity over time.  Projecting demand is particularly important for the household sector given its share in total electricity demand.  Correct decision making has to take into account the impact of various factors that influence demand for electricity.  In this paper, we estimate electricity demand in the residential sector through use of the harmony search method and linear, quadratic and exponential equation models.  The study uses objective criteria to select the model that produces the best estimates and uses it to forecast electricity demand up to the year 2025 under several scenarios. The results show that the exponential model has better predictive power for forecasting of residential electricity demand than other models.

A classification of spatial simulation models of fire and vegetation dynamics (landscape fire succession models or LFSMs) is presented. The classification was developed to provide a foundation for comparing models and to help identify the appropriate fire and vegetation processes and their simulation to include in coarse scale dynamic global vegetation models. Other uses include a decision tool for research and management applications and a vehicle to interpret differences between LFSMs. The classification is based on the four primary processes that influence fire and vegetation dynamics: fire ignition, fire spread, fire effects, and vegetation succession. Forty-four LFSMs that explicitly simulated the four processes were rated by the authors and the modelers on a scale from 0 to 10 for their inherent degree of stochasticity, complexity, and mechanism for each of the four processes. These ratings were then used to group LFSMs into similar classes using common ordination and clustering techniques. Another database was created to describe each LFSM using selected keywords for over 20 explanatory categories. This database and the ordination and clustering results were then used to create the final LFSM classification that contains 12 classes and a corresponding key. The database and analysis results were used to construct a second classification key so managers can pick the most appropriate model for their application based on computer resources, available modeling expertise, and management objective.

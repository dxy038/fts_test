With the growing emphasis on smaller compact and efficient power system there is increasing interest in the possibility of using Bi-directional converters especially in DC based power applications. Having the capability of bilateral power flow, that provides the functionality of two uni-directional converters in single converter unit; Bidirectional converters have the increased industrial applications; demand optimized study of topologies and feasibility, critical feature study for the considered application. This document suggests an optimized implementation of Bidirectional DC-DC converter to fit the present day UPS application. Key issues like compact design, utilisation of transformer core, optimised topology for low power (2.5kW) applications were discussed.

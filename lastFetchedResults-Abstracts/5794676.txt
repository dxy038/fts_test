This paper considers the problem of designing an observer-based output feedback controller for the class of continuous-time linear singular systems with Markovian jumping parameters. The objective is to find an observer-based controller that guarantees the stochastic stability of the closed-loop system. Sufficient conditions for solvability of this problem are obtained and a characterization of the controller is given in terms of the solutions of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is presented to show the usefulness of the proposed results.

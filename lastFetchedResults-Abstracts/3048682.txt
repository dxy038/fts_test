Using a distributed parameter model for beaver population that accounts for their spatial and temporal behavior, an optimal control for a desired distribution of the animals is presented. Optimal solutions are obtained through a "single network adaptive critic" (SNAC) neural network architecture. The objective of this research is to design an "optimal" beaver harvesting scheme for a region of interest.

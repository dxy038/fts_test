One of the applications of photovoltaic (PV) generators today is PV-hybrid power system for electricity supply for remote residences. In these systems, one or more PV array(s) are combined with one conventional source of power (diesel and/or wind) for making a more reliable electricity supply. Batteries are used in these systems for supplying electricity during the nights as well as cloudy days. In hybrid systems one or more diesel generators are used to ensure that the batteries are not undercharged. This paper focuses on a 2.5 kWp PV-hybrid power system to supply a health clinic located in remote area with no access to national grid. The objective of this paper is to present a simple but accurate design and sizing process for a complete self-contained PV-hybrid power system.

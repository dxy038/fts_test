In order to resolve the composite material multi-objective topology optimization in aircraft design, a multi-objective aircraft optimization system based on grid technology, the multi-objective optimization grid (MOOG) is put forward. Using grid middleware, MOOG pooled the distributed computational resource into a high-performance computing platform and built a common genetic algorithm computational model towards multi-objective topology optimization. This system provided uniform resource service and visible user using interface. This thesis discussed in detail the system design and the improved multi-objective genetic algorithm. Finally, the solid experimental results of optimizing one type of high aspect ratio wing show that the MOOG has reduced the computation time and has good parallel acceleration

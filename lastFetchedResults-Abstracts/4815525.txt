An assistant robot with standing-up devices (ARSD) is developed to provide the functions of standing-up from chair and moving for elderly people and paraplegic patients. Virtual prototype technology is employed to make the design and development of the robot more efficient and reliable. And, the co-simulation design method is presented. In order to run a 3D simulation, the model of the robot is built by SolidWorks and is imported to ADAMS through ParaSolid pipe. A multi-objective genetic algorithm based on neural network response surface is used to find the Pareto-optimal solutions in the optimum design of ARSD. In order to find the required answer in the Pareto set, a multi-objective fuzzy decision method is presented also. Finally, the mode of human-robot interactive control is discussed.

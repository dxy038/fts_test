Image segmentation plays an important role in imaging analysis. Based on the Mercer kernel, the fuzzy kernel c-means clustering algorithm (FKCM) is derived from the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (FCM).The FKCM algorithm that provides image clustering can improve accuracy significantly compared with classical fuzzy c-Means algorithms. In this paper, considering the advantages of KFCM, we propose a novel modified kernel fuzzy c means(NMKFCM) algorithm based on conventional KFCM which incorporates the neighbor term into its objective function. The results of experiments performed on synthetic and real medical images show that the new algorithm is effective and efficient, and has better performance in noisy images.

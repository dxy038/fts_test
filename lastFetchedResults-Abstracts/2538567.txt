Background and Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare early maladaptive schemas and cognitive emotion regulation in cardiac patients and normal individuals.

Materials and Methods: In this casecontrol, cross sectional study, all cardiac patients who had referred to medical centers in Urmia city over the year of 2014 were included. Out of this population, 96 patients with cardiovascular diseases were selected. 92 healthy subjects were selected from among the attendants of the patients.&amp;nbsp; Instruments for collection of data comprised a demographic characteristics questionnaire, short version of Young&amp;rsquo;s Schema Questionnaire (YSQSF) and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). To test the research hypothesis, multivariate analysis of variance was used.

Results: There was a significant difference between the two groups in schemas of impaired constraints and overvigilance domains. Likewise, the difference between the two groups, with cardiovascular disease and normal subjects in the two schemas, emotional inhibition and low selfcontrol/selfdiscipline was significant. However, the differences between the two groups in terms of emotion regulation styles were not significant.

Conclusion: The early maladaptive schemas are among personality factors with a potential impact on cardiovascular diseases and their effect is suggested to be taken into account in such disorders.

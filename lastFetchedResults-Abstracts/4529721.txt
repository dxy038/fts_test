Since several years, the network area is in continual progress and one of the important functions that should be introduced in Internet Next Generation consists of the policy-based servers. These servers of control will realize an equivalence between the demands of the clients and the network resources. The objective of the project Arcade is to define an intelligent interface capable of accomplishing the best choice possible on the allocation of the policies that concern the QoS, the mobility and the security. We develop a part of Arcade called NIA (negotiation intelligent agent) that plays the role of intermediary between the user and the rest of the system and is designated to help him access to the Internet New Generation. We use agent technology to dynamically negotiate the SLS on the user´s behalf, follow the user´s behavior to be able to anticipate the negotiations and manage the renegotiations.

Though the multi-valued exponential bidirectional associative memory (MV-eBAM) was verified to possess high capacity by thorough simulations, it still remains an open problem whether the hardware realization of such an architecture is feasible. In this work, we adopt current-mode VLSI circuits to implement the MV-eBAM. The key reason is the chip area will be drastically scaled down in contrast to the voltage-mode approach. Besides, the arithmetic operations needed include the absolute value and the exponential function, in addition to current copiers and current adders. 4-valued logic is realized in this work. Simulation results of recalling a stored 4-valued pattern pair by feeding an associated key vector are successful. Simulations also show the recall is still correct; even if there are error digits in the retrieval pattern vector. This verifies the fault tolerance ability of MV-eBAM

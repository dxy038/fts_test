The vast quantity of waste materials (such as roofing polyester waste fibers) accumulating throughout the world is creating costly disposal problem. The use of these materials was proved to be economical, environmentally sound and effective in increasing the performance properties of the asphalt mixture in recent years. The primary objective of this research was to determine whether homogeneously dispersed roofing waste polyester fibers improve the indirect tensile strength (ITS) and moisture susceptibility properties of asphalt concrete mixtures containing various lengths and percentages of the fiber in various aggregate sources. The experimental design included the use of three aggregate sources, two lengths (0.635 cm (1/4 in.) and 1.270 cm (1/2 in.)) of this fiber, and two fiber contents (0.35% and 0.50% by weight of total mixture). The results of the experiments found that, in general, the addition of the polyester fiber was beneficial in improving the wet tensile strength and tensile strength ratio (TSR) of the modified mixture, increasing the toughness value in both dry and wet conditions, and increasing the void content, the asphalt content, the unit weight, and the Marshall stability.

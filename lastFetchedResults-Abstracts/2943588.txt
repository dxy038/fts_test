In this paper, we present an evolutionary program for solving the fuzzy MSTP (multicriteria solid transportation problem) in which the coefficients of objective function are represented as fuzzy numbers. The ranking fuzzy numbers with integral value are used in the evaluation and selection. The proposed algorithm is incorporated with problem-specific knowledge and conductive to find out the set of nondominated points in the criteria space based on decision makerÂ´s degree of optimism

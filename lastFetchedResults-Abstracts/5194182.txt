The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of Internet-based remote monitored control system for teaching. An open-loop unstable dual-parallel coupled inverted pendulum platform is constructed and uses to develop the NCSs with real-time application interface. Client-Server architecture is developed with the network communication for closed-loop control. And a novel grey prediction method with a multi-step-ahead control signal generator, which used to compensate for network-induced time delays and maintain systems stability, are given. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

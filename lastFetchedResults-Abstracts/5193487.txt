Objective and quantifiable measurement is critical to the successful development of todayÂ´s complex ASIC design. In this paper, we propose a practical digital IP core quality measurement framework which is based on objective quality metrics. This measurement framework can be implemented as a quality measurement program within ASIC design flow. This framework will help IP designers to reach a consensus on which quality attributes are important for a given IP block. As a case study, the presented quality measure framework has been implemented in a wireless communication chip project.

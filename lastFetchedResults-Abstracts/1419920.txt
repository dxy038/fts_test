The objective of this paper was to analyze some features of the surface damage process of hardmetal tools in blanking of sheet metals. Comparative wear trials of hardmetals in abrasive-erosion and adhesive surface failure conditions were conducted and the worn areas by SEM and XRD examined. The dependence of wear on tool material microstructure is shown. It was found that hardmetal resistance to the surface damage during blanking of sheet steels is controlled by its resistance to adhesive wear and originâ€“propagation of fatigue cracks.

A study was initiated with the objective of evaluating the effects of sonication treatment on important quality parameters of extract of Pinus massoniana pollen. Sonication of extract was done (frequency 20 kHz and various amplitude levels) for 10, 30, 50 min, respectively. As results, total polysaccharide, phenolics and flavonoids significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05). And sonicated P. massoniana pollen displays strong immuno-stimulating activity by increasing proliferations of splenic lymphocytes and subsets of CD4+ T cells (CD3+CD4+), CD8 T cells (CD3+CD8+), and increased Ig secretion. Sonicated P. massoniana pollen also showed anti-tumor function by inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, inhibition of ROS production, up-regulation of GSH/GSSG ration, up-regulating the gene expression of P53, Bax and down-regulating the gene expression of Bcl-2. Findings of the present study suggested the sonication treatment of P. massoniana pollen could improve the quality and bioactivity of P. massoniana pollen, indicating that sonication is effective in processing of pollen and could be a potential process in tumor prevention and treatment.

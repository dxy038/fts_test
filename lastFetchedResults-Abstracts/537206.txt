Diagnosing the pregnancy at an early stage is an important requirement for successful dairying and to improve the production of farmers. The available techniques of diagnosing pregnancy are laborious, costly & high technical such as rectal palpation and ultrasonography. On the basis of ancient Egyptian knowledge, a simple non invasive bioassay has been developed to diagnose the pregnancy called PUNYAKOTI Test (Veena et al, 1997). The objective of the present study was to develop farmer friendly simple and non invasive pregnancy diagnosis test for cattle. Urine samples of pregnant and non pregnant cattle's were collected randomly. Germination tests for Mung beans were performed by diluting the urine with distilled water ratio of 1:4, 1:10 and1:14(Veena et.al, 2003). Measurements of germination after 24 and 48 hours and shoot lengths were recorded with in 05 days, respectively. Distilled water was served as a control. General linear model analysis showed that urine of pregnant animals has inhibitory effect on seed germination and Shoot length which were significant (P=0.05) than non pregnant cows. It has been identified the concentration of a plant hormone known as Abscisic acid is higher in the urine of pregnant cows (170.62 nanomoles,ml of urine) than non pregnant cows(74.46 nanomoles,ml) ( Veena et al, 2003).Main effect of Abscisic acid is to maintain the dormancy of the seeds. In conclusion, using above functional property of Abscisic acid can be developed farmer friendly simple and non invasive pregnancy diagnosis test for cattle using urine.

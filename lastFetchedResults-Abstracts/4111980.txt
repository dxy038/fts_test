Strap-down inertial and satellite system BISNS-1T developed by these authors from the Moscow Aviation Institute and JSC &#8220;Transas-Telematics&#8221; at the request of the Joint-Stock Company &#8220;Transas-Aviation&#8221; is presented. The main objective of this presentation is to acquaint our audience with the structure features, design, and algorithms of the system, allowing us to raise the accuracy and integrity of the navigation data and to show the results of its natural tests: at the test-bench and on a vehicle. The structure and design of the system were defined taking into account that it should be installed aboard the unmanned aerial vehicle, &#8220;Dozor&#8221; (Joint-Stock Company &#8220;Transas&#8221;).

A multiple-swarm multiobjective particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, named dynamic multiple swarms in multiobjective PSO, is proposed in which the number of swarms is adaptively adjusted throughout the search process via the proposed dynamic swarm strategy. The strategy allocates an appropriate number of swarms as required to support convergence and diversity criteria among the swarms. Additional novel designs include a PSO updating mechanism to better manage the communication within a swarm and among swarms and an objective space compression and expansion strategy to progressively exploit the objective space during the search process. Comparative study shows that the performance of the proposed algorithm is competitive in comparison to the selected algorithms on standard benchmark problems. In particular, when dealing with test problems with multiple local Pareto fronts, the proposed algorithm is much less computationally demanding. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm is insensitive to most of the user-specified design parameters.

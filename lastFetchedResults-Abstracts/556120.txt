Pathogenic diversity in Didymella rabiei in Ilam and Kermanshah provinces was assessed with the objective of finding out about the existence of pathotypes. One hundred isolates from different farms of chickpea growing regions in these provinces were collected in 2007. Isolates were arranged into ten different groups based upon their sampling regions. One isolate was chosen from anyone of the ten groups as the representative isolate one. Pathogenecity of the selected isolates was conducted on a set of seven chickpea differential hosts in glasshouse conditions. Reaction types of the ten isolates were studied one month past inoculation and on the basis of a 9 point scale. Based on disease reaction on differential hosts in accordance with disease reaction pattern on differential lines in ICARDA, three pathotypes were identified. The pathotypes included: pathotype 1 from Mehran, Ivan in Ilam province, Gilanegharb, Ghasrshirin, Sararoud and Sahneh in Kermanshah province; pathotype 3 from only Darahshahr in Ilam province, and finally pathotype 6 from Abdanan, Shirvan Chardavol in Ilam province and from Sarpolezahab in the province of Kermanshah.

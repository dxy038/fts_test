Background: Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of deaths in the developed countries and causes one million mortalities per year in the USA. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, stress, and low activity are known to be the causes of atherosclerosis. The objective of this study is to confirm the relationship between chlamydia pneumonia (Cpn), as well as helicobacter pylori (Hp) and atherosclerosis.
Materials and methods: In this analytical case-control study two groups of patients were studied. The first group including 30 patients over 30 years old with coronary artery disease were operated using coronary artery bypass graft. The control group included 30 persons assessed with angiography and having normal coronary arteries. The data were collected and analyzed using statistical methods. Results: The two groups were similar in terms of IgA and IgG anti-Cpn, and IgG anti- Hp but they were statistically different concerning IgA anti-Hp which had more positive cases in the case group in comparison with the control group (p<0.003). Additionally, 6 and 8 positive findings in immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the aortic punch biopsy were observed in Cpn and Hp respectively. When the serologic and histological findings were compared, it was revealed that the two bacteria had different behaviors in local invasion and systemic reactions.
Conclusion: This study confirmed that Hp could cause atherosclerosis by activating systemic reactions while Cpn could not cause it. Moreover, in 20% and 26.7% of the cases Cpn and Hp respectively revealed invasions to the aortic tissues which could result in atherosclerosis. It is recommended that this study must be repeated with large numbers of patients and control groups, and the control groups must be cadavers so that their aortic tissues can be biopsied.

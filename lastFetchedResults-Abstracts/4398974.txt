This paper presents a planning method for thermal power that is combined with wind power to get the optimal transmission capacity and bundle proportion of wind power and thermal power. At first, a comprehensive index system is established which takes into account the power demand, level of safety and stability, economy of the receiving system, transmission price and etc. Then these factors are defined as the objectives of the mathematical model with multi-objective function. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is applied to solve this multi-objective model. After obtaining the non-inferior solutions of the model, the optimal compromise solution is determined by the fuzzy membership function. The proposed scheme can obtain the optimal transmission capacity and also can guarantee the stability of the receiving power system. The simulation is conducted on the IEEE-9 system and the results verify the validation of the method.

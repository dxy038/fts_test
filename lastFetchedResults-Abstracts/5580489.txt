In this paper we propose a new deinterlacing algorithm using motion compensation and directional interpolation. To limit the propagation error that is a major drawback of conventional motion compensated methods, motion estimation is performed using original lines only, for same and opposite parity fields. In addition, a threshold value is used during the search to recognize situations where the motion estimator fails to find an optimal matching block. Enhanced edge-based line average with median filtering is used in these situations. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the traditional motion compensated method, based on objective and subjective criteria.

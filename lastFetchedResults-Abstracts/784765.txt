Objective: Recent observations showed that long chain omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3
LCPUFA) could represent a potential treatment for elderly depression. To determine if a n-3 LCPUFA
containing supplement improves depressive symptoms, changes phospholipids acids profile and ameliorates
Health related quality of life (HRQoL) in depressed elderly patients. Design: Two-months, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Nursing home in Pavia, Italy. Subjects: Forty-six depressed
females, aged 66-95 years. Intervention: 22 depressed females were included in the intervention group (n-3
group, that received 2.5 g/day of n-3 LCPUFA, with 1.67 grams of EPA and 0.83 grams of DHA), and 24
patients in the placebo group. The primary endpoint was the improvement of depressive symptoms as
evaluated by Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Secondary endpoints were the evaluation of modifications
of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids fatty acid profile and of of HRQoL, by using the Short-Form 36-
Item Health Survey (SF-36). All parameters were assessed before and after the treatment period of 8 weeks.
Results: The mean GDS at 2 months was significantly lowered only for the n-3 group. SF-36 physical and
mental components were significantly increased in the intervention group. Compliance was good, as
confirmed by erythrocyte membrane phospholipid FA concentrations, with significant increase of EPA and
DHA in the intervention group. Conclusion: The supplementation of n-3 LCPUFA in elderly female patients
reduces the occurrence of depressive symptoms, improves phospholipids fatty acids profile and healthrelated
quality of life.

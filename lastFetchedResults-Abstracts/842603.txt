This paper studies and compares three nonadaptive (bidirectional, unidirectional, and sliding mode) and two adaptive (active control and backstepping) synchronization methods on the synchronizing of four pairs of identical chaotic systems (Chua’s circuit, Rössler system, Lorenz system, and Lü system). Results from computer simulations are presented in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the methods and to compare them based on different criteria.

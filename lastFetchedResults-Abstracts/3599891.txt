Independent of the different tokamak scenarioÂ´s (ETF, TNS, INTOR, etc.) the common need in the mid eighties for reliable operation of large scale high-field (10-12 10-12 T) superconducting magnets can clearly be identified. For the development of large scale conductor and for the evaluation of design criteria a collaboration between CNEN, Italy, ECN, The Netherlands and SIN, Switzerland has been established with the main objective to construct a large European test facility, called SULTAN. The construction of the facility will be realized in two phases. Description of the design for the first phase with an eight Tesla background field of one meter bore is given. Experimental feasibilities, including cooling flexibility, instrumentation and power supplies are shortly reviewed. Progress of components and facility construction is described. The second phase extension to higher field application is outlined.

Objective. The purpose of this work was to establish whether surface replacement non-constrained prostheses can duplicate the normal biomechanics of the metacarpophalangeal joint.

Design. A series of mathematical models.

Background. A non-constrained prostheses has been designed for the replacement of the metacarpophalangeal joint. It uses the concept of surface replacement in that it attempts to replicate the anatomy of the original cartilage surfaces. The centre of rotation of the prosthesis is also sited at the same position as in the natural joint to maintain the balance between the flexor and extensor tendon forces, such that the prosthesis duplicates the biomechanics of the normal joint. Due to the unique dimensions of each joint that may present for surgery, the four sizes of prosthesis that are available for implantation may not always produce an exact replication of the joint kinematics. These situations were examined to establish whether the biomechanics of the joint can indeed be restored.

Methods. Mathematical models for each size of prosthesis implanted into a range of different sized metacarpophalangeal joints were developed. The prosthetic and cartilage surface profiles were compared and the balance between the tendon forces was examined.

Results. Differences in size that may occur between the surface profiles of the normal joint and prosthesis, together with any relocation of the centre of rotation, would have negligible effects on the normal joint biomechanics.

Conclusions. All four sizes of the non-constrained prosthesis can duplicate the normal biomechanics of the joint and hence provide normal function.

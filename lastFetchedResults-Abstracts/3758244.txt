We study the downlink multiuser Multiple Input Multiple Output-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (MIMO-OFDMA) system for margin adaptive resource allocation where the base station (BS) has to satisfy individual quality of service (QoS) constraints of the users subject to transmit power minimization. Low complexity solutions involve beamforming techniques for multiuser inter-stream interference cancellation. However, when beamforming is introduced in the margin adaptive objective, it becomes a joint beamforming and resource allocation problem. We propose a sub-optimal two-step solution which decouples beamforming from subcarrier and power allocation. First a reduced number of user groups are formed and then the problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem. Finally an efficient algorithm is developed which allocates the best user group to each subcarrier. Simulation results reveal comparable performance with the hugely complex optimal solution.

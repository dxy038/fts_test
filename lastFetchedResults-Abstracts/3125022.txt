This paper provide a new model of fuzzy membership transformation which is based on fuzzy multi-objective decision-making method, moreover, this model was used to solve the problems of fault diagnosis for turbogenerator units. The methods of data excavation based on Entropy, excavate the information of membership in the classification which is hidden in various index membership, and make a distinction of the relationship between the objective classification and index membership; meanwhile, definite a distinguishable weight to remove the redundancy worth of index membership grade in the process of objectives classification. This membership transformation model, which is not disturbed by redundant data, provides a new decision-making method of multi-fault diagnosis for Turbo-generator.

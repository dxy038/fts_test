In the case of multi-objective detection, the received signals by radar are the vector superposition of each scattering point. High resolution imaging is a method to distinguish the location of multi-objective. Many algorithms are used for different wideband signal. In this paper, convolution back-projection (CBP) algorithm based on stepped-frequency signal is employed to process the echoes received by antenna and obtain a high resolution two-dimension (2-D) image. After adding a receiving antenna, the height of each scattering point is also gained. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm.

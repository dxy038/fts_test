Presents an application of evolutionary programming (EP) for parameter optimization in the design of a voltage reference circuit. The voltage reference circuit is required to have a precise reference voltage, independent of power fluctuation and temperature variation, but it is difficult to find appropriate circuit parameter values. EP is used as an effective method of finding good parameter values of the circuit elements. We can increase circuit performances a lot by this method. Also, a multi-objective optimization technique is addressed

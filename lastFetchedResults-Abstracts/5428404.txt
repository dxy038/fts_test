This research work presents the solution of the economic environmental dispatch (EED) problem by means of the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. This technique was chosen due to the complexity associated with the highly nonlinear characteristics of the emissions involved and the dimensionality of the problem being considered. The economic-environmental problem was formulated by considering emissions either as constraints or as a second objective function of a multiobjective optimization problem. The IEEE 30 bus system was used for testing and validation purposes. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for solving the EED problem.

In Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems (UMTS), the Downlink Shared Channel (DSCH) can be used for providing streaming services. The traffic model for streaming services is different from the commonly used continuously- backlogged model. Each connection specifies a required service rate over an interval of time, k, called the "control horizon". In this paper, our objective is to determine how k DSCH frames should be shared among a set of I connections. We need a scheduler that is efficient and fair and introduce the notion of discrepancy to balance the conflicting requirements of aggregate throughput and fairness. Our motive is to schedule the mobiles in such a way that the schedule minimizes the discrepancy over the k frames. We propose an optimal and computationally efficient algorithm, called STEM+. The proof of the optimality of STEM+, when applied to the UMTS rate sets is the major contribution of this paper. We also show that STEM+ performs better in terms of both fairness and aggregate throughput compared to other scheduling algorithms. Thus, STEM+ achieves both fairness and efficiency and is therefore an appealing algorithm for scheduling streaming connections.

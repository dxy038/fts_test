To characterize semen quality a number of parameters need to be known. The parameters that are traditionally used - mobility and score - do not completely characterize fertilizing ability and insemination result quality. Dielectrometry in the millimeter range allows one to a larger extent to overcome a number of problems, since it allows one to work with the subject in real time and conditions that prevent subject destruction. The objective of this work is development of a system of instant tests to analyze semen condition at collection and cryopreservation, using dielectrometry in the range of free water dispersion. The method and equipment, which are applied to analyze semen structural and functional status, using dielectrometry in the millimeter range of radiowaves, are described

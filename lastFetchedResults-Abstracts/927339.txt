Objective: Regeneration of large bone defects is a major challenge in maxillofacial reconstruction. The present study evaluated the efficacy of simultaneous use of demineralized bone matrix (DBM), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and platelet rich in growth factors (PRGF).
Methods: Stem cells were isolated from the femoral bone marrow of rabbits and their stem cell nature was confirmed. PRGF was prepared by drawing 5 cc of blood from the heart of rabbits and its centrifugation. A total of four 8mm defects were surgically created in rabbits calvaria using a trephine bur. Third passage cells were loaded on DBM and stored in an incubator for 24 hours. DBM, DBM+PRGF, DBM+MSCs and DBM+PRGF+MSCs were used in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. At 6 and 12 weeks rabbits were sacrificed using vital perfusion. Histomorphometric analysis was performed on 5 Âµm sections stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H &E). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 14 software and ANOVA test. 
Results: Histomorphometric analysis of the sections at 6 and 12 weeks post-operation demonstrated 74.6% and 20.31% osteogenesis in group  1, 14.35% and 28.44% in group 2, 17.75% and 31.33% in group 3 and 18.94% and 37.21% in group 4, respectively. Percentage of new bone formation was higher in group 4. However, this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: It seems that simultaneous use of DBM, PRGF and MSCs results in increased bone regeneration in 8 mm rabbit calvarial bone defects when compared to the application of MSCs or PRGF alone.

This paper presents an optimal design of poly-phase induction motor using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The optimization algorithm considers the cost of active material as objective function and nine performance related items as constraints. The PSO algorithm was implemented on two test motors (7.5 kW and 110 kW) and their results are compared with the Constrained Rosen Brock Method (Hill algorithm) and normal design. Optimized variables are realized by SPEED (Scottish Power Electronics and Electric Drives) software. Optimal design results are theoretically justified. Some standard benchmarking problems are used to validate the PSO algorithm. C++ code is used for implementing entire algorithms.

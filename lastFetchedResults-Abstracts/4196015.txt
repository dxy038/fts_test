According to the power supply for effective enterprise security assessment and the production characteristics of their own power supply, power supply companies made safety evaluation index system. In this paper, the entropy introduced into the gray relation analysis model weight calculations, try to eliminate the weight calculation of human disturbance, in order to improve the evaluation method of evaluation of accuracy, so that the evaluation more objective, for power supply enterprises safety assessment of new The theoretical basis and methods.

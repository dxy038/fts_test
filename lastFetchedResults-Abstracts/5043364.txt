In an aging society, independent lives for elderly person is becoming more and more important. The ability of ADLs is a measurement of the functional status of a person, particularly in regard to people with disabilities and the elderly. This is important to keep their basic qualities of life and our society has to prolong the period performing ADLs. However a suitable evaluation method of daily motions has not been established yet. This research focuses on the human locomotion like walking and running. The objective of this research is to propose a quantitative evaluation method and a model of human locomotion and analyze these motions. IMU sensors which can measure triaxial (3-D) accelerations and triaxial angular velocities are used to measure the human motion. A simulation is conducted to confirm the validity of the human model. Finally, based on the mechanical energy consumption and the stability, human locomotion is analyzed.

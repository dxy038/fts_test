An optimization model is presented with a polynomial objective function subject to max-product fuzzy relation equation. Then the structure of solution set and its solution method are related with max-product fuzzy relation equation. Next, the optimal solution is discussed, based on exponent of monomial among objective function, a solution procedure is proposed. And finally, two practical examples are given for illustration purpose.

A family of zero-current-switching/zero-voltage-switching and zero-voltage-switching/zero-current-switching quasi-resonant bidirectional DC/DC converters suitable for high-frequency operation based on a bidirectional quasi-resonant switch is proposed. These converters are realizable with only two power MOSFETs. Design considerations and guidelines are discussed, and experimental results supporting the proposed concept are presented. The limitation on the level of forward and reverse power imposed by the zero-current and zero-voltage switching requirements is discussed. The use of single-cycle resonant topology and resonant-transition pulse-width-modulation (PWM) topology for bidirectional power conversion is also mentioned

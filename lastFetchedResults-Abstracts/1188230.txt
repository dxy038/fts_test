The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of summer savory essential oil (SSEO) with two types of diets (based on barley or corn) on performance, rumen ammonia nitrogen and some blood parameters of west Azerbaijan native kids. In a randomized complete block design with a 3×2 factorial (0.00, 200 and 400 mg/d of SSEO × barley or corn grain based diets) arrangement with 6 replications, 36 female Kids with 18 ± 2.62 kg initial live weight were used for 11 weeks. Kids were kept in individual cages and had free access to food and water. Dry matter intake, weight gain and feed conversion ration were not affected by the treatments but rumen ammonia nitrogen was affected (P < 0.05) by the SSEO were the lowest ammonia nitrogen was found in kids received 200 mg/d SSEO. The rumen pH was affected by the type of cereal grain (P < 0.05) where it was lower in kids fed barley based diet. Concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, NEFA, BHBA, HDL, LDL, VLDL, blood creatinine levels were not influenced (P > 0.05) by the treatments. In conclusion, the summer savory essential oil may affects the rumen degradabiltity and metabolism of nitrogen but did not affected the blood metabolites.

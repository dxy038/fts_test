Objective(s):To examine the expressions of CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c integrins in the myocardial tissues of rats with isoproterenol-induced myocardial hypertrophy. This study also provided morphological data to investigate the signal transduction mechanisms of myocardial hypertrophy and reverse it. Materials and Methods: A myocardial hypertrophy model was established by subcutaneously injecting isoprenaline in healthy adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Myocardial tissues were obtained, embedded in conventional paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin. Pathological changes in myocardial tissues were then observed. The expressions and distributions of CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c integrins were detected by immunohistochemistry. Changes in the mRNA expressions of CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c in the myocardial tissues of rats were detected by RT-PCR. Image analysis software was used to determine the expressions of CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c integrins quantitatively. Results: Immunohistochemical results showed that the positive expressions of CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c integrins increased significantly in the experimental group compared with those in the control group. The mRNA expressions of CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c in the myocardial tissues of rats were consistent with the immunohistochemical results. Conclusion: The increase in the protein expressions of CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c integrins may have an important role in the occurrence and development of myocardial hypertrophy.

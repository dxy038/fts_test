The frontal crash is an important item relating to C-NCAP test and regulations. The vehicle crash pulse has a vital influence on injury value of driver´s head and chest in 100% frontal rigid carrier crash. In order to this problem, the vehicle crash pulse is analyzed and a structural optimization solution is presented with regard to a specific vehicle. The peak value of crash pulse can be reduced by optimizing rear fixing bolt on sub-frame and increasing the energy-absorbing efficiency on load path. As a result, the analysis of restraint system indicates that the injury value of driver´s head and chest is significantly reduced, thereby achieving the objective of safety development.

A part of management of solid waste related to site selection for healthy landfill, some method and technique delivered for site selecting. Among them analytic network process (ANP), a multi-criteria decision-making technique have some priority that can be a proper model for site selection because
represents a framework with a bidirectional relationship, the ANP allows for complex interrelationships among decision levels and attributes. The ANP feedback approach replaces hierarchies with networks in which the relationships between levels are not easily represented as higher or lower, dominant or subordinate,direct or indirect. The elements of a cluster may influence some or all the elements of any other cluster.therefor.
This paper addresses the problem of solid waste location selection using the analytic network process (ANP), a multi-criteria decision-making technique. The ANP technique enables us to consider both qualitative and quantitative criteria as well as the interdependencies and feedbacks. Selection of the appropriate landfill site is a complex problem and requires an extensive evaluation process considering the requirements of public sector, governmental, environmental objectives, etc. A number of criteria (social, environmental and technical) and their sub-criteria were considered for sitting a landfill on the Qucahn as the case study. The process of site selection was performed through some steps that will be discussed throughout the paper in detail. Finally, the suitable land units for landfill were selected.

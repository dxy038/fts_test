Background
Several theories of cigarette craving suggest that dopaminergic function in the ventral striatum plays an important role. The objective of this study was to determine correlations between craving-related brain activation and dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) binding in smokers.
Methods
Twelve smokers and 12 nonsmoking controls underwent [15O]H2O-positron emission tomography activation study and D1R-binding study using [11C]SCH 23390, and the correlations between receptor binding and cue-induced regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes were assessed. Consecutive D1R-binding changes were examined during a period of 6 months of postsmoking abstinence in five smokers.
Results
Cue-induced activation was observed in the left ventral striatum including the nucleus accumbens in smokers. D1R binding in the ventral striatum showed a negative relationship with cue-induced craving and rCBF changes. D1R binding was significantly low in smokers, and there was a trend of increase after smoking abstinence.
Conclusions
D1R binding and cue-induced rCBF changes in the ventral striatum suggest the important role of D1R in this region in cigarette craving.

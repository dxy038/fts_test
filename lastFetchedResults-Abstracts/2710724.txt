This paper proposes a methodology to determine the optimal capacity of renewable distributed generation (RDG). The objective in this paper is to maximize cost-savings of energy not supplied (ENS) as well as cost-savings of energy loss according to RDG installation in a distribution network. Additionally, in order to achieve this multi-objective optimization problem, both a restoration matrix and restoration availability are newly proposed. In this case study, a practical Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) system is presented and discussed, demonstrating the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

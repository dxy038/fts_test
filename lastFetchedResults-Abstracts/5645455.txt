With the development of embedded system and microelectronics technology, the hardware/software co-design methodology of SoC has taken an important role in de-signing of embedded applications. Hardware/software partitioning is one of the most significant part of hard-ware/software co-design of embedded systems. Hard-ware/Software partitioning is essentially multi-objective optimization problem, namely, how to obtain an optimal hardware/software combination based on satisfying system function requirements and constraints. This paper presents an immune algorithm based on the Pareto concept of multi-objective optimization problems. Compared with other algorithm, it can provide an effective tool for measuring the performance of different objective functions, and improve the designing efficiency. In the last, the result was compared with those of using the single-objective optimization on different task graphs. Experimental results show the algorithm can achieve the global optimal solution of the HW/SW partitioning problem based on meet system constraints.

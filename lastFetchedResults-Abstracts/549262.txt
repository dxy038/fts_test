Objective
The aim of this study was to identify the best criteria for diagnosis of migraine 
in our pediatric population. 
Materials and Methods
A total of 85 children aged below 15 years who had been referred to the 
Neurology Clinic of Al-Zahra Hospital with headache as their chief complaint, 
were enrolled. Validated questionnaires were completed by them. The patients 
were evaluated using five sets of diagnostic criteria including the Vahlquist, the 
Prensky, the International Headache Society (IHS), the IHS-Revised (IHS-R), and 
the Maytal criteria; the sensitivity of each set of criteria was assessed. 
Results
Of the 85 children, clinically diagnosed as having migraine, 61 (72%), 73 
(86%), 75 (88%), 76 (89.5%), and 76 (89.5%) met the criteria of IHS, Vahlquist, 
Prensky, IHS-R, and Maytal, respectively. Both the IHS-R and Maytal criteria 
had the highest, while the IHS criteria had the lowest sensitivity. Fifty-four 
children (63.5%) were positive for all five sets of criteria. The application of IHS 
criteria for diagnosing pediatric migraine led to a smaller percentage of children 
with migraine being identified.
Conclusion
Assessment of the sensitivity of the five sets of criteria for the diagnosis of 
migraine revealed the inadequacies and limitations of the IHS criteria in the 
diagnosis of pediatric migraine

The optimal allocation of emergency power supplies should consider the distribution of existing distributed generators, capacity of existing emergency power suppliers in each local district utility and important customers´ needs for emergency power supplies. Based on the relationship between power supply reliability and economy, the optimum model of emergency power supplies has been proposed in this paper with the minimum total cost as objective function and some constraints such as time and capacity etc. An optimal algorithm of emergency power supplies based on genetic algorithm is put forward. The model and algorithm brought forward are proved by a practical example and software development based on GIS. The study results help to improve power supply reliability and the ability of urban electric network for emergency situation, reduce customers´ outage costs and guarantee power system with preventive and emergency measures facing natural and man-made disasters.

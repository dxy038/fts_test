Background and Objective: Tooth decay is one of the most common human diseases and it has a close relationship with individual’s behaviors. Access to present information or the status can pave the ground for interventions that can improve oral health status. The health belief model is a framework that shows the relation between some of the constructs related personal perceives and cues to action and self efficacy and behavior. This research was done to determine predictors of health belief model constructs in dental caries index in the boy students, in fifth-grade in the primary school in Dezfool in 2010.
Subjects and Methods: This research is an analytic-description type. Initially a questionnaire was self-designed based on model constructs, and validity and reliability was evaluated. T
hen, 150 students were selected by random sampling method. The collected data form the completed questionnaires were analyzed by SPSS15 software.
Results: The results showed that prevalence of tooth decay was %78.7 and M ± SD of dental caries index was 2.59± 2.05. There was a significant relation between dental caries index and perceived susceptibility (P=0.07, r=0.21), severity                             (P=0.03, r=0.16),    barriers       (P=0.07, r=0.21), and self efficacy (P=0.04, r=0.17) constructs, but it had no significant relation with perceived benefits and cues to action. In addition, there was a significant relation between dental caries index and tooth brushing behavior (P=0.002, F=4.05), but it had no significant relation with using tooth flossing. 
Conclusion: The result of this study confirms that we can decrease tooth decay indicator of students by improving tooth brushing behavior.

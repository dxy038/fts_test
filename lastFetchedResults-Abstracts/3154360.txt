Reasonable effort should be made to remove all past references to this paper.<br/><br/>The presenting author of this paper has the option to appeal this decision by contacting TPII@ieee.org.<br/><br/>This article is based on the theoretical study and experimental analysis of multi-objective genetic algorithm and artificial immune algorithm´s characteristics, and presents a method which is based on immune genetic algorithm to solve multi-objective optimization problems. The main contents are as follows: Firstly, the multi-objective optimization problems are described. Secondly, this paper designs an improved immune genetic algorithm model. Finally, use an example of a company to verify the effect of algorithm to solve practical problems.

Given the particularity of rail transport, the damage and losses caused by the railway emergency are often severe. Therefore, establishing the evaluation index system and making effective assessment of the corresponding emergency plan is of great importance for reducing the damage and loss of the incidents. In this paper, according to the characteristics of railway emergency plan, the evaluation index system is firstly established. Then combined with the expert judgments, G2 method is used in the calculation of the index weights, with which the consistency check in AHP is effectively avoided, and thus the fuzzy evaluation method is cited to make a comprehensive evaluation on the emergency plan, which not only combined quantitatively and qualitatively but also make subjective evaluation objective, so the accuracy of the evaluation have been improved. Finally it gives an example to verify the rationality and reliability of the proposed method, which provide the effective assessment to the railway emergency for reference.

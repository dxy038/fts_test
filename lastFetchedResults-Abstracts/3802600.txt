Cycling by means of functional electrical simulation (FES) is an attractive training method for spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects. FES-cycling performance is influenced by a number of parameters like seating position, physiological parameters, conditions of surface stimulation, and pedaling rate. The objective of this paper was the determination of the influence of the most important parameters on optimal muscle stimulation patterns and power output of FES-cycling on a noncircular pedal path. The rider-cycle system was modeled as a planar articulated rigid body linkage on which the muscle forces are applied via joint moments and implemented into a forward dynamic simulation of FES-cycling. For model validation, the generated drive torques that are predicted by the simulation were compared to measurements with an individual paraplegic subject. Then, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the influences of the most important parameters for surface stimulation of gluteus maximus, quadriceps, hamstrings, and peroneus reflex. The results show how optimal stimulation patterns and the expected mean active power output can be estimated based on measured individual parameters and adjusted geometry and stimulation parameters for a particular SCI-subject. This can considerably improve FES-cycling performance and relieve the patients by shortening the time that is necessary for experimental adaptation of the stimulation patterns.

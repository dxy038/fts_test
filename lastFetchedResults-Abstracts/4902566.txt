This paper proposes a novel methodology for the optimal location and sizing of shunt capacitors in radial distribution systems. The optimization problem includes maximizing capacitor saving function, minimizing active power losses, and voltage profile improvement. The installation node is selected by Loss Sensitivity Analysis in a step by step procedure. An evolutionary algorithm known as bacteria foraging algorithm (BFA) is utilized for solving the multi-objective multivariable optimization problem and the optimal size of capacitor for selected nodes is determined. The proposed approach is applied to 34-bus distribution system as a test study and the results are compared with previous method. The results show that this method provides more economical solution by reducing power losses and total required capacitive compensation.

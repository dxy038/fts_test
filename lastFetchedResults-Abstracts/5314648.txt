In explicit or delay-driven congestion control, a common objective is to sustain high throughput without long queues and large losses at the bottleneck link of the network path. Congestion control protocols strive to achieve this goal by transmitting smoothly in the steady state. The discovery of the appropriate steady-state transmission rates is a challenging task in itself and typically introduces additional queuing and losses. Seeking insights into the steady-state profiles of queuing and loss achievable by real protocols, this paper presents an AIST (Asynchronous arrivals with Ideally Smooth Transmission) model that abstracts away transient queuing and losses related to discovering the path capacity and redistributing it fairly among the packet flows on the bottleneck link. In AIST, the flows arrive asynchronously but transmit their packets at the same constant rate in the steady state. For the link with an overprovisioned buffer, our queuing-theoretic analysis and simulations for different smooth distributions of packet interarrival times agree that queuing under AIST with the target utilization of 1 is on the order of the square root of N, where N is the number of flows. With small buffers, our simulations of AIST show an ability to provide bounded loss rates regardless of the number of flows.

This paper describes an approach for the integrated design of linear controlled structures which is being investigated as part of NASAÂ´s Control-Structures Interaction (CSI) methodology development program. The approach is integrated in the sense that the structure and its controller are simmultaneously designed. The design methodology employs constrained nonlinear optimization procedures based on analytically obtained gradients of the structural responses. Design of the controller is based on the so-called Q-parameterization theory, which parameterizes all closed-loop input/output maps achievable with stabilizing linear controllers. Very general objective and constraint functions are possible, and structural shape can be included in the design variables. This method has been partially implemented and demonstrated; early findings are reported.

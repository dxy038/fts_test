Purpose: Quadriceps muscle strength was reduced significantly after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Finding a solution to overcome this problem is crucial. The objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of eight weeks cross exercise on the quadriceps muscle strength, in men after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Methods: Twenty patients with anterior cruciate ligament tear, with an average age of 22.02±1.55 years and mean weight of 71.7±7.15 kilograms, were selected as volunteers. They were divided into two groups: experimental group and control. The experimental group, in addition to physiotherapy, performed eight weeks cross exercise with uninjured leg, three sessions per week and each session lasted for 20 minutes. The control group just received physiotherapy. Before three days of ACLR and After 9 weeks and performing 24 sessions of cross exercise, isometric strength of quadriceps muscle in both groups were measured at 60 degrees of flexion in both legs, by Isokinetic BIODEX system.. Data were analyzed by paired and independent samples t-test at a significance level of pResults: The results showed that following eight weeks of cross exercise, the quadriceps muscles strength in uninjured leg, in the experimental group was significantly increased (P=0.002). Likewise, after reconstruction of the ACL, the amount of reduction in quadriceps muscles in the experimental group was significantly lower than the control group (P=0.001). Conclusion: The degree of strength loss can be positively reduced by continuum concentric cross exercises. Along with the optimization of the healthy organs, these exercises enhance the strength of organs, which underwent surgery.

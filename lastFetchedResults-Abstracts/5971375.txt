Reconfiguring the PTZ parameters of a camera network is an combinatorial optimization problem and computing the optimal solution is very time consuming. Therefore, existing methods can only provide sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, a nonlinear objective function for better utilizing the cameras to track multiple targets is proposed. Furthermore, it is shown that by expanding the unknown parameters and imposing new constraints, the nonlinear objective function can be converted into a linear production game (LPG) problem. Since an LPG possesses an optimal solution which can be evaluated with polynomial time, the proposed method is efficient and accurate. Computer simulations have been conducted and the results show that the proposed method is very promising.

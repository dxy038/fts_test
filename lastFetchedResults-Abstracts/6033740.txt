A 1.2 kVA, 14 V contactless automobile power generation system has been built and tested successfully in laboratory. The system includes a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), a rectifier and a switching power supply (SPS) regulator. Aimed at automobile generator operating mode whose speed and load are variable, a reasonable rated operated point is adopted. Finite element method (FEM) is used for the PMSG magnetic field analysis. Rotor magnet pole protection is discussed, surface insert structure is adopted; once confecting chill-pressing technology for the rotor core makes rotor compact and nice. According to the condition of systemÂ´s stability, reliability, volume, cost and so on, a reasonable regulator topology is selected. Analyzing the objective factor that the regulator input voltage is variable whose characteristic is low voltage and high current, and gives the solutions. A feedback circuit that can make the output voltage stable and has quick response is designed. Test results indicate that the characteristic parameters of contactless automobile power generation system such as the efficiency, output voltage adjustment, and power density all excelled Lundell machine.

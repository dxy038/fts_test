The objective of this study was to investigate the role of contrast enhancement using a three-dimensional (3D) phase-contrast (PC) magnetic resonance (MR) sequence (3D PC-MRA) and to assess the value of a dynamic MR perfusion study of the kidneys to determine the hemodynamic relevance of unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS). Seventeen patients with unilateral RAS were examined on a standard 1.0 T imaging system using a phase shift and magnitude sensitive 3D PC sequence (TR = 160 ms, TE = 9 ms, venc. 30 cm/s). Following the initial pre-contrast 3D PC-MRA a dynamic first pass perfusion study was performed using a Turbo-FLASH 2D sequence (TR = 4.5 ms, TE = 2.2 ms, TI = 400 ms) after bolus injection of 0.15 mmol gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA)/kg body weight. The 3D PC-MRA was then repeated during infusion of 0.15 mmol Gd-DTPA/kg body weight. Evaluation by three independent readers was based on maximum intensity projection images. Source images were rendered on request. Signal intensity (SI) over time curves of the renal cortex were obtained from the dynamic perfusion study and analyzed for maximum signal enhancement as well as temporal relationship to the aortic SI curve. Results from 3D PC-MRA revealed a sensitivity (pre-/post-contrast) of 100%/89%, specificity of 76%/63%, positive predictive value of 80%/69%, negative predictive value of 90%/78%, and accuracy of 85%/75% (p = 0.07). Interobserver agreement was κ = 0.61/κ = 0.47 (pre/post Gd-DTPA), respectively. Increased signal-to-noise was present in all segments of the renal arteries post contrast (p = 0.0003). This came along with image degradation due to aliasing and elevated SI of venous flow that partially obscured the renal arteries. Dynamic SI curves showed a significantly decreased maximum SI in RAS (p = 0.01–0.001). A temporal delay of cortical signal intensity enhancement could not be confirmed in this setting. Gd-enhanced 3D PC-MRA did not yield a superior diagnostic value in the diagnosis of RAS compared to pre-contrast measurements. Dynamic perfusion imaging of the kidneys, in combination with 3D PC-MRA, can contribute additional information in suspected unilateral RAS.

Objective: To investigate some of the reasons why magnetoencephalographic (MEG) spikes are at times not apparent in conventional electroencephalograms (EEG) when the data are co-registered, and to explore to what extent modern EEG analysis methods can improve the yield.
Methods: Seventy seconds of MEG–EEG co-registration on a 122 channel Neuromag system were studied in a 10-year-old boy with Landau–Kleffner syndrome. Twenty-six EEG channels were originally recorded with a left ear reference. The EEG data were subsequently reformatted (BESA) to a variety of montages for the 10–20 and 10–10 electrode array. A 10 s data epoch was compared in detail for concordance between MEG and EEG spikes. To detect the characteristics of hidden low voltage EEG spikes, MEG spikes were averaged and compared with the concomitant averaged EEG spike.
Results: While there was an abundance of EEG as well as MEG spikes on the left; definite right-sided spikes were not visible in the EEG. Right hemispheric MEG spikes were, however, plentiful with an average strength of 757 fT. When the individual MEG spikes from the right hemisphere were compared with the corresponding EEG events their amplitude ranged between 24 and 31 μV and were, therefore, indistinguishable from background activity. The majority of them became visible, however, with further sophisticated data analysis.
Conclusions: When the relative merits of MEG versus EEG recordings for the detection of epileptogenic spike are investigated the 10–20 system of electrode placement and conventional methods of EEG analysis do not provide optimal data assessment. The use of the 10–10 electrode array combined with modern methods of digital data analysis can provide better concordance with MEG data.

Background
Video-assisted thoracoscopy with the creation of a pericardial window is a noninvasive method of pericardial drainage. It also allows an excellent view of both the pleural cavity and pericardium and the precise selection of biopsy sites. We review our 3-year experience with this technique.
Methods
Between January 2001 and February 2004, 18 patients (10 men, 8 women; mean age 57 years) with echocardiographically diagnosed pericardial effusion underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy at our center. Pericardial windows were created under general anesthesia and single-lung ventilation using 2 to 3 trocars. Mean operating time was 46 minutes. A right thoracic approach was used in 16 patients and a left thoracic approach in 2.
Results
Microbiology and virology cultures of the pericardial fluid were negative. Histologic findings were compatible with tuberculosis in 2 cases and granulocytic sarcoma, infiltrating breast carcinoma, and infiltrating nonsmall cell carcinoma in 1 case each. In the remaining patients, the histologic diagnosis was chronic or subacute nonspecific pericarditis. Talc pleurodesis was performed in 3 patients for concomitant malignant pleural effusion. In 4 patients, the pericardial effusion occurred secondary to cardiac surgery; 3 were receiving anticoagulants after valve replacement, and 1 had a heart transplant. There were no complications of the thoracoscopy technique.
Conclusions
Video-assisted thoracoscopic fenestration is an effective technique for pericardial drainage and biopsy. Apart from its diagnostic value, it allows the physician to fashion a pleuropericardial window for effective drainage while avoiding the complications of classic surgical procedures. Concomitant pleural and pulmonary disorders may be managed simultaneously.

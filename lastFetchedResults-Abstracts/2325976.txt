Context and objective: The criminal responsibility of high-ranking officials one
the concerns of international society. Thatâ€™s why they have set the first annexed
protocol for Geneva conventions, constitution for temporary courts and the
constitution of International and some principles and criteria for it through the
clear identification of doctrine and three-fold elements, although international
documents have not presented any definition of the responsibility, but they have
declared that the presence of the structural element of criminal responsibility is
due to international humanitarian rights related to relation between higher and
lower ranks.
Methodology: The present study is descriptive from points of view of type
objective, application and nature and method and data collection has been carried
out through document investigation and
Findings: In judgments before Second World War, commanding and control
criteria have been accepted as the criteria structural element. Contemporary courts
have carried out the principle of effective control and the International Criminal
Court has followed this policy, but the difference is that for higher military ranks,
the principles of commanding and effective control and authority, but for nonmilitary
higher ranks, only effective authority and control have been exerted.
Results: In the articles 86 and 87 of the first annexed protocol are considered
essential to materialize the afore-mentioned doctrine. But, in the International
Red cross committee account of the first annexed protocol, the concept of higher
ranks is beyond the relation between higher-lower ranks and inclusive of the
concept of control in hierarchy. The above-mentioned doctrine is not limited
to military people, but also includes non-military people and is carried out in
relation to international crime and non-international armed enmities.

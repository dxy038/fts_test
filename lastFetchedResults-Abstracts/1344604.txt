Reduction in the permeate flux is a major fundamental problem in membrane separation process due to membrane fouling and concentration polarisation. To alleviate these scenarios with an objective to attain proper throughput from the membranes, different types of high-shear devices have been proposed in literatures. In the present work with the rotating disc membrane module (RDMM), a high-shear device, vanes with different geometries and arrangements were used as turbulence promoters. The aim of the work is to identify a vane which will be worthy to obtain moderate permeate flux at the expense of low energy consumptions, i.e. with low applied trans-membrane pressure (TMP) and low membrane speed. To meet the objective a simulated solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and glucose was introduced as feed to the rotating disc membrane module (RDMM) fitted with different arrangements of vanes at different combinations of trans-membrane pressure (TMP), feed concentration and membrane speed. It was found that 45Â° blade angle vane having holes on the blade surface produce maximum permeate flux at low TMP and membrane speed for even high concentration of the feed solution, and thus responsible for the low rejection of glucose on the retentate side confirming maximum purity of BSA and glucose in either side of the membrane. ANOVA analysis was also done on the throughput of this vane to understand the effects of different operating parameters and the effect due to their mutual interactions.

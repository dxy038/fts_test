This paper presents preventive security-constrained optimal power flow (PSCOPF) with hybrid genetic-ant colony optimization (HGACO) is presented The PSCOPF can be divided into three steps involving security analysis, severest event selection, and preventive algorithm. First, Novel security analysis will be conducted before fault occurred in the system by current-based power flow technique. Second, ranking method will be used to highlight the most severe event caused by the specific facility. And finally, a preventive algorithm will make use of the contingency information, and could be kept the operator system security and avoided congestion when fault occurred. The HGACO is integrated with genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization, and the objective of GA is to improve the searching quality of ants by optimizing themselves to generate a better result, because the ants produced randomly by pheromone process are not necessary better. This method can not only enhance the neighborhood search, but can also search the optimum solution quickly to advance convergence.

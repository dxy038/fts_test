The objective of this study was to determine effects of feeding dried pistachio byproduct (DPB) with two source of supplemental protein (soybean meal (SBM) and canola meal (CM) on performance in early lactation of multiparous Holstein dairy cows. The dietary treatments were two levels of dried pistachio by product (0 vs. 10. %. of DM) with two source of protein SBM vs. CM. Dry matter intake, milk yield and composition were not influenced by the DPB and source of protein. No differences were observed between treatments for rumen pH but effect of source of protein on N-NH3 was significant (P<0.05). Apparent total digestibility of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and crude proteins was similar between treatments. Serum glucose of DPB fed cows was lesser than those not DPB fed. Blood urea nitrogen was affected by the source of protein. Blood urea nitrogen of SBM fed cows was greater than those CM fed. It was concluded that feeding DPB (10% of DM) no effect on performance of dairy cows and could be regarded as feed stuff for regions having low rainfall and forage.

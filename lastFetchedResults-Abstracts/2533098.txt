Background and Objective: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), particularly methicillin resistant strain (MRSA), is one of the most important pathogens in nosocomial infections that is capable of producing food poisoning and foodborne outbreaks. This study aimed to focus on the contamination status of food handlers, utensils and foodstuffs with this agent in a hospital kitchen as sources of distribution of these strains into hospitals.

Materials and Methods: A total of 220 sles were collected from freshly prepared foods, kitchen utensils and food handlers. The sles were cultured in Blood agar and Mannitol salt agar media and the isolates were evaluated both morphologically and biochemically using specialized tests and consequently were identified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using femA and nuc primers. For antibiogram, the standard disk diffusion test was used in accordance with CLSI, 2012 guidelines. To detect MRSA strains, resistance of the S. aureus isolates to cefoxitin (30 micro g) in MuellerHinton agar was evaluated.

Results: Thirty nine S. aureus isolates from food handlers (50%), 26 from kitchen utensils (48.1%), and 22 from food sles (25%) were detected. MRSA strains were found in 22.7% of the S. aureus isolates of foodstuffs, 23.1% in utensils and 5.1% in food handler sles. Homology of the resistance patterns among these isolates was also observed.

Conclusion: This study showed the presence of MRSA strains and homology of resistance patterns among the isolates of the foodstuffs, kitchen utensils and food handlers all of which call for a careful monitoring to prevent their distribution among hospitalized patients.

Background and Objective: Interferons are part of the body's
defense system against viruses. These proteins are generated in
the body, and then they trigger the cells around them to produce
inhibitor proteins against virus replication. The purpose of this
study was cloning and expression of the human interferon alpha-
2b?gene in preplasmic space of Escherichia coli.
Subjects and Methods: In this research, Alpha 2b interferon
gene was cloned in a pET-26b(+) expression vector, under the
control of T7 promoter and pelB periplasmic signal peptide
sequence using NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes. The
expression vector was transformed into Escherichia coli strain
BL21 (DE3).Cloning of alpha interferon gene confirmed using
colony PCR, digestion and DNA sequencing.Gene expression of
alpha interferon was examined by SDS-PAGE and Dot blot
analysis. Also the possibility of periplasmic targeting was
determined using SDS-PAGE and dot blot analysis at 15 hrs
after induction.
Results: The results showed that Alpha 2b interferon was
produced in bacterial expression system and targeted to
periplasmic space.
Conclusion: Our study showed that the production of
pharmaceutical recombinant protein in preplasmic space of
bacterial expression system is fissible and can be ustilized as a
cheaper source and more efficient than conventional expression
systems.

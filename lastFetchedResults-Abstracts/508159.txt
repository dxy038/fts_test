Background and objectives: Flat bread the main source of Iranian diet and the important carbohydrate supplier at food basket of our country. With regard to important of extension of shelf life and decrease of their wastage the objective of this study was to produce Iranian barbary bread with soymilk powder in an attempt to enhance its nutritional value and retard its staling.

Materials and methods: Soymilk powder was substituted at 4 levels, namely, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10%, for wheat flour to produce barbary bread a type of traditional, flat thick bread. The samples of soymilk powder, treated and control flours were analyzed for moisture, ash, protein, fat, fibre, pH, particle size, wet and dry gluten, falling number, and Zeleny value). Staling of bread samples was assessed by six trained panelists 1,3, and 5 days after production.

Results: Soymilk powder brought about statistically significant (p<0.05) increases in the ash, fiber, total fat, and protein contents, while it decreased wet and dry gluten, Zeleny value and falling number. pH of the treated samples was not significantly affected. Results of the sensory evaluation showed that a 10% substitution of wheat flour by soymilk powder created an unpleasant odor in the bread sample, though the least value was reported for the staling of this bread sample. However, addition of 7% soymilk powder had no undesirable effect on the sensory characteristics of bread; in addition, the rate of staling was also acceptable for this sample.

Conclusion: Substitution of soymilk powder (at 3%, 5%, and 7% levels) for wheat flour in making Iranian barbary bread not only will enhance the nutritional value of the bread, but it will also improve its shelf-life, without any undesirable effect on its sensory characteristics.

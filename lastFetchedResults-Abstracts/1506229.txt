Search strategy included using key words adolescent, puberty, puberty health, female and girls.
Results: Challenges related to puberty health education can be categorized to 6 main themes: insufficient knowledge, lack of appropriate attitude and practice; lack of attention to influencing factors; limitation of adolescents’ informational sources [mothers, peers and health educators]; disagreement about the right time to start teaching different aspects of adolescent health; Lack of appropriate educational content and disuse of appropriate methods of health education.

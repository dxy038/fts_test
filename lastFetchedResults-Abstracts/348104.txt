Objective
The movement-related potential (MRP) is an EEG measure related to self-initiated movements, consisting of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), the negative slope, and the motor potential. Since in a former study the BP was reduced in acute prefrontal traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, the present study examined the MRPsâ€™ course in follow-up examinations.
Methods
Right index finger MRPs of 22 patients with contusions of the prefrontal cortex were recorded 12, 26, and 52 weeks after TBI and compared to controls.
Results
Within the patient group, a significant increase of the BP in the temporal course after TBI was observed. MRPs 12 and 26 weeks after TBI did not differ significantly from the control group. One year after TBI, significantly enhanced BPs were found.
Conclusions
In the temporal course after prefrontal TBI, a recovery of the initially reduced BP was observed. The enhanced BP areas 1 year after TBI might represent the need for increased cognitive resources during movement preparation, supporting a recovered, but less effective neuronal network.
Significance
The present study represents the first longitudinal follow-up study of MRPs after prefrontal brain lesion. The observed changes reflect the plastic capacity of the brain, reorganizing the neuronal network function.

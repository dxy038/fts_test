Background and Objective: Tocotrienols have been demonstrated to play a significant role in preventing diabetic nephropathy due to their immunologic and inflammatory properties.The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a daily intake of canola oil enriched with 200 mg tocotrienol (T3)for 8 weeks on nitrosative stress, inflammation and urinary microalbumin in type-2 diabetic patients.
Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was conducted on 50 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (fasting blood sugar  >  126 mg/dl) randomly divided into 2 groups of 25 each to receive, daily for 8 weeks, either 15 ml T3-enriched canola oil (200mg T3; experimental group) or 15 ml pure canola oil (control group). Initial and final blood samples were collected to measureserum hs-CRP and nitric oxide (NO)levels, and 24-hr urine samples to measure urinary volume and microalbumin and creatinine levels. Physical activity levels, anthropometric parameters and nutrients intakes were determined before and after intervention and compared between the 2 groups. 
Results: T3-enriched canola oil brought about statistically significant reductions in urinary microalbumin (p=0.004) and hs-CRP (p=0.003). Also, at the end of the study, the intervention group had significantly lower serum hs-CRP and urinary microalbumin than the control group. A nonsignificant  decrease was observed in the serum NO level in the T3 group.
Conclusion: Based on the findings it may be concluded that tocotrienols can improve the inflammatory status and prevent diabetic nephropathy. However, its effect on nitrosative stress needs furher investigation.

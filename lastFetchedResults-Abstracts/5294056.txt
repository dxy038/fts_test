With advanced ATM technologies, future high speed networks will be able to support a wide spectrum of applications with diverse traffic characteristics and service requirements. This paper proposes a new ABR feedback control scheme where the effects of multiloop delays and high-priority traffic transmission are built into the control model. A so-called general prediction control (GPC) method is then applied to the control model for optimal performance. Our control objective is to minimize the unused link capacity subject to no congestion, where the ABR traffic is adapted to the low-frequency variation of high-priority traffic flow for high efficiency. A simulation study shows a significant improvement in the achievable throughput as well as in the control stability

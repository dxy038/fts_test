The performance of the fuzzy-controlled curved search method depends heavily on the membership functions of the categories of output error and step length used in the controller. We present a fuzzy neuron controller of backpropagation training algorithms for neural networks. With the objective of reducing tuning time, we introduce a self-adaptive fuzzy neuron controller for determining the size of step length. Computational results indicate a strong potential for reduction in tuning time for the fuzzy neuron controller in the neural network learning

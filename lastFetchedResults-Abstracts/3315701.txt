For the complexity of the ship feature classification and sensitivity of optical sensor to weather, airspace, illumination and other marine environment, we propose a new unsupervised multi-ship image segmentation algorithm of remote sensing platforms, including separation from the target area of the adaptive multi threshold criterion, algorithm based on multiscale Ncut hierarchical, multi-objective analysis of ship motion. Finally, through verification and analysis by experiment, comparing with other relevant segmentation methods, our method has better robustness and recognition effect.

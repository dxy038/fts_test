According to production tasks, making manufacturing resources reconstruction via machine tool selection is one of the key issues to achieve manufacturing system reorganization. At the time when machine tool is selected, qualitative factors and quantitative factors must be considered. In order to solve the problem well, the evaluation index system with a hierarchical structure was presented. A multi-objective optimization model was established, and then the model was analyzed by using hierarchical weighting methods. Finally, a practical application was provided to illustrate the scientific validity of the model and the effectiveness of the methodology.

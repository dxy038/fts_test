Objective
In the developed countries, elderly population is rapidly increasing, but outcomes of elderly patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remain unclear.
Patients and methods
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of non-traumatic SAH patients aged 80 years or older, who were hospitalized in a single center between 2000 and 2005.
Results
There were 24 patients (80â€“92 years old and 83% female), representing 8.8% of all non-traumatic SAHs (n = 272). Of those, six patients received an intervention (five clipping and one endovascular coiling) and the remaining 18 patients were managed conservatively. The patients who received an intervention were younger and had a better consciousness at presentation. Early mortality rate within 30 days after SAH was higher in the conservative group (61% [11/18] and 17% [1/6], p = 0.155). At 6 months, mortality rate was significantly higher in the conservative group (83% [15/18] and 33% [2/6], p = 0.038), and independence rate was higher in the intervention group (33% [2/6] and 0% [0/18], p = 0.054). Logistic regression analysis showed that age and degree of consciousness on admission were significant predictor of outcome in 4 weeks, and that receiving intervention was significant predictor of outcome in 6 months.
Conclusion
In elderly SAH patients with good clinical condition at presentation, an active intervention may improve the outcome.

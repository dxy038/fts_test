Expert system for the operative environment diagnostics (ESOED) that is here proposed realizes GIMS- technology (GIS+Model) combining the methodic and algorithms of mathematical modeling with the land and remote observations of the environment. Links between experiments, algorithms, and models of environmental processes and subsystems are developed to realize effective procedure for the operative control and diagnostics of the environment. The objective of this report is threefold: 1) To present a working methodology for the combined use of modeling technology and microwave remote sensing measurements in the assessment of environmental processes and biospheric subsystems dynamics. 2) To illustrate this methodology with computer calculations of global change dynamics for the various scenarios.

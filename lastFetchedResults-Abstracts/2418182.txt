The paper presents an optimal solution for a selective harmonic elimination pulse width modulated (SHE-PWM) technique suitable for a high power inverter used in constant frequency utility applications. The main challenge of solving the associated non-linear equations, which are transcendental in nature and, therefore, have multiple solutions, is the convergence, and therefore, an initial point selected considerably close to the exact solution is required. The paper discusses an efficient hybrid real coded genetic algorithm (HRCGA) that reduces significantly the computational burden, resulting in fast convergence. An objective function describing a measure of the effectiveness of eliminating selected orders of harmonics while controlling the fundamental, namely a weighted total harmonic distortion (WTHD) is derived, and a comparison of different operating points is reported. It is observed that the method was able to find the optimal solution for a modulation index that is higher than unity. The theoretical considerations reported in this paper are verified through simulation and experimentally on a low power laboratory prototype.

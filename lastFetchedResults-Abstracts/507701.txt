OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to compare the effectiveness of two methods of follow-up: Short Message Service (SMS) versus telephone call on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetes. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This semi-experimental study consisted of 77 patients with type 2 diabetes who were randomly assigned into two groups: telephone follow-up (n = 39) and Short Message Service (n = 38). Telephone interventions were applied by researchers for 3 months. SMS group received message daily for 12 weeks. Data were collected using data sheet to record HbA1c and a questionnaire consisted of demographic characteristics. Data gathering was performed at two points: at the baseline of the study and after 12 weeks. Data were analyzed by SPSS 11.5 using descriptive and inferential statistics methods.
RESULTS: Demographic variables were confirmed to be homogenous. The results of this study showed that both interventions had significant mean changes in HbA1c; for the telephone group (P = 0.001) with a mean change of -0.93% and for the SMS group (P = 0.001) with a mean change of -1.01%.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this research showed that intervention using SMS via mobile phone and nurse-led-telephone follow-up improves HbA1c for three months in type 2 diabetic patients and it can be considered as an alternative method for diabetes control

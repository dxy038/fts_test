Efficient virtual product creation combined with predictive engineering requires high-capacity computing and communication technologies as well as fast and transparent supply of knowledge, information and data. For this purpose, grid technologies offer great potentials for virtual product creation. One objective of grid computing is to perform more realistic simulations for better prediction of effects with reduced costs. This paper describes the approach and methods how engineering analysis problems in product development and manufacturing can be solved in the flexible context of CAE applications and grid computing infrastructure. The presented results are partly achieved in a joint project with partners from research and industry.

The objective of this paper is to compare various techno-economic parameters of Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) and Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps through a detailed experimentation and analysis. CFLs and LED lamps are energy-efficient (EE) luminaires as compared to low-cost incandescent lamps. Consequently, as part of Demand Side Management (DSM) initiatives across the nation, incandescent lamps are being steadily replaced by CFLs in the recent years; and the focus now is directed toward accelerating the use of LED lamps for lighting applications due to their high lumen efficiency and long operating life. However, both CFLs and LED lamps cause harmonic distortions in the distribution networks. The paper examines the amount of distortion power (as defined in IEEE-1459-2010 Standard) injected by these energy efficient lamps and their lumen efficacy. An economic comparison considering Annual Life Cycle Cost (ALCC) has also been attempted in the paper.

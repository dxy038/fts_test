Movement compensation is a key issue of stepped-frequency radars. The method based on range profile cross correlation (RPCC) can achieve unambiguous velocity measurement, however with limited velocity accuracy. In this paper, a bidirectional RPCC method is proposed, which is based on the up-down stepped frequency waveform. Moreover, based on the RPCC and the bidirectional RPCC, a new velocity measurement technique is also designed and implemented. Within three consecutive stepped frequency frames, the technique can achieve accurate velocity estimation with the advantage of wide unambiguous range and good anti-noise performance as confirmed by simulation results.

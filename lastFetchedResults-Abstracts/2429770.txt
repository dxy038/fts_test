This work examines the effect of weld strength mismatch on J and CTOD fracture parameters using single edge notch tension (SE(T)) specimens. A central objective of the study is to enlarge on previous J and CTOD estimation procedures based upon plastic eta factors (η) described in Part I for centerline-cracked welds. The present analyses provide a large set of η-factors for a wide range of crack sizes (a/W-ratio) and material properties, including different levels of weld strength mismatch, which are applicable in improved estimation equations for J and CTOD for weld centerline notched SE(T) specimens.

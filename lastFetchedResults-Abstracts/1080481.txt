The main objective of this study is to investigate the reuse possibility of effluent from a vertical submerged membrane bioreactor (VSMBR) treating municipal wastewater. The average removal efficiencies of total chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (T-N), and total phosphorus (T-P) were 96, 74, and 78%, respectively at 8-h hydraulic retention time (HRT) and 60-day sludge retention time (SRT). Additional removal of organic matter and improved nitrification and denitrification efficiencies were found by the formation of a dynamic membrane. The effluent quality of the vertical submerged membrane bioreactor (VSMBR) could satisfy most items in the current drinking water standards of Korea and the WHO (World Health Organization). Accordingly, the reuse of the effluent from the VSMBR could be possible for various purposes such as toilet flushing, sprinkling, and car washing.

This paper presents an efficient mode decision algorithm for H.263 to H.264 interframe transcoding. The proposed scheme uses a support vector machines (SVMs) approach to investigate the relationship between data extracted from H.263 decoding stage and the optimal coding mode in H.264 re-encoding process. Based on the SVM classifier, the transcoder only enables a subset of candidate modes for each macroblock in the rate-distortion-optimized mode decision in H.264. The objective is to eliminate unlikely modes in earlier stages in order to achieve computation saving. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the computational complexity of interframe transcoding by up to 77% while maintaining similar rate-distortion performance.

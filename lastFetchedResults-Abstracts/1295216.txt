This paper presents a review of mathematical programming models for supply chain production and transport planning. The purpose of this review is to identify current and future research in this field and to propose a taxonomy framework based on the following elements: supply chain structure, decision level, modeling approach, purpose, shared information, limitations, novelty and application. The research objective is to provide readers with a starting point for mathematical modeling problems in supply chain production and transport planning aimed at production management researchers.

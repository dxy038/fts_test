Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has been used for short and long-term indwelling catheters. However, PDMS shunt tubing has been scrutinized recently because of their extremely high failure rates. While there are many reasons why PDMS shunt systems fail, one is catheter-associated infection.<sup>[1]</sup> It is hypothesized that nanotextured and nanotubular surfaces can be carefully manipulated to inhibit bacteria responses while remaining non-toxic due to their unique surface energy properties which have the ability to control initial protein absorption and subsequent cell behaviors. The objective of this in vitro study was to create nanopatterned PDMS molds based on anodized titanium (Ti) and anodized stainless steel (S.S) and test fibroblast and bacteria responses on such substrates. Results show promise for the use of such nanopatterned PDMS for improving catheter applications.

A multivariable dynamic matrix predictive control algorithm is designed, which combine associate estimate with multi agent technology. In this algorithm, each of agent contain independence DMC and coordination algorithm based on associate estimate. All agent were integrated to multi agent system (MAS) by using Common Objective Request Broker (CORBA). The global optimal control is implemented through coordination of each agent. The simulation result shown that it has characters of simple, easy implementation and quickly speed.

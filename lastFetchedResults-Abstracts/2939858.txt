This paper proposes a non-conventional approach to the wire routing problem, in which a population of routing patterns evolve through the combined action of stochastic and routing operators, in a operation similar to that of genetic algorithms. In each wiring pattern (individual of the population), all nets are routed and temporary intersections are allowed. The objective of evolution is to improve wiring quality, in the sense of eliminating unwanted net intersections (short-circuits) and simplifying paths in order to reduce manufacturing costs and increase reliability. Experimental results using two-layer routing problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method

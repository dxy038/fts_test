Objectives
en and elastin are two key structural proteins found in the extra-cellular matrices (ECMs) of most tissues, yet very little is known about the response of bone cells to elastin or its derivatives. Recently, we have designed and characterized a novel class of ECM-based composite scaffolds with collagen and a genetically engineered polymer, elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) and subsequently showed their superior mechanical properties and drug release characteristics compared to collagen scaffolds. The objective of this research was to evaluate osteoblast growth and expression on these composite scaffolds.
s
ough biochemical and morphological characterization was performed on MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells cultured on collagen and ELP窶田ollagen scaffolds. Cell viability was assessed using a live/dead assay. Total DNA content of all cells present on various surfaces was quantified. Pre-osteoblast differentiation was assessed by measuring the alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin production. Mineral deposition by the cultured cells was visualized using the Von Kossa stain.
s
sults showed that the ELP窶田ollagen scaffolds were suitable substrates for cell culture that allowed MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cell attachment, differentiation, and subsequent mineralization over a period of 3 weeks. The ELP窶田ollagen scaffolds displayed equivalent biocompatibility and cell-interacting properties to those of the neat collagen scaffolds.
icance
vel ELP窶田ollagen composite material may have future implications as a scaffold material for bone tissue engineering applications, for example, the treatment of alveolar bone loss.

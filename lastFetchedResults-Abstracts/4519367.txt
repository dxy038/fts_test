The VTAM (Vetement de Tele-Assistance Medicale) project began in January 2001. It aims at developing generic clothing technology which integrates biosensors and bioactuactors woven into the fabric. In a first prototype version the T-shirt incorporates four smooth dry EKG electrodes, a shock/fall sensor, a breath rate sensor, two temperature sensors and a GPS receiver. A GSM/GPRS module is connected to the T-shirt and is used for data transmission and hands free communication. The VTAM challenges to reach a higher level of electronic integration in clothing than previous projects like the Lifeshirt USA or the Smart-Shirt USA. The objective is to obtain a biocloth, (or second skin), both comfortable and hygienic (washable), which incorporates connections, wires and microsensors. The leads and treatment modules are flexible and incorporated into the textile itself. The electronic 12C bus is also part of the textile. The mother board, the transmission module and power supply are kept on a belt and connected to the VTAM T-shirt through a micro connector. Data is transmitted through a GSM module to a central PC station. A medical protocol is being applied to process the biomedical data which include a EKG readings, a pneumogram, temperature, and fall detection in mobile situations. Three VTAM T-shirts have been tested on persons in a normal state of health. This project is supported by the french ministry of research.

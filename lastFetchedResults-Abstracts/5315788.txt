Associative memories are used in a pattern-recognition system as core classifiers. For this application, the training procedure for the BAM (bidirectional associative memory) proposed by B. Kosko (1988) has been substantially modified. By introducing an orthogonal set of vectors as the intermediate codes, the IGIA (indirect generalized inverse algorithm) can be incorporated into the recalling procedure. Thus, better system performance is expected

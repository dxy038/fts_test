Introduction & Objective: Recently, it has been suggested that there might be an association between oral diseases such as dental caries, as well as periodontitis and general health . Re-garding the fact that albumin is an indicator of general health, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of salivary albumin concentration with dental caries.
Materials & Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study 108 patients aged 13-19 years old who had teeth caries were placed in 3 groups with mild, moderate and severe dental caries according to their DMFT value (n=36). Five ml of unstimulated saliva were taken from each participant via Navazesh method and their albumin concentrations were assessed by nephelometery method. Data were analyzed by t-test and ANOVA.
Results: The mean concentration of salivary albumin in three experimental groups was 84.442±42.915, 97.964±66.717 and 89.850±33.003, respectively. ANOVA showed that the difference among the mean values was not significant (P=0.09) but the relationship between salivary albumins and sex was significant (P=0.009).
Conclusion: According to the results of the present study there was no significant relationship between albumin and dental caries in 13-19 year old individuals.

In this paper we model a scenario where a ship uses decoys to evade a hostile torpedo. We address the problem of enhancing ship survivability against enemy torpedoes by using single and multiple decoy deployments. We incorporate deterministic ship maneuvers and realistic constraints on turn rates, field of view, etc in the model. We formulate the objective function to quantify and maximize the survivability of the ship in terms of maximizing the intercept time. We introduce the concept of optimal deployment regions, same side deployment, and zig-zag deployment strategies. Finally, we present simulation results.

Objective
The aim of this study was to develop a rapid laboratory procedure that is capable of subtyping Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation groups FA-A, FA-C, FA-G, and FA-nonACG patients from a small amount of peripheral blood.
Materials and Methods

For this test, primary peripheral blood-derived FA T cells were transduced with oncoretroviral vectors that expressed FANCA, FANCC, or FANCG cDNA. We achieved a high efficiency of gene transfer into primary FA T cells by using the fibronectin fragment CH296 during transduction. Transduced cells were analyzed for correction of the characteristic DNA cross-linker hypersensitivity by cell survival or by metaphase analyses.
Results

Retroviral vectors containing the cDNA for FA-A, FA-C, and FA-G, the most frequent complementation groups in North America, allowed rapid identification of the defective gene by complementation of primary T cells from 12 FA patients.
Conclusion

Phenotypic correction of FA T cells using retroviral vectors can be used successfully to determine the FA complementation group immediately after diagnosis of the disease.

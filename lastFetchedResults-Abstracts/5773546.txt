In this research hybrid memetic algorithm and revised TOPSIS (HMA-RTM) method is introduced as a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm for solving multi objective cell formation problem (CFP). The objectives are the minimization of both total moves (intercellular as well as intracellular moves) and the cell load variation. Many researches have been made for cell formation taking into consideration multi objective. But there is limited works that considered Pareto-optimum as a solution set. The HMA-RTM composed of memetic algorithm and revised TOPSIS method (RTM). RTM is used for Pareto based fitness assignment. The propose model capable to providing decision maker with a wide range of non dominated solutions. The efficiency of multi-objective HMA-RTM is illustrated on a large a large-sized test problem taken from the literature. In last section, the results are compared with a closely related result that is taken from literature.

Taking a look at the structure of the hydro power plants of the Austrian utilities many of the electric machines are reaching a critical age. The risk of a failure or a break down can cause high financial consequences. For this reason a concept for the condition evaluation of hydro generators was developed. The focus of this procedure was to collect operational data; machine data and protocols of technical diagnosis measurements in order to form an objective analysis by weighing each factor. The aim was to make a kind of benchmark of all investigated machines. Several comparison charts were generated. This should result in making the right decisions about further operations, maintenance activities or replacement measures

Background: Acetaminophen as a common antipyretic drug, in overdoses, is poisonous for the liver. 
Objective: The current study aimed to assess the protective effects of Ferula (F.) gummosa essential oils against the liver toxicity of acetaminophen in rats. 
Methods: 80 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 16 groups (n=5). Negative control group received only DMSO and the positive control group received acetaminophen 500 mg/kg b.w i.p. The treatment groups received F. gummosa essential oils (100 and 200 mg/kg b.w) i.p immediately after acetaminophen administration. The blood were collected for estimating the values of total antioxidant of plasma (FRAP) and liver enzymes; alanin teransferase (ALT), aspartate teransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Also, a piece of liver was used for determining of glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LP) concentrations, the activity of glutathione s-transferase (GST) and histopathological studies.  
Results: The data showed that F. gummosa essential oil modulate significantly the changes in the levels of GSH, GST and FRAP as well as the liver enzymes and lipid peroxidation compared to negative control group. Furthermore, the histopathological findings of the liver tissue was confirmed the biochemical results.
Conclusion: The essential oil extracted from F. gummosa possessed antioxidant activity which protects the liver against the toxic effects of acetaminophen.

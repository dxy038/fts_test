DC micro-gird architecture and its control have been proposed in this paper. A bidirectional PWM rectifier is used as a backup for DC micro-grid to balance the power when the management ability of the local micro-grid is limited. A power management algorithm is also proposed based on this configuration. The DC zonal micro-grid proposed here has the advantage of maximum utilization of local distributed resource and smooth transition among different modes. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the theory.

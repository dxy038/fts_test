The 2013 Norton Cyber Security reports reveal that South Africa has the third highest number of cybercrime victims in the word - only surpassed by China and Russia. This paper critically reviews one area, the cyber security of small companies, which plays a significant role in putting SA is in this unenviable position, and suggests a plan of action to address the identified area. It is well reported that small companies are increasingly becoming major targets for cyber criminals. Major reasons for this are that small companies do not have the expert security knowledge and often cannot afford to get their own cyber security house in order. Compromising the cyber security measures of small companies in SA can have a crucial impact on the general cyber security of SA as a whole. This paper will investigate this aspect with the main objective of presenting a Plan of Action to improve the situation.

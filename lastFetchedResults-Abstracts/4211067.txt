In this paper, a topology of a multi-functional controlled bidirectional three-phase voltage-source zero voltage soft-switching PWM converter with three auxiliary active resonant commutated leg link snubber (ARCS) is presented for Na-S Battery and/or electric double layer capacitor energy storage system (BESS) with additional active power filter function. The operating principle of this active resonant snubber-assisted soft-switching versatile converter system with multi-functional digital control-schemes including active rectifier and inverter operation modes in addition to APF operation mode are described. The effectiveness of utility-interactive soft-switching bidirectional converter-based BESS is basically proved on the basis of simulation analysis as compared with hard-switching converter-fed BESS

Full-duplex 3.5-MSymb/s millimeter-wave quadrature-phase-shift-keying wireless data transmission over 12.8-km fiber transmission between a central station and base stations located on a 2.2-km coarse wavelength-division-multiplex fiber ring, with remote 40-GHz local oscillator delivery using a bidirectional semiconductor optical amplifier, is demonstrated experimentally. Successful transmission is achieved with 10.5% and 7.8% error vector magnitude values for the downlink and the uplink directions, respectively.

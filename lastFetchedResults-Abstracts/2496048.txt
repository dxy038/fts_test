In this paper, a new model called connective layer is developed for simulation of linear dynamical behavior of bolted lap joints and model updating in 3D models. Connective layer unifies neighboring zones on sides of common surfaces of substructures in joint region. The constitutive relation of connective elements is defined by decomposing it into its normal and shear components. Unknown and different elastic properties with respect to the neighboring solid elements are defined for connective layer and the unknown parameters of the model are identified by a finite element model updating technique using modal test data. The frequency response of the structure is measured by exciting the structure using an impact hammer. Using an optimization algorithm in ANSYS, the difference between the experimentally measured frequencies and the predictions of the parametric model is minimized as objective function. The connective element performance is demonstrated by application to an actual structure containing a single lap bolted joint coupling two identical aluminum alloy 7075-T651 beams and, finally, comparison of results to those of interface elements. The outcomes of presented model have good correlation with the experimental results. The proposed method predicts the higher mode frequencies which do not participate in model updating process with minimum error in comparison to those of interface element. Due to simplicity, accurate and computationally efficient manner, this model can be incorporated into commercial finite element codes to simulate bolted joints in large and complex structures.

Data processing has been in some way a critical aspect of intelligent data processing systems and decision support systems. Currently, the rapid search for the main factors that influence the objective of the decision or intelligent data processing are used mostly by data analysis, data preprocessing and knowledge discovery, which in our opinion could be employed by the low level decision support or qualitative analysis. We propose a way to bring the primitive data closer to the application and the objective of the decision. The approach relies on the data relativity analysis technique

Large roll motion induced by waves can severely affect the ability of vessels and the speed will loss due to added resistance which caused by ship motions, especially in moderate to high sea states. With increasing needs of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the effect of added resistance on surface ship performance must be considered when a ship fin stabilizer control system is designed. In this paper, we investigate basic principles of added resistance in oblique waves and ship calm water resistance. An alternative approach for reducing speed loss while keeping the satify roll reduction percentage, is proposed by controlling both roll and roll rate at the same time. A double nonlinear generalized minimum variance (NGMV) controller is used for achieving this objective. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated.

Discusses the capabilities of airborne MSS data for classifying forest damage. The objective of this research is to determine if the modified normalized difference (MND) red reflectance edge corresponding to the interpolated MND near-infrared could be a predictor for 3 different species and 4 damage classes almost independently of view angle effect

One objective in the design of VLSI/WSI fault-tolerant processor arrays (FTPA), is to increase the probability of successful reconfiguration in the presence of one or more faults given that a fault has occurred (survivability). This paper reports a comparison of FUSS (Full-Use-of-Suitable-Spares), a recently proposed reconfiguration scheme, with other two well reconfiguration schemes. The results reported were obtained using MGRE (Model Generator and Reliability Evaluator). The models generated, already take into account the survivability rate of each reconfiguration scheme. This factor is obtained via simulation or whenever possible analytical expressions are derived

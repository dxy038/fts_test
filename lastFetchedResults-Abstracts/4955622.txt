In this paper, Differential Evolution based approach with a novel dynamic constraint-handling mechanism is proposed to solve constrained real-parameter optimization. This is implemented by restating the single-objective constrained optimization as a set of single-objective unconstrained problems and dynamically assigning to the individual adaptively as its fitness. Three selection criteria based on feasibility are used to deal with the constraint problem. Moreover, the shirinking acceptable region and local search are added for finding the optimum solution. The approach is tested on a suit of test problems proposed for CEC2010 competition and special session on single objective constrained real-parameter optimization. The results obtained are discussed and some conclusions are made.

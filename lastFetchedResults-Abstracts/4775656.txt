In this paper, we study a Virtual Server Provisioning and Selection (VSPS) problem in distributed Data Centers (DCs) with the objective of minimizing the total operational cost while meeting the service response time requirement.We aim to develop general algorithms for the VSPS problem without assuming a particular queueing model for service processing in each DC. First, we present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation. Then we present a 3-step optimization framework, under which we develop a polynomial-time ln(N)-approximation algorithm (where N is the number of clients) along with a post-optimization procedure for performance improvement. We also show this problem is NP-hard to approximate and is not possible to obtain a better approximation ratio unless NP has TIME(n<sup>O(log log n)</sup>) deterministic time algorithms. In addition, we present an effective heuristic algorithm that jointly obtains the VS provisioning and selection solutions. Extensive simulation results are presented to justify effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

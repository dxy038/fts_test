The clinical efficacy and safety of pitavastatin (NK-104), a novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, during long-term treatment, were examined in 25 patients (male/female=11/14, mean AGE=53±13 (mean±SD) years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). After a period on placebo of >4 weeks, 2 mg/day of pitavastatin was administered for 8 weeks, and the dose was increased to 4 mg/day for up to 104 weeks. Total cholesterol (TC) decreased by 31% from the initial value of 340±57 to 237±40 mg/dl (P<0.0001) at week 8. During treatment with the higher dose, TC decreased even further to 212±35 mg/dl at week 12; it decreased by 37% from the initial value (P<0.0001). Similarly, the baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased by 41% at week 8, and by 49% at week 12, from 267±61 mg/dl at baseline. These findings indicate a dose-dependent effect of the drug on TC and LDL-C concentrations. To examine whether the levels of circulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases: TIMPs) are altered during lipid-lowering therapy, we also measured their plasma levels. The mean levels of MMP-2 and -3 were significantly increased. No significant alteration was found in MMP-9, TIMP-1 and -2 levels. As for the safety of pitavastatin, adverse reactions were observed in one case (4%) of subjective and objective symptoms. The effects of pitavastatin on TC and LDL-C were stable during long treatment of patients with heterozygous FH.

Despite the importance of air–oil slug flows to many industrial applications, their available data reported in the literature are limited compared to air–water slug flows. The main objective of the present study is to explain how air–oil slug flow parameters can be experimentally investigated using hot-film anemometry, capacitance sensors and image processing. Experiments were performed using air–oil slug flow through a horizontal pipe for air superficial velocities ranged from 0.01 m/s to 0.65 m/s and oil superficial velocities ranged from 0.03 m/s to 2.3 m/s. The signal obtained from the hot-film anemometer was used to determine the time-averaged local void fraction and liquid velocity and turbulence intensity for air–oil slug flow. The capacitance signals along with the data obtained by image processing of the flow were used to determine the elongated bubble length and velocity. The measurements techniques used found to describe in detail the internal structure of the slug flow. Finally, the experimental results were compared to existing models and correlations.

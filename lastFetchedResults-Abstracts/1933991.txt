The objective of the study was to evaluate cytometrically the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic spermatozoa in fresh semen of silver foxes in the breeding season. In males F3 and F4 with high percentages of early apoptotic (A+Pi−), late apoptotic (A+Pi+) and necrotic (A−Pi+) spermatozoa as well as 56–65% of living spermatozoa (A−Pi−) with progressive motility, the semen was characterised by reduced fertility. In males F1 and F2 with spermatozoa showing the motility and viability of 89–90% and high percentages of living cells that do not bind Annexin V and propidium iodide, the semen was assessed as valuable and useful for artificial insemination. Amongst 16 females of group I and II inseminated with semen from F1 and F2 males, 15 (93.75%) had multi-cub litters – on average 6.1 and 4.8, respectively. In contrast, amongst 16 females of group III and IV inseminated with semen from F3 and F4 males, only 10 (62.5%) had litters with few cubs (on average 2.6 in group III and 2.1 in group IV). Our findings explicitly indicate that semen of farm male foxes should be evaluated before the breeding season, as one of the causes of reproduction failures is likely to be a high percentage of apoptotic and necrotic spermatozoa. Thanks to flow cytometry, fresh ejaculates can be speedily evaluated and their usefulness for artificial insemination determined.

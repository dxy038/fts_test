Mobile learning is related to and embedded in the learnerspsila situational context. Contrasting representational notions of context as established in ubiquitous computing as well as phenomenological notions of context as the generation of subjective meaning, we propose a dialectical and learner-oriented view. Learning is expansion into a context where meaning-making practices and objective opportunities for development relate. Implications of this notion for learner-centered design will be discussed within two application scenarios. Both provide opportunities for learners to expand their abilities for engagement in a given environment, one involving portable devices, and the other relying on embedded systems.

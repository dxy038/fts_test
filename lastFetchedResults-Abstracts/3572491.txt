A novel structure using recursive nonsymmetric half-plane (NSHP) digital allpass filters (DAFs) is presented for designing 2-D recursive digital filters. First, several important properties of 2-D recursive DAFs with NSHP support regions for filter coefficients are investigated. The stability of the 2-D recursive NSHP DAFs is guaranteed by using a spectral factorization-based algorithm. Then, the important characteristics regarding the proposed novel structure are discussed. The design problem of 2-D recursive digital filters using the novel structure is considered. We formulate the problem by forming an objective function consisting of the weighted sum of magnitude, group delay, and stability-related errors. A design technique using a trust-region Newton-conjugate gradient method in conjunction with the analytic derivatives of the objective function is presented to efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem. The novelty of the presented 2-D structure is that it possesses the advantage of better performance in designing a variety of 2-D recursive digital filters over existing 2-D filter structures. Finally, several design examples are provided for conducting illustration and comparison.

Power system control areas within three major (and essentially separate) areas of North America are interconnected electrically, thus enjoying vastly improved reliability and economy of operation compared to operating in isolation. Each must continually balance load, interchange and generation to minimize adverse influence on neighboring control areas and interconnection frequency. This requires investment in control systems and the sacrifice of some fuel conversion efficiencies to achieve the objective of complying with minimum control performance standards set by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC). Control also increases wear and tear on machinery in the pursuit of these goals. Area control area (ACE) diversity interchange (ADI) offers a means of reducing this control burden without undue investment or sacrifice by any participant in a group. This paper describes the philosophy of ADI and the ENEREX partnershipÂ´s favorable experiences with its actual implementation in Iowa

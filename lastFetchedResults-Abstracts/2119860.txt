The objective of this work is to obtain electrical semi-conducting composites of polypyrrol-poly(vinyl alcohol) PPy-PVA, prepared with ultraviolet radiation in the presence of iron-arene salt, which acts as photoinitiator, and using methanol as solvent. The photopolymerization of Py inside PVA matrix produces black composites, which is a characteristic of the PPy in the conducting form. Conductivity studies have shown that these composites depend on the nature and initiator concentration, the UV light exposure doses and the PPy concentration in the matrix. Preliminary results of the electrical conductivity PPy-PVA composites carried out by the Coleman method showed values ranging from 10−6 to 10−5 S/cm without using external dopants.

This paper presents a &#8220;Ming-style Computational Model&#8221; for the computer-supported Ming-style learning system. In the traditional style learning paradigm, a student was supposed to learn by reading, drawing and making. To provide a more intuitive and feasible way for learning, we try to use shape grammar to present the analytical and generative style and give students the ability to analyze existing Ming-style and to generate new designs. In this paper, we use &#8220;Hu men&#8221; as an example to illustrate how to summarize the relationship between style and form and represent it with a set of rules which can help students learn style through an objective way in the style learning system. Some issues related to style learning system also discussed for future research.

This study aims to develop a force-reflecting macro-micro teleoperator. Force-reflection is significantly important in complex teleoperations. Due to the transmission delay, it is very difficult to ensure stability. Accordingly, in this paper, the controllers are designed based on the framework of H<sub>&#8734;</sub> theory. In general an objective of the scaling problem is to magnify the scale of the micro environment, with minimal loss of physical information. However, in this study a human oriented scaling (personal scaling) is suggested

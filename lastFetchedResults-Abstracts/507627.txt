Introduction and objective: Seroepidemiological studies have shown a significant difference in seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) and its outcome. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of HP infection in a normal population (patient's visitors) and to determine frequency of some risk factors of this infectious agent. 
Materials and methods: Cardiac visitors in Razi hospital in Ahvaz were tested for the presence of anti HP-IgG by ELISA assay. Frequency of risk factors for HP acquisition in HP seropositive individuals was studied. 
Results: The studied subjects included 96 persons with mean age of 58.03 Â±11.53 years in whom 52% were females. Fifty five (61.1%) persons presented a positive result for anti HP-IgG test 
Conclusion: HP Seropositivity was not affected by age, sex and residential area. Crowding was the most important risk factors for HP acquisition.

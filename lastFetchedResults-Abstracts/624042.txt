The main objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between the fiscal
performance of the state governments in Malaysia with the political and institutional
environment within which they evolve. The focus of our analysis is the inter-governmental
transfer system which constitutes an essential part of any inter-governmental and
decentralised system. More particularly, we analysed the impact of federal grants on state
governmentsâ€™ fiscal efficiency. Indeed, the general observation of a continuous deterioration
in the financial situation in Malaysia bring us to question if the state governments are
making sufficient efforts to exploit all the revenue sources that are in their hands. And one
may wonder if the inter-governmental grants system is one of the causes of state governments
slackening in their tax efforts. Fiscal effort is measured by the amount of taxes collected by
the state government and the impact of federal grants on fiscal efforts is assessed by using
the stochastic frontier analysis methodology. The advantage of using this method is that it
allows us to obtain estimates of both efficiency level as well as the determinants of the
efficiency level.

The objective of this study was to investigate on the effect of mixing intensity (G) and mixing duration (td) on struvite precipitation in the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) wastewater generated from the semiconductor manufacturing process. Batch-scale experiments revealed that struvite crystallization was affected by both G and td. The mixing effect was to enhance the mass transfer of solute to the crystals in the process, resulting in the improvement of struvite crystallization and growth. By forming struvite, removal efficiencies of N and P increased logarithmic with the multiple values of G and td, i.e., Gtd. Insufficient mixing energy with the Gtd value less than 105 caused an increase in the formation potential of unexpected precipitate unlike to pure struvite, causing a decrease in removal efficiencies of N and P in the process. At the Gtd value over 106, struvite precipitation was not restricted by fluoride, of which high level inherently contained in the CMP wastewater. The study results can be taken into consideration in the design and operation of the struvite precipitation process for both nutrient (N and P) removal and recovery.

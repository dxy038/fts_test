The objective of the present study was to test the concentrations of some elements in the transplanted lichen Usnea amblyoclada transplanted in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, and to investigate the relative air quality of the area as indicated by a Pollution Index. Analyses of Cu, Co, Pb, Fe, Ni, Mn, S and Zn in addition to analyses of physiological parameters were performed after the transplantation period. No significant differences were observed among the sampling stations for the physiological parameters, except the dry weight/fresh weight ratio. The concentration of most elements was similar to or lower than those found in non-polluted and even polluted areas. The significant correlation found between Cu, Pb and Zn with the content of hydroperoxy conjugated dienes suggests an important oxidative effect probably caused by these ions. The distribution patterns of the elements were quite similar, with maximum values around a cement plant and the metallurgical industries. The Pollution Index distribution pattern does not coincide with the elements distribution, due to the fact that the index values probably reflected the emissions of gaseous phytotoxic pollutants.

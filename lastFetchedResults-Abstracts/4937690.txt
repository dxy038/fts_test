The objective of this paper is to implement a mixed mode TLM-SPICE algorithm that allows the full wave modeling of linear, non-linear devices and the electromagnetic interaction among them. The simulation domain can be subdivided into subdomains and within each subdomain one different numerical method can be applied. The Network Theory for electromagnetic fields introduced by states that is possible to represent the connection between different subdomains using the the relation of the tangential field components on both sides of a boundary that divide the domains.

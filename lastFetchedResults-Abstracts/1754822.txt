Objective
jective was to assess the prevalence of panic disorder, its influence on quality of life (QoL), and the presence of further anxiety and depressive comorbid disorders in outpatients with chronic heart failure (CHF).
s
ross-sectional study, anxiety and depressive disorders were diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition diagnostic criteria in patients with CHF who were aged ≥18 years and had New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classes I–IV, using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Health-related QoL was evaluated using the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36).
s
 258 participating patients, 24 (9.3%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for panic disorder. Seven of these (29.2%) were diagnosed with comorbid anxiety disorders, 11 (47.3%) were diagnosed with comorbid depressive disorder, and 5 (20.8%) were diagnosed with other anxiety disorders and any depressive disorder. Female gender [odds ratio (OR)=3.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.2–7.8; P=.02] and a lower level of education (OR=0.3; 95% CI=0.1–0.9; P=.04) were associated with the presence of panic disorder. In patients with panic disorder, QoL was significantly more restricted on all subscales of the SF-36 as compared to those without panic disorder, even when age, gender, and NYHA functional class were controlled for (P=.05 to &lt;.01).
sion
imately 1 of 10 patients with CHF suffers from panic disorder, many of whom also have additional anxiety or depressive comorbid disorders. Female gender and a low level of education are positively associated with the presence of panic disorder. QoL is severely limited by the presence of panic disorder. Diagnosis of mental disorders and treatment offers for affected patients should be available in patient care.

Context: The growth of managed care has spurred re-evaluation of the roles and responsibilities of public health agencies and private health plans for providing public health services. Although rates of curable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the United States are the highest in the developed world, many clinicians and managed care organizations are not systematically providing high-quality, comprehensive STD-related services to their patients and the community.
Objective: To examine issues around managed care and STD prevention as a model for overcoming barriers that impede managed care organizations from providing comprehensive public health services and collaborating with health agencies.
Setting: Two-day invitational workshop.
Participants: Representatives from 18 health plans, 10 public health agencies, 6 academic institutions, 1 purchasing coalition, and 5 other health organizations.
Results: Major obstacles include: turnover and heterogeneity in the health care system; deficiencies in clinical knowledge and skills; differences in organizational culture and language; low priority of STDs; inadequate public health surveillance data and performance measures; confidentiality concerns; and lack of coverage for sex partners.
Conclusions: Potential approaches for addressing these barriers include: requiring that STD-related services be covered by Medicaid managed care programs; implementing performance measures; requiring collaborative activities; promoting education of and outreach to stakeholders; funding of pilot projects; and researching the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of STD-related services for various populations.

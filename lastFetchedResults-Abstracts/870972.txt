A Mond]Weir type dual for a class of nondifferentiable multiobjective variational
problems in which every component of the objective function contains a
term involving the square root of a certain positive semidefinite quadratic form, is
considered and various duality results, viz. weak, strong, and converse duality
theorems, are developed for conditionally properly efficient solutions. These results
are obtained under V-invexity assumptions and its generalizations on objective
and constraint functions. This work extends many results on variational
problems established earlier.

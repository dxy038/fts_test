Focusing on a particular feature, the ability to create random rhythms, our study is aimed at the analysis of cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia, comparing them with normal subjects. We have developed a new cognitive test using methods from nonlinear dynamical systems theory, with the objective of measuring the subjectÂ´s capacity of developing a random rhythm.

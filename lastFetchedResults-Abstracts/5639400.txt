In order to evaluate urban public traffic system, an ideal interval method is presented. It is develop through improving a multiple objective decision making ideal point method. The indexes weight is decided by the variation coefficient of the value of evaluated indexes of urban public traffic system standard, the new ideal interval model is proposed and applied to evaluate urban public traffic system, the concept of attribute measure interval and attribute interval recognition theoretical model are presented. The used process and the reliability of the new method are explained by real survey urban public traffic system data of one city. The evaluating results validates the new mode is feasibility in synthesis evaluating urban public traffic system. It will offer scientific reference for instructing and controlling urban traffic by government.

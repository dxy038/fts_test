Trabeculectomy success rate among Asians is not too promising. Thus, a survival analysis among our local population is very important to help future strategy of glaucoma patient management. Objective: To determine the five year trabeculectomy success rate among glaucoma patient treated at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. Methodology: A retrospective record review study was conducted involving 96 glaucoma patients (96 eyes) who underwent trabeculectomy from 1<sup>st</sup> January 1990 to 31<sup>st</sup> July 2006. Additional follow up of one year after the recruitment of the study subjects was done from 1<sup>st</sup> August 2006 to 31<sup>st</sup> July 2007. All patients who fulfilled the selections criteria were included in the study. The medical records were reviewed by a single researcher with the help of senior consultant of ophthalmology and important information on the variables of interest and trabeculectomy outcome status were collected and recorded into a clinic form. The Kaplan Meire analysis was used in statistical analysis. Results: The median trabeculectomy success time was 18.8 months and the overall trabeculectomy success rate was 36.1% (95% CI:25.6; 46.8) at five year. The patients without ocular surgery [42.2% (95% CI:30.3; 53.5)] demonstrated higher trabeculectomy success rate compared to those with previous ocular surgery [0% (95% CI: 0; 0)] prior to trabeculectomy at five year post trabeculectomy and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.008).Conclusion: Trabeculectomy success rate for glaucoma patients at HUSM was acceptably low. The used of antimetabolites during trabeculectomy is highly recommended in our population especially those with previous ocular surgery.

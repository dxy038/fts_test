We discuss a non-preemptive single-machine job sequencing problem where the objective is to minimize the sum of squared deviation of completion times of jobs from a common due date. There are three versions of the problemâ€”tightly restricted, restricted and unrestricted. Separate dynamic programming formulations have already been suggested for each of these versions, but no unified approach is available. We have proposed a pseudo-polynomial DP solution and a polynomial heuristic for general instance. Computational results show that tightly restricted instances of up to 600 jobs can be solved in less than View the MathML source. General instances of up to 80 jobs take less than View the MathML source.

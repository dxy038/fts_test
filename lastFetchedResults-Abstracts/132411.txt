Background: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients, as well as hospitalized patients, which show an increasing rate of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. The objective of this study was to compare the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial sensitivity and resistance of uropathogens in 1996 and 2000 in Kerman city.
Materials and Methods: Urine sample of 300 patients in 1996 and 251 patients in 2000 which were referred to Kerman medical laboratories, were collected randomly and cultured and uropathogens were identified. Antibacterial sensitivity was tested against 8 antibacterials using disc-diffusion technique.
Results: The prevalence of urinary infection was higher in women (85.7%). Escherichia coli (73.7% in 2000) was the most frequent pathogen isolated, followed by Enterobacter; Klebsiella spp, Pseudomonas spp, Staphylococcus, and Proteus spp. Among the E.coli isolates, only ciprofloxacin constitute reasonable therapeutic option for treatment of UTI in Kerman city (91.8% sensitive). High resistance rates to ampicillin (91.1%), co-trimoxazole (66.5%) and gentamicin (63.3%) were observed a gainst the E.coli. Against Klebsiella spp, infections, the only therapeutic option was ciprofloxacin (100% sensitivie). Klebsiella spp, showed high resistance rates to ampicillin (94.4%), gentamicin (68.4%) and nitrofurantoin (68.4%). Enterobacter isolates were completely sensitive to ciprofloxacin, but showed high resistance to gentamicin (73.5%) and co-trimoxazole (68.6%). The resistance of urinary infections agents to gentamin was found higher in the year 2000 compare to the year 1996.
Conclusion: the results of this study showed that Ecoli was the most frequent uropathogen isolated in Kerman city which exhibit high resistance to most commonly used antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin was `the most reasonable therapeutic option for treatment of UTI. Also the resistance rate to commonly used antibiotics in the year 2000 was comparable to 1996, except for gentamicin which showed a significant increase in bacterial resistance.

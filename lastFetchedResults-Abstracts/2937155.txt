This paper presents multidisciplinary research and curriculum efforts at the University of Missouri-Rolla in the smart structures area. The primary objective of our project is to integrate research results with curriculum development for the benefit of students in electrical, and mechanical and aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics. The approach to the accomplishment of curriculum objectives is the development of a two-course sequence in the smart structures area with an integrated laboratory. The research portion of the project addresses structural identification and robust control methods for smart structures. A brief summary of the research results and a description of curriculum development in the smart structures area are described in this paper

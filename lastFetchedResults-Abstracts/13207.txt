Human Body Model ESD tests on two commercially available different types of wavelength division multiplexing bidirectional optoelectronic modules, intended for data transmission over multimode optical fibers at 820 and 1320 nm wavelengths, have been performed. These bidirectional modules incorporated pin diode receivers and light emitting diode in a single package. In particular, the 820 nm light emitting diodes had rather high damage threshold pulse amplitudes of about + 10,000 V under forward bias and -5000 V under reverse bias conditions, and no active layer degradation has been observed. In-situ measurements of the optical transients emitted during forward bias ESD pulses enabled a damage pulse threshold detection of a LED without the need of further optoelectronic characterization. The receiver photodiodes, however, were very sensitive to reverse bias ESD pulses. The InGaAs photodiodes degraded during ESD pulses with amplitudes as low as -150 V and in the case of the Silicon photodiodes as low as -175 V. Â© 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

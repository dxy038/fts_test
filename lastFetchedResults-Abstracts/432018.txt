A 48-year-old man presented with pain in his left shoulder radiating to the left scapula and a tingling sensation of the left arm with involvement of the fourth and fifth finger. Based on the clinical and radiologic findings, the diagnosis of Pancoast tumor of the left lung was made. Computed tomographic guided fine needle biopsy was not conclusive. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed to obtain a biopsy. The histologic and microbiologic examinations established the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB).

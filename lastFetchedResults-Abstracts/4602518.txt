In this paper, the service restoration problem has been formulated as a multi-objective, multi-constrained, and combinatorial optimization problem. The preferential knowledge of the various objective functions considered herein is known a priori. The first objective function (minimization of out-of-service area) has been kept at the first preference. The objective function of minimization of manually controlled switch operations has been kept at the second preference and that of minimization of remotely controlled switch operations has been kept at the third preference. Finally, the objective function of minimization of losses has been kept at the fourth preference. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is applied in solving the service restoration problem in an electric power distribution system. In contrast to the single objective function optimization approach, it does good in solving conflicting objective functions and constraints in the service restoration problem. And due to the introduction of front formation and elitism, the approach has a faster speed and reduced complexity.

Nowadays, the advance and enhance in competitive area, convert the supply chain management into one of the most important issues for industries, organization, and firms. Increasing the quality of products, decreasing the costs, and representing the satisfying service are the primary objectives of organization and managers. Apart from that, the amount of CNGs (such as CO2) has been raised by industrial activities. Therefore, the concern of air pollution motivates managers and researchers to consider this issue in the process. This paper represents a multi objective supply chain network fuzzy programming, which is multi product, multi period, multi-layer, and has reverse product network. Operational risks are considered as deficiency in suppliers’ units and production center. The model’s duty is to choose the optimal suppliers based on different factors such as selling price, the average of deficiency and transportation costs. In order to solve the model, the Jimenez and TH approach are used and for large-scale problems, the paper uses the NSGA-II algorithm.

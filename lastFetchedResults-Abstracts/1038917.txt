Oscillating turbulent channel flow with heat transfer has been investigated by use of large eddy simulation (LES) technique. Three-dimensional filtered Navier–Stokes and energy equations are numerically solved by fractional-step method. Dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) models for the turbulent SGS stresses and heat fluxes are employed to closure the governing equations. The objective of this study is to examine the reliability of the LES technique for predicting the turbulent oscillatory heat transfer and to analyze the behavior of turbulent heat diffusion from a solid boundary to the adjacent oscillatory shear flow. In this study, oscillating turbulent channel flow with a constant difference of temperature imposed on both the walls is calculated for the Prandtl number (Pr) from 0.1 up to 100 and the Reynolds number (Reτ) 350 based on the friction velocity and the half-width of the channel. The frequency of driving pressure gradient for the oscillating turbulent channel flow ranges low, medium and high values. Some typical turbulence statistical quantities and structures of velocity and temperature fluctuations are analyzed.

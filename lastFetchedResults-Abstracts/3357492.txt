The planning is one of the most important cognitive functions of the human beings. It is essential for the solution of mental and physical problems. This paper shows a conceptual and computational model of motor planning. It is based on recent findings of the human brain and how the human can develop several motor plans in order to solve their daily problems. The objective of our bio-inspired model is to develop appropriate mechanisms to endow virtual creatures with them, in order to emulate both internal and external processes of the human brain.

Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis usually infects the lungs; however, organs other than the lungs may also be involved. This study is an analysis of the situation of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis in the Markazi province, Iran.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the information in the registration software of tuberculosis in health centers was collected and SPSS software 16 was applied to data analysis.
Results: In the survey, a total of 1787 TB patients were identified, of whom 24.2% were diagnosed with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and 1.9 % of the patients with extra-pulmonary TB were associated with HIV infection. Female to male sex ratio was equal to 1.3. Overall, 82.5% of the patients were Iranian and mean age of patients were 43.3 years. Tuberculosis of the lymph nodes and skeletal and pleural tuberculosis had the highest prevalence. Moreover, extra-pulmonary tuberculosis in females, aged 15-55 years, was more and the diagnosis delay was more common in extra-pulmonary tuberculosis while relapse occurred more frequently in pulmonary tuberculosis.
Conclusion: Noticing the greater diagnosis delay in extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, it is necessary to train physicians and other healthcare workers in extra-pulmonary TB diagnosis and more planning needed for instructing it.

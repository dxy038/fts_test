Objective this study was investigating the effects of 4 weeks plyometric training on serum Brain Derived Nerotrophic Factor (BDNF) concentration of active men. Participants were 14 physical education students that randomly divided in two groups: experimental (n=7) and control group (n=7). experimental group performed 4 week plyometric training consist of scissor jump, lateral hop, box jump, diagonal hop, power skipping, speed skipping. Blood samples were taken in fasting state before and after training in order to measurement brain derived nerotrophic factor. BDNF measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Data was analyzed using dependent t test. Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05. No significant effect of 4 weeks plyometric training session was found on serum BDNF concentration, (P < 0/812). But vertical jumping did showed significant changes (P < 0/007). 4 weeks plyometric training doesnâ€™t have any effect on serum BDNF of active men but vertical jumping significantly increase. It seems that our training protocol may not be long or intensive enough to create a change in BDNF concentration.

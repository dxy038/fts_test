The objective of this investigation is to determine the best means of processing the power from remotely placed batteries or fuel cells to power sensors and communication devices having very light, steady state loads and much heavier short duration pulse loads. This paper discusses the requirements, interface characteristics, and problem areas associated with various approaches and illustrates the most favorable approach, push-pull converter-pulse width modulation, and the results obtained.

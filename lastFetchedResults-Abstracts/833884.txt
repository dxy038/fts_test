This paper describes the thermal problem and presents the experimental data for validation. The thermal problem involves validating a model for heat conduction in a solid. The mathematical model is based on one-dimensional, linear heat conduction in a solid slab, with heat flux boundary conditions. Experimental data from a series of material characterization, validation, and accreditation experiments related to the mathematical model are provided. The objective is to use the series of experiments to assess the model, and then use the model to predict regulatory performance relative to a regulatory requirement. The regulatory requirement is defined in terms of the probability that a surface temperature not exceed a specified temperature at the regulatory conditions.

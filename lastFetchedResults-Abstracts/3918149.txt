In this work we extend the existing concept of De- Noise and Forward (DNF) for bidirectional relaying to utilise non-coherent modulation schemes. This is done in order to avoid the requirement of phase tracking in coherent detection. As an example BFSK is considered, and through analysis the decision regions for the denoise operation in DNF are identified. The throughput performance of BFSK in DNF is compared to BPSK.

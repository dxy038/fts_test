Objective
m of this study was to establish the reaction kinetics of 35% hydrogen peroxide and sodium ascorbate and to determine the mass of antioxidant required to neutralize the bleaching gel.
s
thod used to quantify sodium ascorbate was based on the United States Pharmacopeia (1995)26. Oxidationâ€“reduction titration was used to confirm the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and sodium ascorbate and to determine the reaction kinetics between them.
s
sults indicated a direct correlation between the mass of hydrogen peroxide and that of the antioxidant agent. In addition, 5 min of contact was sufficient to neutralize the hydrogen peroxide used.
sion
n vitro study showed that the amount of sodium ascorbate required for reduction of hydrogen peroxide is directly related to the concentration of the latter. In addition, the reaction kinetics between oxidant and antioxidant showed that a longer application time for sodium ascorbate does not influence the effectiveness of the reaction and that 5 min is sufficiently long for this antioxidant to exert an antioxidant effect.

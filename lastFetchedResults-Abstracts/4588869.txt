We present the design and development of a serious game about &#8221;Transmilenio&#8221;, a public transportation system based on articulated buses. The objective of the game is to create awareness about the expected behavior of users within the system. Initially, and in order to maintain a high degree of interaction and fun while keeping the educational side of the game, we modeled the driverÂ´s perspective, from which one can observe the mistakes that are made by pedestrians as well as drivers. The final results were satisfying as they show that the game was interesting for players and that awareness was raised regarding the rules and procedures of the system.

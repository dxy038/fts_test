In this paper the design of the one cycle controller of a single stage inverter for photovoltaic applications is carried out by means of a multi-objective strategy, in order to optimize the inverter performances at both high and low insolation levels. Design constraints keeping into account the different possible weather conditions are adopted. The optimization algorithm also provides useful information concerning the system sensitivity with respect to each one of the controller parameters. This allows to design a maximum power point tracking perturb and observe controller that significantly improves the inverter performances. Experimental measurements confirm the predictions of theoretical and simulation results.

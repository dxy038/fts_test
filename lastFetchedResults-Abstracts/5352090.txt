Main objective of this research is to develop a medical tele-analyzer. The developed system consists of 2 subsystems; doctor-side subsystem and patient-side subsystem. In the doctor side subsystem, an array of displacement sensor is equipped to detect movement of doctor hand and fingers. The detected information is transmitted to the patient side to be used in medical disease analysis. On the other hand, the patient-side subsystem consists of an array of displacement actuators which is used to follow displacement of doctor hand and fingers. An array of force sensors is used to detect forces between patient and the equipment. Since the analysis and control need real time operation, the desired communication channel has to be direct-line type. Not only using in medical tele-analysis, the proposed system can also be used in any tele-force-displacement controls of industrial processes.

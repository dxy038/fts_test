The paper addresses the problem of expanding the capacity of large-scale distribution networks for secure operation under generation uncertainty. The problem is formulated as a stochastic decision problem. For radial distribution networks the power-flow is monotonic with the generation profile. This monotonicity property is applied to convert the stochastic problem formulation into a two-scenario under uncertainty formulation. The two-scenario problem is then solved with an evolutionary hedging process. The algorithm is designed to solve multiple-scenario multiple-objective problems, providing the optimal set of investments together with first-order information on the robustness credit of each investment. An example is presented to illustrate the algorithm and its results

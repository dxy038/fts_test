The laws concerning food industry follow one or two general objectives in order to protect human life and health, customers' interests, the use of correct practice in food trade and taking into account, whenever necessary, the protection of animals' health and wellbeing, plants and environment protection.Food laws deal with free trade of food and animal manufactured food and with food trade according to general principles and requirements.When making and adopting food laws, existing international standards should be taken into consideration, except the case when these standards or elements of these standards are not going to be efficient or proper in order to achieve the objectives of the legislation, or when there is a scientific motivation, or if these standards can determine a certain level ofprotection different from the one adopted in the community. In order to achieve the general objective concerning the insurance of a high level of protection of human life and health, food laws are based on risks evaluation, apart the case when this approach is not suitable for the circumstances or the nature of that regulation .Risks evaluation is based on scientific information available, and is done independent, with objectivity, and transparency.Risks management takes into account the results of risks evaluation and the opinions of Animals and Food Safety Agency, other relevant factors for risks management and precaution principle. In those special cases when after the evaluation of the existing information is identified the possibility of side effects over health, but there is a scientific uncertainty, can be adopted temporal measures of risk management necessary to insure a high level of health protection, until new scientific information is providedfor a complete evaluation of the risk.The measures will be taken according to the possible side effects and will not restrain the food trade more than necessary to insure a high level of protection for health considering technical and economic possibilities and also other relevant factors.These measures are reexamined in between a reasonable period of time, that depends both on the nature of the risk for life or health and on the type of scientific information necessary to clarify scientific uncertainty and to completely evaluate the risks.

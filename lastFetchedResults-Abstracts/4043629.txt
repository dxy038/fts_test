We have examined an optimization approach to iterative control design. The important ingredient is that the gradient of the design criterion is computed from measured closed loop data. The approach is thus not model-based. The scheme converges to a stationary point of the design criterion under the assumption of boundedness of the signals in the loop. From a practical viewpoint, the scheme offers several advantages. It is straightforward to apply. It is possible to control the rate of change of the controller in each iteration. The objective can be manipulated between iterations in order to tighten or loosen performance requirements. Certain frequency regions can be emphasized if desired. This direct optimal tuning algorithm is particularly well suited for the tuning of the basic control loops in the process industry, which are typically PID loops. These primary loops are often very badly tuned, making the application of more advanced (for example, multivariable) techniques rather useless. A first requirement in the successful application of advanced control techniques is that the primary loops be tuned properly. This new technique appears to be a very practical way of doing this, with an almost automatic procedure

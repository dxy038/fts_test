The main objective of this paper is to show new possibilities of wireless communication for mobile robotic and industrial units in the real time. The means of using wireless communication networks based on parallel processing and data transfer for various network topologies are discussed here. We have been focusing our research on ultra low power communication chips based on frequency 2.4 GHz. Furthermore we have shown procedures for creation of the network communication nodes with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. The nodes are designed as embedded mobile devices. With regards to data transfer communication there are modulation, security and protocols presented. The contribution shows similar problems that can possibly occur when we use multiple transfer sources at the same time on the close area, which is quite difficult to avoid when we design embedded devices.

In this paper, we propose a novel routing algorithm for maritime monitoring of short term events where large area monitoring relies on small buoys drifting along with local currents. The objective of this algorithm is to improve communication where scalable mobile networks are optimized by taking into consideration a weight function based on remaining energy and relative distance between buoys. To improve wide area communication, amplified transmitters were selected. Therefore route optimization requires a different approach, as transmission requires more power than reception. We present two new approaches for message routing, where relay selection depends on a weight advertised periodically, and calculated through remaining energy and route distance to sink. The first approach uses a single route, while the second approach balances its load by using different routes selected in proportion to route weight. In both cases, the algorithms show improvements over single-hop and greedy approaches. Moreover, the second solution shows a more efficient message distribution through relay nodes that ultimately results in lower latency.

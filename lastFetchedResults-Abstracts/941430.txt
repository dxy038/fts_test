Accumulation of cadmium, mercury, lead, copper and zinc was studied in muscle, liver and kidney of 9 adult and 7 juvenile
arctic hares (Lepus arcticus), collected in 2003 in the southwestern part of Nunavut, Canada. Our objective was to determine
the level of heavy metal accumulation, and distribution among age groups and tissue. Concentrations of all metals varied
among tissues, and concentrations of Cd, Hg and Zn were higher in adults compared to juveniles. We found correlations in
metal content among tissues, and among metals in kidneys. We also found the hares to have low concentration of most heavy
metals except cadmium. We suggest that the high cadmium levels might be caused by the local geology, and the hares being
adapted to these levels. The low levels of the other metals are probably due to low input of atmospheric contaminants. Only
one of the individuals had Cd content slightly above the maximum contaminant levels recommended for human consumption
of meat. There were no levels in meat above the recommended maximum for the rest of the metals surveyed. However the Cd
levels in liver and kidney are orders of magnitude higher than the recommended maximum, and consumption of these organs
should be avoided.

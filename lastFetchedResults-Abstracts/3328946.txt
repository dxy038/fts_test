The objective of this paper is to present a two-step method for automatic generation of operation screens of distribution systems. The first step consists of reduction of the graph representing the network, based on filtering criteria that determine which elements should and which should not be preserved in the diagrams, as well as which parts of the network should be simplified and represented by equivalent elements. The second part is the automatic layout of the reduced graph according to general aesthetic criteria commonly found in the available literature and specific criteria adopted for this work by the team of operators of an actual network in an electric utility in Brazil, chosen as pilot project on which the results of the method will be presented.

The paper presents an HEVC-based deblocking filter that improves perceptual quality of reconstructed video on the content that exhibits a lot of chaotic motion, such as water, fire or smoke while providing similar quality on &#8220;normal&#8221; video content, such as the content with linear motion. The filter is also capable of efficiently suppressing block artifacts in smooth areas with slowly changing samples intensity. The objective performance of the proposed deblocking filter is on average similar to the HEVC deblocking.

The load - generation balance is the No. 1. Rule of the power system operation. The increasing power demand requires better exploitation of the existing system. To reach this objective a possible method is the decrease of the peak/valley ratio of the daily load curve. We dig in depth how new DSM capabilities can be found. The traditional ripple control cannot be extended on a lot of programmable household appliances, like the washing machine, refrigerator, tumble drier, etc. We also investigated typical households and found great voluntary control potential. The paper presents different analysis techniques, measurement results and gives a structure to move these loads into the ldquosmoothrdquo DSM.

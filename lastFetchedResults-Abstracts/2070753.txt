Objective: Ovarian and follicle transplantation may preserve fertility in young cancer survivors.
In this study, we have transplanted preantral follicles using fibrin gel as a carrier
and fibrin gel supplemented with platelet lysate (PL) as a rich source of angiogenic and
growth factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of fibrin gel and PL in
follicle transplantation.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, ovaries were taken from 14-dayold
Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice. Preantral follicles were dissected
from the ovaries and encapsulated into fibrin gel supplemented with 5, 10, 15 or 20%
PL, then transplanted back into the same donor mice. Fibrin gels supplemented with
PL that contained preantral follicles were placed in a subcutaneous pocket in the
back of the neck of the recipient, donor mouse (the same mouse that follicles were
collected). After 14 days the grafts were processed and embedded in paraffin blocks,
then serially sectioned for histological evaluation. We counted the follicles and classified
them according to stage (preantral or antral). Data were presented as mean ±
standard error of mean (SEM) and analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the
Kruskal-Wallistest.
Results: The mean percentage of recovered follicles encapsulated and transplanted
in each group were 33.30 ± 2.47 (fibrin gel), 31.96 ± 1.90 (fibrin gel+5% PL), 34.02
± 2.44 (fibrin gel+10% PL), 48.31 ± 2.06 (fibrin gel+15% PL) and 17.60 ± 2.79 (fibrin
gel+20% PL). There was a signi?cant increase in the recovery rate of grafted follicles
with fibrin gel+15% PL (48.31%; p < 0.001). The percentage of preantral follicles
showed no significant difference in all groups (p < 0.05). The percentage of antral follicles
showed a significant decrease in follicles grafted with fibrin gel+20% PL when
compared to the other groups (11.77%; p < 0.005) but no significant difference was
observed in the other groups.
Conclusion: The use of PL in follicle transplantation can improve ovarian follicular
survival rate.

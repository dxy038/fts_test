In a wireless sensor network, it is necessary to have control over the network topology, to enhance its lifetime and scalability. The objective of this work is to design layered architecture. The architecture is based on hierarchical based clustering. The link weight based enabled protocol has been proposed in this paper. This proposed protocol not only considers the residual energy but also the distance of nodes with base station and connectivity of the nodes i.e. (nodes degree). The aim of this work is to enhance lifetime of the wireless sensor network, scalability and balance distribution of clusters. Moreover, we have also compared the results with other heirarchical based existing apporaches. The results show the viability and efficacy of this proposed layer architecture.

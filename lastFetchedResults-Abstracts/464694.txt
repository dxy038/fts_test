OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the clinical significance of ultrasonographically diagnosed fetal wrist position anomalies. STUDY DESIGN: The relationship of the fetal hand to the forearm was prospectively evaluated in all second- and third-trimester scans over a 5-year period. If an abnormal wrist position was detected, a targeted scan, including echocardiography, was performed. The outcomes of abnormal pregnancies were obtained. RESULTS: An abnormal relationship of the hand to the forearm was found in 22 fetuses in 27,467 scans. Nine had a normal karyotype, and 13 had an abnormal karyotype. Among the nine with normal chromosomes, three had evidence of a movement disorder. Three with normal karyotypes are alive; two of these are the only normally functioning survivors. They had no other major anomalies and were shown prenatally to have normal movement of the limbs. CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal fetal wrist position is associated with a high incidence of karyotype and movement abnormalities. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;174:1834-9.)

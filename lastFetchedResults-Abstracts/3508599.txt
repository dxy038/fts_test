Some aspects of the development of a modern engineering graphics course for first-year engineering students are described. The objective of the course is to teach students the graphic presentation of 2-D and 3-D data, to give an understanding of the graphic-user/computer communication, and to apply these concepts efficiently to engineering problems. The course covers the mathematical principles of 2-D and 3-D data representation and the hardware and software components of a graphic system, and it includes a wide range of laboratory exercises to illustrate the concepts covered in the lecture. Some examples of student work are given

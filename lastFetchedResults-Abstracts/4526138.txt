The use of multiple paths to route data between two end points provides various advantages by efficiently utilizing the underlying network resources. Prior research work has focused on the use of multiple paths with the objective of maximizing the end-to-end QoS such as bandwidth. Another category of work has proposed solutions for computing disjoint paths for fault-tolerance. In this work, we investigate the problem of maximizing the total bandwidth from disjoint paths. The solution to this problem combines the two main advantage of exploiting multiple paths: end-to-end QoS and end-to-end reliability. The solution has practical importance in providing fault-tolerance to bandwidth-intensive applications such as high quality video streaming. We prove that above problem if NP-complete and present its ILP formulation. We describe a heuristic algorithm along and evaluate its performance.

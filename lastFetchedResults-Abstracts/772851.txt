We develop the perturbation theory for propagators, with the objective to prove Gaussian bounds. Let U
be a strongly continuous propagator, i.e., a family of operators describing the solutions of a non-autonomous
evolution equation, on an Lp-space, and assume that U is positive and satisfies Gaussian upper and lower
bounds. Let V be a (time-dependent) potential satisfying certain Miyadera conditions with respect to U.
We show that then the perturbed propagator enjoys Gaussian upper and lower bounds as well. To prepare
the necessary tools, we extend the perturbation theory of strongly continuous propagators and the theory of
absorption propagators.

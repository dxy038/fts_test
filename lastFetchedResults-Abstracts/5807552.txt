Describes the Defense Electronics Supply Center´s (DESC´s) quality program and the results achieved. The primary objective of the program is to improve the quality of electronic parts being purchased. Emphasis is on the high payoff areas of weapon system parts and the critical items with high demands. Three main topics discussed are the qualification certification program, the product quality program, and the DESC test program. All these programs are vital to DESC in improving the quality of electronic components for the US Department of Defense.

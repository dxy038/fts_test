In wireless location area, Taylor Series algorithm is essential to find the solution to minimize the objective function-the sum of squared TDOA measurement remains. This paper proposes a new objective function definition: the sum of squared distance from iterative point to each TDOA hyperbola. Then steepest descent method is used to find the optimized solution of the new model. In the end the two algorithms are compared using simulation tests under different environments. Results show that the new algorithm can achieve stabler and higher accuracy than Taylor Series algorithm especially under high noise environment.

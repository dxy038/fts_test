Fully implantable Cochlear Implants (CIs) would represent a tremendous advancement in terms of quality of life, comfort and cosmetics, for patients with profound sensorineural deafness. One of the main challenges involved in the development of such implants consists of finding a power supply means which does not require recharging. To this aim an inertial Energy Harvester (EH), exploiting the kinetic energy produced by vertical movements of the head during walking, has been investigated. Compared to existing devices, the EH needs to exploit very low frequency vibrations (&lt;;2.5 Hz) with small amplitude (&lt;;9 m/s<sup>2</sup>). In order to maximize the power transduced, an optimization method has been developed, which is the objective of this paper. The method consists in calculating the dynamical behavior of the EH using discrete transforms of experimentally measured acceleration profiles. It is shown that the quick integration of the second order dynamical equation allows the use of computationally intensive optimization techniques, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The robustness of the solution is also evaluated.

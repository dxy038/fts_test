The aim of this technical note is to present CFD simulations of a tube rupture incidental scenario in a Primary Heat eXchanger (PHX)/Primary Pump (PP) assembly for two design variants of the FAst-Spectrum Transmutation Experimental Facility FASTEF ongoing design, in the framework of the FP7 Central Design Team (CDT) European project. The simulation domain reproduces with some simplification the entire primary coolant loop. The objective is to understand whether it is necessary take some counter-measures to avoid the ingress of steam in the cold plenum. The simulation has been performed on two successive updates of the design and of the nominal operation. The simulations show a good resistance to steam ingress, under the condition that provision is made to avoid an excessive accumulation of steam at the top of the PHX/PP assembly casing.

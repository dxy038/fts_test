Introduction: Antibiotic resistance of Salmonella Typhi has been increased since several decades ago. Resistance pattern is different in different areas and is dependent on many factors so knowledge of this pattern is necessary for physicians in order of treatment of typhoid fever patients.
Objective: Our aim was to study antibiotic Resistance of Salmonella Typhi Isolated from typhoid fever patients who admitted in Razi Educational and Medical Center.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, 86 positive blood cultures for salmonella Typhi and their antibiograms in Razi during 3 years (1377-1380) and distribution of cases during this time were studied.
Results: The results showed that Multi drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella Typhi was rare (1 case resistant to Ceftizoxime, Trimetoprim Sulfamethoxazol and Amoxicillin) and distribution of disease was sporadic. The most percentage of resistance were to Ampicillin and Amoxicillin (19% and 22% respectively) Resistance to Trimetoprim Sulfamethoxzaol and Ceftizoxime were (5/8%) and (4/8%) respectively. Resistance to Chloramphenicol and Ciprofloxacin were not seen. Conclusion: MDR Salmonella Typhi in this area is rare and physicians can use first line Antibiotics such as Trimethoprim Sulfarnethxazol, Chloramphenicol and if being sensitive, Ampicillin and Amoxicillin for treatment of typhoid fever patients.

This paper deals with selecting control structures for a three-product Petlyuk (dividing-wall) column with an objective to achieve desired product purities with minimum use of energy (V). We consider four alternate control structures with and without the vapor split as a degree of freedom. This work also demonstrates the usefulness of the graphical V min diagram to visualize minimum boilup requirement and choose the appropriate control structure.

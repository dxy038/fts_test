Alterations of nasal sensibility following open rhinoplasty were studied both subjectively and objectively. In a prospective study, 25 patients were included. All patients underwent open rhinoplasty using a middle columellar incision. Subjective questioning and objective testing of nasal sensibility using the Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were obtained preoperatively and both 3 weeks and 1 year after surgery. The match-paired Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. At 3 weeks after surgery, there was subjective and significant objective alteration of sensibility in the area of skin supplied by the external nasal nerve (nasal tip and adjacent upper columella). This altered sensibility, however, recovered by 1 year after surgery. The recovery was thought to be due either to recovery of the external nasal nerve itself, or to collateral sprouting from the nerves supplying the adjacent areas of nasal skin.

We present a switched control law for stabilizing an underactuated underwater vehicle (UUV) moving in a horizontal plane in a neutrally buoyant condition. The control law consists of a sequential series of control actions, each of which achieves a certain objective, finally resulting in the system being moved to the origin. Finite-time controllers are employed at each stage to achieve the desired objective. Simulation results are presented to validate the control law.

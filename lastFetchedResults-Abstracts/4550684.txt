HF skywave (OTH) radars operate in a very challenging environment so the objective of optimizing the radar resources to address the surveillance missions can be achieved only with the aid of a variety of support systems and models. As the technological sophistication of OTH radar increases and performance expectations rise, the demands on these ancillary support systems are growing. This paper reviews the present situation and looks at some prospective developments.

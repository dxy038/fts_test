To study the optimum design factors and the optimal thermo-economical performances an optimal performance analysis of a solar driven heat engine system at maximum thermo-economical objective function conditions is done numerically. In the present investigation, thermodynamic analysis and NSGAII algorithm are employed to optimize objective function associated to the power output, thermal efficiency for a Solar driven engine system. Three decision-making procedures are applied to optimized answers from the results. The error through investigation is shown using error analysis.

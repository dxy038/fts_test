The Children´s Rehabilitation Center Telethon of the State of Mexico (CRIT-EM) provides care to disabled children carriers of neural-muscle-skeletal diseases. The CRIT-EM´s medical model includes the use of high technology as a tool for assessment and treatment. The objective of this work is to show how high technology is used in the rehabilitation process. The technologies included are the motion analysis, virtual reality, the robotic gait and assistive technology. The data and clinical information obtained from high technology can helps to establish rehabilitation strategies for each patient and objectively measure the functional benefits derived from the rehabilitation treatments. Through experience gained at the CRIT-EM, we can establish that it is not sufficient the acquisition and use of high technology in the assessment/treatment of patients with disabilities, but it is necessary to know the scope and limitations of each system, learn to using the technology, covering the period of the learning curve and become the data from this technology in useful information for clinical application.

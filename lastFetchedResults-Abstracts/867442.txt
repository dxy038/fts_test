A genetic algorithm based mixed-integer; non-linear programming model proposed by Min et al. [Min, H., Ko, C. S., & Ko, H. J. (2006). The spatial and temporal consolidation of returned products in a closed-loop supply chain network. Computers & Industrial Engineering, 51, 309â€“320] was recently published in Computers & Industrial Engineering journal to solve the reverse logistics problem involving both spatial and temporal consolidation of returned products. In this work, comments and suggestions are given to the recently published model of Min et al. (2006). The comments like centralized return center location, maximum allowable distance between customers and the initial collection point, calculation of transportation cost and finally, the modification of the objective function are suggested in this work.

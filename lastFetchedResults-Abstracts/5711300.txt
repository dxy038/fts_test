The prerequisite of problem-solving is consciousness of the problems that exist in a service system where a person supports others. In order to provide better services and improve the current situation, it is very important to determine the structure of problem consciousness and how critical thought can be applied to it. In this paper, the authors attempt to systematize, using the KJ method, the Confucian thought relating to a strong active problem-consciousness collected in the Analects of Confucius. The authors suggest that the problem consciousness structure of Confucianism comprises four elements: objective responsibility, wisdom (information and knowledge), and judgment based on the results of systematizing the Analects of Confucius using the KJ method.

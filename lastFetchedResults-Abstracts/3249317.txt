In network industries, functional effectiveness of the whole system is dependent on the collaborative effort of all players. However, governing these multitudes of organizations is a complex and challenging task. The objective of this paper is to implement five governance mechanism pillars in system of systems to understand and facilitate this task. The first step is to separate three layers of complexity in network industries. The second step is to present the role of each governance mechanism pillar in governing these complex networks. We applied this approach to the FAA NextGen project, which is the enterprise transformation process of the United States Air Transportation Network.

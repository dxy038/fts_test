The placement of base stations in wireless sensor networks affects the coverage of sensor nodes, the tolerance against faults or attacks, the energy consumption and the congestion from communication. However, previous studies mostly focus on the placement of base stations to improve a partial property, not considering all of them. In this paper we propose multiple-objective metric (MOM), which reflects four different metrics for base station placement in wireless sensor networks. First, the ratio of sensor nodes which can communicate with a base station via either single-hop or multi-hop represents the coverage of sensor nodes. Second, the average ratio of sensor nodes after the failure of base stations represents the fault tolerance of a network. Third, the average distance between sensor nodes and their nearest base station represents the energy consumption of a network. Fourth, the standard deviation of the degree of base stations represents the average delay of a network due to congestion. We show that placing multiple base stations using our proposed MOM can fairly increase various properties of wireless sensor networks

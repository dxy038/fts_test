This paper presents implementation of the firefly algorithm adapted for solving hierarchical multi-objective radio frequency identification (RFID) network planning problem. This problem belongs to the group of hard optimization problems since it employs many objectives and constraints. Firefly algorithm has been proven as a robust algorithm for solving such tasks. We used hierarchical approach where total coverage was required, along with minimization of the number of used readers, interference and transmitted power. Empirical tests were conducted on six standard RFID benchmark sets with clustered and random topologies. In comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art metaheuristics which were tested using the same benchmark sets, our proposed approach exhibited uniformly better performance.

The transport of grating blank at the nanometer scale is the key of diffraction grating fabrication technology. In this paper, a precision grating blank feeding system for a diffraction grating ruling engine was described in detail, and the dynamic characterization of fine motion stage (FMS) in the dual-actuated stage, in which a piezoelectric actuator (PA) are used as the driving elements, has been investigated to provide more accurate predictions of positioning performance via simulation and experiments. A PID control system with Background Propagation (BP) neural network is employed as control strategy to see whether the system can provides precision positioning for grating blank in closed loop. All the work is validated by experimental tests based on laser interference measurement system. The main objective is to identify a procedure giving the dynamic characterization for the precision feeding system of the diffraction grating ruling engine, in order to establish a better condition in the ruling process of the grating fabrication.

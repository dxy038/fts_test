If the reactive power of the load is changing rapidly, then a suitable fast response compensator is needed Static VAR Compensator (SVC) thyristor control series compensator (TCSC) and thyristor control phase shift transformer (TCPST) is such a compensator which belongs to FACTS family. The ultimate objective of applying reactive shunt compensation in the line is to improve the voltage profile. The inclusion of the FATCS devices in the circuit improves the reactive power in the line. FACTS are successfully simulated and the results show the voltage profile improvement.

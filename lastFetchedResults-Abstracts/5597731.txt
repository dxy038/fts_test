Vehicle Number Recognition (VNR) is an image processing technology which uses efficient algorithms to detect the vehicle number from real time images. The objective is to design an efficient Vehicle Number Recognition System &amp; to implement it for automatic toll tax collection. The system detects the vehicle first and then captures the image of the front view of the vehicle. Vehicle number plate is localized &amp; characters are segmented. The system is designed for grayscale images so it detects the number plate regardless of its color. Template matching technique is used for character recognition. The resulting vehicle number is then compared with the available database of all the vehicles so as to come up with information about the vehicle type &amp; to charge toll tax accordingly. The system is then allowed to open road barrier for the vehicle &amp; generate toll tax receipt. The vehicle information (such as passing time, date, toll amount) is also stored in the database to maintain the record. The hardware &amp; software integrated system is implemented &amp; a working prototype model is developed. Experiments show that system successfully detects and recognize the vehicle number plate of real images of Pakistani vehicles.

Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is increasingly being applied to optimisation of multi-objective problems in engineering design and scientific investigation. This paper investigates the behaviour of a novel algorithm based on an extension of the concepts of spatial social networks using a model of the behaviour of locusts and crickets. In particular, observation of locust swarms suggests a specific dependence on population density for ordered behaviour. Computational experiments demonstrate that both the new, spatial, social network algorithm and a conventional MOPSO algorithm exhibit improved performance with increased swarm size and crowding. This observation may have particular significance for design of some forms of distributed PSO algorithms.

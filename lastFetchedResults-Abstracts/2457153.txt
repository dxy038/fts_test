Due to the small number and the innovative aspects of fusion devices, in general, not much information is available in the literature about availability and reliability of their components. To perform probabilistic safety assessment of fusion devices, analysts have to consider use of reliability data originating from different technological experiences. To set up all the available information and create a dedicated data source on components typically used in fusion facilities, a specific database system has been developed. Data collection and data distribution activities have been established in the context of the International Energy Agency Agreement on the Environmental, Safety and Economic Aspects of Fusion Power (IEA ESE). This database development has been carried out to pursue the objective of creating a reference databank for the international fusion community. This paper briefly describes the database structure, the adopted generic component classification, and the fusion specific component breakdown. It also describes the procedure to gain consensus on data between interested IEA participants.

The purpose of this research is to explain the relationship between
export market expansion strategies and export performance and to detect
factors affecting this relationship. We study factors influencing export
market expansion strategy and impacts of this strategy on export
performance simultaneously using the profile deviation approach to test
the concept of co-alignment. Results (obtained by studying food
manufacturer exporters in Iran during 2003-2005) show that market
concentrators and market spreaders do not differ in most export
performance dimensions (including export level and relative export
growth). These findings are in accordance with the contingency
approach, stating that the success of an export market expansion strategy
depends on many different situational factors as well as the alignment
between these factors and strategy. Findings show factors as gaining
more market share as an export objective, product adaptation to customer
needs in target markets, solving logistic problems, management
international outlook, production capabilities, competitive pricing and
regular visits to target markets to be the determinants that fit the market
concentration strategy. On the other hand, more sales volume, coping
with pricing constraints, production capabilities and marketing
capabilities are the factors that tit the market spreading strategy.

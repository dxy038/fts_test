In this paper, we study the statistical scheduling of offline subjective tests for evaluating alternative control schemes in real time multimedia applications. These applications are characterized by multiple counteracting objective quality metrics (such as delay and signal quality) that can be affected by various control schemes. However, the trade-offs among these metrics with respect to the subjective preferences of users are not defined. As a result, it is difficult to select the proper control schemes that lead to the best subjective quality at run time. Since subjective tests are expensive to conduct and the number of possible control schemes and run-time conditions is prohibitively large, it is important that a minimum number of such tests be conducted offline, and that the results learned can be generalized to unseen conditions with statistical confidence. To this end, we study in this paper efficient algorithms for scheduling a sequence of subjective tests, while leaving the generalization of limited offline subjective tests to guide the operation of the control schemes at run time to a future paper. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the robustness of our algorithms in terms of their accuracy and efficiency.

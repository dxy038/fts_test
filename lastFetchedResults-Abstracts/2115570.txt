The objective of this research was to produce a dried potato product and study the effects of different drying methods (oven, microwave, and microwave-oven) on rehydration capability, vitamin C and shrinkage of the dried potatoes. Completely randomized design was used for statistical analysis of the results. The results showed that there was a significant difference between produced dried potatoes by drying methods and its justification was in applying different drying mechanisms, for example the amount of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in the dried potatoes by microwave was significantly more than that in the dried products of the other two methods. Also starch amount of the dried cubes in microwave apparatus was higher than the other samples which this is the case of a high rehydration percentage in microwave samples. Investigating the variation of shrinkage percentage during drying by different methods showed that the lowest shrinkage occurred in the samples dried by microwave.

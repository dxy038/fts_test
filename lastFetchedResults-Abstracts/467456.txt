Objective: The purpose of our study was to evaluate to which extent saline contrast hysterosonography (SCHS) is able to replace diagnostic hysteroscopy in uterine cavity evaluation in women suspected of intrauterine abnormalities. Study Design: In this prospective observational study we performed SCHS instead of diagnostic hysteroscopy. Diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed in case of failed or inconclusive SCHS. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess subgroups for their risk of failure and inconclusiveness. Results: Two hundred fourteen women were included consecutively. SCHS was conclusive in 180 cases (84.1%), failed in 12 (5.6%), and inconclusive in 22 (10.3%). Uterine size above 600 cm3 was the best predictor of failure and/or inconclusiveness (positive predictive value 0.42). Conclusion: SCHS was able to replace 84% of the outpatient diagnostic hysteroscopies in uterine cavity evaluation in women suspected of intrauterine abnormalities. Our study showed that diagnostic hysteroscopy can be restricted to inconclusive or failed SCHS. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:945-9.)

Bone drilling is a common surgical procedure in orthopaedic, neuro, and dental
surgeries for internal xation. Estimation and control of the bone drilling force and torque
are critical in preventing drill breakthrough, excessive heat generation and unnecessary
mechanical damage to the bone. This paper illustrates experimental measurements, and
a comparison of the drilling thrust force and torque in Conventional Drilling (CD) and
Ultrasonically-Assisted Drilling (UAD), in two directions; along the longitudinal axis of
the bone and normal to it (radial direction). The objective of this research is to nd
the eect of drill size and ultrasonic vibration superimposed on drill movement, on the
thrust force and torque. The eect of drill speed on force was investigated in the described
directions, followed by a series of experiments, to explore the in
uence of drill size and
penetration direction on the level of force and torque. The drilling force and torque were
found to be strongly dependent on the drilling direction. Experimental results reveal that
when drilling in a specic direction, lower drilling force and torque are found in UAD
compared to CD.

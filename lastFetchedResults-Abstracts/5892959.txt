In this paper, we address the problem of stereo-video quality assessment. We introduce objective no-reference metrics for automatic color- and sharpness-mismatch detection in video captured using stereo cameras. The algorithms are based on view matching and reconstruction. A fast block-based color-independent algorithm for stereo matching is proposed. We verify the applicability of the proposed metrics by assessing the quality of full-length films. This quality-assessment procedure reveals scenes distorted during film production or postproduction and enables film comparison in terms of stereoscopic quality.

Video distribution over error-prone Internet Protocol (IP) networks results in visual impairments on the received video streams. Objective impairment detection algorithms are crucial for maintaining a high Quality of Experience (QoE) as provided with IPTV distribution. There is a lot of research invested in H.264/AVC impairment detection models and questions rise if these turn obsolete with a transition to the successor of H.264/AVC, called High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). In this paper, first we show that impairments on HEVC compressed sequences are more visible compaired to H.264/AVC encoded sequences. We also show that an impairment detection model designed for H.264/AVC could be reused on HEVC, but that caution is advised. A more accurate model taking into account content classification needed slight modification to remain applicable for HEVC compression video content.

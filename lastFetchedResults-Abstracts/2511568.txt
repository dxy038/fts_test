<strong>Objective:</strong> Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into various connective tissue lineages. Therefore, they have attracted a lot of attention from investigators in the context of stem cell therapies. In our study, we have evaluated the frequency, phenotype and differen¬tiation potential of MSC in bone marrow (BM) cord blood (CB) and mobilized peripheral blood (mPB). <br /><strong>methods:</strong> Sixteen CB, 11 BM and 19 mPB were obtained from normal donors. Mononuclear cells sus¬pended in culture medium and seeded in culture flasks. Flasks were incubated in a CO2 incubator with a change of culture medium every 4 days and passaged when fibroblast like cells reached confluence. For every other passage, MSC were examined for CD13, CD44,CD34 by flow cytometry and induced to differentiate into adipocytes and osteocytes.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> All BM samples produced MSC that survived multiple passages in mesenchymal culture me¬dium over 4 months. CB and mPB samples produced a non-confluent adherent layer of heterogeneous cells, and did not proliferate beyond the first passage. Immunophenotype of BM-derived MSC in every other passage were CD34-, CD13+ and CD44+, the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation were con¬firmed by Oil-red O and Von Kossas staining, respectively. The mentioned evaluation for mPB and CB were not attempted because these were not confluent even in the first passage.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In our study, only human BM cells produced MSC. These cells are positive for MSC sur¬face proteins and differentiate into MSC lineages.

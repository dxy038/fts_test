Satellite navigation is particularly susceptible to radio-frequency interference. In order to safeguard against and mitigate both unintentional and malicious interference, it is important to have accurate methods to detect it. This paper describes DETECTOR, a GSA-funded project whose objective is to detect and characterize interference for road transport applications. The overall architecture as well as the hardware and software design is described, and the results of one of the real-world tests in an urban environment are shown. During this test several interference sources (jammers) were detected, showing the validity of the design and the necessity of its goals.

Objective: Studying the existence of sensorineural hearing loss (decreased bone conduction) in Chronic Otitis Media (without inner ear complications), and determining the intensity of the hearing loss and its relation with disease duration, the patients' age and the middle ear pathology.
Method: The study was done on 207 COM patients admitted to Ghaem Hospital and a properly matched control group. Epidemiological and audiometric information were obtained and analyzed.
Result: SNHL was found in 31.4% of the cases and 5.3% of the control group, which was more common in those above 45 years of age, and those with more than 15 years history of otorrhea. On the other hand, the correlation between middle ear pathology and SNHL wa not substantiated.
Conclusion: COM can cause SNHL and BC threshold shift. So this must be considered in the outcome of the surgery.

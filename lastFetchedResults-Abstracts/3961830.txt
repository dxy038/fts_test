In CIM-OSA the specific functions of each particular CIM system are captured in a CIM-OSA implementation description model whilst the general functions, common to all CIM systems, constitute the CIM-OSA integrating infrastructure. The objective of the CIM-OSA integrating infrastructure is to realise these general functions in a way that allows for the integration of the specific functions inherent in each particular CIM system. It also allows the use of the technological components and standards available for both general and specific functions. The CIM-OSA integrating infrastructure comprises four blocks of services: the business services, front-end services, information services and the communication services. This article focuses on the description of the integrating infrastructure as proposed by ESPRIT Project AMICE it first establishes the requirements that led to the definition of the CIM-OSA integrating infrastructure. After discussion of the basic concepts used to specify the integrating infrastructure, the components of the integrating infrastructure related to information management are detailed

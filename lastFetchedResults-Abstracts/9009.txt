A complex method for the optimum var control of radial primary power distribution networks, dealing with the proper selection and installation of shunt capacitors, is developed in this article. The problem is examined both on an annual and a long-term basis. First objective functions and relative algorithms which determine the kind, the size, the minimum number, the locations and the adjustments of the possibly installed standard capacitors are developed. Then all these are embodied in a complex software package, which examines all the technically acceptable var control solutions, it compares them economically and finally proposes the more profitable. Results of the application of this package on a practical network are also given.

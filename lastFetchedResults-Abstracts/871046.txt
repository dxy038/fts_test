In this paper, Wolfe and Mond]Weir type duals for a class of nondifferentiable
multiobjective variational problems are formulated. Under invexity assumptions on
the objective and the constraint functions involved, weak and strong duality
theorems are proved to related properly efficient solutions for primal and dual
problems. Later, related problems with these variational problems are introduced.

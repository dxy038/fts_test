In this paper, we deal with a control problem for a new joint admission and resource allocation controller taking into account vertical handover in a heterogeneous wireless network. The controller is dynamic: it uses statistical information on the arrival and sojourn rates of the mobiles to optimize the average performance of the system. To account for multi-objective optimization, we consider the maximization of an objective subject to a set of constraints. We turn this constrained problem into an unconstrained one that we numerically solve using the Semi-Markovian Decision Process (SMDP) framework. We compare the optimal policy to some heuristics for different parameter values.

The IEC 62271-100 international standard states that the mechanical endurance test is a mandatory test for a circuit breaker (CB) to verify its mechanical performance. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the failure modes of three mechanical components and to show how they can be improved to extend the mechanical endurance of a prototype 126 kV single-break vacuum circuit breaker (VCB). The three mechanical components are: a pin (stainless steel: 20CrNiMo) contained in a contact spring component, a joint bearing (stainless steel: 1Cr18Ni9Ti), and an inter-locking pawl (steel: Q235). All three components showed low-cycle metallic fatigue failure modes, which presented as deformation and metallic crack initiation and propagation. During mechanical endurance operations (i.e., closing and opening operations under no load conditions), the pin in the contact spring component fractured after approximately 178 operations; the joint bearing deformed greatly and fractured after about 1,500 operations; and the inter-locking pawl fractured after approximately 2,100 operations. Based on the theory of multi-body system dynamics and the S-N characteristics of the metal material applied in each case, the failure modes and fatigue lives of the three failed components and improved versions of their geometries were analyzed, respectively. Both the simulation results and the experimental results for the mechanical endurances of the improved component geometries offered greater confidence in the mechanical reliability of the 126 kV VCB: after 1,500 operations, the improved pin worked well, with no deformation or initial cracking; after 2,000 operations, small deformations were observed on both terminals, but with no initial cracking; and after 2,000 operations, the joint bearing and the inter-locking pawl both continued to work well, with no deformation or initial cracking.

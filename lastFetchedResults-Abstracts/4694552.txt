Vector beams are known to have a unique polarization distribution and corresponding focusing characteristics. Various applications of vector beams are reported. Vector Bessel-Gauss beams are solution of a vector wave equation and belongs to the class of non-diffracting beams. Self-reconstruction of intensity distribution has been the focus of many scientific studies, but there are no reports on polarization reconstruction. The objective of this work is to investigate the self-healing property of intensity and polarization of tightly focused vector Bessel-Gauss beam at the focal plane when a beam is partially obstructed at the pupil plane.

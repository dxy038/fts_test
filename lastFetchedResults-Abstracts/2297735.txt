Khajeh Abdullah Ansari was a Shariah oriented and a competent and tasteful writer. There are numerous works in the field of mysticism and Sufism left from him all of which reflect mystical experiences. One of the works is a low volume book titled “Letter of Affection”.
This old man from Herat, in his book, introduces a basic and most applicable expression used in Islamic mysticism, namely affection. A glimpse of his work reveals that he has a specific perspective toward this general subject using most concepts that can clarify the unknown angles.
Reflecting on the book unveils not only the very great awareness by Khajeh in terms of mystical issues, but also the mysteries of beautiful, well made, and efficient discourse that are the outcome of and transferring such awareness. To convey the meaning, Khajeh has used dual interactions and logical language as well as some image making tools, thus making a decent interaction between language and meaning. As a result, dealing with this kind of link and its dimensions make up the objective of this paper.
Prior to anything else, Khajeh discusses the difficulty of explaining some of his findings, though he endeavors to explain the topic of his book accurately to the readers. He found out that the transferring language is not able to convey his overall experiences, consequently he has to use emotional language. Therefore, he has employed emotional language not only for decorating discourse but also to better convey the meaning and thought.
Key words:
Affection, phrasal and indicative language, dual interaction, image language.

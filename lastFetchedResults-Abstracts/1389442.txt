Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) negatively modulates the immune response in vitro. The objective of this study was to investigate if PCV2 interferes with the development of the immune response to Aujeszky’s disease virus (ADV) vaccine, using an in vivo experimental subclinical model. Pigs were divided into four groups: (group CC) not infected with PCV2 and not vaccinated against ADV; (group IC) infected with PCV2 but not vaccinated against ADV; (group CV) not infected with PCV2 but vaccinated against ADV, and (group IV) infected with PCV2 and vaccinated against ADV. Pigs in groups IC and IV were inoculated intranasally with PCV2 and 14 days later, pigs in the CV and IV groups were vaccinated IM with a gE−tk− attenuated ADV vaccine.

al signs and weight gains were recorded from days 0 to 35 post-PCV2 inoculation (PI), at which point the pigs were euthanased and examined post-mortem. Throughout the experiment the PCV2 load was quantified in serum, antibodies to PCV2 and ADV were determined and antigen-specific cellular responses against both viruses were measured using an interferon-γ ELISPOT. PCV2 inoculated animals developed subclinical infection and had lower weight gain relative to non-infected controls. No differences were observed between the CV and IV groups in terms of the humoral or cellular immune responses to vaccination against Aujeszky’s disease, suggesting that subclinical infection with PCV2 does not alter the response to this vaccine.

The objective of virtual 3D sound technology is to convey to the listener an accurate impression of an acoustic environment. This is accomplished by conveying a realistic directional impression of sounds. Most of the successful techniques for doing this are based on the head related transfer function (HRTF). If loudspeakers are used to create the desired sound pressure field, then the cross talk associated with them will need to be compensated for. We present a method that can be used to calculate the required HRTFs using an adaptive filtering method based on the filtered X method of Widrow (1985)

A wide-band Yagi-Uda antenna with an x-shape driven dipole for the Meteor Burst Communication (MBC) at the VHF is presented in this paper. The parameter design and multi-objective optimization process of the proposed antenna are given. And effects of the installed height on the performance of the antenna are also studied in detail. The simulated and measured impedance bandwidth of VSWR&lt;1. 4 reaches 10%. The simulated maximum antenna gain across the operating frequency band is about 12. ldBi. Moreover, in the case of the practical installed height y<sub>0</sub> = 2.0 lambda, the simulated gain reaches 16. 27 dBi and the elevation main beam direction is 83.25deg, which is due to the effect of the ground plane.

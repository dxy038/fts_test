Abstract
Development is one of general concepts that have been spoken highly about it. Trying to understand indigenous ways of development have been a major concern of Iranian society up to now. Despite these efforts, seems the actor and the subject has been neglected in the development. Not the present or the past history, true and complete story of Iranian economic activists is not available. The only thing is the hegemony of substantial theories that have explained non-development in different ways. Hence, this paper focuses on the Iranian economic characteristic and tries to compare and implement this feature to economic ethic narrated by Max Weber from other religions, particularly Protestant religion.  The objective is to achieve the description and explanation of the reason of non- appearance of spirit of capitalism as Weber pointed. The historical period chosen for this study is Naseriâ€™s era up to rise of Reza Khan.

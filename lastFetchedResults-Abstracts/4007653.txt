The range scale algorithm (RSA) proposed in 2004 is a constrained optimization problem with only three base stations (BSs). In this letter, by introducing a new variable to replace the square term, the quadratic objective function of the constrained optimization problem in RSA is turned into a linear objective function. Then the computational complexity is reduced and the performance is improved. Moreover, when the number of BSs is larger than three, we construct a new objective function and give the corresponding constraints. So the RSA is extended for more BSs and the performance of positioning is improved significantly. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms improve the location accuracy over traditional algorithms in different Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments.

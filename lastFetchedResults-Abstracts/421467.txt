OBJECTIVES
We sought to compare standard lower extremity vascular laboratory treadmill exercise with the office-based active pedal plantarflexion technique.
BACKGROUND
Intermittent claudication is relatively common in elderly patients and is an important predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Noninvasive testing using resting and posttreadmill exercise ankle:brachial systolic blood pressure indices is often required to confirm the diagnosis and objectively assess the severity of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease. This is traditionally performed in a formal vascular laboratory setting.
METHODS
Fifty consecutive patients (100 lower extremities) with known or suspected intermittent claudication referred for lower extremity treadmill exercise testing were also tested with active pedal plantarflexion using a prospective, randomized crossover design. Supine ankle:brachial systolic blood pressure indices were measured immediately before and after each form of exercise.
RESULTS
There was an excellent correlation (r = 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 0.97) between mean postexercise ankle:brachial systolic blood pressure indices for treadmill exercise and active pedal plantarflexion. There was no significant difference in outcome based on the order of testing or the severity of arterial occlusive disease. Symptoms of angina or dyspnea occurred in 11 patients (22%) with treadmill exercise versus zero patients with active pedal plantarflexion.
CONCLUSIONS
Active pedal plantarflexion is an office-based test that compares favorably with treadmill exercise for the noninvasive, safe, objective and economical assessment of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease.

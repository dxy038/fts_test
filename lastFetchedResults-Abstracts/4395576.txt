The objective of this paper is to propose a semi-isolated multi-input converter (S-MIC) for hybrid PV/wind power charger system which can simplify the power system, reduce the cost and deliver continuous power with higher reliability. The S-MIC consists of a forward-type isolated pulsating voltage source cell (I-PVSC) and a SEPIC prime converter that can realize the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) function for each PV/wind source. Due to the semi-isolated configuration, the proposed S-MIC can adopt PV/wind power sources with larger operation voltage difference. In this paper, the operational principle of the proposed S-MIC is explained and the small-signal ac model is developed. Computer simulations and prototype circuit experimental results are presented to verify the performance of the S-MIC.

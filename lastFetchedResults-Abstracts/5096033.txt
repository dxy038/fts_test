This paper introduces MABEL, a new platform for the study of bipedal locomotion in robots. One of the purposes of building the mechanism is to explore a novel powertrain design that incorporates compliance, with the objective of improving the power efficiency of the robot, both in steady state operation and in responding to disturbances. A second purpose is to inspire the development of new feedback control algorithms for running on level surfaces and walking on rough terrain. A third motivation for building the robot is science and technology outreach; indeed, it is already included in tours when K-through-12 students visit the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan. MABEL is currently walking at 1.1 m/s on a level surface, and a related mono-pod at Carnegie Mellon is hopping well, establishing that the testbed has the potential to realize its many objectives.

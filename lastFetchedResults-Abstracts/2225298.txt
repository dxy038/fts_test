Objective: Pancreatic stroma plays an important role in the induction of pancreatic cells
by the use of close range signaling. In this respect, we presume that pancreatic mesenchymal
cells (PMCs) as a fundamental factor of the stromal niche may have an effective
role in differentiation of umbilical cord blood cluster of differentiation 133+ (UCB-CD133+)
cells into newly-formed B-cells in vitro.
Materials and Methods: This study is an experimental research. The UCB-CD133+ cells
were purified by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and differentiated into insulin
producing cells (IPCs) in co-culture, both directly and indirectly with rat PMCs. Immunocytochemistry
and enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) were used to determine
expression and production of insulin and C-peptide at the protein level.
Results: Our results demonstrated that UCB-CD133+ differentiated into IPCs. Cells in
islet-like clusters with (out) co-cultured with rat pancreatic stromal cells produced insulin
and C-peptide and released them into the culture medium at the end of the induction protocol.
However they did not respond well to glucose challenges.
Conclusion: Rat PMCs possibly affect differentiation of UCB-CD133+ cells into IPCs by
increasing the number of immature B-cells.

<strong>Objective:</strong> Memory and concentration may be affected by hemodialysis in end-stage renal disease. In this study, changes in cognitive function parameters such as attention, impulsiveness, and reaction time were measured and evaluated in the Iranian hemodialysing patients. <strong><br />Methods:</strong> In this analytic observational study, cognitive function of 38 hemodialysis patients was measured before and after hemodialysis sessions using Conners' continuous performance test.<strong><br /> Results:</strong> Mean age of patients was 37.97 12.58 years. There wasn't any significant difference between numbers of matches successfully recognized, number of Miss Faire and mean of reaction time of those matches successfully recognized before and after hemodialysis. There weren't any differences between history of hemodialysis and number of matches successfully, matches missed and mean reaction time of matches. Educational level of patients was significant effect on number of Miss Faire during hemodialysis. <strong><br />Conclusions:</strong> It has been concluded that hemodialysis did not have any significant impact on the cognitive function. However, this hypothesis needs to be checked and confirmed by careful selection of patients and other cognitive function tests.

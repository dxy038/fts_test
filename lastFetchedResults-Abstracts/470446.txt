Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of acupressure at the P6 point for the in-patient treatment of severe nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy.
Study design
This was a prospective single-blind randomized control trial that involved 80 patients with nausea and vomiting plus ketonuria before 14 weeks of gestation.
Results
There was no difference between length of stay, amount of medication, or fluid required between the acupressure and placebo groups, although acupressure reduced the number of patients who stayed ≥4 nights in the hospital. Acupressure was well tolerated and not associated with an increase in perinatal morbidity or death.
Conclusion
The use of acupressure at the P6 point does not reduce the amount of antiemetic medication that is required, the requirement for intravenous fluid, and median duration of in-patient stay more than the use of placebo. A small reduction was seen in the number of women who required ≥4 days in the hospital.

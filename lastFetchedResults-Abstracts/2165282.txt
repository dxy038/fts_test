Background: Ginko biloba stimulate blood circulation to the brain. As a result of insufficiency to improve blood flow to the brain.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of eight weeks endurance training swimming on BDNF and NMDA levels with Ginkgo biloba extract young girls untrained. Methods: 40 healthy females aged 27-22 girls as subjects of this study were selected and randomly divided into four groups of 10 people (1-swim training with Ginkgo biloba extract (SG), 2- swimming training(S), 3- Ginkgo biloba extract (G) and 4- control group (C)). The aqueous extract of Ginkgo biloba with amount of 80mg/day and were prescribe for eight weeks. The experimental group consisted of eight-week training program three times a week, with an intensity of 60-75% of maximum heart rate were performed. Blood samples from subjects 24 hours before and after the test, was used for measure the levels of NMDA and BDNF. Results with the t-test and one-way analysis of variance were analyzed and significant levels of p ?0.05 determined. 
Results: The results showed that levels of NMDA in SG and G group had significant increase. However, The significant increase in the levels of BDNF in SG, G and S were observed. Conclusion: The present study endurance training and Ginkgo biloba consumption was effective in decrease anxiety and improve memory that related to flavonoid and antioxidant activity of this plant.

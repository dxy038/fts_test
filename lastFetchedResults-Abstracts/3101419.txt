In car factory, each production unit has its own objective so the different goals may be contradictory. It is important to design a production logistics system to meet the change. This paper proposes to apply advanced planning and scheduling (APS) technology to design a coordinated production logistics system. Firstly, this paper analyzes the structure and characteristics of car factory. Secondly, facing the optimistic questions of push/pull hybrid production planning and control model in car factory, this paper constructs a coordinated production logistics system based on ERP, JIT and APS. Lastly, the paper provides an integration framework and the integrated technologies for enterprise information system.

As to the urban Voronoi diagram based on the plane measurement, any point may freely passes in and out of the horizontal and vertical transport network, but the situation of direct transport without obstacle is relatively rare in the objective world, most of the transport networks are separated by the obstacles in various shapes, the linear obstacle is the most important one among the obstacles in various shapes, and many obstacles can be treated as approximate linear ones, so the study of the urban Voronoi diagram with linear obstacles is necessary. The Voronoi diagram processing process is the same as the matrix operation process, while with matrix as the basic data unit of MATLAB, and its expression is very similar to the form commonly used in mathematics and engineering, so to solve the problem with MATLAB is much simpler than that with the C, FORTRAN, and other languages. In this paper, the crystal 4-neighborhood generation algorithm of the urban Voronoi diagram with linear barriers is simulated with MATLAB as a tool, and it is applied to specific instances.

Field-Excited Flux-Switching machines are doubly-salient machines with complex flux-density waveforms in the core. Hence, prediction of iron losses is difficult. In this article, we propose a method to determine flux loci in iron parts in an analytical manner, accounting for bidirectional field in back-irons of stator and rotor. The analytical model for flux-density prediction in the core at no-load was first validated with 2D FE simulations. Then measured iron losses on a prototype machine were used to calibrate an iron loss model. It was shown that in FE-SF machines rotor iron losses are not negligible and represent 28% of total iron losses. This model could be advantageously used in a design optimization procedure.

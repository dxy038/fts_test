A novel approach for robust restructurable/reconfigurable control synthesis is proposed using a model-matching approach. Based on an augmented system structured by the nominal control system and the faulty system, the objective of restructure/reconfigurable control synthesis is to minimize the difference between the transfer matrix of the reconfigured closed-loop system and that of the nominal closed-loop system in the H<sub>infin</sub>-norm sense, under the constraint that the reconfigured system should be internally stable. Besides regarding the control redesign as a kind of reconfigurable control approach, the control mixer concept is used for synthesis of a restructurable control. The robust control methods, H<sub>infin</sub> and mu synthesis techniques, are employed for these restructurable/reconfigurable control syntheses. The reconfigured system performance, stability and robustness are shown to be guaranteed when some conditions are satisfied. The proposed approach is also extended to deal with parametric and additive faults as well as the case with system uncertainties

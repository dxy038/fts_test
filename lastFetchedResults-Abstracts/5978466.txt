Hyperspectral imaging sensors suffer from spectral and spatial misregistrations. These artifacts prevent the accurate acquisition of the spectra and thus reduce classification accuracy. The main objective of this work is to detect and correct spectral and spatial misregistrations of hyperspectral images. The Hyperion visible near-infrared (VNIR) subsystem is used as an example. An image registration method using normalized cross-correlation for characteristic lines in spectrum image demonstrates its effectiveness for detection of the spectral and spatial misregistrations. Cubic spline interpolation using estimated properties makes it possible to modify the spectral signatures. The accuracy of the proposed postlaunch estimation of the Hyperion properties has been proven to be comparable to that of the prelaunch measurements, which enables the precise onboard calibration of hyperspectral sensors.

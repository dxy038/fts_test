The neuron network in the inner catfish retina was studied by injecting current from the one neuron and recording resulting responses into a nearby neuron. Current injected into an amacrine or a ganglion cell always produced a response from neighboring amacrine or ganglion cells chosen randomly. Bidirectional communications were found to exist for neurons of similar response patterns, e.g. on-cell pair, off-cell pair, or on-off cell pairs. These communications are mutually excitatory, fast, and likely linear. Single transmission between neurons of different response patterns was also shown to exist

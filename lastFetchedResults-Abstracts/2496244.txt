<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong>Probiotics are live microbial feed supplements which beneficially affect the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance, producing metabolites which inhibit the colonization or growth of other microorganisms or by competing with them for resources such as nutrients or space. The aim of this study was to investigate the probiotic properties of <em>Candida famata </em>and <em>Geobacillus thermoleovorans</em>.<br /><strong>Material and Methods: </strong>In this study, yeast and bacterial strains isolated from pure oil waste were identified using Api 50 CHB and Api Candida Systems and their probiotic properties were studied through antimicrobial activity, biofilm production,adherence assay and enzymatic characterization.<br /><strong>Results and Conclusion: </strong>According to biochemical analyses, these strains corresponded to <em>Geobacillus thermoleovorans </em>and <em>Candida famata. </em>Antagonism assay results showed that the tested strains have an inhibitory effect against tested pathogenic bacteria. The yeast <em>Candida famata </em>was unable to produce biofilm on Congo Red Agar (CRA), while the bacterial strain was a slime producer. Adherence assays to abiotic surfaces revealed that the investigated strains were fairly adhesive to polystyrene with values ranging from 0.18 to 0.34 at 595 nm. The enzymatic characterization revealed that the tested strains expressed enzymes such as phosphatase alkaline, esterase lipase (C8), amylase, lipase, lecitenase and caseinase. The obtained results may allow the isolated strains to be considered as having the potential to be candidate probiotics.</p>

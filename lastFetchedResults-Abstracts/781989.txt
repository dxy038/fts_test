The objective was to characterize vaginal bacteria in ewes with vaginitis. Intravaginal
sponges impregnated with medroxyprogesterone were used to synchronize estrus
in 22 multiparous Santa Inês ewes. At sponge removal (6 days later), all ewes had
clinical signs of vaginitis. Purulent vaginal secretions were subjected to standard bacteriological
procedures, including determining whether isolates were susceptible to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, cefalotin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin,
ampicillin, penicillin G, and amoxicillin. The majority of the isolateswere coliforms
(72.7% Escherichia coli and 18.2% Klebsiella pneumoniae), whereas the remainder were
Staphylococcus aureus. Antimicrobial resistance was common, with all isolates resistant to
at least one compound. Ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were the most
effective (100% susceptibility), whereas penicillins (including broad-spectrum penicillins),
were the least effective (80–100% resistance). In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria, mainly
coliforms,were present in association with vaginitis in ewes given intravaginal sponges; all
isolates were susceptibile to at least some antimicrobials

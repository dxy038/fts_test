Considering the high water use by agriculture in comparing to the other sectors of Tehran and Alborz Provinces, optimization of cropping pattern and water allocation in deficit irrigation condition can play an important role in water demand management. For this purpose, in the present study, the optimization is performed on the two levels (by two sub-models). The first level was the allocation of intra-seasonal and second level was the integrated optimization of irrigation water allocation and cropping pattern in a dry year condition by second sub-model. The amount of net benefit estimated with regard to the different deficit irrigation and then a benefit function were developed for each crop. In this study, the non-linear programming (NLP) was used due to existing non-linear relationship between net benefit and irrigation water and thus the non-linear objective function is applied. Considering the various scenarios in the amount of available water, optimal cropping pattern and water allocation of individual crops determined. The results of the model indicate that the net benefit of agriculture is improved %36 in Tehran and Alborz Provinces by changing in cropping pattern and using deficit irrigation.

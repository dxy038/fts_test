Inroduction & Objective: Probiotics are food supplement and pharmaceutical substance prepared from living microorganisms, which with enhancement of microbial equilibrium of intestinal microbiota insert useful effects on the host (human/animal). Researches were indicated that nutrients could affect the brain and neurohormones via vagus nerve. So it is probable that probiotics can regulate some parts of brain activities and result it better function.
Materials and Methods: In this study 24 male wistar rats with 95-118 grams weight range and 4 weeks age were used and they divided to four groups randomly: two groups as control, with and without stressed rats. Two other groups were received were gavaged with 1 Ã— 10 9 cfu/ml of probiotics.
Results: Data of this research indicated that in the control groups, stress were increased the time of latency in dark component significantly (p < 0.05) and there by decreased the learning and increased the spent time in dark component. In probiotic receiving groups, learning level had not significant difference with non-stressed control group even in stressed condition.
Conclusion: Results of this study showed that the Lactobacillus brevis isolated from Tarkhineh dough, enhance the on passive avoidance learning in maleWistar rats under stress conditions. Our data demonstrate the positive effect of this probeotic on learning and memory.

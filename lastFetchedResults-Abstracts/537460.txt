Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate serum thyroid hormone levels in epileptic children receiving anticonvulsive drugs.
Materials & Methods
In this case- control study, 30 epileptic children who were receiving anticonvulsive drugs (case group) were compared with 30 healthy children (control group). This study was carried out in the Qazvin Children's Hospital (Qazvin, Iran) from October to December 2007. Both groups were matched for age and sex. Thyroid hormone levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay and immunoradiometric assay. Data were analyzed using Chi-square and Student's t-tests.
Results
The mean serum T3 and T4 levels in the case group were 2.36 ± 0.73 nmol/L and 95.96 ± 27.01 nmol/L, respectively, and the corresponding values in the control group were 1.88 ± 0.93 nmol/L and 147.46 ± 35.77 nmol/L, respectively. The mean serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in the case and control groups were 2.73±0.73 mIU/mL and 2.49 ± 2.17mIU/mL, respectively.
Conclusion
This study revealed that long-term consumption of anticonvulsive drugs resulted in a decline in serum T4 levels and an increase in serum T3 levels, but had no effect on TSH levels.

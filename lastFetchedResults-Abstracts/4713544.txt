The main objective of the CONNECT project is to create a pedagogical framework that attempts to blend informal and formal learning and to situate learning in real-world contexts. The introduction of a technologically advanced approach for learning by connecting a wide range of learning environments (school, home, science museums, research centers, science thematic parks and exhibitions) and the bridging of theoretical and applied aspects of every day personal activities is expected to lead to the development of a new science learning scheme for all. This scheme will demonstrate innovative ways of science communication as well as ways to augment human abilities by capturing, recalling and generalizing from situated events.

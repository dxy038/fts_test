The concept of disjoint component analysis (DCA) is based on the fact that different speech or audio signals are typically more disjoint than mixtures of them. This letter studies the problem of blind separation of convolutive mixtures through the subband-wise maximization of the disjointness of time-frequency representations of the signals. In our approach, we first define a frequency-dependent measure representing the closeness to disjointness of a group of subband signals. Then, this frequency-dependent measure is integrated to form an objective function that only depends on the time-domain parameters of the separation system. Lastly, an efficient natural-gradient-based learning rule is developed for the update of the separation-system coefficients.

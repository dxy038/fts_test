This paper presents an evaluation of the potential of an optimization approach in improving real time irrigation water management in systems with complex distribution networks. The optimization approach is based on quadratic programming. The operational objective is to maximize crop production through appropriate water allocation, while maintaining equity between different irrigation schemes and units within schemes. The approach has been evaluated through application to the irrigation system in the Lower Ayung River Basin in Bali, Indonesia. A simulation model of this irrigation system was available, and it has been possible to measure the effectiveness of the optimization approach by comparing the results of simulation runs incorporating optimization with the results of runs representing existing water allocation practice. The results indicate that the optimization approach does have potential and can significantly improve crop production at the basin scale. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the potential of the approach and describes the development of a more sophisticated optimization approach based on real-time evaluations of crop water requirements. Considerations for practical implementation are discussed.

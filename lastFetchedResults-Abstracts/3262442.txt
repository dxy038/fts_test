In order to increase the voltage profile and to reduce power loss in the distribution system shunt capacitors are to be installed at suitable locations in a large distribution system. When we place the capacitors optimally we will get some benefits. Placing a capacitor in a Electrical distribution system involves various factors like maximizing energy and peak power loss reduction by installing a capacitor. Location of nodes where the capacitor should be placed is decided by fuzzy expert system by incorporating a set of rules into it, Candidate nodes should be found for capacitor placement using fuzzy system. The objective function includes cost of power loss, energy loss and capacitor banks. Constraints include voltage limits, number and location of installed capacitors. Loss sensitivity factors are used to select the candidate location for capacitor placement. The proposed method is applied to 12 bus and 34 bus radial distribution system. Results show robustness of proposed method in solving this difficult task.

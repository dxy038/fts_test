The concept of multiband, multimode radios is relevant to a wide variety of communications applications. These applications include the commercial wireless and civil government sectors, and the military communications sector. The Modular Multifunction Information Transfer System (MMITS) Forum is in the process of developing standards requirements and standards recommendations for multiband, multimode systems that meet wireless communications user requirements from all three of these sectors. In March 1995, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, the Honorable Paul G. Kaminski, addressed the Research and Development Subcommittee of the House Committee on National Security and stated &#8220;The bottom line is that we have no choice but to move from separate industrial sectors for defense and commercial markets to an integrated national industrial base. Leveraging commercial technological advances to create military advantage is critical to ensuring that our equipment remains the most advanced in the world. The objective is to marry the momentum of the vigorous, productive, and competitive commercial industrial infrastructure with the unique technologies and systems integration capabilities provided by our defense contractors. &#8221; Thus, the goals and objectives of the MMITS Forum are very much consistent with the theme of this conference for &#8220;Integrating Military and Commercial Communications for the Next Century&#8221;

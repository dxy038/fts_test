By applying evolutionary game theory, a control strategy for active suspension based on a quarter-car vehicle model is proposed to control body vertical acceleration, suspension travel and tire deformation. With impact facts calculation and fuzzy clustering, it also presents the game description about multi-objective problems by decomposing design variable assembly into stratagem set of all the game players. To solve multi-objective control problem, Nash equilibrium model is used. The technique steps are put forward. The simulation results show that the active suspension with immune controller can effectively imp rove both ride comfort and handling stability.

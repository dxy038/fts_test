Objective. To explore the effect of scrotal reconstruction following avulsion on spermatogenesis.
Methods. Three patients were followed-up after having their scrotums reconstructed. Two scrotums were reconstructed by skin flap. Another patient's testicles were buried in thigh pockets. The follow-up continued from 3 months to 4 years after operation, and we examined the sperm quality, sexual function, sexual hormone, and testis biopsy.
Results. The follow-up data showed that the spermatogenesis was not altered in the early stage (up to three months), but was substantially abnormal in the late stage (after two years).
Conclusions. Using the thick skin flaps, or burying the testicle for scrotum reconstruction are not recommended for patients who wish to remain fertile.

We report the bidirectional propagation of atom sample around a "stadium" shaped magnetic waveguide. The atoms are cooled and trapped at one side of the magnetic "stadium". Optical standing-wave can evenly divide the atoms to propagate in opposite directions around the ring, which recombine at starting position after traversing the same closed path. The ring encloses an area of 8.0 cm<sup>2</sup>. The flux density of the guided atoms reaches 10<sup>11</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-2 </sup>

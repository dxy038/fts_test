Voices are used as primary media in human communication. A human voice is a sound generated by the complex movements of the vocal organs, and is the most important media employed for communication in daily life to logical discussions. A human is able to detect the position of a source sound in 3D space by perceiving the time difference reaching to both ears. Furthermore we can selectively listen to an objective voice in the crowd. This paper presents real time detection and identification of a particular person among plural speakers using a microphone array. The system identifies the position of a particular speaker, and enhances the voice signal selectively.

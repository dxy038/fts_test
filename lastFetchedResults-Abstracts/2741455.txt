In this paper, we discuss a theoretical optimal design of a nonlinear transmission line using a genetic algorithm (GA) to achieve peak pulse power. The technique is based on an integrated optimization approach that uses a GA coded in Matlab and the circuit simulation program LTspice. A bidirectional interface is created that allowed information to be rapidly transferred between the circuit simulator and GA with real-time monitoring of the entire design process, including peak power and elemental values. The designed process shows a peak voltage enhancement of 318% while eliminating the tedious trial and error process usually required. It is important to note that this result is achieved using only six L-C segments and a much greater voltage increase is likely as the number of segments is increased.

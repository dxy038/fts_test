In this paper, we propose a framework for online inter-peer assessment of group works in a blended learning context. The objective is to define a hybrid assessment approach that fosters assessment for learning for the learners and supports summative assessment for the teachers. The assessment framework is implemented within a collaborative learning platform. The peer assessment process focuses on the assessor role, which is identified as the most likely to engage learners and bring learning gains. It has been applied in a real situation for the semester project of a first year bachelor level course. The setting up and the running of this experiment are described and the results analyzed and discussed.

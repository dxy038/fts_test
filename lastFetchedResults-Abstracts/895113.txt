This paper studies the multi-factory production (MFP) network scheduling problem where a number of different individual factories join together to form a MFP network, in which these factories can operate more economically than operating individually. However, in such network which known as virtual production network with selfish factories, each individual factory usually focuses on self-benefits and does not care much about the others within the network. In this study, we proposed a heuristic algorithm for sum of completion time minimization. Here, although each factory has an objective function, Pareto concept are introduced in single-objective environments. Therefore, this paper proposed a weightedLp-metric based framework. We investigated the performance of our algorithm in comparison with imperialist competitive algorithm and obtained results are reported.

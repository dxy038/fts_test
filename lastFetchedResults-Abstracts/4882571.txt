The use of a controller based on fuzzy set theory, to control a hybrid isolated structure is considered in this work. The objective of the hybrid system is to obtain an ideal sliding system with &#8220;complete&#8221; base isolation for structures subjected to earthquakes. As the hybrid system approaches a state of &#8220;complete&#8221; isolation, the effects of imperfections, measurement noise, model limitations, and compensation errors start to play a dominant role in the system performance. Fuzzy logic provides a simple framework to capture the effects of nonlinearities and uncertainties in a real problem, without an explicit model of the plant or controller. The applicability of this approach is investigated on a benchmark experimental model consisting of a 1:4 scale sliding base isolated system complemented at its base by a servo controlled actuator, with a digital computer to provide real-time control. The results of this experimental and analytical study show the feasibility of the implementation of fuzzy logic based control to highly nonlinear civil engineering structures

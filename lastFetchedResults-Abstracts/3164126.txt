Existing security research in wireless sensor networks is based on specific assumptions about the nodes and the network environment that are tied to specific usage scenarios. Typical scenarios consider sensor nodes that are immobile and have pre-defined communication patterns. We argue that node mobility is a realistic characteristic of sensor nodes that needs to be taken into consideration in future sensor networks. Mobility capabilities can address the objective challenges raised in mission-critical applications, such as in disaster relief, where their environment characteristics fluctuate over time. It is imperative to investigate the way security is affected in mobile sensor networks and identify the challenges that will need to be addressed in future security protocol design. We present our vision for future sensor networks through a realistic scenario and discuss security gaps that are present in existing research for next generation sensor networks.

Background: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is the most common oral disease yet despite its high prevalence, the etiological factor (s) of this ulcer is not fully understood.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the serum levels of ferritin, iron, and TIBC in patients with RAS.
Methods: This case-control study was performed on 40 patients with RAS and 40 healthy people (control group). They were screened through laboratory tests for the indices mentioned above. The data was analyzed by SPSS, chi-square and t-tests.
Findings: Of 40 patients, 25.6% were found with ferritin deficiency compared to 7.5% of control group (p<0.05) however, no significant difference for other indices were observed. Conclusion: Low ferritin level in patients with RAS is suggesting a relation between RAS and ferritin deficiency.

This paper presents a newly developed resource constrained project scheduling method in stochastic networks by using critical chain concept. The objective of the presented model is defined as minimizing the multiplication of expected project duration and its variance. This paper suggests a competition routine by implementing a policy to maximize the total contribution of selected activities in reducing the expected project duration and its variance. In this respect, a heuristic algorithm is developed and compared with the other existing methods.

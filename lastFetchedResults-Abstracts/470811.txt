Objective
Studies suggest that sleep deprivation adversely affects performance. We hypothesized that cesarean delivery complications would be more frequent during the night shift (11 pm-7 am), and evaluated morbidities by delivery shift.
Study design
Eighteen thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine term women undergoing an unscheduled cesarean delivery in 13 centers from 1999 to 2000 within a prospective observational study were included. Maternal/neonatal morbidities and time from decision to cesarean delivery were evaluated by time of delivery (7 am-3 pm, 3 pm-11 pm, 11 pm-7 am). A composite of maternal morbidities was evaluated by logistic regression controlling for potentially confounding factors.
Results
Controlling for age, race, insurance, cardiac disease, preeclampsia, diabetes, previous incision type, and prenatal care, shift of delivery had no impact on maternal morbidity (11 pm-7 am OR 0.9 [95% CI 0.81-1.0]). NICU admissions were slightly increased at night but neonatal complications were not.
Conclusion
Maternal and neonatal complications of cesarean delivery do not increase with delivery during the night shift.

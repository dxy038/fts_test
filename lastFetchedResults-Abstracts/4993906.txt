We propose an effective method to design multibeam dielectric lens antennas. A genetic algorithm (GA) with multi-objective optimization is adopted to balance gain against sidelobe level. The lens shapes and the position of each feed are associated with chromosomes. The gain and sidelobe level are evaluated in a pareto ranking method. The method yields the distribution of the objective function values and the corresponding antenna structures.

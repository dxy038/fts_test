The paper presents an interactive fuzzy satisfying method for solving optimal power system rescheduling by assuming that the decision-maker has imprecise or fuzzy goals and constraints. An interactive decision-making process is formulated in which decision-maker can learn to recognize good solutions by considering all possibilities of fuzziness. The salient features of the proposed method are: (i) ability of solving multi-objective problem which guarantees that a global noninferior solution will be generated; and (ii) the possibility to obtain a reasonable nonfuzzy solution under consideration of the ambiguity of parameters

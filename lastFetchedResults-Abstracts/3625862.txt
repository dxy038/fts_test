This paper presents a new strategy for assessment of audio signal quality. The resulting method, named Objective Measure of Audio Quality, includes some of the most effective features found in the current methods of audio assessment, as well new techniques resulting from the identification and study of the major limitations of such methods. The performance of the new strategy is compared to that one achieved by PEAQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality), currently adopted as standard by International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

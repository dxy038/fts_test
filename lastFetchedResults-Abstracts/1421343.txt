The frictional behavior of elastomers is characterized by compliance of asperities, special surface chemistry, and wetting properties. The objective of this paper is to investigate the coupled influence of surface texture and wettability on the lubrication of an elastomer contact. Patterns of micro-dimples were fabricated on disks of a polymer material, PDMS. An oxygen plasma treatment was used to hydrophilize the disk surfaces. Friction tests of the disks sliding against a spherical pin of PDMS were carried out. The experimental results indicate that the effect of surface texture is different for PDMS with different wetting properties.

This paper studies a new multi-objective fuzzy optimization prob-
lem. The objective function of this study has dierent levels. Therefore, a
suitable optimized solution for this problem would be an optimized solution
with preemptive priority. Since, the feasible domain is non-convex; the tra-
ditional methods cannot be applied. We study this problem and determine
some special structures related to the feasible domain, and using them some
methods are proposed to reduce the size of the problem. Therefore, the prob-
lem is being transferred to a similar 0-1 integer programming and it may be
solved by a branch and bound algorithm. After this step the problem changes
to solve some consecutive optimized problem with linear objective function on
discrete region. Finally, we give some examples to clarify the subject.

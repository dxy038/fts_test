The objective of this study was to qualify a 3M Z-Axis (anisotropic) conductive film for use in applications calling for sub 100 &#956;m pitch flex to ITO/glass connections. For the environmental stability tests, the following accelerated aging conditions were studied: 100&#176;C dry, 125&#176;C dry, -40&#176;C/100&#176;C cycle, -55&#176; C/125&#176;C shock, 60&#176; C/95%RH and 85&#176; C/85%RH. We examined both the electrical and peel performance of these bonds after environmental aging

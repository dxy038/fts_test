Trust management, with trust collecting mechanism as one of its foundations, has been the focus of more and more researches in grid security. This paper analyzes shortages of existing trust collecting mechanisms, and then proposes a novel trust collecting mechanism by introducing the idea of publish/subscribe scheme used in messaging system. The objective of this mechanism is to support dynamic trust management as well as to reduce time delay and transportation overheads brought by process of trust collecting. A simulated experiment is devised to validate strong points of this novel approach.

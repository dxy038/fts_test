Dynamic voltage restorers (DVRs) are utilised in the distribution systems to protect sensitive loads from voltage sags. In this reported work the vehicle to grid technology with a bidirectional converter is used to design a virtual dynamic voltage restorer based on hysteresis voltage control theory. The potential of a low-cost solution that utilises the mitigation capabilities of plug-in vehicles parked in charging stations is investigated. Simulations are performed to demonstrate that the proposed virtual DVR improves the power quality while maintaining voltage level at the user end.

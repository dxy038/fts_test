Following the occurrence of unexpected events and natural disasters, a highly
important relief operation is the transferring of relief commodities from the
distribution centers (DCs) to shelters. In this paper, a three-level network
consisting of depot of vehicles, distribution centers,and shelters has been
considered for routing and scheduling of relief vehicles through introducing a
multi-objective model. The first objective function represents the total arrival
time of vehicles to DCs and shelters. The second objective function illustrates the
number of vehicles used. We use the TH method to deal with the multi-objective
problem. During the relief commodities distribution, issues such as the feasibility
of getting service from each distribution center with multiple vehicles and
heterogeneous fleet of vehicles has been regarded. In order to solve the proposed
model and represent its efficiency, we select the fourth region of Tehran city as a
case study; run the model on it, and present solution results.

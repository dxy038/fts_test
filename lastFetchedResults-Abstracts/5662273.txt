In this work, we present UCare (Urban Care), a context-aware, flexible architecture that provides rich environment adaptation services to disabled users. We have considered bidirectional adaptability, that is, adapting the system interface to user capabilities and system capabilities to user needs. To accomplish this goal, UCare provides two operation modes: non-interactive, whose main property is transparency, and interactive mode, allowing direct user participation in service operation. Both services and user capabilities are described by means of profiles, which are jointly processed to select suitable services for the users. The UCare platform offers the building blocks to develop applications that meet the corresponding requirements.

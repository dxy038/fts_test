The radar cross section (RCS) of a CAD model of the stealth bomber B-2 Spirit was simulated with the CADRCS software. Results from simulations with the aircraft model having a perfectly conducting surface and rotating about the yaw, pitch and roll axes are presented and compared with results of simulations where the surface of the model was covered with a radar absorbing material (RAM). The objective of this study was to investigate how the shape can affect the RCS of an aircraft and how the use of RAM can further reduce its RCS.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Primary brain lymphoma (PBL) is one of the malignant and rare cerebral tumors and it has considerably increased over recent years because of immunosuppersion such as tissue transplant and patients with AIDS. The purpose of this study was to determine CT-scan findings of patients with PBL.
METHODS: This study was done to evaluate brain CT scan of 30 cases who had stereotactic biopsy of PBL in Shohada Tajrish hospital (Tehran) during 1990-2000. Extra cerebral manifestations of lymphoma were not seen in any patients.
FINDINGS: Lesions were multifocal in 60% and single in 40%. Most lesions were homogeneously hypo or isodense with diameter over 2cm. Peritumoral edema was mainly severe and central necrosis was seen in 38%. In most cases, the contrast enhancement was severe and homogeneous. The lesions were commonly in the deep hemispheric regions, corpus callosum and basal ganglia. Involvement of ventricles and periventricular areas were common.
CONCLUSION: According to the results, PBL in CT findings is considerably various in pattern.

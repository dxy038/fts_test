This study proposes a new hybrid video deinterlacing algorithm method featuring a novel approach to qualify the reliability of motion vectors. The algorithm switches between motion-compensated and enhanced edge-based line averaging (ELA) methods based on motion vector reliability. When the motion vectors are calculated, reverse motion estimation (RME) is applied to the optimal matching block. A motion vector is assumed reliable if the result of RME refers to the original block or to a block in its vicinity. Motion compensation is used when motion vectors are reliable to improve the vertical resolution and enhanced ELA is used when the motion vectors are not reliable to prevent artefacts. Experimental results show that RME performs better than previous approaches, based on objective and subjective criteria. The computational complexity of the proposed method is up to two orders of magnitude less than previous methods, while the quality of the output compares well with the best previously reported methods.

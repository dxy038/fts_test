Introduction: Airway obstructioy system could be varyies from a little change to a lifethreatening disorder. Clot in endotracheal can mimic clinical signs and radiographic changes in focal obstructive airway tract.

Clinical findings:n due to post intubation blood clot is seen in different situations. Its effects on respirator

We report the patient with severe hemoptysis due to tuberculosis. When the patient was under rigid bronchoscopy suddenly, tracheal ruptured and tracheal tube filled of bright red blood and clot. Obstruction was recorded. Ddiagnosis by clinical and para clinical and endoscopic evaluation. Initial treatments includes: lavage, suction and pull out of clot by forceps was done. The second treatments in this situation are rigid bronchoscopy, fogarty catheter and regional thrombolytic agents. If clot in endotracheal tube is established, treatment is changingchanges the tube as soon as possible. Delay can cause death or severe morbidities.

Conclusion:

Airway obstruction due to blood clot is rare but is a serious dangerous complication. Early diagnosis can be effective in prevention of life treatment disorders

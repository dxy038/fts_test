Prevention or management of pain is an important objective in root canal treatment. Post-endodontic pain has always been an important concern for patients and clinicians. Informing patients regarding the possibility of postendodontic pain and drug administration for its management can improve their trust in dentists, raise their pain threshold and increase their tendency to seek further dental treatments. This study aimed to assess the attitude of Hamadan dentists towards the administration of analgesics for the management of postendodontic pain. This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 in Hamadan city, Iran. Data was collected using a questionnaire including demographic information and questions about administration of analgesics for endodontic patients. All participants filled out the questionnaires anonymously. Collected data was analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 and descriptive statistics. Eighty questionnaires were completed by dentists. Most dentists reported to use ibuprofen mostly to alleviate mild to moderate and severe endodontic pain in healthy individuals. Only 42 dentists (52.5%) used intracanal medicaments to relieve pain. The overall level of knowledge of general dentists in Hamadan city about the prescription of analgesics was satisfactory. Dentists should be aware of the latest advancements in their field and maintain their level of knowledge by regularly participating in continuous education programs and accessing relevant scientific resources.

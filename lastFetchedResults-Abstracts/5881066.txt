An automation system which depends solely on production improvements has been developed recently focusing on the optimization system, maximization of the efficiency, stability of the system, convenience of operation, and compatibility. Various studies on enhancement of the automation system efficiency are being considered by many researchers and software developers in order to achieve maximum production improvement and optimization of operations in the effort to maximize the effectiveness of the automation system. The production measurement UPH (unit per hour) has been used to determine the automation system efficiency but the efficiency of each operation is calculated manually on the basis of the accumulated UPH in the conventional system. Therefore, more accurate efficiency measurements are required. The operational efficiency of the automation system has been measured using UPH to provide users with a more quantified and objective evaluation of the system. The user should provide the initiating time to operate the process so that the operation efficiency is obtained as results sorted by date of the operations

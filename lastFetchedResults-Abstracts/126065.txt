Objective(s): To compare bone mineral density of different skeletal sites and to assess the possibility of using one skeletal site for diagnosing osteoporosis as opposed to the two sites required in the WHO criteria.
Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out on 4229 patients referring to the BMD center of Shariati hospital from 1379-1382. Demographic data was collected. Dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed on all cases. BMD results were defined according to the WHO diagnostic criteria. Results: Data was collected from 4229 individuals (91.8% female and 8.2% male) with a mean age of 53.44Â±11 years. Prevalence of osteoporosis using the lumbar site was 24.8%, using the femoral site was 12A% and 27.8% according to the WHO criteria. Sensitivity of DXA at the lumbar spine was 88.9% and at the femoral site was 46.6%.
Conclusion: The sensitivity of the lumbar spine for the diagnosis of osteoporosis shown in this study is highly acceptable yet in order to establish an osteoporosis diagnostic guideline for the Iranian population prospective studies are required.

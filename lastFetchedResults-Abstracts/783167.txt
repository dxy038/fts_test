Objective This study was conducted to
explore how general practitioners (GPs) manage subjects
with early psychosis and collaborate with psychiatrists
in the care of such patients. Methods Survey
questionnaires exploring practice in patients with early
psychosis were mailed to all GPs in South-Western
France (n=3,829). Results The response rate was 23.6%.
Half of GPs responding to the survey had actually diagnosed
a possible case of schizophrenia during the
previous year. In such cases, the most frequent decision
was to refer the patient to a psychiatrist, despite
the difficulties of convincing the patient and obtaining
a rapid referral. According to GPs’ answers, the relationships
between primary care and the mental health
team were characterised by a lack of communication:
less than one out of three GPs had regular contact with
a mental health team, and a large majority reported
that they never or rarely had information about the
diagnosis and treatment of subjects referred for early
schizophrenia. Having regular contacts with mental
health services had a major impact on GPs’ management
of subjects with early schizophrenia, in particular
on reducing delays to obtain a psychiatric consultation
and on level of information on diagnosis and treatment
after referral. Conclusion Promotion of networking
between primary care and mental health services is
required to reduce delayed access to care in subjects
with early schizophrenia

Introduction: Spinal Anesthesia (S.A) is currently becoming a more common and popular method for orthopedic surgeries. Unfortunately, Backache (BA) and Post Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH) are both frequent and troublesome. Several factors (including needle shape and size, frequency rates of puncture attempts, and age and gender) have been shown to affect the rates of such complications. 
Objective: To determine these factors and evaluate some modalities to prevent them.
Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study on 200 patients-15 to 65 years old with class type 1 and 2 A.S.A(American Society of Anesthesiology), who were candidates for orthopedic lower extremity surgeries. Anesthetic procedure was performed using a standard 24G needle Lidocaine 5% plus Epinephrine. Symptom questionnaire was filled for the history of Headache and Backache and history of former S.A. post-op puncture complications of 1st day, 1st week and 1st month were added to the forms. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16 and the results were considered significant at p < 0.05.
Results: Rates of BA and PDPH were 12.5% and 17%, respectively. Post anesthetic BA for first day, week, and month were 16%, 9%, and 3.5%, respectively and PDPH were 6.5%. 3.5% and1% respectively with no significant differences. History of former spinal anesthesia with BA and PDPH revealed notable differences (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: The results of this study support the idea that history of previous spinal anesthesia could be a triggering factor for backache and headache in prior Spinal anesthetic procedures.

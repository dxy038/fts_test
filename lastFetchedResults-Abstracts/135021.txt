Objective (s): To assess job satisfaction and related factors in general practitioners (GPs) in Tehran, Iran. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Tehran between June and December 2003.
Data were collected via a 16-item questionnaire. We divided the city of Tehran into 5 zones based on the size of the resident population: Central Zone (Districts 6, 7, 10, 11, 12), Northern Zone (Districts 1-3), Southern Zone (Districts 15-20), Eastern Zone (Districts 4, 8, 13, 14) and Western Zone (Districts 5, 9, 21, 22). A sample of 934 was drawn proportionately form these zones, taking into the account the number of private GP offices active at the time of the survey.
Results: The mean age of the participants was 39.5y (SD = 9y). Eighty-seven percent of the subjects were male, and 91% were married. Overall, in 11% of the subjects the job satisfaction level was "high" or "very high". 41% showed intermediate-level and 48% had low or very low satisfaction with their jobs. Job satisfaction was found to be significantly related to age category (P<0.002), working experience (P=0.003) and ownership of the office's premises (P<0.0001). No statistically significant relationships were detected between job satisfaction and gender, marital status, or spouse's education. Likewise, there was no significant relationship between job satisfaction and the particular zone where the clinic was located (North, South, ...).
Conclusion: This study showed that older, well-established physicians (who have a better financial and welfare status) were more satisfied with their jobs. Hence, there is need to provide the fast-growing population of young medical graduate with more equitable and attractive job opportunities in order to achieve greater job satisfaction and higher professional standards.

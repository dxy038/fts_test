A Single item EOQ model is modeled using crisp arithmetic approach in decision making
process with demand unit cost and dynamic setup cost varies with the quantity
produced/Purchased. This paper considers the modification of objective function and storage
area in the presence of estimated parameters. The model is developed for the problem by
employing NLP modeling approaches over an infinite planning horizon. It incorporates all
concepts of crisp arithmetic approach, the quantity ordered, the demand per unit and compares
with other model that of the crisp would optimal ordering policy of the problem over an infinite
time horizon is also suggested. Investigation of the properties of an optimal solution allows
developing an algorithm for obtaining solution through LINGO 13.0 version whose validity is
illustrated through an example problem. Sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution is also
studied with respect to changes in different parameter values and to draw managerial insights.

The objective of tolerance analysis is to check the extent and nature of variation of an analyzed dimension or geometric feature of interest for a given GD & T scheme. The parametric approach to tolerance analysis is based on parametric constraint solving. The accuracy of simulation results is dependent on the user-defined modeling scheme. Once an accurate CAD model is developed, it is integrated with tolerance synthesis model. In order to make it cost competent, it is necessary to obtain the cost-tolerance relationships. The neural network recently has been reported to be an effective statistical tool for determining relationship between input factors and output responses. This study deals development of direct constraint model in CAD, which is integrated to an optimal tolerance design problem. A back-propagation (BP) network is applied to fit the cost-tolerance relationship. An optimization method based on Differential Evolution (DE) is then used to locate the combination of controllable factors (tolerances) to optimize the output response (manufacturing cost plus quality loss) using the equations stemming from the trained network. A tolerance synthesis problem for a motor assembly is used to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology.

To reduce the effect of network jitter, the playout algorithm for voice streams should correctly adjust the playout delay. Conventional playout algorithms were based on network delay only: they did not consider the perceptual quality, and were not aware the codec and interactive mode. Therefore, we present two novel approaches: codec aware adaptive playout (CAAP) algorithm and interactive aware adaptive playout (IAAP) algorithm, which intent to optimize the voice quality based on codec and interactive mode respectively. The performance of CAAP and IAAP are superior to the prior algorithms in our substantial evaluation. Since no objective mechanisms for measuring the speech quality of two-way communication exist, we also propose a new quality measurement for it.

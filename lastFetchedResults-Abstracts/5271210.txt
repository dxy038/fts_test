In order to find and eliminate the existing and potential errors in the process of decision making, one should be able to understand the laws of erring. However, knowing the laws of erring is not the objective. Especially, for the complex system, the failure of the system is due to complicated inter-connected errors. Therefore, there is a necessity to find an approach or theory to decompose the intricate and hard-understood error system to simple and understandable components. In this paper, some features of error logic decomposition connective will be presented and followed by some simple examples to illustrate the complex mathematical formulations.

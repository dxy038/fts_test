We study the interaction of a stream with a sloping unconfined aquifer that the stream is assumed to fully penetrate. The analysis applies to flow in a vertical section, considers the existence of a low-conductivity streambed layer and the flow in the aquifer to be induced by variations of the stream stage. Invoking the Dupuit assumption yields the 1-D Boussinesq equation, extended for a sloping base. The Boussinesq equation is linearised, the derived flow model is critiqued and an objective procedure for determining the linearisation level is developed. We solve the linear governing equation by the method of Laplace transform, with analytical inversion; the horizontal-aquifer case is treated in the zero-slope limit. The system response function is derived for the general case (sloping aquifer, sediment bed layer) and for several specific cases, and solutions are verified against known analytical results. Responses are contrasted for aquifers on positive, negative and zero slopes to step changes in the stage of streams with and without a sediment bed layer. The solutions give the aquifer stage and flow rate, the flow exchange rate at the streamâ€“aquifer interface and the exchanged water volumes (bank storage/release).

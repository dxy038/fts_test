The amount of images contained in repositories or available on Internet has exploded over the last years. In order to retrieve efficiently one or several images in a database, the development of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems has become an intensively active research area. However, most proposed systems are keyword-based and few imply the end-user during the search (through relevance feedback). Visual low-level descriptors are then substituted to keywords but there is a gap between visual description and user expectations. We propose a new framework which combines a multi-objective interactive genetic algorithm, allowing a trade-off between image features and user evaluations, and a support vector machine to learn the user relevance feedback. We test our system on SIMPLIcity database, commonly used in the literature to evaluate CBIR systems using a genetic algorithm, and it outperforms the recent frameworks.

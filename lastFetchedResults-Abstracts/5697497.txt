This document proposes the integration of different controller methodologies on a VSC (Voltage Source Converter) based HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) stations and an active filter simultaneously. Hybrid control involves three different control techniques as follows: a discrete controller, which is in charge to regulate the voltage in the rectifier station, a fuzzy design manages the power flow in the inverter station toward the ac grid and a fuzzy controller is added to the active filter with the objective to reduce harmonic current in the VSC - HVDC stations. Simulation results validate the control performance in the whole system.

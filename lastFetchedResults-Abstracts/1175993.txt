Abstract
Background and objective: Pigeons are potential resources of spreading many zoonotic pathogens such as Salmonella and avian influenza.Therefore the presence of these species of birds which was exposed with human population would result in spreading of Salmonellosis and avian influenza within people. One of the prominent characteristics of religious places is the presence of pigeons, so pilgrims and service providers are highly exposed to these birds and their feces. Pigeons as reservoir of these agents would transmit these diseases to pilgrims and public as a whole.
Materials and methods: In this survey which was conducted in 2009,cloaca swabs and blood samples of 220 pigeons were taken in the holy shrine of Fatima Masooma.Serum samples were examined with haemagglutination inhibition test by using H7, H5 and H9N2 antigens and cloaca swabs were cultivated to detect salmonella spp.
Results: It was founded that none of the serum samples had antibodies titers against H5 and H7 antigens.However in 2 cases (1/8%),1 and 3 titers of antibodies were detected against H9N2. Moreover, none of feces’ samples were positive in salmonella culture.
Conclusion: Because these pigeons haven’t had any history of influenza vaccination, the low titers of antibodies against this virus could represent infection by wild virus. Although the results of cultivating feces were negative,however because of the presence of Iranian and foreign pilgrims in the holy shrine and the important role of pigeons in maintenance and transmission of these pathogens, health and hygiene controls must be considered for the population of these birds as a reservoir of potential infection.

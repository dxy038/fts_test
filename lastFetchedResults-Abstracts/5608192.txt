We demonstrated experimentally that the dispersion of a Zeiss 40&#215; /1.2 Achroplan objective can be compensated by means of chirped mirrors over a bandwidth of 170 nm at 800 nm. The interferometric autocorrelation trace recorded at the focus of the microscope objective with a two-photon diode indicated a pulse duration of &lt;14 fs.

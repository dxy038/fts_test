Background Psychiatric disorders and
hypertension both independently increase risk for
heart disease, cardiac events, and healthcare utilization.
However, the contribution of specific psychiatric
disorders to healthcare utilization in persons with
hypertension is unknown. Objective To evaluate
associations between psychiatric disorders and receipt
of hospital care in people with hypertension.
Design Cross-sectional epidemiologic survey. Subjects
A total of 8,812 hypertensive individuals drawn
from a randomly selected sample of 43,093 US adults.
Main outcomes Participants were assessed in-person
for a range of mental disorders (using the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV),
hypertension status (self-report), and past-year
occurrence of emergency room treatment and overnight
hospital stay (self-report). Results After controlling
for demographics and clinical variables,
persons having any lifetime mood, anxiety, or personality
disorders had increased likelihood of emergency
room treatment [odds ratios (ORs) = 1.26,
1.18, and 1.47, respectively]. Persons having any
mood or personality disorder had increased likelihood
of overnight hospital stay (ORs = 1.24 and 1.31,
respectively). The specific disorders significantly
associated with emergency room treatment were
lifetime major depression, lifetime manic disorder,
past-year major depression, past-year manic disorder,
past-year panic disorder without agoraphobia, and
paranoid, histrionic, antisocial, obsessiveâ€“compulsive
personality disorders, with ORs ranging from 1.25 to
2.41. The specific disorders significantly associated
with overnight hospital stay were lifetime dysthymia,
lifetime manic disorder, past-year major depression,
past-year manic disorder, and histrionic, antisocial,
and paranoid personality disorders, with ORs ranging
from 1.40 to 1.87. Conclusion Results suggest that
addressing mental health problems in persons with
hypertension may decrease healthcare utilization.

Objective (s): To investigate on consequences of living with HIV/AIDS. 
Methods: This was a qualitative study. Initially we selected a convenience sample and then narrowed-down the sample by maximum diversity in terms of age and education. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews. All interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the codes were extracted after reviewing them several times. Content analysis was performed to explore the data.
Results: In all 34 participants were interviewed: 32 HIV positive men (with age average: 37.5 years and standard deviation: 7.13) and 4 HIV positive women (with age average: 34 years and standard deviation: 3.04) Participants indicated the following consequences: social, psychological, physical and economic. Most participants referred to adverse social outcome as the most important consequences of living with HIV/AIDS. The most important social adverse effect mentioned by participants was stigma, discrimination and exclusion. 
Conclusion: The findings suggest that stigma and discrimination should be lessening for people who live with HIV/AID. Perhaps media could play an important role to achieve this.

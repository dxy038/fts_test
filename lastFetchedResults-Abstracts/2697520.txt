Simple and accurate circuit simulation models for high-voltage silicon carbide power MOSFETs and Schottky barrier diodes are presented and validated. The models are physics-based and consist of minimal number of model parameters that can be easily extracted from simple static I-V and C-V measurements. The models are used in a buck-boost bidirectional dc-dc converter, with and without an antiparallel Schottky diode. The efficiency of the converter was analyzed for synchronous and nonsynchronous operation of the switches. An optimal selection of the antiparallel Schottky diode is proposed to minimize the cost of the converter without compromising its efficiency.

Green IT and computing are key areas to contribute with the environment sustainability. Recent researches have been exploring tools, practices, process, frameworks, reference models in Green IT, as well as they are mitigating the impact of the technology on the user of raw materials, electrical energy costs, greenhouse gas emissions or generation e-waste. Sizing up earnings and costs of green practices and processes will allow that software organizations can invest more in environment actions. This paper presents a systematic mapping study about green metrics, with objective to discover the state-of-the art drived by software engineering.

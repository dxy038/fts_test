A motion-adaptive variable-bit-rate (VBR) video codec is considered, and a motion-classified model is developed to represent the characteristics of various classes of motion activities, including scene changes. The codec switches between interframe, motion-compensated, and intraframe coding corresponding to low, medium, and high amounts of motion and scene changes, respectively. The model captures the motion of various video scenes by providing the statistics of VBR-coded video traffic through a first-order autoregressive process with time-varying parameters. The parameters of this model are obtained from a VBR-coded sample video sequence with the objective of matching the bit-rate distribution and the autocorrelation among the bit rates. The validity and accuracy of the model are evaluated, and the characteristics of aggregated traffic sources obtained with the model are discussed

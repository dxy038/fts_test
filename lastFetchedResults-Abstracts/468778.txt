Objective
In adults, nutrient intake is controlled by opposing actions of appetite stimulants (eg, neuropeptide Y [NPY]) and suppressors (eg, leptin). Because NPY may exert a preferential role in mediating adult carbohydrate intake, we sought to determine the effect of central NPY on near-term fetal carbohydrate ingestion.
Study design
Five pregnant ewes and fetuses were prepared with fetal vascular, sublingual, and intracerebroventricular catheters, electrocorticogram, and esophageal electromyogram electrodes and studied at 131±2 days' gestation. After a 2-hour baseline period, 10% sucrose was infused sublingually for the duration of the study. At 4 hours' time, NPY was injected into the fetal cerebral ventricles and fetal swallowing monitored for an additional 6 hours.
Results
During the basal period, mean (±SEM) swallowing averaged 0.8±0.1 swallows per minute. Fetal swallowing increased significantly in response to sublingual sucrose (1.3±0.1 swallows/min, P = .001), and further significantly increased at 4 to 6 hours after NPY injection into the cerebral ventricles (1.8±0.3, P = .001).
Conclusion
These results indicate central NPY stimulation of fetal ingestion beyond that resulting from sublingual 10% sucrose. The in utero development of NPY-induced ingestive behavior may be in preparation for high neonatal caloric intake.

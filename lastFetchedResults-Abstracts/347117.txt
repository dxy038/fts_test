Objective: To describe the association between a unilateral mid-temporal rhythmic theta discharge (‘psychomotor variant of Gibbs’) with neuroimaging-demonstrated underlying mass lesion.
Methods: Standard routine awake and scalp electroencephalography, continuous video-EEG monitoring and magnetic resonance brain imaging were employed in the diagnostic work-up of a 9-year-old boy with a severe behavioural disturbance and episodic outbursts of aggression.
Results: EEG showed a unilateral mid-temporal rhythmic discharge which was continuous in drowsiness and which remained confined to the right hemisphere. MRI showed a lesion in the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle displacing superiorly the white matter stem of the right temporal lobe.
Conclusion: A rhythmic mid-temporal theta discharge, commonly regarded as a benign EEG variant, may, in some patients, reflect underlying structural pathology. Neuroimaging should be considered particularly when this EEG pattern remains confined to one hemisphere.

The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of oligonucleotide structure on the formation and biological properties of oligonucleotide/poly-L-lysine (ODN/PLL) complexes, or "oligoplexes". Two structurally different ODN sequences RBG (rabbit &#946; globin) 33 and RBG147 were used in the study. The difference in ODN binding and hence complex formation was analyzed by a gel retardation assay. In addition, complex formation in buffer versus in serum-free medium was studied. The oligoplexes also displayed different cellular uptake efficiencies. Differences in the biological activity were attributed to the varying characteristics of the oligoplexes due to ODN structural difference.

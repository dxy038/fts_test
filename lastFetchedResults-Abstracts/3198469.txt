Bidirectional Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) systems are preferred for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) applications. Typically, bidirectional IPT systems consist of high order resonant networks, and therefore, the control of bidirectional IPT systems has always been a difficulty. To date several different controllers have been reported, but these have been designed using steady-state models, which invariably, are incapable of providing an accurate insight into the dynamic behaviour of the system A dynamic state-space model of a bidirectional IPT system has been reported. However, currently this model has not been used to optimise the design of controllers. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimised controller based on the dynamic model. To verify the operation of the proposed controller simulated results of the optimised controller and simulated results of another controller are compared. Results indicate that the proposed controller is capable of accurately and stably controlling the power flow in a bidirectional IPT system.

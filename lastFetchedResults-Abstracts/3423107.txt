Coordination is defined as the decision problem of a control unit embedded in a hierarchical multilevel system. The strategy for coordination is derived by using two principles termed the interaction balance and the interaction prediction principle, respectively. A family of interacting subsystems is then considered as coordinable via a coordination principle and relative to an objective valid for the overall system if the lower level control problems can be influenced so that the overall task is achieved. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the coordinability of a class of dynamic systems are derived using a variational approach. The results are applied to systems described by differential equations.

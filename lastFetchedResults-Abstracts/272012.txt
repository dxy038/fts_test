An inverse homogenization problem for two-phase viscoelastic composites is formulated as a topology
optimization problem. The eective complex moduli are estimated by the numerical homogenization using the ®nite
element method. Sensitivity analysis shows that the sensitivity calculations do not require the solution of any adjoint
problem. The objective function is de®ned so that the topology optimization problem ®nds microstructures of
viscoelastic composites which exhibit improved stiness/damping characteristics within the speci®ed operating
frequency range. Design constraints include volume fraction, eective complex moduli, geometric symmetry and
material symmetry. Several numerical design examples are presented with discussions on the nature of the designed
microstructures. From the designed microstructures, it is found that mechanism-like structures and wavy structures
are formed to maximize damping while retaining stiness at the desired level.

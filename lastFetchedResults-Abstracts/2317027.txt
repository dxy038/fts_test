Objective (s): Computerized physician order entry system has been introduced as an effective tool to reduce errors and to increase patient safety. This study was conducted to investigate the acceptance rate of the system if implemented.
Methods: This was a descriptive study. The study was conducted in three teaching hospitals in Kerman, Iran in 2013. All physicians were invited to participated in the study. Data was collected using a questionnaire consisting of three parts: the description of CPOE, respondents’ demographics and questions about the study objectives. Data was described by median and quartiles and was analyzed using nonparametric methods.
Results: In all 633 physicians were studied. Fifty-seven percent of physicians agreed with CPOE ease of use, 45% with CPOE usefulness and 32% with its positive effect on clinicians’ workflow. There were significant relationships between system ease of use and usefulness with physician’s age and gender.
Conclusion: The results showed that physicians would accept CPOE system to a good extent, if it were implemented. Younger doctors have a greater readiness to accept the system.

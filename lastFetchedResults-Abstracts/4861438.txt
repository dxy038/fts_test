The objective of the paper is to illustrate the potential impacts on operating costs associated with a variety of different ´UMTS network sharing´ scenarios such as sharing site locations, RNS (radio network subsystem) equipment, transmission, core network, national roaming and MVNO (mobile virtual network operators). Comparisons are made between a generic reference network design, obtained using simplified dimensioning tools (see Kromer, J., ibid., p.281-8), and a number of network sharing options currently under consideration in the market place. In addition to covering areas such as sharing sites, node B equipment, RNC (radio network controller), core network and transmission costs, installation and operation issues are also considered. Regulatory and standards issues related to network sharing are included in the analysis. The relative merits of each network sharing scenario are presented and sharing recommendations for the different phases of network deployment are provided.

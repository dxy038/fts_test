Presents a control design method for diesel engines equipped with a variable geometry turbocharger and an exhaust gas recirculation valve. Our control objective is to regulate the air-fuel ratio and the fraction of recirculated exhaust gas to their respective set points that depend on engine operating conditions. Interactions between the two actuators and nonlinear behavior of the system make the problem difficult to handle using classical control design methods. Instead, we employ a control Lyapunov function (CLF) based nonlinear control design method because it possesses a guaranteed robustness property equivalent to gain and phase margins. The CLF is constructed using input-output linearization of a reduced order diesel engine model. The controller has been tested in simulations on the full order model as well as experimentally in the dynamometer test cell

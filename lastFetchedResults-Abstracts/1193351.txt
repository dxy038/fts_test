The objective of this research is to establish a model that can predict chloride transport phenomena in sound and cracked concrete. The chloride diffusivity is formulated based on computed micro-pore structure, which considers tortuosity and constrictivity of porous network as reduction factors in terms of complex micro-pore structure and electric interaction of chloride ions and pore wall. In the real environment, concrete structures are not always crack-free, therefore chloride transport in cracked concrete is also simulated by section large void spaces in a control volume to represent the crack and by proposing a model of chloride diffusivity through the cracked region The proposed models are implemented into a finite-element computational program DuCOM, which simulates the early-age development process of cementitious materials. The calculated concentration profiles of total chloride ions are verified through a comparison with experiments results.

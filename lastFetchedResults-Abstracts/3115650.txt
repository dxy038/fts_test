Objective: To evaluate the sub-health based on the modern diagnostic technique of TCM. Method: We draw assistance from diagnostic technique of TCM, use synthesis of the four diagnostic methods, combine the digital and informational diagnostic technique such as the diagnosis of pulse, glossoscopy, the diagnosis of facial complexion, the diagnosis of meridian, and so on, then with the neural network technique to collect the information of sub-health qualitatively and quantitatively, achieve the early diagnosis of sub-health. Result: The modern diagnostic technique of TCM thoroughly absorbs the advantage of diagnostic-technique of TCM with information-collecting precisely and comprehensively, early diagnosis and synchronization of diagnosis and treatment, meanwhile, it uses the modern information technology, overcomes the subjective influence of the evaluation methods nowadays such as scale evaluation, detection evaluation, solves the embarrassed state of modern detection technique in sub-health, establishes the foundation of evaluation system and standard of sub-health. Besides, it successfully avoids the disadvantage of the diagnostic technique of TCM with high expertise require, which is used for clinic. Conclusion: The modern diagnostic technique of TCM achieves the objective, microcosmic, and non-traumatic diagnosis in sub-health, so it has distinct superiority in sub-health evaluation, and we can hope to solve the sub-health problem finally with it.

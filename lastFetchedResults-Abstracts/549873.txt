Mastitis is the in!ammatory reaction of the udder to invading pathogens, characterized by pathologi-
cal changes in the mammary tissue, an increase in the number of somatic cells, physical, chemical and
microbiological changes in the milk. The objective of the present study was to determine plasma, total
antioxidant status in the cows with subclinical mastitis and healthy cows. Milk and heparinized blood
samples were collected from 45 normal cows and 45 cows with subclinical mastitis from dairy cattle
in khouzestan province, Behbahan, Iran. The result showed that the most dominant isolated bacte-
rium from subclinical mastitis samples was staphylococcus aureus (N=17). No signi"cant difference
(P > 0.05) was shown between plasma TAS concentrations in the studied groups. The correlation be-
tween SCC and total antioxidant status was negative and signi"cant (P < 0.001).
Optimum antioxidant intake in the feed may enhance the resistance against subclinical mastitis.

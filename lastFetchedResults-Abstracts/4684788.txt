Atmospheric correction schemes, using various levels of approximation, are described to retrieve surface bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) and directional hemispherical reflectances (albedos) from multi-angle radiance measurements. Observational scenarios include measurements from space-based and airborne platforms and from the ground. The retrieval schemes are tested on simulated data incorporating realistic BRFs and atmospheric models containing aerosols. It is assumed that the optical properties of the atmosphere are known well enough to model the radiative effects in the retrieval process. Sensitivity of the atmospherically-corrected BRFs and associated hemispherical reflectances to various aerosol properties and the Sun-view geometry is illustrated

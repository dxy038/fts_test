The present paper describes a new method for solving the problem in which the
objective function is a fractional function, and where the constraint functions are in
the form of linear inequalities. The proposed method is based mainly upon simplex
method, which is very easy to understand and apply. This can be illustrated with the
help of numerical examples.

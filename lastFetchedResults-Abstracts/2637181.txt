The main objective of this project is efficiency evaluation of nanofilteration membrane in Barium
removal from dewatering unit and effective parameters investigation of this method. In this research, the
temperature, pressure and pH are considered as a operational parameters in a pilot nanofilteration
membrane for removing a real sample.
Taguchi method and Qualitek-4 software are selected to acquire optimum operational condition and
experimental designing. On this basis, 16 tests with 2 times repetition, totally 32 tests, are carried out.
Based on the obtained results, the optimum operational conditions to remove barium are T= 20C0, P=170
PSI and pH=4.
The efficiency in Barium removal is 88.4%, which the initial Barium concentration is reduced from
209 Mg/L to 24.5 Mg/L Furthermore, the water recovery factor is about 47.17 %, which its proper
efficiency shows that this method is suitable from high volume purification of wastewater.

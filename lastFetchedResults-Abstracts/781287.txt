Basic and applied research on physiology of reproduction in alpacas and llamas has gained much importance in the last
decades because of their increasing economic value. Reproductive biotechnologywould allowpropagation of genetically superior
individuals, especially those with excellent quality fiber. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the most
relevant subjects related to reproductive biotechnology in female and the male. In the female, follicular synchronization, ovarian
superstimulation, embryo recovery and transfer, oocyte maturation, assisted reproduction techniques (in vitro fertilization, ICSI),
nuclear transfer and embryo cryopreservation are reviewed. In the male, this review concerns artificial insemination.

Objective: This study was undertaken to determine by means of color power angiography the longitudinal changes in the diameters and the flow volumes of 4 major fetal arteries during gestation. Study Design: The middle cerebral artery, the ascending aorta, the descending aorta, and the renal arteries in 81 appropriate-for-gestational-age fetuses were examined longitudinally between 24 and 38 weeks’ gestation by means of color power angiography. In addition to measurement of the diameters of these arteries, Doppler velocimetry was performed. Flow volume was calculated from the cross-sectional areas of the arteries and the velocity integral of the Doppler waveforms. Results: The mean (±SD) gestational age at delivery and birth weight were 39.8 ± 1.6 weeks and 3326 ± 345 g, respectively. The diameters and flow volumes of all the arteries increased significantly as gestational age advanced. Flow volume increased from 39 ± 19.0 mL/min to 140 ± 63.9 mL/min in the middle cerebral artery, from 216.2 ± 77.6 to 937.4 mL/min in the ascending aorta, from 124.4 ± 76.6 to 390.0 mL/min in the descending aorta, and from 27.5 ± 16.8 to 80.3 ± 57.3 mL/min in the renal arteries. When blood flow volume was adjusted to milliliters per kilogram body weight, an initial significant fall in blood flow was seen in all the vessels to a minimal level at 30 weeks’ gestation; blood flow rose thereafter, although not significantly, until term. The ratios of flow volume in the ascending aorta to those in the other vessels increased with gestation, with the highest ratio being that between the ascending aorta and the renal arteries. Conclusion: Identification of fetal arteries with color power angiography is easy and highly sensitive. The distributions of blood flow in various fetal arteries exhibited regional differences, with significantly more blood flow to the brain. These normative baseline values may be useful in the diagnosis of congenital cardiac anomalies and also in the diagnosis and monitoring of fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction.

This paper presents an approach for nonlinear parameter estimation which is based on differential geometric properties of a nonconvex objective function. The parameter search mechanism is sustained on a polynomial approximation of patches of the cost functional. This approach is able to capture moving local minima and force the trajectory to the global minimum in a relative broad region. A selected example shows the features of the proposed approach

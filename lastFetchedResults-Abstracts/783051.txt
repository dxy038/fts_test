Background Measures of perceived coercion
at psychiatric hospital admission have been developed.
We aimed to investigate predictors of perceived
coercion in subjects admitted to psychiatric hospital in
the UK, and to test the hypothesis that high perceived
coercion at admission predicts poor engagement with
community follow-up.Method A cohort of consecutively
admitted subjects were interviewed at admission and
before discharge, and were followed prospectively for 10
months. Service use and compliance with care were
rated from case notes and by clinicians.Results One hundred
interviews were obtained from 118 consecutive admissions
(85 %). Compulsory admission was strongly
associated with perceived coercion,but one-third of voluntary
patients felt highly coerced, and two-thirds were
not certain they were free to leave hospital. Greater age,
less insight, and non-white ethnicity were associated
with high perceived coercion. Perceived coercion did
not predict engagement with follow-up. Conclusions
Services recognise provision of care in the least restrictive
setting as a key objective.Perceived coercion should
be regarded as an important outcome measure in service
evaluation.

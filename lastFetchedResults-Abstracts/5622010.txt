The problem of systematically determining the optimal design for an unmanned Mars-roving vehicle is considered. A system model, identifying all feasible designs, is generated by consideration of the physical constraints on the design parameters, and the requirement that the system be deliverable to the Mars surface. An expression which evaluates system performance relative to mission goals is developed. The model and objective function together allow simulation of the effects of design trade-offs upon system performance for all feasible designs. Nonlinear programming techniques are utilized to identify the optimal design.

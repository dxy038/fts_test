BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vascularization of the developing vertebrate brain occurs exclusively via angiogenesis and formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature capillaries originating in the cortical brain perineural vascular plexus. In this study, vasculogenesis in cerebral cortex of rat newborns was investigated.
METHODS: Newborns Wistar rat (among 5-15 days after birth) were used. After fixation, the brain of all specimens was processed, serially sectioned and vasculogenesis process by using morphometrical methods and histological studies were carried out. The brain blood volume density was measured and after that data were analyzed.
FINDINGS: Our findings revealed that in the first phase of vasculogenesis, endothelial cells formed uncanalized buds which grew out from the body of a principal artery (PA) and extended to same bud in other blood vessel. Later, primitive vascular lumen developed to a sufficient size to allow for the circulation of blood cells. These processes increased continuously until 8 postnatal days.
CONCLUSION: These data suggested that in the vasculogenesis of cerebral cortex, there are two steps. In the first phase, there is a migration and translocation endothelial cell during vascular bud forming and lead to cellular cords and in the second phase, the primary vascular cords change to vascular endothelial cell chaining and occurring a canalization process among them for blood circulation.

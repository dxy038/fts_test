A WDM fiber optic link is considered for transmitting the reference signals for distances of less than 10 km. The quantification and analysis of phase noise caused by the link is the main objective of this work. The RF phase noise is investigated under different experimental setups so that the additive effect of different components in the link can be examined. Moreover, the influence of wavelength selection and power on the noise is also studied.

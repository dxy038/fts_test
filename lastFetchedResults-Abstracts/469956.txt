Objective
This study was undertaken to compare grief resolution after dilation and evacuation (D&E) or induction of labor (IOL) for second-trimester pregnancy termination.
Study design
A prospective cohort of 49 women choosing second-trimester abortion caused by fetal anomalies by either medical IOL or D&E. Depression was evaluated by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and bereavement was assessed by using the Perinatal Grief Scale with follow-up to 12 months after pregnancy termination. Data were analyzed with Ï‡2 tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and independent and paired sample t tests.
Results
There was no significant difference in depression incidence on enrollment (61.9% D&E, 53.8% IOL, P = .579), at 4 months (23.5% D&E, 14.3% IOL, P = .252) or 12 months (27.3% D&E, 20.0% IOL, P = .696) or on the PGS at 4 months (74.1 vs 90.2, P = .351) or 12 months (73.3 vs 86.4, P = .658).
Conclusion
There is no significant difference in grief resolution among women who terminate a desired pregnancy by either medical or surgical abortion.

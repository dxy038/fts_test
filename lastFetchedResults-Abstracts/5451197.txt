In the third-generation mobile communications network, to address the actions the user can at any time any place for high-speed data transfer. So an extension of the use of 4G technology is WiMAX mobile network. Technology combines mobile communications and IP network integrated IP voice communications into a mobile network of the world. This development has been advanced from IEEE802.16 to 802.16e for mobile communications network. The technology is available to users in the world of mobile communications and IP network communication with each other and achieves high bandwidth data access efficiency. The main objective of this thesis is to present a physical measurement in the 802.16e environment. For the actual nature of the open and non-open terrain environment or a fixed-point measurement with non-fixed-point of the actual data transfer rate. The signal strength to provide users to understands the 802.16e system. The how many signal can be received how many data and how many signal can transfer. How long distance with can be know the cell to cell in how many distance need to do the hand-over request. It looks forward to the 4th generation mobile communications network (WiMAX) can contribute to.

We experimentally demonstrate bidirectional transmission in a multisignal orthogonal frequency division multiplexing hybrid optical-wireless long reach passive optical network with a colorless optical network unit (ONU), and the optical seed generated at remote node (RN) 75 km away from optical line termination. The main impairments are quantified and the most limiting is shown to be Rayleigh backscattering beating noise. To overcome it, the ONU optical gain is increased and a transmission reach exceeding 25 km beyond the RN is achieved.

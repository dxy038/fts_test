Objective
Interhemispheric and intrahemispheric balance models may be integrated to gain an increased understanding of how cerebral systems are involved in the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure. We sought to examine the relationship between left and right frontal and posterior activity and resting heart rate and blood pressure. Based on this integration, we predicted that lateral (left minus right hemisphere) and longitudinal (frontal minus posterior regions) asymmetry in cerebral activity would be related to resting measures of heart rate and blood pressure.
Methods
Resting heart rate, blood pressure, and EEG (low and high beta) were obtained in a sample of 42 men. Physiological measures were obtained during an eyes closed resting period.
Results
Our results provided partial support, finding significant correlations between resting heart rate and not only frontal lobe lateral asymmetry but also frontalâ€“parietal asymmetry.
Conclusions
These results provide support for the relative differential associations of the left and right frontal and parietal lobes and cardiovascular activity.
Significance
Previous research has not examined cerebral control of cardiovascular functioning from a functional cerebral systems perspective. The results are discussed as they relate to research on aggression and hostility.

Lymphodepletion followed by adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of autologous, tumor-reactive T cells boosts antitumor immunotherapeutic activity in mouse and in humans. In the most recent clinical trials, lymphodepletion together with ACT has an objective response rate of 50% in patients with solid metastatic tumors. The mechanisms underlying this recent advance in cancer immunotherapy are beginning to be elucidated and include: the elimination of cellular cytokine ‘sinks’ for homeostatic γC-cytokines, such as interleukin-7 (IL-7), IL-15 and possibly IL-21, which activate and expand tumor-reactive T cells; the impairment of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells that suppress tumor-reactive T cells; and the induction of tumor apoptosis and necrosis in conjunction with antigen-presenting cell activation. Knowledge of these factors could be exploited therapeutically to improve the in vivo function of adoptively transferred, tumor-reactive T cells for the treatment of cancer.

The objective of the Virtual Laboratory for the Disabled is to create a realistic, real-time, electrical engineering virtual laboratory. This project targets individuals who do not have adequate mobility of their upper bodies to perform laboratory experiments. To provide a more realistic and enhanced learning experience, the users of the virtual laboratory are allowed the freedom to build and test a wide variety of realistic electrical circuits, and be able to perform curriculum-based experiments. The main goal is to create an environment similar to a real electrical engineering laboratory, and to offer the user a way to learn the different aspects of instrumentation and circuitry

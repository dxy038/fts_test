The objective of this study was to study the effect of pL.:J.nllng: patterns and plant density
on yield and yield componens of corn (Hybrid K,S.C 704). The research 'vas carried out
in Agricultural Research Station of Azad University in Ahwaz. The trial was arranged In
factorial with randomized complete hlock design with three rcnhcations. Om: factor W.1S
planting patterns (one-row and two-row planting on a ridge] and another factor was three
levels of plant distances on each row (25, 30 and 35 centimeters). The findings in the
present study showed that planting patterns had sigmrlcant cffccts on the number of cubs
per square and the number of seeds on one row of cub, hut the other yield component\
v'ere not statistically significant. Effect of planung patterns had significant effect 1111
gram yield. The maximum and the minimum grain yield product bclouged to two-row
planting (2655 kg! ha) and one-row planting {2411 kg/ haj respcctively. with respect to the
effect of plant density for yield components, the results showed that the number of seeds
per row on cubs was highly affected hy plant density but in Lase of other yield
components the result was not significant. furthermore, the grain yield indicates thai the
effect of plant density on grain yield was varidable in which the hlghesl and the lowest
grain yield were obtained for 25 and 35 centimeters seed distances (2671 kg.'lm and 21.14
kg/ha respectively).

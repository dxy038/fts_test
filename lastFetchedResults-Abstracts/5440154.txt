Many optimization theoretic based rate allocation strategies have been developed for allocating some optimal rates to the competing users in wireless ad hoc networks. By considering different objective functions (such as congestion level, total packet loss and so on), the researchers propose some optimization framework by which the problem can be solved. Due to the rapid increase in the development of different video applications in such environments and the existence of difficulties in satisfying the prespecified QoS limits, increasing the received video quality can be considered as an important and challenging issue. The quality of the received video stream is inversely proportional to the amount of distortion which is being imposed on the video stream by the network packet loss and the video encoder. The main objective of the current paper is to introduce an optimization framework in which by optimal rate allocation to some competing video sources, the aggregate distortion of the all of the sources be minimized. The simulation results verify the claims.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate Event-Related Potentials of affective working memory in BAS and BIS personality. 
Methods: In this study, 502 participants completed the self-report BAS/BIS Scales (carver & white 1994). 18 subjects (10 subjects in BAS and 8 subjects in BIS) were selected. ERPs were measured while subjects answered working memory task contain of positive and negative pictures. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to analyze the data. For negative pictures, BAS subjects exhibited larger P300 amplitude than BIS subjects. 
Results: For positive pictures, BIS subjects compared to BAS subjects showed longer P100 latency and BAS subjects exhibited larger N200 amplitude than BIS subjects. For negative pictures, BIS subjects compared to BAS subjects, showed larger N200 amplitude and BAS subjects exhibited larger P300 amplitude than BIS subjects. 
Conclusion: Most of the findings confirm The Gray Affective Personality Theory (1987). The BIS subjects were sensitive to negative pictures and the BAS subjects were sensitive to positive pictures. Most of the findings confirm The Gray Affective Personality Theory (1987). The BIS subjects were sensitive to negative pictures and the BAS subjects were sensitive to positive pictures. For P300 component, Gray Model didnâ€™t prove. It seems P300 is a suitable component to study affective processing in BAS because P300 showed high frontal affective processing in BAS subjects especially to negative pictures.

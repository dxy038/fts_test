In this research, the capability of a multicolony Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is applied to multiobjective waste load allocation problem. In order to derive nondominated solutions, three different models are used. Two of them are biobjective and the remaining one is a three-objective model. In the first model, minimization of cost and DO violation along the stream flow is considered as multi objective optimization problem, while for the second case, minimization of the cost and equity is investigated. For the third optimization problem, minimization of cost along with equity and DO violation are considered. For the all case studies, the Pareto front is derived which enhances the decision maker to choose one which more suitable for him/her according to the priorities. The case study is the Wilmate river in Oregon State of US. The following research shows the capability of NA-ACO in multiobjective optimization of waste load allocation problem. According to the discrete pattern of decision variables in the ACO algorithm, it can be easily map to practical waste load allocation problems.

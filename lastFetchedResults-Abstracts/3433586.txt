The Board of Governors of the IEEE Engineering Management Society has established a key program for EMS members under the umbrella of Special Interest Groups. This call is to invite EMS members and other interested professionals to participate in the activities of the Special Interest Groups (SIGs). The raison dÂ´etre of SIGs is to promote greater involvement of members in the activities of the Society, and to provide a new platform with a sharper focus for discussion on topics of interest to members through the exchange of ideas and experiences on specific themes that reflect the Fields of Interest of the Society. The objective of SIGs is to bring together groups of members with cognate interests, and to give them an opportunity to conduct a range of functions, including: Organizing focused Workshops or Symposia on specific Engineering management subjects; Arranging special sessions at EMS Conferences; Assisting with the review of EMS Conference papers, with a view to formulating and chairing special sessions; Contributing articles to the EMS Newsletter or to the EMS Web-site; and Making nominations for Society Awards, and promotion of members to higher IEEE grades.

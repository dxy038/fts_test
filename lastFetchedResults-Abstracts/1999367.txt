Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between organizational stress and performance of members in Iranian National Female's Taekwondo team at the international events.
Methodology: The population of the study was 40 females from Iran national taekwondo team, teenagers, youth and adults, present in the preparatory camp preparing to participate in the international competitions in 2012. The sample of this study was chosen purposefully (n=40). To achieve the research objectives, self-made questionnaire of organizational stress was used as the investigation tool. The questionnaire validity was confirmed by experts and its reliability calculated in a pilot study with 30 subjects which turned out to be 0.87. In order to achieve the research purposes, the descriptive and inferential statistics methods such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov, multivariate regression, Pearson correlation coefficient, single-sample T-test with the help of SPSSS.V.18 software were used.
Results: The findings showed that organizational stress was in a high level among Iran members of female taekwondo team (t=20.86, p?0/05). There was an inverse significant correlation between organizational stress and performance of athletes (r=-0.732, p?0/05). In organizational stress, the environmental (t=2.106, p?0/05) and team (t=2.456, p?0/05) factors could predict the performance of athletes at the international events. But the leadership (t=-0.770, p?0/05) and individual (t=1.793, p?0/05) factors could not predict the performance of athletes at the international events.
Conclusion: Due to the high level of organizational stress and its negative impact on performance of female taekwondo players, it seems organizational stress should be recognized and controlled by authorities of the federation of Taekwondo.

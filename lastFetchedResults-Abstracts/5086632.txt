Obtaining perception of human plays an important role in various field. Meeting the need of obtaining perception of human accurately and expediently, this paper proposed the design and implementation of a perception-obtaining system. Firstly, the subjective and objective methods of obtaining perception of human are analyzed and, further, a design idea of a perception-obtaining system based on neuro-fuzzy network is put forward. Secondly, the principle of the system is described. The implementation of the system is addressed from both hardware and software aspects. Finally, an experiment is conducted to prove that the design and implementation of the proposed perception-obtaining system is reasonable and reachable.

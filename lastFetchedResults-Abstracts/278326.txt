Objective measurement of weight bearing during a long-term period can give insight into the postoperative loading of the lower extremity of orthopedic patients to avoid complications. This study investigated the validity of vertical ground reaction force measurements during a long-term period using the Pedar Mobile insole pressure system, by comparing it with a Kistler force platform. In addition, the validity of a new sensor drift correction algorithm to correct for offset drift in the Pedar signal was evaluated. Ground reaction force data were collected during dynamic and static conditions from five healthy subjects every hour for 7 h. A mean offset drift of 14.6% was found after 7 h. After applying the drift correction algorithm the Pedar system showed a high accuracy for the second peak in the ground reaction force-time curve (1.1 to 3.4% difference, p>0.05) and step duration (−2.0 to 4.4% difference, p>0.05). Less accuracy was found for the first peak in the ground reaction force–time curve (5.2 to 12.0% difference; p<0.05 for the first 3 h, p>0.05 for the last 4 h) and, consequently, in the vertical force impulse (5.5 to 11.0% difference, p>0.05). The Pedar Mobile system appeared to be a valid instrument to measure the vertical force during a long-term period when using the drift correction program described in this study.

Linear programming (LP) is powerful to solve the constrained optimization problems in planning and control. But in the dynamic target pursuit and obstacle avoidance (TPOA) problem, LP suffers from nonlinearity in either the objective function or the constraints. This paper proposes an acceleration space LP. It describes the TPOA problem as several linear inequalities that are easily solved by LP and can be applied to the problem with any shape of obstacles. Moreover, it makes an active planning based on the velocities of the vehicle relative to the obstacles and target. Simulation is given to illustrate the main ideas

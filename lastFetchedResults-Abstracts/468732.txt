Objective
This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of 3 days versus 7 days of ampicillin in prolonging gestation for at least 7 days in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).
Study design
We performed a randomized clinical trial comparing 3 days of ampicillin with 7 days ampicillin in patients with PPROM. Our primary outcome was the prolongation of pregnancy for at least 7 days. Secondary outcomes included rates of chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
Results
Forty-eight patients were randomly selected. There was no statistically significant difference in the ability to achieve a 7-day latency (relative risk 0.83, 95% CI 0.51-1.38). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in the rates of chorioamnionitis, endometritis, and our composite neonatal morbidity.
Conclusion
In patients with PPROM, length of antibiotic therapy does not change the rate of a 7-day latency or affect the rate of chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, or neonatal morbidity.

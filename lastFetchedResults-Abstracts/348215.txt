Objective
To verify findings of an independently regulated anterior limbic alpha band source.
Methods
In a randomised cross-over study, the spontaneous EEG was recorded in nine healthy subjects after i.v. lorazepam or placebo. Intracerebral current densities within classical frequency bands were estimated with low resolution electromagnetic tomography [LORETA] and compared between groups with t-statistical parametric mapping [SPM{t}]. A region-of-interest [ROI] based method was used to compare frontal and occipital alpha band activity changes.
Results
Irrespective of treatment group, local maxima of alpha band power were localised both in the occipital lobe, Brodman area [BA] 18, and in the anterior cingulate cortex [ACC], BA 32. Statistical parametric mapping showed reduced parieto-occipital, but unaltered frontal alpha band power after lorazepam. This result was confirmed by ROI-based comparison of BA 18 and BA 32.
Conclusions
There was an anterior limbic maximum of alpha band activity which, unlike occipital alpha, was not suppressed by lorazepam.
Significance
The well-known anterior alpha band components may originate from a narrowly circumscribed source, located in the ACC. Frontal and occipital alpha band activities appear to be independently regulated.

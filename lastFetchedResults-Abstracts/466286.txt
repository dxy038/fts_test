Objective: We sought to determine risk factors for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism during pregnancy or post partum. Study Design: We performed a population-based case-control study. All Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents with a first lifetime deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during pregnancy or post partum from 1966 to 1990 were identified (N = 90). Where possible, a resident without deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was matched to each patient by date of the first live birth after the patientâ€™s child. The medical records of all remaining patients and all control subjects were reviewed for >25 baseline characteristics, which were tested as risk factors for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Results: In multivariate analysis smoking (odds ratio, 2.4) and prior superficial vein thrombosis (odds ratio, 9.4) were independent risk factors for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary thrombosis during pregnancy or post partum. Conclusion: Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis may be warranted for pregnant women with prior superficial vein thrombosis. Smoking cessation should be recommended, especially during pregnancy and the postpartum period. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:104-10.)

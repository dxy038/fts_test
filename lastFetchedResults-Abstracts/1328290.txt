This paper describes a procedure for optimising both cost and weight using the cost parameter, ΔC/ΔW, as a primary design driver. The theory behind the algorithms involving the cost parameter will be stated. A comparison between the Pareto method, which is the standard approach for multi-objective optimisation, and this new innovative approach will be made on a simplified aileron structure. Results from the optimisation applied to a Krueger flap will also be presented.

It is well-known that space-time block coded transmit diversity system suffers from a diversity penalty in the time-varying channel. Lately, based on the Alamouti two-input single-output (2ISO) antenna diversity system, Vielmon et al. investigated the impact of a time-varying channel on the bit-error-rate (BER) performance and also recommended three detectors to increase the system robustness for rapid channel variation. In this paper, we generalize these detectors and their BER expressions to the two-input multiple-output (2IMO) antenna configuration. Moreover, the bit-error-outages (BEOs) are also derived to provide a more objective judgment on the transmission quality within a fading environment. These generalized results can be easily extended to the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems with the 2IMO antenna configuration.

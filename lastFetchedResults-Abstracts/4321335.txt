Unit commitment can dramatically improve the economy of power system operation. Fossil fuel generating unit commitment problem has been widely researched. With the proportion of nuclear power capacity increasing, nuclear power plant need participate peak-valley load regulation for satisfying power balance demand. Consequently, generating unit economic commitment including nuclear power unit was researched in this paper. A unit commitment model considering nuclear power plant load following was put forward and the objective is to achieve minimum energy using. Uranium consumption ratio of nuclear power plant was converted to coal consumption ratio of fossil fuel power plant according to capacity equity principle. In this way, the objective of minimum energy using was changed into minimum coal consumption. Taking 2015 GuangDong power grid in abundant water season as an example, using the unit commitment model put up in this paper can significantly reduce energy resource use.

Hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), a sorbent compound obtained from natural zeolite, has demonstrated an ability to sorb aflatoxins (AFs) with a high affinity. Addition of this compound to feedstuffs contaminated with AFs has shown a protective effect against the development of aflatoxicosis in farm animals. The objective of the present study was to compare the efficiency of HSCAS and local montmorillonite silicate in respect of the protection against aflatoxicosis in the rat as a sensitive animal model. AF treatment (2.5 mg kg−1 diet) significantly reduced blood hemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes, cholesterol, triglycerides, cholinesterase, total protein, albumin, zinc and copper concentrations. While it significantly increased creatinine, bilirubin, urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase and transaminases concentrations. In addition, AF administration induced degenerative changes in the hepatic and renal tissues. The results indicated that addition of HSCAS or montmorillonite to the AF-contaminated diet at a level of 5 g kg−1 resulted in a significant improvement in the hematological and biochemical parameters, mineral retention and histological picture of both liver and kidneys.

concluded that the deleterious effects of AF could be overcome or, at least, diminished by sorbents. Moreover, sorbents by themselves had no toxic effects.

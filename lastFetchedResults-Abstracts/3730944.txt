The cyclotomic polynomial (CP) prefilter design problem is formulated as an optimization problem with linear objective functions by applying logarithms to the transfer function of the CP prefilter. This problem is then solved by mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Design examples demonstrate that this method leads to more efficient cascaded finite impulse response (FIR) prefilter-equalizers than existing methods.

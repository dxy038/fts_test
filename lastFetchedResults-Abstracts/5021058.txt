The concept of folded bowtie antennas is presented in this paper. To pursue this objective, a Peano space-filling curve approach is utilised. Thus, the combined Bowtie-Peano antenna (BPA) is introduced, exhibiting the broadband performance of the bowtie antennas combined with the compactness of the Peano designs. Numerical results obtained via a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) scheme clearly illustrate the behaviour of the novel structure. The feasibility of bandwidth enhancement is signified at specific resonances.

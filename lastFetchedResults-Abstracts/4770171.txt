Encrypting network traffic is a normal procedure to protect information for exchange. This prevents tapping and manipulation but it also hampers intrusion as well as data leakage and misuse detection. Obtaining knowledge about users of encrypted communications is, however, beneficial in terms of monitoring access, security and accounting reasons. Thus, the objective is to provide evidence of the source of actions, especially to detect insiders and illegal connections, without the necessity of decrypting the network traffic. We propose a novel architecture to identify users of encrypted traffic in a network environment of a company. It is based on statistical evaluation of monitored network packets. The proposed approach utilizes and combines two main aspects, the mode of operation of remote sessions and the keystroke dynamics of users. Aspects such as capturing and clustering network traffic, generating user profiles and patterns, and statistical analysis are part of the architecture.

The present work shows the implementation of an economic system in order to measure the solar radiation with the intention of quantify the amount solar energy received in this particular area. In order to accomplish that objective it was developed a data acquisition system based on a pyranometer, data acquisition board and a computer to record and display the data. Measurements obtained allowed the comparative analysis of this economic system versus the Meteorological Station currently used by the Instituto Tecnologico de Nogales.

An analysis was performed on several simulated transient stability disturbances in the American Desert Southwest area using a modal deconstruction methodology. The objective of the analysis was to determine whether a technique could be found to determine stability and its applicability to real-time prediction. The analysis employed here utilized the Prony technique. Simulated disturbances were assessed over a 10 second observation window using the Prony method within a process. Results of the process were judged based on the ability to identify signal modes and their damping levels. Outcome of the analysis using the proposed methodology showed that the process was effective in identifying the dominant signal modes and their damping levels within a 2.5 % quality of fit tolerance. However, the accuracy of the method was found to be dependent on the order of the Prony approximation and reduced frequency resolution in smaller windows implying effectiveness in real-time applications.

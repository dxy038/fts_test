The robust control problem of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with parameter uncertainties and disturbance is discussed. After analysis of uncertain model of synchronous motor, arbitrary order sliding mode differentiation and output-feedback control are designed to avoid chattering problem which exists in standard sliding mode. The result of simulations indicates that the multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) objective through state feedback linearization can convergence in finite time with good performance, in spit of parameter uncertainties and the output coupling.

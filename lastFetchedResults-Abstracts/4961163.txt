Considers a constrained optimal control problem, in which the &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm of some transfer matrix is to remain bounded by some number while an objective function is minimized. All &#8459;<sub>2</sub>/&#8459;&#8734;, l<sup>1</sup>/&#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> and time domain constrained &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> are contained in the authorÂ´s formulation. It is shown that a suboptimal solution may be computed by solving a finite dimensional, convex optimization problem. This problem may be constructed a priori in terms of the data and is usually large. Hence an iterative algorithm with guaranteed convergence is also given for the computation of an approximate solution

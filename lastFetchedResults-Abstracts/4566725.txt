Speeding up logic simulation is important to reduce design time of complex systems. Hardware emulation through reconfigurable systems (RS) built using FPGAÂ´s offer an cheap and efficient method to achieve the required speed-up. Emulation through RS poses some unique problems because of the limited circuit and I/O resources. A preparatory step for emulation using RS is to partition the circuit into as few parts as possible satisfying the resource constraints. This paper presents multi-objective search based optimal and approximate algorithms for circuit partitioning for this purpose

The Frequency Assignment Problem is assignment of frequencies or channels to establish link between base station and mobile transmitter in cellular system. To avoid interference, minimum separation between assigned frequencies is required. This problem is NP-hard. Due to limited availability of spectrum and reuse of same frequencies at different geographical locations, an excellent assignment is to be done, which must satisfy electromagnetic constraints with respect to demand in each cell. This paper presents a novel DGWCHD algorithm for frequency assignment problem in cellular radio networks. The objective is to assign the frequency satisfying electromagnetic constraints for given demand with minimum use of frequency bandwidth. The proposed algorithm is based on real wild animal´s using intelligent strategies during chasing and hunting their prey, such dogs as agents, implemented on Chakaborty´s benchmark problem constructed the 55-Cell FAP problems using other benchmark problems. The DGWCHD algorithm has been used for call ordering and FEA strategy for assignment. The performance of the proposed DGWCHD algorithm has been compared with other techniques. The results obtained are very optimistic and encouraging.

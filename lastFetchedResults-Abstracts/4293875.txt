Present work focuses on the objective of obtaining uniform velocity and temperature distribution across the length of an oxidation oven. For this purpose many design modifications were introduced in the holes geometry, number of holes and also hole sizes. Inlet guide vanes and flow straightening ducts are also introduced to gain required flow distribution.

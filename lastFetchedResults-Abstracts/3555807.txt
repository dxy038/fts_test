The authors propose a Bayesian approach with maximum-entropy (ME) priors to reconstruct an object from either the Fourier domain data (the Fourier transform of diffracted field measurements) in the case of diffraction tomography, or directly from the original projection data in the case of X-ray tomography. The objective function obtained is composed of a quadratic term resulting from chi /sup 2/ statistics and an entropy term that is minimized using variational techniques and a conjugate-gradient iterative method. The computational cost and practical implementation of the algorithm are discussed. Some simulated results in X-ray and diffraction tomography are given to compare this method to the classical ones.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

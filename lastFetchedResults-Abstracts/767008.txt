Highly porous scaffold plays an important role
in bone tissue engineering, which becomes a promising
alternative approach for bone repair since its emergence.
The objective of this work was to blend poly (e-caprolactone)
(PCL) with chitosan (CS) for the purpose of preparation
of porous scaffold. A simple unique method was
employed under room-temperature condition to blend the
two components together without separation of two phases.
The reaction leads to formation of sponge-like porous 5,
10, 15 and 20 wt% CS composites. XRD, IR and SEM
were used to determine components and morphology of the
composites. DSC studies indicated that the miscibility of
the two components. And pore volume fractures of composites
were determined by a simple method in which a
pycnometer was used. The results show that CS is successfully
commingled into PCL matrix, and adding CS into
PCL will not damage the crystalline structure of PCL. The
composite shows no signs of phase separation and presents
a unique porous structure under SEM observation. The
porosity of composite increased with the increase of the
content of CS in the composite. The highest porosity
reached to 92% when CS content increased to 20 wt%. The
mechanism of formation of this unique porous structure is
also discussed.

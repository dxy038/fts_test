This paper presents an empirical investigation for line balancing in aluminum industry. Assembly line problems (ALB) are divided into three types, single-model assembly lines to handle (easy) problems to build a product that is designed to build one kind of product, multiple and mixed model to design for different kinds of products. This paper is an effort to describe comprehensively the solution to the problem for single-model assembly lines using some practical software package named FLB. The primary objective of aluminum assembly line balancing is optimal deployment activities subject to various limitations. The preliminary results of this paper indicate that the implementation of line balancing could reduce make span, significantly.

This work presents a practical method of designing controllers for active noise cancellation (ANC) headphones. Without attempting system identification and perturbation modeling, the headphone system is directly described by a set of frequency-response data. In frequency domain, the controller synthesis problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, where the H<sub>2</sub> performance objective is minimized with various frequency-dependent constraints. The fixed-order robust controller is thus designed to achieve maximum noise attenuation with acceptable stability margins. Further, the method is able to accurately constrain noise amplification outside the control bandwidth due to waterbed effect of the nonminimum phase plants. This feature is very important for the ANC design to maintain an overall quality of noise reduction

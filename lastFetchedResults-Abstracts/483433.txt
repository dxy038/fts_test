In this research, water and wastewater networks have been considered for the case that there is more than one contaminant in the streams. One of difficulties in optimization of such systems is the complexity of the nonlinear equations. Linear approximation of these models in some cases may lead to incorrect solution, but optimal solution will be often obtained if the effective contaminants in the system are identified, which is the case in this research work. Linear models describing the system with multiple contaminants along with an appropriate objective function have been developed for optimization of water network of a refinery. The results show considerable decrease in fresh water usage of the network from 37.6 t/h to 21.9 t/h (41.7% decrease) which yields a 112,824 t/yr decrease in the refinery fresh water usage

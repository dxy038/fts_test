Background and Objective: The most common tumors of mediastinum are neurogenic tumors, while mediastinal tumors are common in adolescent and middle ages. Lymphoma is a common cause of mediastinal tumors in children. We observed an increase in prevalence of lymphoma in adults. This study was to evaluate mediastinal masses over 5 years duration. Subjects and Methods: The study was carried out over five years stated from 1382 (2003) in three sugery departments of Ahvaz University of Medical Sceinces, Iran. Patients with mediastinal mass were evaluated for age, gender, signs and symptoms, chest X-ray, chest CT scan and the methods of removal and the pathological reports of results of tissue samples. Results: Sixty patients were evaluated and there was no difference in gender. Mediastinal masses were most common in 3rd and 4th decades of life. Anterior mediastinum was the most common involved site. Anterior mediastinotomy was the most common operation from which large tissue samples were taken from 78. 33 % and 51.67 % of the mediastinal masses were lymphoma.

Conclusion: The best method to take large tissue of these tumors is anterior mediastinotomy. The most common pathology in mediastinal masses is lymphoma. Lymphoma must be suspected in young patients with fever, cough, dyspnea and a mediastinal mass.

The local temperature-distribution influences the amount of heat moving into or out of a body. In order to get the benefits of a multilayered structure when a constant temperature is required on one side of a metal plate with the other side heated irregularly, a variation between the thicknesses of the layered structure is needed. In the case of kitchenware products, where one side of the saucepan is heated irregularly, however, a constant temperature distribution is required on the other side.In this study, the main objective is to find a numerical solution to the problem of non-regular distribution of temperature on the “non-heated” side of an irregularly-heated plate by means of placing two layers of Cu/CrNi and Al/CrNi of varying thicknesses in a combined structure. For this aim, the Finite-Element Method program package ANSYS has been used. The Al/CrNi laminated plate has a low temperature-gradient distribution on its upper (or “non-heated”) surface due to its low heat conductivity compared with that of the Cu/CrNi steel.

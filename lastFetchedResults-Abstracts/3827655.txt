A new biomimetic linear actuator named Antagonistically Driven Linear Actuator (ANTLA) that could be directly employed in both macro and microscale of robotic applications is introduced in the present work. The presented actuator provides cost effectiveness and simple fabrication process thanks to its plain construction. In addition to producing basic bidirectional rectilinear motions, the actuator is able to modulate its compliance that might be one of the critical elements of the actuator functionality for the biomimetic applications. For the test, the proposed actuator concept is fabricated and assembled in a microscale robot that generates annelid motion.

Objective: We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of oral misoprostol administered to patients with the efficacy and safety in a control group treated with a Foley catheter and oxytocin for induction of labor. Study Design: Two hundred patients requiring induction of labor at term with a Bishop score of ≤5 were randomized to receive oral misoprostol or a cervical Foley catheter plus oxytocin. Patients in the misoprostol group received 50 μg at 4-hour intervals for a maximum of 6 doses or until an adequate contraction pattern developed. Those in the control group had a Foley catheter inserted in the cervix, whereas oxytocin was administered intravenously by a standard incremental infusion protocol to a maximum dose of 36 mU/min. Results: In multiparous patients the percentage delivered of their neonates within 24 hours and the median induction-to-delivery times were similar in the 2 groups. In nulliparous patients, however, delivery within 24 hours was significantly less likely in the misoprostol group (53.4% vs 82.5%; P< .001), and the median induction-to-delivery time was longer (23.3 hours vs 17.2 hours; P< .01). There were no differences in the incidence of meconium, chorioamnionitis, low Apgar scores, or cesarean delivery. The incidence of hyperstimulation was higher in the oxytocin-Foley group (4.1% vs 13.1%; P = .02). Conclusion: Oral misoprostol is as effective as oxytocin-Foley catheter for inducing labor in multiparous women. Misoprostol appears less efficacious in nulliparous patients.

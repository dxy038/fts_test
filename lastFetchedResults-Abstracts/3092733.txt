Compared with the previous standards, H.264 adopted some new technologies to improve the coding efficiency and coding performance at the cost of higher computational complexity. We should do some changes to better fit for implementation based on DM642. In the paper, we reviewed the H.264 algorithm and looked for the crucial points for implementation based on DM642. We introduce searching algorithm and half-pixel interpolation algorithm optimization, the emphasis is put on the assembly optimization for Intra- prediction, DCT, Quantization(Q).Our H.264 encoder can encode real-time for QCIF resolution video, 12- 18 frames per second(fps) for CIF resolution video. The decoded video pictures provide high subjective and objective quality.

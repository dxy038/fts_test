In vehicular adhoc network the communication between the nodes is the major issue. Due to high node mobility and fast topology changes devising protocols for Vehicular network may not be successfully accomplished by simple adaptation of protocols designed for wired networks and MANET. In recent years Swarm Intelligence based routing protocol performing very well in wireless sensor network and MANET. The objective of this paper to show that Swarm Intelligence based routing protocol shows promising results in VANET. For this we compared and evaluated the performance of AODV, OLSR, and Swarm Intelligence based routing protocol in terms of throughput, latency and data packet delivery ratio for VANET. Simulation results shows that SWARM Intelligence based routing protocol showed promising results in VANETs as compared to AODV and OLSR.

Objective
Endocytosis has been thought to control entry into the cell and play a crucial role in the development, immune response, neurotransmission, intercellular communication, signal transduction, and cellular and organismal homeostasis. We investigated the basic properties of endocytosis in the marginal cells of stria vascularis (SV) to discuss whether marginal cells have a potential to maintain the endolymph homeostasis.
Methods
We perfused microperoxidase (MPO), an endocytosis tracer, into the cochlear duct. After 5â€“60 min of endolymphatic perfusion, the tissues were fixed and the distribution of MPO within the marginal cell was observed by transmission electron microscopy.
Results
Endocytosis started already at 5 min after MPO perfusion. Small MPO-loaded endosomes were observed up to 30 min after MPO perfusion. The small tubulovesicular endosomes and the plasma membrane invagination were not decorated by an electron dense bristle structure. After endocytosis, MPO labeled preendosomes were quickly transported to the large vacuolar endosomes that connected with tubular endosomes. At 60 min after MPO perfusion, MPO-loaded large vesicles that have small vesicles in the lumen were observed.
Conclusion
The time-course of MPO-loaded endosomes was similar to that of CF-loaded endosomes in the marginal cells of SV. The strial marginal cells have vigorous endocytotic activity both in clathrin-independent and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. This high activity of endocytosis in SV seems to be needed to maintain the homeostasis of endolymph via membranous channels and/or receptors regulations.

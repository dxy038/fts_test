Evaluating the performance of clones to be used in short rotation intensive culture (SRIC) plantations for biomass production is critical for identifying superior clones and matching them with sites on which they will perform best. This will lead to increased production and a strengthening of the commercial prospects of these plantations. The primary objective of this study was to use a multivariate approach to evaluate the relative clonal performance of 38 willow and hybrid poplar clones, deployed in a genetic selection trial based on a coppice rotation system established in central New York State (NY) in 1997. Cluster analysis was conducted using survival, several individual plant growth attributes, and insect defoliation, all measured during or at the end of 1998. Two linear functions developed using discriminant analysis, comprising primarily of attributes related to tree vigor and site adaptability; tree volume index and length of growing period, explained most of the variation (98.5%) among the clusters. Eight of the 38 clones evaluated are expected to be high biomass producers, and are recommended for more extensive clone-site trials and commercial scale plantations across central NY and the northeastern United States (US). The results of this study indicate a possible approach to more effective juvenile selection in tree improvement programs, and insights for a refinement of the current SRIC tree ideotype.

Various methods for time-varying filtering with prescribed time-frequency (TF) pass region are compared analytically and numerically. The Weyl correspondence permits a unified TF analysis of apparently unrelated concepts of linear TF filtering, including STFT-based filters, Weyl filters, and TF projection filters. The linear TF filters are compared to nonlinear TF analysis/masking/synthesis methods based on the Wigner distribution (WD) or the smoothed WD. The study of TF (signal separation problems permits the objective evaluation of TF filter methods. Linear methods yield improved performance and had reduced cost as compared to nonlinear methods

In this paper, we present how to use the Constructive Scrapbook to integrate expression and analysis and propose that its design is effective for learning. Constructive Scrapbook is a computer application in which the user arranges compositions of pictures in a two-dimensional space, makes various compositions, and switches them freely. Although subjective expression and objective analysis are treated as different activities in the educational world today, we have designed a tool that handles both types of activities simultaneously through constructive learning. Our objective is to have children and ordinary persons use various facets to analyze their expressions and then create new expressions.We held a workshop using the Constructive Scrapbook. The results show that the tool has the potential to make the user analyze expressions, extract significances to consider them deeply, and then create new expressions.

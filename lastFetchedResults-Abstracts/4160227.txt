A fiber-optic high-definition television (HDTV) distribution system is discussed, which economically distributes HDTV signals to customers at a bit rate of about 100 Mb/s. The subscriber network is formed in a star topology to facilitate bidirectional connection. The distribution system uses digital video transmission at 1.3 &#956;m wavelength using single-mode fiber. The video channel selection is made by an optical video selector. The optical selector consists of laser diode optical switch modules, which have a gain in the `ONÂ´ state and two-input, two-output 3 dB couplers. The authors describe the bit error rate characteristics of a signal-mode fiber digital distribution system using a four-input, one-output optical selector

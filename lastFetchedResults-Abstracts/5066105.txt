The development and tested performance of a multiple beam tile-based active phased array for wideband CDL/TCDL military communications applications is described. Work is performed under contract to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren, VA. The program objective is to develop the multiple link antenna system (MLAS) hardware/software and demonstrate its military utility through an advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD). MLAS is a compact, active phased array antenna supporting four simultaneous high data rate (274 Mbit/sec, minimum), full duplex channels utilizing highly integrated, wide bandwidth gallium arsenide (GaAs) chip technology. The ACTD MLAS antenna hardware consists of a 256-element transmit array and a 256-element receive array. Each array provides 4 beams that are independently scanned electronically; Circular or linear polarization of any orientation is independently selectable for each beam. The design architecture, measured performance results, and potential applications are presented.

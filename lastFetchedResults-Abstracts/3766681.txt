Although two-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo) is a useful technique for evaluation of global and regional left ventricular function, the main limitation is the inability to easily extract reliable and accurate quantitative information throughout all phases of the cardiac cycle. We sought to develop suitable automated techniques for the objective determination of endocardial and epicardial borders in two-dimensional echocardiographic images. To test algorithms for the automatic detection of myocardial borders we constructed a cardiac ultrasound phantom consisting of 16 echogenic annuli of known dimensions embedded in a material of low echogenicity which allowed imaging without partial volume effects. An algorithm based on Gaussian filtering followed by a difference gradient operator was applied to detect edges in the 2-D echo images of these annuli. The radii of the automatically determined inner borders were within 0.44 mm root meansquared error over a range of 15-25 mm true radius. This lower boundary for the error in our approach to automatic placement of myocardial borders in 2-D echocardiograms suggests the potential to extract more information concerning left ventricular function than is available with current techniques.

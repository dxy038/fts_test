Three-dimensional (3D) meshes are used intensively in distributed graphics applications where model data is transmitted on demand to users, terminals and rendered for interactive manipulation. This paper presents a transmission system for such applications with an objective of minimizing the latency between the user input and the response. In particular, we represent 3D models by multiple resolutions to allow fast and scalable rendering, and provide them with unequal error protection and/or retransmission when sending the data over a lossy link. The transmission policies are determined adaptive to environment variables and in linear computation time. Simulation results show that the proposed transmission system achieves 20-30% reduction on delivering latency compared to the state-of-the-art approach in the literature

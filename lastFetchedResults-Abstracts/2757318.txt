In this paper, an image dimming perceptual model is proposed as the foundation of image compensation and quality evaluation. Specifically, under this model an ideal compensation function is derived out and objective quality metrics SSIM and PSNR are adopted to evaluate the compensation performance. A practical compensation function is obtained by modifying the ideal compensation function under the consideration both of visual perception and objective quality. By using the SSIM and PSNR metrics, the relationship between image mean values, backlight levels, and image quality is further investigated. Base on this a novel scheme of backlight level adaptive adjustment is presented. Numerous experimental results verify the effectiveness of the model and demonstrate the advantages of the compensation and backlight level adaptive adjustment techniques.

Objective: We report a series of 13 patients with surgical treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation (CM). The aim of this study was to investigate postoperative patient disability and seizure control in patients with CM in order to clarify indications for neurosurgical removal. In our series we emphasize the beneficial effect of excision of CMs. We also give an overview of the current literature covering options for treatment in surgically inaccessible CMs. Methods: In this retrospective study we describe the clinical outcomes of neurosurgical intervention in 13 patients with a CM. Seven patients had epilepsy at presentation and six had focal neurological deficits due to intracerebral haemorrhage (five patients) or mass effect due to the CM (one patient). The modified Rankin scale was used to define patient disability pre- and postoperatively. An overview of the indications for surgery and postoperative outcome with follow up periods of 1â€“6 years (mean: 3.3 years) are provided. Results: In all patients presenting with epilepsy a reduction in seizure frequency was seen. Four of them became seizure-free postoperatively. The six patients with neurological deficits due to intracerebral haemorrhage or mass effect due to the CM showed clinical improvement postoperatively, two of them made full recoveries. Improvement of the postoperative Rankin score was seen in six of 13 patients. Conclusion:Improvement in seizure control and reduction in patient disability warrants surgical intervention in symptomatic CMs.

This paper investigates the use of fuzzy decision-making in predictive control. The use of fuzzy goals and fuzzy constraints in predictive control allows for a more flexible aggregation of the control objectives than the usual weighting sum of squared errors. Compared to the standard quadratic objective function, with the fuzzy decision-making approach, the designer has more freedom in specifying the desired process behavior

Objective
STAT5A/5B-deficient mice are recognized to manifest defects in multiple cell types and tissues. In particular, the hematopoietic defects in these mice are widespread, affecting multiple lineages and multiple stages of development. Previous studies indicate that deficiencies intrinsic to hematopoietic cells contribute substantially to the observed defects. However, in light of the broad physiologic effects of STAT5 in the context of the organism outside the blood system, we wished to investigate the possibility of STAT5-dependent environmental influence of nonhematopoietic origin on hematopoietic development in these mice.
Materials and methods

We transplanted wild-type bone marrow into STAT5A/5B-deficient mice to determine the effects of loss of STAT5 in nonhematopoietic tissue on hematopoietic development.
Results

We observed that transplantation of wild-type marrow completely corrects hematopoietic defects in STAT5A/5B-deficient recipient mice, including peripheral blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, and reductions in specific progenitor subsets.
Conclusion

These results indicate that the important role of STAT5 in hematolymphoid development are mediated directly through effects on hematopoietic cells and not indirectly.

INTRODUCTION: The results of intracranial and extracranial vessel color Doppler sonography, which is now an inseparable part of patient evaluation, vary in different studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pattern of vascular involvement in thrombotic stroke and its relationship with risk factors of stroke. METHODS: One-hundred patients (45 males and 55 females) with thrombotic stroke underwent transcranial sonography and color Doppler sonography of extracranial vessels. The pattern of vascular involvement was analyzed. The risk factors of stroke were also evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of the studied individuals had some variations in their color Doppler sonography of extracranial vessels, 27% had changes in the intracranial vessels and 26% showed changes in both. The most frequently involved vessels among the intracranial and extracranial vessels were the middle cerebral artery and the internal carotid artery, respectively. The pattern of vascular involvement was unrelated to hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia or history of ischemic heart disease. Extracranial involvement in patients with positive history of MI was more prevalent than in those without such history. CONCLUSIONS: Extracranial vessel involvement in thrombotic stroke was found to be more prevalent than intracranial vessel involvement in the city of Rafsanjan; however, intracranial vessel involvement was more prevalent than in western countries.

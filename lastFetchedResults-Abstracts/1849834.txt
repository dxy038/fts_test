Compressive sensing (CS) enables the reconstruction of a magnetic resonance (MR) image from undersampled data in k-space with relatively low-quality distortion when compared to the original image. In addition, CS allows the scan time to be significantly reduced. Along with a reduction in the computational overhead, we investigate an effective way to improve visual quality through the use of a weighted optimization algorithm for reconstruction after variable density random undersampling in the phase encoding direction over k-space. In contrast to conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction methods, the visual weight, in particular, the region of interest (ROI), is investigated here for quality improvement. In addition, we employ a wavelet transform to analyze the reconstructed image in the space domain and fully utilize data sparsity over the spatial and frequency domains. The visual weight is constructed by reflecting the perceptual characteristics of the human visual system (HVS), and then applied to â„“1 norm minimization, which gives priority to each coefficient during the reconstruction process. Using objective quality assessment metrics, it was found that an image reconstructed using the visual weight has higher local and global quality than those processed by conventional methods.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to establish whether ultrasound-estimated or dye-determined amniotic fluid distribution (upper compared with lower quadrant) is predictive of perinatal outcome. Study Design: Amniotic fluid distribution as measured by the amniotic fluid index, single deepest pocket, and dye-determined volumes was ascertained and correlated with intrapartum and neonatal outcomes. Results: Between January 1997 and January 2001, 135 women (70 upper-greater and 65 lower-greater) participated in this prospective observational study. The sum of the amniotic fluid index (P = .309), single deepest pocket (P = .168), and dye-determined amniotic fluid volume (P = .368) for the upper-greater compared with the lower-greater groups were similar. Decelerations in labor (P = .597), late decelerations (P = .999), cesarean deliveries for fetal distress (P = .413), and umbilical cord pH < 7.2 were similar (P = .647) Conclusion: Ultrasound-estimated and dye-determined amniotic fluid volumes are similar between upper-greater and lower-greater groups, and intrapartum/neonatal outcomes are not affected by the amniotic fluid distribution.

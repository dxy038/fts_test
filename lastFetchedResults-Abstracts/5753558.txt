The remote sensing camera in large field and wide cover needs CCD with enough pixels. But the existing CCD cannot satisfy the practical needs. Therefore several pieces of CCD which has insufficient pixels are spliced to get a long CCD array with plenty of pixels. The precision requirements of CCD splicing are very strict, so that the same high accuracies are required in the precision detection of CCD splicing. When detecting precision of CCD splicing, the graphical markers with simple geometric structure in the CCD package are selected as templates. The position precision data of the graphical markers in each CCD are obtained using the template matching algorithm. Using the unified objective templates, the focal plane which has multi-chip of CCD is detected by template matching algorithm. Experiment results show that the template matching algorithm can enhance the located precision of each CCD to 0.347&#956;m. The splicing precision detection with template matching algorithm can avoid the subjective error caused by the conventional detection method. And its results are more accurate. In addition, without manual intervention in the process of precision detection, the efficiency of precision detection is improved.

This paper reports on a robust optimal design of MEMS gyroscope. Proposed robust design method uses perturbation method, which doesnÂ´t need to calculate derivative compared with method based on sensitivity analysis, considering the worst-case tolerance instead of statistical information about uncertainties. Monte Carlo analyses of robust and deterministic optimization are also studied, and results indicate that more than 80% of the objective function samples with standard deviation 0.4&#956;m is acceptable with respect to the robust design. System-level based on macromodels and physical level based on finite element model simulation verifications show that the MEMS gyroscope designed using presented method is acceptable.

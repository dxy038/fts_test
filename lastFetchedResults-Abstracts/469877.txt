Objective
This study was undertaken to determine the (1) impact of delivery route on the natural history of cervical dysplasia and (2) overall regression rates of cervical dysplasia in pregnant women.
Study design
A retrospective analysis was performed on 705 pregnant women with abnormal Papanicolaou tests who presented for prenatal care at the Kapiolani Medical Center Women's Clinic in Honolulu, Hawaii, between 1991 and 2001. Data collection included demographics, delivery route, and cervical pathology.
Results
Two hundred one patients met the inclusion criteria. Regression rates for vaginal and cesarean section groups were as follows: atypical squamous cells (64% vs 70%, P = .32), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (58% vs 42%, P = .073), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (53% vs 25%, P = .44). Of the total population, 30% of lesions persisted postpartum, 58% regressed, and 12% progressed.
Conclusion
Mode of delivery does not influence the natural history of dysplastic lesions. Gravid and nongravid women have similar regression rates.

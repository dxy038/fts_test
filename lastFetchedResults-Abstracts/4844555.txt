In order to achieve meticulous management in reliability of power supply, the system of MBO (management by objective) is studied based on power distribution network GIS platform. First, a new coding method which used GUID (Global Unique Identifier) technology is integrated in spatial database design. The codes can describe completely the topological structure of distribution network which is necessary for MBO. Then a new algorithm used in objective decomposition for power supply reliability is designed. By this algorithm the total power supply reliability rate of the whole distribution network can be properly decomposed and assigned into each power line. The factors which can influence the results of objective decomposition are discussed and determined. The algorithm is integrated in power distribution network GIS platform, and the practical example shows that the decomposition algorithm can obviously improve the reliability of power supply.

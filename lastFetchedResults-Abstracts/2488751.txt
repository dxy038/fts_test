Objective: Advanced maternal age (AMA) is an important factor in decreasing success
of assisted reproductive technology by having a negative effect on the success rate of
intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), particularly by increasing the rate of embryo
aneuploidy. It has been suggested that the transfer of euploid embryos increases the implantation
and pregnancy rates, and decreases the abortion rate. Preimplantation genetic
screening (PGS) is a method for selection of euploid embryos. Past studies, however,
have reported different results on the success of pregnancy after PGS in AMA. Investigating
the pregnancy rate of ICSI with and without PGS in female partners over 35 years of
age referred to infertility centers in Tehran.
Materials and Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 150 couples with the female
partner over age of 35 were included. Fifty couples underwent PGS and the remaining
were used as the control group. PGS was carried out using fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y. Results of embryo transfer following PGS
were evaluated and compared with those in the control group.
Results: Implantation rates obtained in the PGS and control groups were 30 and 32%
respectively and not significantly different (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: PGS for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y does not increase implantation
rate in women over 35 years of age and therefore the regular use of PGS in AMA
is not recommended.

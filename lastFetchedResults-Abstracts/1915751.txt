Renal cell carcinoma is the most lethal of the common genitourinary neoplasms, with 30% to 40% of patients eventually dying from disease progression. Although the recent development of targeted therapies against kidney cancer has yielded substantially improved tumor response rates and progression-free survival, these agents are still not curative. The integration of systemic therapies with surgery still represents the best management for select patients with advanced disease. Specifically, consolidative surgery may play a vital role in the management of this challenging patient population. However, concerns remain regarding the potential for increased surgical morbidity complicating the integration of surgery after targeted therapy. Careful patient selection and specific precautions to increase surgical safety should be implemented.

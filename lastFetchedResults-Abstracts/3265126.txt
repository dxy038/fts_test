A new kind of fuzzy adaptive method is proposed to transfer the multi-objective function to single objective function under the same constraint conditions. Based on multiple dynamic programming models, an improved dynamic programming method with different step-length to the solution for an optimal distribution of generators in an electrical power plant has been developed. This method overcomes the problem that due to improper selection of searching step-length. The experimental results show that the dynamic programming method based on fuzzy adaptive theory has a good energy-saving effect and engineering application value.

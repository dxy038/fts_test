In this paper, I attempt to model for finding the optimal arrangement of providing phone service to a "Pseudo US". Taking the considerations of several social consequences, regarding providing phone service to the "Pseudo US" as a multi-objective programming problem, an optimization model is constructed in several different optimal methods including AHP and a more objective one-Fuzzy Optimization Model. When emphasizing sustainable development the optimal coverage of cell phone is 25%. Moreover, another three different optimal arrangements under different emphasis are obtained, as well as the optimization from an energy perspective.

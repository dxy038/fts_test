An Immune Algorithm (IA) based optimization approach
for solving the capacitor placement problem is proposed in
this paper. In the capacitor placement problem, those practical capacitor
operating constraints, load profiles, feeder capacities and
allowable voltage limits at different load levels are all considered
while the investment cost and energy loss are minimized. In the proposed
method, objective functions and constraints are represented
as antigens. Through the genetic evolution, an antibody that most
fits the antigen becomes the solution. In this IA computation, an
affinity calculation process is also embedded to guarantee the diversity.
The process stagnation can be thus better prevented. The
proposed method has been applied to a test system and the results
are compared with other published techniques.

The paper presents a study of the fatigue and
post-fatigue behavior of a hybrid carbonâ€“glass biaxial
fabric reinforced epoxy composite manufactured by the
resin transfer molding (RTM) and the hand lay-up (HL)
processes, with the main objective of assessing whether a
material characterization run at the prototype level of a
handicraft technology could be significant for a mass production
technology and whether a comparison on static
properties (a viable task at an industrial level) could ensure
the same level of agreement for the fatigue life and residual
properties. Tensile and flexural static tests as well as displacement-
controlled bending fatigue tests (R ratio of 0.10)
were conducted on two sets of standard specimens, having
fiber orientation parallel to the loading direction (on-axis
specimens) and at 45  to the loading direction (off-axis
specimens). Specimens were subjected to different fatigue
loading, with the maximum load level up to 60% of the
average ultimate flexural strength, and damage in the
laminate was continuously monitored through the loss of
bending moment during cycling. After 106 cycles, the
fatigue test was stopped and residual properties were
measured. Micrographs of sample sections revealed some
voidage for HL specimens while resin rich areas were
observed for RTM specimens. Results of the static tensile
and flexural tests pointed out lower mechanical properties
for the RTM specimens when tested on-axis and slightly
higher properties when tested off-axis. Regardless of
specimen fiber orientation, the fatigue and post-fatigue
performance of RTM samples was inferior to that of HL
specimens with the gap increasing for increasing fatigue
load levels. The result was ascribed to the presence in RTM
samples of resin-rich areas, which are reported to have
limited influence on the laminate static properties but
which may act as initiation sites for fatigue cracks

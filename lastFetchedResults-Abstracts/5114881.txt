Gene expression microarray data can be used to classify tumor types. We proposed a new procedure to classify human tumor samples based on microarray gene expressions by using a hybrid supervised learning method called MOEA/WV (multi-objective evolutionary algorithm/weighted voting). MOEA is used to search for a relatively few subsets of informative genes from the high-dimensional gene space, and WV is used as a classification tool. This new method has been applied to predicate the subtypes of Iymphoma and outcomes of medulloblastoma. The results are relatively accurate and meaningful compared with those from other methods.

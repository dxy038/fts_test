The rapid development of industrial robotics has provided an opportunity for the greater efficiency of aircraft manufacturing industry. But the complexity of work environment is a great challenge to robotÂ´s practical application. This paper describes a method of designing and positioning multi-robot workcells which are used to manufacture large surface workpieces in three-dimensional space. The method defines the work space of robot as a sector region and transforms the problem of multi-robot workcell layout into a nonlinear programming problem. The objective is to maximize the overlapped workspace of two robots without collision between robots and workpieces. This method has been implemented on computer and the results obtained are promising.

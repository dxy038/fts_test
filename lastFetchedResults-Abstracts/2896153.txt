LiMgPO<sub>4</sub> (LMP) phosphor is a new highly sensitive material for TL and OSL dosimetry. The objective of the work was to investigate the dosimetric properties of this material. LMP phosphor doped with Tb and B was irradiated with beta rays and alpha particles. Thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurements were performed for LMP powders in comparison with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:C detector (Landauer). The phosphate which was made in our laboratory exhibits a main TL peak at 150&#176;C. The synthesized LiMgPO<sub>4</sub>:Tb,B is a highly sensitive OSL material for dosimetric applications.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the wear phenomena of Jatropha and palm oil contaminated lubricant in elastrohydrodynamic lubrication with a four-ball machine. As a result, it was found that both Jatropha and palm oil has the potential in becoming an alternative lubricant in conventional machinery usage. However, Jatropha oil contaminated lubricant was a better lubricant in terms of low wear scar diameter, low coefficient of friction and high flash temperature parameter.

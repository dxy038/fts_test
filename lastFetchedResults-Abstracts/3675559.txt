A simple method for time delay measurement of a chirped fibre grating by using bidirectional modulation of a Mach-Zehnder modulator is proposed. The bidirectionally modulated light with time difference produces an interference fringe in the RF domain. The time delay of a chirped fibre grating can be obtained by measuring the period of the RF interference fringe from different wavelengths.

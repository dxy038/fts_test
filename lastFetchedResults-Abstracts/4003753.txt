Numerous methods are presented for graphically determining the impedance of linear circuits in the sinusoidal steady state. This paper gathers together selected methods scattered throughout the literature and adds two new methods. The majority employ straight lines, requiring no inversions or circle diagrams to achieve their results. These visual, graphical methods are particularly useful in the creation of circuits to achieve a given objective. The graphical methods are rapid and less subject to human error than the mathematical approaches which they supplement. They have a strong educational content both in and out of the classroom.

The objective of this work was to develop a method to confirm the geographical authenticity of Galician-labelled honeys as Galician-produced honeys. Eleven metals were determined in 42 honey samples divided into two categories: natural Galician honeys and processed non-Galician honeys. Multivariate chemometric techniques such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, KNN and SIMCA are used to classify honeys according to their type and origin on the basis of the chemical data. Using only three features, Cu, Mn and Li, an almost correct classification was achieved. Â©

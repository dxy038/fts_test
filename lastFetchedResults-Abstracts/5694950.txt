It is well known fact that organizations diversifies and increase their product line locally and globally. In developing new products, project managers prefer to undertake related projects. As the projects are interdependent and inter related, there is a risk related interdependency. Information Systems(I.S) project selection decision is influenced by a number of factors like long-term plans, profit maximization, tangible and intangible benefits, availability of resource mix, and the underlying project risk. Risk related dependency can be co-related and can be measured. Although the risk is intangible but a rupee value can always be assigned to it by risk determination factor taking into consideration the three main risks i.e. Size, Structure, and Technology risk. Risk is inversely proportional to these three factors. The problem of determining risk factor can be solved easily by multiplying proportions of risk and the relational interdependency factor, called common risk, and subsequently taking the square root of it. And as risk is tangible to some extent, we have called this square root value as the relative risk factor making it our Risk Related objective function.

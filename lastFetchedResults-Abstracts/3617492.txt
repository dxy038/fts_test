A postprocessing method for the correction of visual demosaicking artifacts is introduced. The restored, full-color images previously obtained by cost-effective color filter array interpolators are processed to improve their visual quality. Based on a localized color ratio model and the original underlying Bayer pattern structure, the proposed solution impressively removes false colors while maintaining image sharpness. At the same time, it yields excellent improvements in terms of objective image quality measures.

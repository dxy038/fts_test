A visual tracking based method of measuring some parkinsonian symptoms quantitatively and objectively is proposed. A mathematical model of the dose-effect relationship of levodopa (a drug used in the symptomatic therapy of ParkinsonÂ´s disease) is derived with the aid of this method. The derived model is used to optimize the dosage regimen with respect to a sensible objective function which includes the parkinsonian symptoms and the amount of levodopa which is to be administered. Clinical results of this therapy opimization are discussed. Drawbacks of this approach are pointed out and some further research topics are suggested.

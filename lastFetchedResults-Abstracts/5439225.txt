The objective of this paper is focused on numerical modeling of WDM (Wavelength-Division Multiplex) transmission systems that employ new classes of high-order PSK (Phase-Shift Keying) modulation formats. This paper provides investigation of signals propagation with corresponding degradation mechanisms in physical layer, when high-order phase modulation formats are used for their transmission. The impacts of linear and nonlinear effects on modulated signal in multichannel system are studied. For this purpose, it was created numerical model by solving CNLSE (Coupled Nonlinear Schro&#776;dingerÂ´s Equations) through SSFM (Split-Step Fourier Method). The fundamental characteristics of optical fibers, employed modulation format and WDM system parameters are significant for our investigation, because they play important role for behavior of modulated signals. Our results are analyzed and interpreted by the way of finding out the suitable and optimal system settings for transmission of phase modulated signals.

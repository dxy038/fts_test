The objective of this paper is to investigate different diversity techniques for broadcast networks that will minimize the complexity and improve received SNR of broadcast systems. Resultant digital broadcast networks would require fewer transmitter sites and thus be more cost-effective and have less environmental impact. The techniques can be applied to DVB-T, DVB-H and DAB systems that use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). These are key radio broadcast network technologies, which are expected to complement emerging technologies such as WiMAX and future 4G networks for delivery of broadband content. Transmitter and receiver diversity technologies can increase the frequency and time selectivity of the resulting channel transfer function at the receiver. Diversity exploits the statistical nature of fading due to multipath and reduces the likelihood of deep fading by providing a diversity of transmission signals. Multiple signals are transmitted in such a way as to ensure that several signals reach the receiver each with uncorrelated fading. Transmit diversity is more practical than receive diversity due to the difficulty of locating two receive antennas far enough apart in a small mobile device. The schemes examined here comply with existing DVB standards and can be incorporated into existing systems without change. The diversity techniques introduced in this paper are applied to the DVB-H system. Bit error performance investigations were conducted by simulation for different DVB-H and diversity parameters

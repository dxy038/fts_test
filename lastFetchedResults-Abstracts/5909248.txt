Applying synthetic aperture interferometric radiometer (SAIR) in near field imaging has been receiving great interest in the recent years. Because the traditional far-field Fourier imaging theory is not valid in near-field condition, developing the proper near-field imaging techniques is the major desirable objective of near field SAIR applications. This work is devoted to establish an effective near field imaging method still with traditional far-field plane antenna array. The discrete numerical inversion method with focal plane approximation is developed. The regularization method is also introduced to deal with the ill condition and measurement errors.

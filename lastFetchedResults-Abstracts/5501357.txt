The aim of remote sensing image processing is to extract important geographic information toward a better understanding of the objective world. ERDAS IMAGINE is a system for processing of remote sensing images, which provides abundant and functional image processing tools, especially the tools for spatial modeler. In this paper, using the spatial modeler, we have developed several graphic models for remote sensing image enhancement based on the fundamental principles of image processing. The results showed that the developed models are easy to use and make the image processing faster. Additionally, the simulated running of the models confirmed the feasibility of those graphic models for remote sensing image processing.

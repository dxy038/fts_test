The theoretical performance of class E frequency multipliers described by Kozyrev bears little resemblance to the observed performance of such circuits. This paper provides a new analysis of idealized class E frequency multipliers similar to that used by Raab in his description of class E amplifiers, in that the equations describing multiplier operation are obtained from Fourier series methods and the assumption of an infinite output network <img src="/images/tex/6.gif" alt="Q"/> . The equations so obtained are used to determine 1) optimum operation (maximum power output capability at 100-percent efficiency) at any harmonic, and 2) design equations that yield the requisite component values for optimum operation. The equations provide an easily used design method for optimum class E multipliers but allow the implementation of nonoptimum multipliers to suit any design objective. Class E multipliers with moderate values of output network <img src="/images/tex/6.gif" alt="Q"/> were constructed and tested. The measured performance of these experimental circuits shows excellent agreement to the theoretical performance predicted by the equations.

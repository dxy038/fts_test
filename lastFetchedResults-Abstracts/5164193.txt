Recognizing different kinds of fruits and vegetables is a common task in supermarkets. This task, however, poses several challenges as it requires the identification of different species of a particular produce and also its variety. Usually, existing computer-based recognition approaches are not automatic and demand long-term and laborious prior training sessions. This paper presents a novel framework for classifier fusion aiming at supporting the automatic recognition of fruits and vegetables in a supermarket environment. The objective is to provide an effective mechanism for combining low-cost classifiers trained for specific classes of interest. The experiments performed demonstrate that the proposed framework yields better results than several related work found in the literature and represents a step forward automatic produce recognition in cashiers of supermarkets.

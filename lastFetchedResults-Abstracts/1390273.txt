Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are a diverse group of double-stranded DNA viruses, of which 12 viral types have been detected and characterized so far. However, there is still a limited understanding of the diversity of BPV. Several putative new BPVs have been detected and some of these have been recently characterized as new viral types. However, only a very limited amount of information is available on the pathology associated with these novel viral types yet this information could be of significant value in improving our understanding of the biology of BPV. The objective of this study was to examine some of the epidemiological features of cutaneous bovine papillomatosis in Brazilian cattle, in particular to establish the relationship between BPV types isolated from beef and dairy cattle herds and the lesions they cause.

y-two cutaneous lesions were collected from 60 animals. Histopathological, PCR and sequencing assays were conducted to characterize the lesions and detect the BPV types responsible. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the maximum likelihood method. BPV types 1–6 and 8–10 were found, as well as a putative new BPV type that belongs to the Deltapapillomavirus genus. The tumors were all classified as fibropapillomas. This is believed to be the first record of BPV types 3 and 10 associated with fibropapillomas. These results confirm that there is a wide range of BPV types that infect cattle, and that an understanding of this diversity is necessary for improved methods of therapeutic treatment.

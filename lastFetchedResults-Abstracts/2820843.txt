The application of phase change materials (PCMs) for solar thermal-energy storage capacities has received considerable attention in recent years due to their large storage capacity and isothermal nature of the storage process. This paper reports the results of an experimental investigation on the thermophysical properties of composites materials (Epoxy resin/metal tubes) filled with paraffin developed to improve different properties of PCM and open a wide field of applications to latent heat storage systems. The objective of this research is to use PCM composite as integrated components in a passive solar wall. The proposed composite TROMBE wall allows daily storage of the solar energy in a building envelope and restitution in the evening, with a possible control of the air flux in a ventilated air layer. An experimental set-up was built to determine the thermal response of these composites to thermal solicitations. The results have shown that most important thermal properties of these composites at the solid and liquid states, like the "apparent" thermal conductivity, the heat storage capacity and the latent heat of fusion. Results indicate the performance of the proposed system is affected by the thermal effectiveness of phase change material and significant amount of energy saving can be achieved. Experimental investigations of the thermophysical properties of composites materials (Epoxy resin/metal tubes) filled with paraffin have shown that these materials combine a high heat storage capability and an enhanced heat transfer at the same time.

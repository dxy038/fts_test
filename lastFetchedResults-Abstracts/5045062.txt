The objective of this paper is to present an approach to apply the Organizational Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3) to effectively assess organizational project management capability. Assessment index system is put forward based on OPM3, and BP neural network assessment model is constructed. Model is trained and validated through computer simulation by Matlab software. The result shows that the proposed approach can obtain objective and accurate assessment.

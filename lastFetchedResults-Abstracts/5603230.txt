Given a transfer line with individual machines reliability data, and given fixed size buffer zones for work in process across the transfer line, the objective is to determine the transfer line maximal sustainable mean production rate. We present a recursive algorithm based on a recently developed transfer line decomposition technique to evaluate a maximal sustainable throughput. The algorithm derived provably converges. Numerical results are compared with those obtained based on other competing algorithms in the literature for similar transfer lines.

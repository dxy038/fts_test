A multi-objective Pareto genetic algorithm design methodology is applied to thinned planar arrays to simultaneously minimize peak side-lobe levels and target an elliptical mainbeam with specific minimum and maximum half-power beamwidths. This new radiation pattern synthesis technique for thinned planar arrays provides antenna engineers with a set of tradeoffs between low side-lobe levels and close adherence to mainbeam design objectives (i.e., the specified half-power beamwidths corresponding to the major and minor axes of an elliptical mainbeam). One Pareto optimization example is presented for a thinned low side-lobe planar array with a desired minimum and maximum beamwidth of 8.4&#176; and 12&#176; respectively. Two designs from the Pareto front are discussed, one with a -20.92 dB side-lobe level and beamwidths between 11.5&#176; and 7.5&#176; and a second with a -18.97 dB side-lobe level with beamwidths between 12&#176; and 7.93&#176;.

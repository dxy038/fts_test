The objective of this research is to investigate the comparison nanosilica and aluminium powder in epoxy as adhesive on shear strength of single lap joint between aluminium-GFRP composite. The shear strength was determined by utilizing the single-lap shear test. The nanosilica content was varied in 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 (w/w), whereas the content of aluminium powder was varied in 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 (w/w). Experimental results showed that the nanosilica-epoxy adhesive has the maximum shear strength at 2% nanosilica content. However, for the use of the aluminium powder-epoxy adhesive, the shear strength decreased significantly along with elevated level of aluminium powder. The adhesive failure mode occurres the joining using nanosilica-epoxy as adhesive, and the joining using aluminium powder-epoxy as adhesive is categoried as cohesive failure mode. The cohesive failure mode has higher shear strength over adhesive failure mode.

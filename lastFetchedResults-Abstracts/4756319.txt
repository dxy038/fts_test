This paper presents a Fuzzy controller applied to a DC-DC Boost converter in order to minimize the system´s power loss effects by adjusting the duty cycle of the converter. The variation in the input voltage and the losses in the electronic components of the converter (load variations) are the main causes of these power losses. The main objective of the controller is to maintain a constant voltage at the load regardless of these losses. The Fuzzy controller was embedded on a Digital Signal Processor in order to have a great reliability and a faster system response. The results show that the Fuzzy control technique can be utilized to minimize the effects of the system´s uncertainties and disturbances while keeping the system´s output response in its operating point.

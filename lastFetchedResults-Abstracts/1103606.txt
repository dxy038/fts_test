The tendency of over-estimation of sun-glint reflectance was found in GLI satellite ocean color data, after applying the traditional sun-glint model of Cox and Munk together with objective analysis wind data. ADEOS-II has provided a good opportunity to improve the glint model using data measured by GLI and SeaWinds, both onboard the satellite. With the help of simultaneous wind measurements achieved by SeaWinds, the Cox and Munk model is re-evaluated using GLI measurements to obtain a new relationship between the surface mean square slope and wind. The new model was found to be very close to the Cox and Munk under moderate wind speed but is much different under calm condition, where it shows similarity to the result reported by Ebuchi and Kizu. It also improves the ocean color data availability and the precision of sun-glint reflectance, based on the evaluation result of the generated Level 3 data products.

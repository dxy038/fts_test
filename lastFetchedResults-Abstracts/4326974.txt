A mathematical model for the optimization of electricity distribution networks with several voltage levels is described. In the model the objective function includes all the costs of the system. A suitable optimization method is used to minimize the objective function considering the technical constraints. The model is based on a greenfield situation with no existing networks and it gives the optimal values for the number and sizes of equipment at each voltage level. All the costs of this optimal system are also given.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

In this paper, the energy-based localization problem in wireless sensor networks is addressed. The maximum likelihood (ML) location estimation problem is a difficult optimization problem due to the non-convexity of the objective function, and an exact solution is difficult to obtain. An approximate solution to the ML problem is proposed, by relaxing the minimization problem into semidefinite programming form. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions.

This paper presents a structure of classes based on Object-Oriented Programming, which allows the development of an Optimization Library. In this library, deterministic and stochastic optimization algorithms are considered, as well as algorithms that work with constrained or unconstrained objective functions. We present the characteristics of some main optimization methods used in recent years, mainly in the electromagnetic area. Then, based on these characteristics, we show the classes created for the implementation of this optimization library. Finally, we present the communication architecture used for data exchange between this library and a Finite Element Method software

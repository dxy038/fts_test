Extracting the clear fundus images information is a prerequisite for diagnosing the patientspsila conditions exactly in clinic. This paper adopts respectively de-noising algorithm based on multi-scale and that based on median filter to process real fundus images. It gives the LMLSD algorithm based on Gaussian wave extraction, which is used to estimate SNR (signal-to-noise) of the processed images and give an objective quantitative evaluation to treatment effect of the above two de-noising algorithms. The results show that the image processed by multi-scale algorithm is much clearer, and SNR increases significantly. The results of objective quantitative evaluation are in accordance with subjective visual feeling, so the selecting of evaluation algorithm is appropriate.

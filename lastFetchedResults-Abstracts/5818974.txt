The objective of this paper is to propose a simple emulator of variable speed wind turbine generator, which consists of two inverters control two squirrel cage induction motors. One acts as prime mover and other acts as variable speed generator. As prime mover, the manual speed command is used to simulate as close as possible of wind turbine. As generator, the variable speed self excited induction generator is implemented by controlling slip speed at negative all time, in which a rotor speed is greater than a synchronous speed approximately 3%. Therefore, the generator operates at high efficiency. The development construction is implemented by a high performance monolithic intelligent motor controller, which is designed for Volts-per-Hertz speed control. It operates at 32-bit calculations for high-precision based on digital signal processing (DSP) filtering to enhance speed stability together with low-cost for implementation. The experimental results express that the characteristic and the performance of the system can be built up the voltage for a wide speed range both sub and super synchronous speed. This system is necessary for laboratory to improve the quality of wind power generation research.

Switched reluctance motor is featured with more advantages like reliable operation and simple construction. However, it demonstrates especially large torque ripple while running, which restricts its massive use. As drive system of switched reluctance motor is a complex time-varying and nonlinear system, this makes it very difficult to apply ordinary controls to switched reluctance motor. However, direct torque control technology as stated in this article will directly consider the torque as controlled objective. It emphasizes the effects of direct control of torque. This will eliminate complex transformation of vector and simplifies the process of mathematic motor model so that control structure is simple and control procedure is direct. In this article, direct torque control technology is applied for the control of switched reluctance motor so that speed governing can take place quickly and steadily while the motor is suppressing torque ripple effectively.

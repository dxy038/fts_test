The objective of any software development is to deploy quality product with zero defects by meeting the end user expectations. There are several Software Development Life Cycle methodologies being followed to achieve this and the selection of best methodology is circumstance dependent. With our experience using Lean and Agile principles since last 4 years, in this paper we would like to explain in detail with statistics that these principles and practices can be successfully implemented in a iterative model development SDLC to achieve the matured, quality software in a long term medical imaging product. We will prove that it has positive impact on the software quality by comparing the outcome after following Lean and Agile principles with the prior results where traditional waterfall method was followed.

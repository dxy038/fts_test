The main objective of the interface controller depicted in this paper is to improve data capture from a multi touch interface based on FTIR (frustrated-total-internal-reflection) techniques, applying thresholding methods for image segmentation. In order to arrive to this goal, a FPGA based controller has been developed, which will be able to process a video signal in real time, thus allowing data to be extracted into a computer system for different applications. This controller also allows full system calibration, based on a real time histogram generator, which forms part of the developed system.

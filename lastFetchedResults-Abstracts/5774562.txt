A new multi-sensor image registration technique is proposed based on detecting the feature corner points using modified Harris Corner Detector (HDC). These feature points are matched using multi-objective optimization (distance condition and angle criterion) based on Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO). This optimization process is more efficient as it considers both the distance and angle criteria to incorporate multi-objective switching in the fitness function. This optimization process helps in picking up three corresponding corner points detected in the sensed and base image and thereby using the affine transformation, the sensed image is aligned with the base image. Further, the results show that the new approach can provide a new dimension in solving multi-sensor image registration problems. From the obtained results, the performance of image registration is evaluated and is concluded that the proposed approach is efficient.

The basic principles of SAR jamming performance evaluation (JPE) are discussed firstly. A novel evaluation method of SAR jamming performance by combining the subjective evaluation and objective evaluation is proposed. Namely, based on the objective evaluation parameters, a nominal value of SAR jamming performance can be obtained by weighting the objective evaluation parameters, where the weighted factors come from expertÂ´s judgments. Detailed derivations are given as well as the simulation experiments.

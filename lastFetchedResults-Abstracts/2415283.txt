Objective
Definitive diagnosis of the central nervous system (CNS) lesions is unknown
prior to histopathological examination. To determine the method and the
endpoint for surgery, intraoperative evaluation of the lesion helps the surgeon.
In this study, the diagnostic accuracy and pitfalls of using frozen section (FS) of
CNS lesions is determined.
Materials & Methods
In this retrospective study, we analyzed the results of FS and permanent diagnoses
of all CNS lesions by reviewing reports from 3 general hospitals between March
2001 and March 2011.
Results
273 cases were reviewed and patients with an age range from 3 to 77 years of
age were considered. 166 (60.4%) had complete concordance between FS and
permanent section diagnosis, 83 (30.2%) had partial concordance, and 24 cases
(9.5%) were discordant. Considering the concordant and partially concordant
cases, the accuracy rate was 99.5%, sensitivity was 91.4%, specificity was
99.7%, and positive and negative predictive values were 88.4% and 99.8%,
respectively.
Conclusion
Our results show high sensitivity and specificity of FS diagnosis in the evaluation
of CNS lesions. A Kappa agreement score of 0.88 shows high concordance
for FS results with permanent section. Pathologistâ€™s misinterpretation, small
biopsy samples (not representative of the entire tumor), suboptimal slides, and
inadequate information about tumor location and radiologic findings appear to
be the major causes for these discrepancies indicated from our study.

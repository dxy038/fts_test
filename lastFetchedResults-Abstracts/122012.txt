According to the official report, total sandy soil and sand dune in Khuzestan province are more than 350000 hectares, and the large scale of these are located in around of Karkheh river. The implementation of desertification control and sand dune fixation started from 1969 from which to now more than 85000 hectares were implemented by biological operating and physico-chemical activities and people's participation schemes. The main objective of this investigation was to estimate suitable emitter in sand dune and to suggest some recommendation in terms of cultivating potato (Solarium tubberosum L.) plant in such condition. Potato tuber planted in plot.the size of each plot was 20 x 10m. and the distance of two plants were 0.5 x 0. 9m, in form of Split Latin Squar Desgin on two artificial hard pan in 40 and 60 centimeters depth. Potato plants were irrigated by drip, spray jet emitters and furrow systems. The depth of irrigation was estimated based on 40% of total available water and 80% of evaporated water from the installed pan evaporation class A. Results show that the trickle irrigation increase water use efficiency, leaf tickness and yield(17.31 ton/ha). The average yield in all treatments was 16.25 ton per hectar. It is concluded that the trickle irrigation could provide water requirments in zoon root with less waste water percolation. Comparison of the results shows that the application and distribution efficiencies are higher for the trickle irrigation,but according to the Leaf Area Index(LAI) measurments, conventional planted distance must be improved for increasing yield per hectar.

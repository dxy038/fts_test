CPU scheduling is one of the most important tasks of operating system, which provides a specific sequence of execution for the processes waiting in queue. The scheduling of processes has very much impact on efficiency and performance of CPU. The major objective of this task is to maximize the efficiency and hence the performance. We present a Genetic Algorithm based approach for CPU scheduling. Genetic algorithm is evolutionary technique which finds optimal solutions for NP hard problems. Genetic Algorithm based approach presented here, is used to find near optimal solution for the scheduling problem. The algorithm schedules the processes based on their average waiting time. We implement and compare the results of two traditional algorithms: FCFS (First Come First Serve) and SJF (Shortest Job First) with Genetic algorithm based CPU scheduling.

This paper considers the problem of simultaneous fault detection and control (SFDC) in continuous-time switched linear systems. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimization problem and the results are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Extended LMIs are used in the design of detector/controller to reduce conservatism. An average dwell-time approach is used to guarantee the stability and weighted H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance of the closed loop system. Finally an illustrative example of SFDC design for the highly manoeuvrable technology vehicle is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Power electronic systems comprising a high number of power converters on the load and energy supply side can be considered as smart micro or nano grids. Realizing such smart micro or nano grids means always the need of complex power electronics, consisting of electrically isolated and/or non-isolated, unidirectional and/or bidirectional AC/DC and/or DC/DC converters. Due to the requirement of different power converters a high number of active power switches, isolated gate drive supplies, isolated voltage and current measurements are necessary. In that case classic centralized control approaches are leading to very high efforts for wired connections. By using really intelligent power modules comprising novel two-wire interfaces with integrated power and signal transfer, control overhead by wired connections could be effectively reduced and safe galvanic isolation can be achieved.

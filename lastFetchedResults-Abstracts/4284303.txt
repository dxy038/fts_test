Phytoremediation is a promising tool in removing pollutants from the environment or in rendering them harmless. Some previous reports showed that Fe deficiency in dicots induced the stimulated accumulation of a number of micronutrient metals other than Fe. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of Fe deficiency on the uptake of cadmium (Cd) by tomato (<i>Lycopersicon.</i> <i>Esculentum</i> <i>Mill.</i>) in hydroponic culture. Results showed that Fe deficiency induced cadmium uptake, biomass decrease and changes of pH and Eh in hydroponic culture. Under Fe deficiency status, the decrease in pH and the increase in Eh might result in higher cadmium availability. Values of bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) indicated that Fe-deficiency status affected cadmium accumulation and translocation in tomato. The results of this research would significantly improve the understanding of metal removal from the contaminated environment.

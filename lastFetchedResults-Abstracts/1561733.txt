Dynamic model identification and state variables estimation from the corrupted measurement data have been attracted much research efforts during the recent years. In this way, Kalman and H-infinity filters have been increasingly used to estimate the parameters individually. In this paper, a mixed kalman-H_? filter is designed in an innovative approach using a multi-objective optimization method. It is desired to simultaneously employ the advantages of both filters to minimize both the root-mean squared errors and the upper bounds limit of estimation errors associated with Kalman and H-infinity filters, respectively. Some Pareto optimum design points are presented for two case studies from which trade-off optimum design points can be simply selected.

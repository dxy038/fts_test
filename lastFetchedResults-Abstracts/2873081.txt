In this paper, new classes of generalized invex functions called (h, &#966;) - &#961; invex functions, (h, &#966;) - &#961; quasi invex functions and (h, &#966;) - &#961; pseudo invex functions are introduced, multi-objective semi-infinite programming involving new generalized functions is researched, the sufficient optimality conditions are obtained under weaker convexity.

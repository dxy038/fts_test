Endometritis is accepted as a major hindrance to achieve optimal reproductive efficiency in mares. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of combined therapy of immunomodulator and ecbolic as an alternative stand-alone therapy for mares with persistent endometritis. On the basis of history, culture, endometrial cytology, and per rectal and/or ultrasonographic genital examinations, 76 subfertile mares were selected and assigned to three age groups and four treatment (G-1, 2, 3) and control (G-4) groups. At estrus, all the mares were bred once naturally. Thereafter, the mares of G-1 (n = 28) were aseptically treated at 6-hours after natural service with intrauterine infusion (in 50 mL normal saline solution) of 100 μg of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Additionally, these mares received two injections of 20 IU of oxytocin (IV) at 12 and 24-hours after infusion. Mares in group G-2 (n = 11) were treated with LPS as mares of G-1, whereas mares in G-3 (n = 12) received oxytocin injections only. The mares of G-4 (n = 23) did not receive any treatment. Pregnancy rates at day 21 and foaling rates were higher (P < .001) in group G-1 than in G-4. In G-1, higher percentage of mares at ages 6–10 years conceived and foaled than mares aged ≥16 years. On re-swabbing of mares that remained nonpregnant, the majority of G-1 and G-2 mares demonstrated sterile cultures and negative cytology, whereas uterine inflammation persisted in mares of G-3 and G-4. In conclusion, the combined therapy was effective for the elimination of persistent endometritis and improved reproductive performance of subfertile mares.

Aiming at the deficiencies of the traffic signal cycle optimization in the regional traffic signal control system and considering vehicle emission pollution, this paper proposed a traffic signal cycle optimization method based on bi-level programming model, and attempted to take reducing vehicle emission as one of the signal control objective parameters. Then the improved PSO algorithm was proposed to solve the optimization model. Finally, the effectiveness of the optimization model and the algorithm was verified through VISSIM and MATLAB. The results indicate that the traffic signal cycle optimization method proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the network delay and vehicle emission.

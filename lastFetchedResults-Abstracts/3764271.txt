The leakage reactance of the machine is expressed as an equation involving slot leakage, end-connection leakage, differential leakage, stator-halves leakage, and tooth-top leakage reactance. This leakage reactance equation, or objective function, is then minimized under suitable constraints. Geometric programming is used to carry through the optimization procedure. A computer program is developed and applied to find the optimum leakage reactance for a 95 kVA, 208 V, wye-connected, 40 800 r/min aerospace alternator, using 8-, 10-, and 12-pole machines.

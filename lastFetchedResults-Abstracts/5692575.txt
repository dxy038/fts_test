Along with the growing software market in recent years, business requirements are changing more rapidly and the complexity of enterprise applications is growing continuously. An ideal goal is to encapsulate these requirements into a high-level abstraction, which can be used to drive large-scale adaptation of the underlying software implementation. Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is one of the enabling techniques that support this objective. One of the important parts in this process is the creation of Platform Independent Model (PIM). There are several approaches on this matter. However there is still the absence of clear documentation on the methods especially when the purpose is aimed for generic PIMs in a specific domain. This article introduces an approach to developing PIMs by using UML, OCL and promotes agility by applying agile modeling for this purpose. A practical example will be demonstrated.

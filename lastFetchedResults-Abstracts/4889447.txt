On the premise that the roller press drive is properly selected and applied, the cost of roll surface wear, machine availability and energy savings will be improved. The most important requirement to reach this objective is that relative motions must not occur between the material slab surface and the welded roll surface. Such relative motion would inevitably result in excessive wear and even spalling of the roll surface because the welded roll surface does not resist shear stress. The author discusses how to overcome these problems using speed-elastic squirrel cage motor drive technology

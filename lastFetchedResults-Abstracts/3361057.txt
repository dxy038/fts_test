In this paper the nonlinear dynamics of interconnected power converters in an islanded direct current (DC) microgrid is analyzed. By using a simplified scheme based on two cascaded converters we analyze the dynamical behavior that can arise from the interconnection of these devices on a common DC bus. Furthermore, in order to address the bus voltage control problem, we propose a Sliding Mode Controller for a DC-DC bidirectional power converter to control the DC bus voltage under instantaneous constant power loads. This class of loads introduces a destabilizing nonlinear effect on the converter through an inverse voltage term that can lead to significant oscillations in the DC bus voltage. Simulation results are shown to illustrate the nonlinear analysis.

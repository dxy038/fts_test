An Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) is a machine able to extract information from its environment and use knowledge about its world to move safely in a meaningful and purposeful manner. Robot Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance are from the most important problems in mobile robots, especially in unknown environments. It must be able to interact with other objects safely. Several techniques such as Fuzzy logic, Reinforcement learning, Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms, have applied to AMR in order to improve their performance. During the past several years Hybrid Genetic-fuzzy method has emerged as one of the most active and fruitful areas for research in the application of intelligent system design. The objective of this work is to provide a Hybrid method by which an improved set of rules governing the actions and behavior of a simple navigating and obstacle avoiding AMR. Genes are in the form of distances and angles labels. The chromosomes are represented as a rule written in a Boolean algebraic form. The method used to enhance the performance employs a simulation model designed by using Visual Basic software.

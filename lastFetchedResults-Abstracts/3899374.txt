The development of the algorithm is based on a set theoretic approach to regularization. Deterministic and/or statistical information about the undistorted image and statistical information about the noise are directly incorporated into the iterative procedure. The restored image is the center of an ellipsoid bounding the intersection of two ellipsoids. The proposed algorithm, which has the constrained least squares algorithm as a special case, is extended into an adaptive iterative restoration algorithm. The spatial adaptivity is introduced to incorporate properties of the human visual system. Convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms is established. For the experimental results which are shown, the adaptively restored images have better quality than the nonadaptively restored ones based on visual observations and on an objective criterion of merit which accounts for the noise masking property of the visual system

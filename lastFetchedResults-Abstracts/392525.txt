Objective: To search the effects of administration of various concentrations of a wide-spectrum antimicrobial agent, chlorhexidine, to the nasal mucosa. Material and methods: About 0.20, 0.12, 0.06 and 0.03% concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate were applied to the rabbit nasal mucosa as one puff twice a day throughout 5 days. Another group, treated with serum saline to the nose, behaved as the control group. On the fifth day following drug administration, specimens were taken from nasal mucosa of the rabbits and examined under light microscope. Results: As a result of comparison between drug treated group and control group, with increasing drug concentrations progressively increased neutrophil infiltration in mucosa, ciliary loss in cells, and occasional metaplasia were observed. Conclusion: There is a linear, positive and strong association between concentrations of chlorhexidine and its irritative effects on rabbit nasal mucosa. While 0.20 and 0.12% concentrations of chlorhexidine cause excess irritation on the nasal cavity, 0.06 and 0.03% concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate causes lower irritation and effects on the animals which have experimentally induced rhinosinusitis must be evaluated.

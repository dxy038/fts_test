A cascade synthesis procedure for constructing high frequency narrow-band (or high quality factor) single-mode optical fiber transversal filters using <img src="/images/tex/9672.gif" alt="j \\times j (j \\geq 2)"/> bidirectional couplers is reported. Design and analysis of the cascade filters are described. Experimental results of many fabricated cascade filters with tap numbers up to 256 and the first-order passband frequencies up to 3.25 GHz are consistent with the mathematical analysis.

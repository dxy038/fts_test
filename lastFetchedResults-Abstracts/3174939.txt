A vertical bidirectional IGBT having all its main electrodes in the front side of the silicon wafer is proposed. The main goal of the proposed structure is to overcome the difficulties and complexity of packaging realization encountered in some of the proposed vertical power bidirectional switches. Indeed, they generally have their main electrodes (anode and cathode) and their MOS gate electrodes on both sides of the wafer. Extensive 2D simulations were used in order to validate the device operating modes and to analyse the device static as well as dynamic performances. The technological process suitable for its realization is also described.

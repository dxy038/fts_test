The objective of this paper is to highlight landmarks in burn prevention. Novel strategies in the areas of law and regulation, environmental and consumer product design, and educational programs are identified and discussed. Notwithstanding marked reductions in burn morbidity and mortality, especially in economically developed countries, burn injuries remain an important public health concern throughout the world. More, and more effective, burn prevention programs coupled with renewed efforts to reduce the social and environmental correlates of burn injuries (poverty, overcrowding, family stress, and educational deficits) are needed to further reduce burn incidence and its long-term sequelae.

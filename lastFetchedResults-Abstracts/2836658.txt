The purpose of this paper is to show possibilities of modern game device such a Microsoft Kinect sensor for examinations in otoneurology. There are several traditional examinations, which can be revived for use in current medical practice. The aim of this study was to utilize skeleton tracking feature of the Microsoft Kinect sensor to monitor patients´ movement to provide objective outputs from particular examination. The preliminary tests have shown that device is able to provide significant information that can be useful for implementation of Unterberger´s and Hautant´s test. Hautant´s test has been subsequently programmed for laboratory experiments and in the course of this year the results will be discussed and tested in cooperation with specialists in otoneurology. The combination of Kinect sensor and future software application appear to be further applicable with possible benefits in practice. Using gaming equipment can greatly accelerate the development, because research does not need to focus on the development of hardware, but most efforts may be directed to the implementation of the particular objectives and results may be earlier deployed for practical tests and use. Great importance is also the price of the hardware. Due to the masses spread of the gaming industry the price is much lower than the equipment developed specifically for particular medicine examination. However, to enforce any new device into practical use in medicine is a complicated process and push the proposed solution, at least for screening tests will be a sufficient satisfaction.

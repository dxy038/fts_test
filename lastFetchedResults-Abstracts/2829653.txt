This paper presents a real-time decolorization method. Given the human visual systems preference for luminance information, the luminance should be preserved as much as possible during decolorization. As a result, the proposed decolorization method measures the amount of color contrast/detail lost when converting color to luminance. The detail loss is estimated by computing the difference between two intermediate images: one obtained by applying bilateral filter to the original color image, and the other obtained by applying joint bilateral filter to the original color image with its luminance as the guidance image. The estimated detail loss is then mapped to a grayscale image named residual image by minimizing the difference between the image gradients of the input color image and the objective grayscale image that is the sum of the residual image and the luminance. Apparently, the residual image will contain pixels with all zero values (that is the two intermediate images will be the same) only when no visual detail is missing in the luminance. Unlike most previous methods, the proposed decolorization method preserves both contrast in the color image and the luminance. Quantitative evaluation shows that it is the top performer on the standard test suite. Meanwhile it is very robust and can be directly used to convert videos while maintaining the temporal coherence. Specifically it can convert a high-resolution video (1280 &#215; 720) in real time (about 28 Hz) on a 3.4 GHz i7 CPU.

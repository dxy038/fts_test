BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Resveratrol is a natural phytoalexin found in certain plants, such as red grapes. Several studies confirm the beneficial effects of resveratrol on the cardiovascular system. Similar to many other polyphenols, resveratrol initiates the intracellular pathways which are activated under energy constraints. This review aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on the cardiovascular health, focusing on the associated cellular and molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: In this study, we searched for English and Persian articles in PubMed and SID databases using keywords such as resveratrol, nitric oxide (NO), endothelial, cardiovascular diseases, oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, cardiac protection and polyphenol. Related articles were mostly published during 2002-2013.
FINDINGS: The initial survey of 72 collected articles indicated that resveratrol is able to neutralize oxidative species and activate Nrf2 while minimizing antioxidant damage. In addition, this compound enhances vascular function through increasing the production and bioavailability of NO in blood vessels via the stimulation of estrogen receptors. On the other hand, resveratrol, similar to calorie restriction, activates SIRT1 which is an NAD-dependent deacetylase. In addition, resveratrol exerts anti-inflammatory effects on blood vessels through NF-?B and inhibits platelet aggregation using NO. Resveratrol also provides cardiac protection against reperfusion injuries and is able to slow down the process of aortic and cardiac hypertrophy resulting in hypotension.
CONCLUSION: Resveratrol affects endothelial function, oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, platelet aggregation, hypertension, atherosclerosis and cardiac hypertrophy through a variety of mechanisms.

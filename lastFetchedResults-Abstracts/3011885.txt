This paper describes a simulation-based analysis of a printed circuit board (PCB) testing process. The PCBs are used in a defense application and the testing process is fairly complex. Boards are mounted on a test unit in batches and go through three thermal test cycles. As boards fail testing during the thermal cycling, operators can either replace the failed boards at fixed points during the cycling or can allow the test unit to complete the testing cycle before removing failed boards. The primary objective of the simulation study is to select an operating strategy for a given set of operating parameters. A secondary objective is to identify the operating factors to which the strategy selection is sensitive. Initial testing indicated that failed boards should be replaced as soon as possible under the current operating configuration of the sponsorÂ´s facility. Secondary testing is also described.

There are more product specifications, great production and much equipment over the whole process of tire building. The actual complex scheduling problem of tire building is described in detail. To solve the complex multi-objective, large-scale production scheduling problem of tire building, a heuristic algorithm is proposed from the experience of the experts. The algorithm was tested by online data. Results show that the heuristic algorithm can quickly workout the optimal production scheduling of tire building, reduce the production cost, and improve productivity. The algorithm will lay the firm groundwork for application to production process in the future.

Objective To investigate the relationships
between type A behaviour pattern (TABP) and
psychological distress measured in middle aged men
participating in two surveys 28 years apart. Design
and subjects Men residing in Oslo and born in 1923–
1952 (all men aged 40–49 years and 7% of those aged
20–39 years—30,016 altogether) were invited to a
cardiovascular screening in 1972/1973—asking about
risk factors, symptoms and diseases. All the 17,972
participants were also asked questions about TABP
(two items) and psychological distress (one item). Of
the original invited cohort, those who still lived in
Oslo or its vicinity in 2000 were invited to a new
health examination carried through by similar procedures.
Among other questions the participants
answered ten items about psychological distress
(Hopkins Symptoms Checklist: HSCL-10). Altogether
7,393 men participated in both surveys. Results In
1972/1973 almost 57% of those participating twice
considered themselves as a person who stresses
himself and chooses high speed and at the same time
denied that they rather preferred a tranquil and quiet
life—a combination of answeres defined as type A
behavior pattern. The corresponding TABP in 2000,
when most of the men were retired, was 27%. A
confirmatory factor analyses based on questions
asked in 2000, verified that the HSCL/distress items
reflected one underlying latent factor, and that this
was a different factor than the one reflected in the two
TABP items. The cross-sectional association between
TABP and distress in 1972/1973 was highly significant
(P < 0.001)—the odds ratio for psychological distress
adjusted for background variables was 2.23 (95%
confidence interval 1.98, 2.50). The corresponding
association in 2000 showed a higher mean HSCL-10
score and a higher proportion with HSCL-score ‡1.85
in men with TABP compared with men without
(P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively), but the odds
ratio in 2000 was lower than the result 28-years earlier.
When those reporting psychological distress in
1972/1973 were excluded, TABP in 1972/1973 predicted
psychological distress (HSCL-10) in the followup
survey when adjusted for background variables
(P < 0.05) using structural equation modelling. Conclusion
Type A behaviour pattern and psychological
distress reflect two different latent factors. TABP
seems to be associated with psychological distress,
both cross-sectionally and prospectively. This
knowledge permits early detection of individuals who
have a higher probability of experiencing psychological
distress over a considerable period of time

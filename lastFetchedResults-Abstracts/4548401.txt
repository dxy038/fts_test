A low loss bidirectional switch set is proposed for a matrix power converter. The proposed switch is able to turn on at zero current and turn off at zero voltage to achieve almost zero loss and soft switching. Hence, a simple hysteretic current control can now be applied directly to a matrix power converter without adding any additional snubber circuit and worrying about the short circuit problem. Hence, hardware implementation of the matrix power converter becomes very simple. Moreover, efficiency of the converter can be greatly increased without sacrificing its dynamic performance

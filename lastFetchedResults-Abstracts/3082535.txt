The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of nanoscale carriers such as liposomes for tramdermal delivery of piroxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The effect of liposomes on the percutaneous permeation of piroxicam across the rat skin was investigated in vitro using modified Franz type diffusion cells. Different liposomal formulations have been prepared and characterized in order to obtain the highest efficiency of the drug entrapment. Their topical performances have been compared with a non liposomal system containing piroxicam. Our results demonstrated that the incorporation of piroxicam in liposomes modified their ability to permeate through skin

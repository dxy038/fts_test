The modification of polyethylene surface has been used to obtain better interaction between organic polymeric surfaces and inorganic species. A previous treatment with modifiers is required in order to provide the adherence to the polymer surface. Our objective was the synthesis and the electrical characterization of copper sulfide coated low-density polyethylene (CuS-LDPE) films. SEM micrographs and AFM images showed a homogeneous distribution of copper sulfide, which contributes to the increasing of the electrical conductivity. X-ray analysis showed an increase of the copper sulfide crystals according to the number of immersions in the precursor sulfide solution. The measured conductivity of the CuS-LDPE films was in the range of 3.6–163.3 S cm−1, according to the number of immersions on the precursor solution.

This paper describes the thermal and mechanical properties of nanocomposites based on polylactic acid (PLA) and microfibrillated cellulose (MFC). The primary objective of this study was to improve the storage modulus of PLA at a high temperature. MFC and PLA were mixed in an organic solvent with various fiber contents up to 20 wt%, followed by drying, kneading and hot pressing into sheets. The nanocomposites were prepared in two different states, fully amorphous and crystallized. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed that the presence of MFC accelerates the crystallization of PLA. The tensile modulus and strength of neat PLA were improved with an increase of MFC content in both amorphous and crystallized states. The addition of 20 wt% of MFC in PLA improved the storage modulus of crystallized PLA at a high temperature (120 Â°C) from 293 MPa to 1034 MPa.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of shelf-life enhancers (sodium lactate [SL] or sodium lactate + sodium diacetate [SLDA]) on limiting the growth of Escherichia coli K12 in needle-injecting surface-contaminated beef strip steaks with recycled enhancement solutions. Strip loins were injected to 10% over initial weight. SLDA was most effective in controlling bacterial growth followed by SL alone. The salt/phosphate combination in the enhancement solution was ineffective. SL decreased a∗ (less red) and b∗ values (less yellow) of the steaks compared to the salt/phosphate control. SLDA decreased L∗ values compared to SL alone. SL and SLDA were equally effective in reducing purge loss from the steaks. Steaks enhanced with a “fresh” enhancement solution had higher a∗ values (more red) and higher E. coli contamination levels than steaks enhanced with recycled solutions. Recycling did not affect L∗ value, b∗ value, or purge loss.

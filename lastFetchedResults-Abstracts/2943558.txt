The problem of optimal design of a flexible manipulator link based on its closed-loop transfer function is formulated through the integation of actuator dynamics, control algorithm, sensor location, and mechanics of arm construction. By approximating a flexible link with N small uniform segments, we obtain analytical segmentized solutions for transfer functions for integrated arm systems. This enable us to formulate various optimization problems with explicit objective functions. Several optimization criteria are discussed in this paper

This paper presents a new joint demosaicing and zooming algorithm for digital cameras, each equipped with a single CCD/CMOS sensor and a color filter array (CFA). According to the proposed adaptive heterogeneity projection masks and Sobel- and luminance estimation-based masks, we can extract edge information of each pixel in terms of the direction of variation and the gradient from the mosaic image directly and accurately, and the extracted more accurate edge information will be utilized to assist the design of our proposed new joint demosaicing and zooming algorithm. Based on twenty-four popular testing mosaic images, our proposed new zooming algorithm has better image quality performance in terms of two objective color image quality measures, the color peak signal-to-noise ratio (CPSNR) and the S-CIELAB DeltaE<sup>*</sup> <sub>ab</sub> metric, and one subjective color image quality measure, the color artifacts, when compared with several previous zooming algorithms.

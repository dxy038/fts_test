Proposes a new mechanism, divergence caching, for reducing access and communication charges in accessing online database servers. The objective is achieved by allowing tolerant read requests, namely requests that can be satisfied by out-of-date data. We propose two algorithms based on divergence caching-static and dynamic. The first is appropriate when the access pattern to an object in the database is fixed and known, and the latter is appropriate in other cases. We analyze these algorithms in the worst case and the expected case

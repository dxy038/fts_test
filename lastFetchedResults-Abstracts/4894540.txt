Brushless DC (BLDC) motors are used in many industrial and domestic applications due to their higher energy efficiency, high reliability, low maintenance and higher torque to weight ratio. Further these motors are compatible with any digital systems so that the drive can be controlled by a digital controller for optimal performance. BLDC motors have the drawback of higher torque ripple and the drive circuit produces unwanted harmonics which reduces the power quality and causes unwanted electromagnetic interference. The objective of the proposed work is to develop a reconfigurable controller for the BLDC motor drive using fuzzy logic technique to minimize the harmonics by varying the switching frequency and duty ratio without affecting the voltage to the drive. This technique is implemented in reconfigurable VERTEX II Pro development board and observed that there is tangible improvement in performance in terms of reduction in harmonics. This controller consumes lesser power compared to the conventional electronic controllers.

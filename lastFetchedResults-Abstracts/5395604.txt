Shaft furnace roasting in iron mineral processing is a synthetic complex process, the optimizing control of such process is very difficult. To deal with this problem, an optimizing control approach based on multi-objective evaluation is developed through combining evaluation theory with case-based reasoning (CBR). The set points in control loops are produced by the methodology of CBR, followed by real-time appraisal and correction for the purpose of the optimization on integrated production indices. The successful application on shaft furnaces from a mineral processing plant indicates effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

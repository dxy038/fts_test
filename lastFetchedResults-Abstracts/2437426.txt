Digital TV (DTV) bears much potential for e-commerce, but most of it remains underexploited due to the lack of systematic approaches to the provision of interactive applications. Working on top of an existing recommender system, this paper presents mechanisms to automatically compose applications that provide personalized commercial functionalities to the users. The proposal addresses specific concerns of DTV environments, with special attention to achieving good personalization quality and furnishing useful interactions when there is no return channel permanently available for bidirectional communication. Preliminary experiments reveal good acceptance of the concept among real users.

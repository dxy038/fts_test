Background and Objective: There is impairment in the level of muscle activity of scapular and rotator cuff muscles in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. Exercise therapy is one of the important methods of treatment in these patients. In addition, the application of tape has been suggested in the rehabilitation of patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. The purpose of this study was to study effects of therapeutic exercise associated with facilitative taping of selected shoulder girdle muscles on the activity level of these muscles in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.
Subjects and Methods: This study was performed on two groups of 12 subjects from patients with shoulder impingement syndrome, by non-probability convenient sampling method. Electromyography recorded from selected muscles in both groups during movements of flexion and abduction. Electromyography was recorded after a period of exercise therapy associated with tape for one group and without tape for the other group.
Results: Comparison of level of electromyography activity of middle and lower trapezius and infraspinatus muscles during flexion and abduction tasks in tape group, before and after treatment shows increase to 17.54% (p=0.41) and in non tape group before and after treatment  increases to 2.94 % (p=0.38).
Conclusion: The results of our investigation revealed that there is no significant influence of tape application on level of electrical activity of muscles studied during flexion and abduction tasks in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.

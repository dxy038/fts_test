A prioritized call admission control scheme for UMTS WCDMA networks to support multiple services is investigated. Admission is based on maximum base station transmit power and service class priority. The objective is to evaluate the interactions that exist among the various services and to assess how system performance and service behavior are related. Conversational, streaming and interactive services with distinct QoS requirements are considered. Prioritized resource allocation to achieve differentiated service treatment is used to improve spectrum utilization and revenue. Real time services with stringent QoS requirements operated in circuit switched mode use dedicated channels as radio bearers. Downlink shared channels are used to transport non real time data handled in packet switched mode. The investigation indicates that allocation policies that favor lower rate real time services achieve better overall performance in the examined mixed services scenarios

Experimental results regarding the charging of two different heat storages with a small-scale low-cost solar parabolic trough are described.

in objective is to compare the efficiency of the charging for these storages and conclude. Both storage units have the same storage potential and contain a nitrate mixture (salts) in order to store energy with latent heat (melting temperature: 210–220 °C). The system is liquid-based: the collector concentrates the energy on the receiver so that the fluid (a heat transfer oil: Duratherm FG) inside the receiver tube is heated and can carry the energy to the storage. The loop connecting the collector and the storage is filled with the heat transfer oil which circulates by self-circulation. The first storage in mainly made of aluminum and salts, while the second in based on the oil and salts. The objective of this concept is to store heat during the day for use as a heat source for cooking, or for other applications at times without sunshine. The system is heated artificially to simulate the sun and ensure that we put the same amount of energy for the two experiments.

The primary problem that affects the use of efficient grid or cluster computing systems are the discovery and usage of parallel and high performance grid computing applications and related services. The primary objective of this paper is to build on a protocol that minimizes the number of messages exchanged between the various peers by applying new grid based pre-coalition concepts to the peer to peer grid services model A<sup>3p</sup>viGrid. Lists of agents are maintained in the form of categorized listings that help in the formation of potential coalitions and negotiations among the agents. By developing a new pre- coalition protocol we are able to simulate the number of messages passed inside the A<sup>3p</sup>viGrid system that uses predetermined coalition formations to utilize coalition leaders/agents for communication on behalf of a clan or society of agents or peers

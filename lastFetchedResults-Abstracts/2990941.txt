In this paper, we present a new method which uses genetic algorithm to produce offsetting two-dimensional NURBS curves; a parameter optimization method is used for approximating offset curves. The objective function being minimized is the explicit summation of square of errors at sample point piecewise processing which yields valid profiles. The result shows that genetic algorithm is more efficient than traditional methods

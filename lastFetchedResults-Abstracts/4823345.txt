Electric vehicles are the future trend of our transportation. The problem is how we do it considering environmental, social, economic, and health impacts. In this paper, we build a Multi-objective Dynamic Programming model that simulates the reforming process from gasoline vehicles to electric vehicles. The result and the methods can be used as a reference for government electric vehicles replacing strategy. The model will show how the vehicles reform will be carried out. The replacing process will be divided into four stages. And in the end of our 40 years process, most gasoline vehicles are replaced. The advantages and problems faced while replacing will also be discussed in the paper.

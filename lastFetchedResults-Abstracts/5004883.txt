This paper develops a quasi-decentralized control framework for plants with distributed, interconnected units that exchange information over a shared communication network. In this architecture, each unit in the plant has a local control system that communicates with the plant supervisor - and with other local control systems - through a shared communication medium. The objective is to design an integrated control and communication strategy that enforces the desired closed-loop stability and performance for the plant while minimizing network utilization and communication costs. The idea is to reduce the exchange of information between the local control systems as much as possible without sacrificing stability of the individual units and the overall plant. To this end, dynamic models of the interconnected units are embedded in the local control system of each unit to provide it with an estimate of the evolution of its neighbors when measurements are not transmitted through the network. The use of a model to recreate the interactions of a given unit with one of its neighbors allows the sensor suite of the neighboring unit to send its data in a discrete fashion since the model can provide an approximation of the unitÂ´s dynamics. The state of each model is then updated using the actual state of the corresponding unit provided by its sensors at discrete time instances to compensate for model uncertainty. By formulating the networked closed-loop plant as a hybrid system, an explicit characterization of the maximum allowable update period (i.e., minimum cross communication frequency) between each control system and the sensors of its neighboring units is obtained in terms of the degree of mismatch between the dynamics of the units and the models used to describe them. The developed control strategy is illustrated using a network of interconnected chemical reactors with recycle.

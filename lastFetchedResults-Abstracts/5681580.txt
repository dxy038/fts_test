A special quadratic programming problem in complex variables is investigated for a closed form solution. Two different approaches are used. The first is a direct approach that leads to a family of solutions because of a singular matrix encountered in the solution process. The second is an indirect approach based on parametrizing the objective function. It leads to a solution which is a member in the above family and which is shown to be bounded.

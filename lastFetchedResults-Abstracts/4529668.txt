In this paper, we present the work on transfer grammar, one of the most challenging issues in MT, in a bidirectional Tamil-Hindi translation system-Sam park. Transfer grammar between the above languages can be categorized into two levels (1) the structure transfer and (2) lexical level transfer. Tamil and Hindi differ extensively at the clausal construction level and at the verb formation level since Tamil is an agglutinative language and Hindi is not. Transfer grammar described here uses a hybrid approach using CRF a machine learning algorithm and linguistic rules for structure transfer, a rule based approach for word level transfer. We tested the approach in the Sam park system using web data and the results are encouraging.

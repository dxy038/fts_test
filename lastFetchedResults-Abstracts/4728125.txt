As the demands for water resources management is tending to be diversified, when optimizing reservoir scheduling, not only the requirements of power generation, flood control, but also water supply requirements of reservoir downstream areas should be considered. This problem is a large scale dynamic nonlinear constrained multi-objective optimization problem. It is difficult to solve using traditional optimization methods. This paper uses Multi-objective Cultural algorithm to solve the multiobjective water resources optimization problem. It considers the correlation of power generation between reservoirs, divides the reservoir downstream areas into several water supply sections, and takes the correlation and constraints between each section into consideration. Taking water supply and power generation as examples, it sets up a multi-objective model, and uses the cultural algorithm to solve the model, which achieves a good result.

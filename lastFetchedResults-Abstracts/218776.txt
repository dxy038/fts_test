A greenhouse experiment was conducted in Department of Plant Science and Agricultural Resources,
Faculty of Agriculture, Khan Kaen University in 2005. The objective of this study were to investigate the
effects of adventitious root removing and timing of fertilizer application on growth, yield and nutrient uptake
of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.). The results showed that removing adventitious roots from the plant
significantly reduce in growth, yield and nutrient uptake of kenaf in comparison with no adventitious root
removing. Splitting chemical fertilizer application as basal at planting, combined with top dressing at 60 days
after planting during adventitious root forming in flooded soil did not show any significant difference in fiber
yield in comparison with once application as basal at planting. A field experiment was conducted in Ban Muong
village, Muang district in Khon Kaen province in 2005-2006. The objective of this study was to investigate the
effects of timing of fertilizer application on growth, yield and nutrient uptake of kenaf (Hibiscus
cannabinus L.). The results showed that splitting chemical fertilizer application as basal at planting, combined
with top dressing at 60 days after planting significant increase in fiber yield as compared to once basal
application at planting or once top dressing at 60 days after planting. The new finding indicate that the
response of adaptive adventitious roots (water roots) of economic kenaf crops to flooding stress mainly affects
nutrient uptake, similar to the aquatic roots of wetland plants.

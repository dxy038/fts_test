Aspergillus niger is known to be capable of bioleaching heavy metal ions from municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration fly ash. The objective of this study was to investigate the bioleaching kinetics of the fungus in the presence of the fly ash at various pulp densities (1–6%) in a batch system. The growth of the fungus was modeled using the modified Gompertz model. Since the metals present in the fly ash are toxic and inhibit microbial growth, an inhibition kinetic model using the generalized Monod growth kinetics was evaluated. In a two-step bioleaching system where the fly ash was introduced into the culture two days after inoculation, citric acid production and the leaching of the metals aluminium, iron and zinc from the fly ash were examined. The kinetic parameters in the system were estimated using the least square method. Results showed that the modified Gompertz model fit the experimental data well. The specific growth rate decreased with increasing pulp density, with a maximum specific growth rate (μmax) of 0.115 day−1 for the control. The critical inhibitor (i.e. fly ash) concentration (image) above which no growth occurred was found to be 6.0%. Results also showed an increase in metal concentration leached with a concomitant increase in the citric acid production at various pulp densities.

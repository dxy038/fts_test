In the present study WO3 thin films were deposited by sputtering onto ITO glass, W/ITO and Si substrates by using the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, with the objective of applying these materials in electrochemical intercalation devices. The thin films microstructure and electrochemical behavior were determined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cycling at constant current with potential limitation. By mainly adjusting the substrate holder speed rotation, pillar-type and helical-type structures were obtained under high and low speed rotation levels, respectively. The electrochemical results showed that the best charge capacity performance was obtained for the WO3/W/ITO films with pillar-type structures, which are more porous.

We investigate the wavelet-based scalable video coding problem and present a solution that takes account of each user´s preferred resolution. Based on the preference, we formulate the bit allocation problem of wavelet-based scalable video coding. We propose three methods to solve the problem. The first is an efficient Lagrangian-based method that solves the upper bound of the problem optimally, and the second is a less efficient dynamic programming method that solves the problem optimally. Both methods require knowledge of the user´s preference. For the case where the user´s preference is unknown, we solve the problem by a min-max approach. Our objective is to find the bit allocation solution that maximizes the worst possible performance. We show that the worst performance occurs when all users subscribe to the same spatial, temporal, and quality resolutions. Thus, the min-max solution is exactly the same as the traditional bit allocation method for a non-scalable wavelet codec. We conduct several experiments on the 2D+t MCTF-EZBC wavelet codec with respect to various subscribers´ preferences. The results demonstrate that knowing the users´ preferences improves the coding performance of the scalable video codec significantly.

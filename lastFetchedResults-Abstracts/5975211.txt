The objective of this paper is to explore the time-optimal control problem arising in manufacturing applications involving point-to-point positioning. In such applications the motive forces are provided by electric motors, and the resulting current flow generates heat that leads to temperature rise. Manufacturing productivity is thus linked to a trade-off between the desire to reduce travel time and the need to avoid excessive temperature rise. This fundamental trade-off is explored for motion systems driven by two types of synchronous motors

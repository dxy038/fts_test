The objective of this paper is to offer a study on the mechanism of representing Irano-Islamic discoursive elements in the Iranian TV commercial advertising. The problem dealt with in this paper pertains to the Iranian constitutional law that urges the national media to contribute to the development of Irano-Islamic cultural codes. We treat the commercial advertisements as cultural texts and then we study and analyze them based on Rolan Barthes's semilogic approach. The primary findings of our analysis indicated that although these advertisements used religious and cultural symbols in their content in order to advertise commodities, they in fact used these symbols as an instrument to instigate the buying motif of their audience and did not contribute to development of religious teachings. The advertisements also used national symbols to construct motivating advertisements but these they were only used as slogans and clishe and not as a tools to improve national identity. Generally speaking, Iranian TV advertisements have not been successful in representing Irano-Islamic discourse and have not reached the targeted objectives made clear in constitution.

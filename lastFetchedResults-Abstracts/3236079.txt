A Metrology Recipe Automation capability has been have developed and deployed at GLOBALFOUNDRIES with the objective to support daily metrology recipe setup for foundry operations. Previous publications on this capability focused on recipe validation and benefits to process control through improved metrology. In this paper an overview of GLOBALFOUNDRIESÂ´ Metrology Recipe Automation (MRA) solution will be provided. The benefits and justification of an MRA solution will be reviewed, and insight will be given into the production application, examining the primary business processes, software architecture and typical use case of the application. Necessary interaction with the design and tape out processes to integrate the necessary data will be covered, and the complexities of coordinating fab setup activities with design activities will be discussed. The paper will conclude with a discussion of the opportunities for improving vendor metrology tool software interaction, as well as the challenges of collaboration between fabless design firms with foundry manufacturing to insure the necessary data is available to enable automation.

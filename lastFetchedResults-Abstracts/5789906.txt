EMC considerations in the design and implementation of a unified relocatable SVC for a open-cast lignite mining in Turkey have been presented. A successful SVC layout is found to be an important design objective for EMI immunity. Closed loops that can be formed by copper grounding bars and guard fence around air-core thyristor controlled reactors are to be avoided in the design and implementation. This paper also summarizes the experience gained in the formation of medium-voltage protective and electronic grounding systems for sites having surface limestone.

Introduction: Anthropometry of neurocranium as well as intelligence has been reported to have a bidirectional effects. The aim of the present investigation is to study the relationship between neurocranium anthropometry and Intelligence Quality (IQ) in students living in tropical and cold areas in Iran. Materials and Methods: The method of the present investigation is comparative and analytical descriptive. A total number of 100 healthy Azari medical students were included. The neurocranium length, width, and height were measured by Martin Saller caliper. The students' brain capacity was determined using Lee Pearson formula. In the next phase, all students were tested with Wechsler intelligence test. MRI was performed in 10 students with the highest IQ as well as in 10 students with the lowest IQ. The relationship between frontal and temporal lobes mass with full-scale intelligence quotient (FSQI) was evaluated. Results: The results indicated that a higher brain capacity was accompanied by the highest IQ. The significant differences were observed among male and female students from cold and tropical areas. A higher FSIQ rate in male students was accompanied by larger mass of the frontal lobe. The highest IQ was observed in female students with a larger mass of the temporal lobe. FSIQ was correlated to the mass of the frontal lobe and the temporal lobe in male and female students, respectively. Conclusion: This study revealed a relationship between weather, brain volume, and the mass of the frontal and temporal lobes with FSIQ.

Developing, for example, a simple booking web service with modern tools can be a matter of a few weeks work. Testing such a system should not need to take more time than that. Automatically generating tests from specified properties of the system using the tool QuickCheck provides professional developers with the required test efficiency. But how good is the quality of these automatically generated tests? Do they cover the cases that one would have written in manual tests? The quality depends on the specified properties and data generators and so far there has not been an objective way to evaluate the quality of these QuickCheck generators. In this paper we present a method to assess the quality of QuickCheck test data generators by formulating requirements on them. Using this method we can give feedback to developers of such data generators in an early stage. The method supports developers in improving data generators, which may lead to an increase of the effectiveness in testing while maintaining the same efficiency.

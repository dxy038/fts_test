Objective: To find out the frequency of upper gastrointestinal pathologies as found on endoscopy in patients presenting to Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar.Material and Methods: This observational study was conducted in Medical A Unit, Post-Graduate Medical Institute, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, from 1st September 2002 to 31st August 2006 (4 years period). Records of upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies performed at endoscopy unit of were analyzed. Detailed information of the patients including serial no, name, age, gender, address, indication(s) for endoscopy, endoscopic findings, if biopsy taken, any complication(s) if occurred, were recorded. All patients were HBsAg and anti-HCVnegative.Results: During the study period, 1840 upper GI endoscopies were performed. Male to female ratio was 1:8 with majority of patients in the age-group of 31-40 years age-group. Most common indications for upper HI endoscopy were dyspepsia (n=1652, 89.78%) and dysphagia (n=74, 4.03%). Endoscopy was normal in 608 (33.05%) patients. Among the positive endoscopic findings, inflammatory lesions (gastritis, esophagitis etc) were the most common (n=728, 39.56%0), followed by peptic ulcer disease (n=148, 8.05%), malignancies (n=128, 6.96%), erosions (n=116, 6.30%) and miscellaneous lesions (n=112, 6.08%).Conclusion: Dyspepsia is the most common indication of upper GI endoscopy. Gastritis, esophagitis, duodenal ulcer and upper GI malignancies are amongst the common abnormal endoscopic findings. Almost one-third of patients have normal endoscopic findings and probably suffering from functional dyspepsia.

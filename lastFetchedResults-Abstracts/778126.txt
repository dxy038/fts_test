Actually the environmental concerns arise
from the emissions produced by fossil fueled electric
power plants, the classical economic dispatch, which
operates electric power systems to minimize the total fuel
cost which can no longer be considered alone. Thus, by
environmental dispatch, emissions can be reduced
through dispatch of power generation. The proposed
Environmental Economic Load Dispatch (EED) is
formulated mathematically as a nonlinear constrained
multiobjective problem with competing and noncommensurable
objectives of fuel cost, emission and
system loss. So, a multi-objective meta-heuristic of
Improved Harmony Search Algorithm (IHSA) is applied
in this paper to solve the EED problem through the
advantages of fuzzy mechanism. In addition, renewable
sources and wind energy in particular have recently been
getting more interest because of various environmental
and economic considerations. Accordingly, wind power
is included in the problem formulation to find the effects
in power system. The proposed technique has been
applied over the IEEE 30 and 118-bus test power system.
The achieved results demonstrate the validity of proposed
technique.

The objective of the present research was to show that incorporating a visuo-haptic device ´Telemaque´ may increase the fluency of handwriting production of cursive letters in kindergarten children i.e., before formal handwriting learning begins. Forty two 5 year-old children were assigned an intervention involving either Telemaque (experimental training; VH group) or not (control training; C group). The fluency of handwriting was tested before and after both interventions. Fluency was analysed by kinematic parameters: average velocity, number of velocity peaks, and number of breaks during the production of six cursive letters (a,b,f,i,l,s). The results showed that the fluency of handwriting production for all letters was higher after the VH training than after the C training: The movements were faster, exhibited less velocity peaks and children lifted the pen less often during the letter production. These results showed that the Telemaque device may help kindergarten children to increase the proactive strategy to control handwriting movements

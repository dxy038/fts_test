Different multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems are formulated and compared. Two MDO formulations are applied to a sounding rocket in order to optimize the performance of the rocket. In the MDO of the referred vehicle, three disciplines have been considered, which are trajectory, propulsion and aerodynamics. A special design structure matrix is developed to assist data exchange between disciplines. This design process uses response surface method (RSM) for multidisciplinary optimization of the rocket. The RSM is applied to the design in two categories: the propulsion model and the system level. In the propulsion model, RSM determines an approximate mathematical model of the engine output parameters as a function of design variables. In the system level, RSM fits a surface of objective function versus design variables. In the first MDO problem formulation, two design variables are selected to form propulsion discipline. In the second one, three new design variables from geometry are added and finally, an optimization method is applied to the response surface in the system level in order to find the best result. Application of the first developed multidisciplinary design optimization procedure increased accessible altitude (performance index) of the referred sounding rocket by twenty five percents and the second one twenty nine.

The objective of this investigation is to improve the planning, selection, and justification of information technology (IT) projects as a vehicle for business enhancement. The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) criteria are used herein as a framework for strategic planning of information technology implementation. Research findings suggest that application of these criteria in isolation is not sufficient for planning and evaluating information technology initiatives. However, consideration of these criteria in the form of a post-planning audit has the potential to improve the strategic relevance of the information technology deployment plan. Finally, the prominent role that computer security plays in much of the current IT literature, combined with a lack of consideration for intellectual property management in the MBNQA criteria, suggest that this is a key shortcoming of the MBNQA, not only in the context of IT planning, but also in the broader context of a business assessment tool

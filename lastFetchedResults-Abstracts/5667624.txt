The method of amending chord length parameterization was used to process different feasible point vectors of ship´s section area, and the parameterized cubic spline curves were used to express the different subsections of ship´s section area curve (SAC). The work of designing a good ship´s SAC was converted to a problem of multi-objective optimization. The objects of single functions were set as the minimum deformation energy of the curve E<sub>def</sub>, the best length of parallel middle body of the ship C<sub>p</sub>, the best position of parallel middle body of the ship, the best longitudinal position of buoyancy center of the ship X<sub>B</sub>, and so on. Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm was used to create the objective ship´s SAC as well as optimizing it, and the niche mechanism was introduced in to enhance the ability of curve to rectify itself in a narrow scope, so the curve would keep changing to be rational gradually. Refer to the principal dimensions of a battleship, the SAC of it was created again with the new method. The comparison between the new SAC and the original one shows that, niche ant colony algorithm is an effective method to create new SAC of ship when there is no mother curve to modify.

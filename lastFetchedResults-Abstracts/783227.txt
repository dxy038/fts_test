Objective: To examine the association of
variables from survey data on well-being with suicide
rates and other markers of population mental health
in Europe. Design: Ecological study correlating
(Spearman’s rank correlation) life satisfaction and
happiness (European Values Survey 1999/2000) in 32
countries with suicide rates (WHO Mortality Database),
rates of hospital discharge for mental and
behavioural disorders and prevalence of mental disorders
based on registered mental patients (WHO
Regional Office for Europe) and Mental Health Index
(MHI)-5 survey data (European Opinion Research
Group). Results: An inverse association exists between
suicide rates and life satisfaction (r ¼ )0.44;
95% CI: )0.68, )0.11) and happiness (r ¼ )0.42; 95%
CI: )0.67, )0.08). Similar though weaker associations
were seen with hospital discharge data and MHI)5
data but not with the prevalence of mental disorders.
The association between suicide rates and life satisfaction
was weaker amongst 15–44 year olds
(r ¼ )0.31; 95% CI: )0.59, 0.04) than amongst 45–
64 year olds (r ¼ )0.47; 95% CI: )0.70, )0.14). It was
strongest in the 65+ age group (r ¼ )0.54; 95%
CI: )0.75, )0.23). A similar pattern was observed for
the association with happiness. In a subgroup analysis,
the association between suicide and life satisfaction
in Eastern Europe was similar to that in the whole
dataset (r ¼ )0.35) but a positive association was seen
in Western Europe (r ¼ 0.47). Conclusions: Life satisfaction
and happiness were modestly associated
with other indicators of population mental health.
Since all such markers have their limitations, surveys
of well-being may be useful indicators of population
mental health

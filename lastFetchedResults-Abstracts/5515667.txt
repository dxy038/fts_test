The objective of this paper presents the photovoltaic (PV) water pumping system with a maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The water pumping system uses a variable speed single phase induction motor (SPIM) driven by a centrifugal pump by a field oriented control (FOC) inverter. The system under study consists of two sections. First, the MPPT using a DC-DC converter controlled the duty cycle to track maximum power from PV under different insolation conditions. The duty cycle directly relate with a flux producing current component (Ids). Second, the FOC inverter uses a current control voltage source inverter (CC-VSI) for SPIM driven the centrifugal pump. The voltage (Vpv) and current (Ipv) of PV are used as command to control drive system and changed as torque (Iqs) and flux (Ids) producing current to control motorÂ´s speed which varies as maximum power available under different insolation conditions. The simulation results are shown that the characteristics and performance of drive system, which varies as each conditions of light by expressed in voltage (Vdq), current (Idq), speed of motor and electromagnetic torque. The propose system can be applied to pumping system, solar water treatment, irrigation system in agriculture and solar vehicle etc

Mitigation of the variability in output power of renewable generators such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is a growing concern as these generators reach higher penetrations on electric grids. Furthermore, increased penetration of electric vehicle (EV) loads presents a challenge for distribution feeders. This paper presents a system where a bidirectional, highly efficient, dc-dc EV charger is placed between the high-voltage dc bus of a PV inverter and the EV battery. The system partially alleviates feeder overloading by providing fast charging for the EV battery from the PV system. In addition, the charger is capable of diverting fast changes in PV power output to the battery, thereby reducing the rate of change of inverter output power to a level below the ramp rate of existing grid resources. The paper addresses sizing of the charger and energy storage based on the PV system rating, the desired maximum ramp rate, and site solar irradiation characteristics, including geographic dispersion of PV arrays. Analysis suggests that small amounts of energy storage can accomplish large reductions in output power ramp rate. Experimental results are shown for a 10 kW, 98% efficient dc-dc charger based on bidirectional four-phase zero-voltage-switching converter.

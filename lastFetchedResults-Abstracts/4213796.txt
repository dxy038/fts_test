Algorithms for real-time imaging in medicine are continuously improving. For example an image reconstruction requires rapid processing of large volume of data obtained. One way to speed up certain parts of the data processing is the use of FPGAs. Using this technology can further enhance the integration of electronic systems to the level of mobile systems. The objective of this paper is to reveal and demonstrate the possibility of accelerating algorithms in medical imaging technique using FPGA. Conventional graphical outputs are implemented using the graphical control unit with a large video memory. For imaging, however, can be used also such methods which generate images in real time without using the video memory. Sequence of heart images was chosen for the demonstration. These images in quick sequence appear the beating heart - a heart cycle. The animation is solved with different ROM-based images in FPGA without continuous redrawing of the video memory. The demonstration design also uses the mouse which movement can smoothly move the animated images. Other image parameters can be set in real time.

The objective of this paper is to propose new Web metrics based on its usability and effectiveness for different Web domain users of the page through the available utilities and its visual appearance. The earlier metrics concentrated on the number of visits, cost per visit and clicks to download ratio are not sufficient enough to fully assess the Web quality and the impact of the page features on the number of visitors. To satisfy the small group of visitors of different business views and expectations, the Web content and the provision for navigating within the site is playing a vital role The efficiency of a Web page is viewed as the ratio of the relative cost of page features and network resources to the number of visits and the effectiveness is the ratio of the actual user expectation to the desired number of Web users. The different classes of the Web pages based on their domains are considered and new metrics are proposed. A visual simulator has been developed to determine the impact of the individual utility metrics on the total number of hit count values based on the survey results. The main focus in this work is to arrive at a matrix model for determining the numbers of visitors from various domains who expect to get the most recent and updated correct information content what they searching for.

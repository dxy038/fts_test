This work presents the virtual simulation of the hoses hydroforming; the main objective is to predict when and where cracks can appear during a cyclic loading.

A methodology has been proposed to investigate the effects of plastic strain and residual stress after hydroforming on cyclic life fatigue.

First, an axisymmetric simulation of the hydroforming of flexible metal hoses was accomplished using the finite element method, then a cyclic loading is applied, finally the life cycle is estimated using a model based on Chabocheâ€™s model.

The results are compared with experimental data, a good agreement is found if we take in account the residual stress and the hardening due to hydroforming.

A mechanical behavior model has been developed to study the braid which is the second element of the braided corrugated hoses; they are added to corrugated hoses in order to improve its radial and axial stiffness.

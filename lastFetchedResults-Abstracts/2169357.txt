The objective of this study was to evaluate different infrared spectroscopy methods in combination with chemometrics for the differentiation between Brettanomyces bruxellensis strains. These methods of discrimination were applied to intact yeast cells of B. bruxellensis strains and on wines spoiled by the same strains. Eleven wine isolates of B. bruxellensis were evaluated for volatile phenol production in red wine and their genetic diversity was determined by Restriction Endonuclease Analysis–Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (REA-PFGE). Fourier transform mid-infrared (FTMIR) spectroscopy was used to obtain spectral fingerprints of the spoiled wines. Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) was used to obtain spectral fingerprints from the intact cells of the 11 B. bruxellensis strains. The groupings from the genetic fingerprints obtained with REA–PFGE were used as reference firstly for comparison with the groupings observed with the FTMIR spectral fingerprint of the wines and secondly for the FTIR-ATR spectral fingerprints from the whole cells. Results indicated that ATR-IR spectra obtained by scanning whole cells of B. bruxellensis could be useful for rapid strain typing in comparison or complementary to molecular techniques and FTMIR spectra from wines provide a useful resource for the discrimination between B. bruxellensis contaminated wines.

A method for networking a small number of serial HF modems has been developed at Harris. The objective of this particular technique is to provide an extremely robust method for communicating low rate data at differing priorities over the HF band. Automated frequency selection is incorporated without requiring additional sounding equipment. A signaling scheme with capabilities similar to the one employed by Harris´ serial HF modems is required by this network approach. This paper discusses a simulation of the network. The simulation runs on Harris´ Concert system utilizing up to 64 parallel processors. It simulates the HF channel, modem and networking protocols as well as generation and queueing of traffic. Use of parallel processors allows the simulation to be partitioned in a fashion that closely parallels an implementable system. Emphasis will be placed on requirements for meaningful simulation of the HF channel, as a description of the network and its performance has been previously reported.

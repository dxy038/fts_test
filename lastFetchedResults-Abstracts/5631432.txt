The objective of the paper is to carry out real time experiment using state of art hardware dSPACE DS1104 R&amp;D controller board in a laboratory education point of view. A Quanser servo plant module and dSPACE software with the DS1104 R&amp;D controller board is used in the experiment to derive transfer function of servo motor that describes the load shaft position with respect to the motor input voltage using frequency response and Bumptest method.

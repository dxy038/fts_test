Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Code of Practice (COP) is introduced as one of the road safety intervention programmes as guidance for bus operators to implement safety and health in their working environment. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of SHE COP implementation of a single bus operator that has adopted one man operation. The data was collected by completing a set of checklist after observing the activities during pre departure, during the trip, and upon arrival. The results show that there are seven widely practiced SHE COP elements. In addition, the results show that 46% of the buses have average speed exceeding the maximum permissible speed on the highways (90km/h), and all the maximum speeds exceed the highway speed limit for buses. The statistical analysis shows that there is no significant association between SHE COP elements and the selected variables such speed and inappropriate driving behavior.

In economic resource management systems, the objective is to bring about an efficient allocation of resource while allowing market participants, resource consumers and owners, to act on their individual valuations of jobs and resources. In this paper we investigate the pricing of resources in dynamic grids. Particularly, we investigate grid resource management based on a computational commodity market of CPU resources, where resources are determined by supply-and-demand equilibrium. In particular introduce several categories of CPUÂ´s characterized by execution speed. These differ in cost and performance but may be used interchangeably in executing jobs and thus represent so-called substitutable resources. We investigate, using simulation, whether the algorithms for computing the supply-and-demand equilibrium, function in this context.

This paper addresses the power control problem in two-tier OFDMA femtocell networks to alleviate the cross-tier interference. We model the objective of power control with utility function, and proof the proposed utility function is strictly concave with respect to transmission power. Then a power control algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization is developed to find the optimal power settings to maximize the utility function. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can improve the outage and throughput performance of macro users with less impact on femtocell users. Meanwhile, our proposed algorithm is easy to implement in distributed manner and efficient in computation.

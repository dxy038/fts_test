This paper describes the partnership SEMY Engineering, Inc. and White Oak Semiconductor formed to successfully provide automation and advanced process control (APC) solutions from a combination of proprietary and commercially available software systems. The White Oak factory objective was to implement a computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) system providing full availability of all necessary data for yield analysis and process control. Semiconductor production throughput and reliability at White Oak has significantly increased using this implementation. A large ROI (&gt;500%) has already been realized in the lithography cell in the first year alone

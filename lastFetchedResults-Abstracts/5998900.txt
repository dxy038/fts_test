We develop two novel globally-informed gate-sizing algorithms for tackling the problems of statistical circuit timing optimization under a timing yield constraint, and timing yield optimization under a timing (i.e., delay) constraint. Unlike previous works, our techniques are global in the sense that they use objective functions that take into account either the entire circuitÂ´s variabilities and available gate sizes or those of the statistically timing-critical part of the circuit. The actual optimization, using the aforementioned objective functions, was performed using a recently introduced efficient discrete optimization technique called discretized network flow (DNF). We compared our algorithms to a state-of-the-art sensitivity based method. Experimental results show an absolute yield improvement of up to 43% and an average of 37% for the best of our two techniques over that of a non-statistical timing optimized circuit (optimized using a recent state-of-the-art method) based on the worst-case delay estimate for each gate. Our technique also gives a 19% better relative yield improvement over the sensitivity based method.

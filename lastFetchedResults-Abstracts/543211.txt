A series of new 1-[(2,8-dimethylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-yl)carbonyl]-4-alkyl/arylthiosemicarbazides, 2-[(2,8-dimethylimidazo[ 1,2-a]pyridine-3-yl)carbonyl]hydrazono-3-alkyl thiazolidin-4-ones, 2-(2,8-dimethylimidazo[1,2- a]pyridine-3-yl)-5-arylamino-1,3,4-oxadiazoles and 4-alkyl/aryl-2,4-dihydro-5-(2,8-dimethylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine- 3-yl)-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones were synthesized. The structures of the compounds have been elucidated by IR, 1H NMR, EI mass spectra and elemental analysis. Antibacterial, antifungal and antimycobacterial activities of compounds were evaluated against various microorganisms and some of them were found to be active in varying degrees against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.

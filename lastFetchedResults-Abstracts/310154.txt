Objective
To investigate the relationship between thyroid and kidney function.
Design and methods
13,383 results of serum creatinine and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were retrieved from the database of our Laboratory.
Results
When compared with euthyroid subjects, those with TSH < 0.2 mIU/L and > 2.5 mIU/L had increased and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR), respectively. TSH levels were an independent predictor of e-GFR.
Conclusions
A mutual relationship was observed between kidney and thyroid status.

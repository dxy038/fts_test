The pore structure of porous media has been recognized as a vital parameter influencing the properties of cemented material, such as strength, fluid transport ability and thus durability. The main objective of this experimental study is to assess the effects of natural (curing temperature) and accidental (fire, self-heating temperature) thermal loads on the pore structure of cemented pastefill materials, largely used as construction materials in mine operations. Results show that both curing and heating temperatures significantly affect the pore structure of the cement matrix of pastefill materials. Increasing curing temperatures up to 50 °C leads to a refinement of the pore structure of cemented tailings materials, while heating temperature begins to significantly deteriorate the microstructure (porosity, pore size distribution, mineral phases) of cemented tailings at temperatures above 400 °C.

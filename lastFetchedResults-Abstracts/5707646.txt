The objective of segmentation operation is to separate the mass from the rest of the breast by trying to delimit its borders correctly. This article presents a semi-automatic mass extraction method by application of an adaptive region growing segmentation technique. The region growing process is guided by regional feature analysis; consequently, the result will be a robust algorithm able of respecting various image characteristics.

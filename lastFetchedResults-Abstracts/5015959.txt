To get the sort of the comprehensive benefits of the currently frequently-used heating equipments, this paper constructed a target system of the comprehensive benefits heating equipments. In the paper, with the use of DEA/AHP evaluation model, first of all, calculate the effective coefficient of the heating equipments consisting of input/output system; Then, using comparison matrix consisting of these effective coefficient, calculate the comprehensive benefits evaluation of the heating equipments. Avoiding the subjectivity of artificial to determine the matrix in AHP and DEA can not sort in a full-scale. Making the evaluation findings more objective and reliable.

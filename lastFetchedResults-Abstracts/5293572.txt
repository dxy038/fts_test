Distribution networks paradigm is changing currently requiring improved methodologies and tools for network analysis and planning. A relevant issue is analyzing the impact of the distributed generation penetration in passive networks considering different operation scenarios. Studying DG optimal siting and sizing the planner can identify the network behavior in presence of DG. Many approaches for the optimal DG allocation problem successfully used multi-objective optimization techniques. So this paper contributes to the fundamental stage of multi-objective optimization of finding the Pareto optimal solutions set. It is proposed the application of a multi-objective tabu search and it was verified a better performance comparing to the NSGA-II method.

Bidirectional low-noise Raman amplification and simplex coding based on the return-to-zero modulation format are optimized through numerical simulations for long-range Brillouin optical time-domain analysis sensing. Experimental results are reported on sensing capabilities along 120-km distance with 1-m spatial resolution, and worst-case temperature and strain resolution values of 1.3 and 26 , respectively.

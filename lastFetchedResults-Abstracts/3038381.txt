Optimization of an N-layer digital multiresolution broadcasting system with respect to some form of quality&#215;population product objective function appears to he an N-dimensional problem. However, with a generalized broadcasting model using N orthogonal channels with BPSK signaling under the assumption of uniform population distribution the problem can be narrowed down to three cases. This paper identifies each of these three cases and explains their meaning for system performance optimization.

Considering the motor controllability of Four-Wheel-Independent-Drive Electric city-bus (4WID E-Bus), an optimizing torque distribution strategy is proposed. First, the objective function for meeting the requirements of vehicle stability and fuel economy is set up, which assure the optimal fuel economy. Then, the target function is derived under the constraint conditions of longitudinal and lateral stability, and the simulation analysis is performed at the same time. Finally the simulation results verify that the optimizing torque distribution strategy can effectively improve the fuel economy of E-Bus under the stability constraints.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of corn fiber oil (CFO), ferulate phytostanyl esters (FPEs) and parent compounds of FPE, including sitostanol and ferulic acid, in hamsters.
Method

Seventy male Golden Syrian hamsters were randomly assigned to six experimental diets for 4 weeks: (1) cornstarch–casein–sucrose-based control diet (control); and (2) control diet plus 0.1% (wt/wt) cholesterol (cholesterol–control). The remaining four groups were given cholesterol–control diet with: (3) 10% (wt/wt) CFO; (4) 0.5% (wt/wt) sitostanol; (5) 0.23% (wt/wt) ferulic acid; and (6) 0.73% (wt/wt) FPE. At the end of dietary intervention, total plasma cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined. Parameters of cholesterol kinetics, including cholesterol absorption and synthesis, as well as mRNA expression of sterol transporters such as Niemann–Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1), ATP-binding cassette G5 (ABCG5) and ABCG8, were assessed.
Results

Supplementation with CFO decreased (P<.0001) plasma total cholesterol levels by 29% as compared with the cholesterol–control group, while FPE and sitostanol reduced (P<.02) cholesterolemia by 15% and 14%, respectively. CFO and sitostanol decreased (P<.05) cholesterol absorption by 24% compared to the cholesterol–control group. Dietary intervention did not alter the intestinal gene expression of ABCG5, ABCG8 and NPC1L1.
Conclusion

The present results show that the CFO-induced and sitostanol-induced decrease in cholesterol absorption is independent of intestinal enterocyte sterol transporters such as ABCG5, ABCG8 and NPC1L1 in hamsters.

Selective laser patterning of thin films in a multilayered structure is an emerging technology for process development and fabrication of
optoelectronics and microelectronics devices. In this work, femtosecond laser patterning of electrochromic Ta0.1W0.9Ox film coated on ITO glass
has been studied to understand the selective removal mechanism and to determine the optimal parameters for patterning process. A 775 nm
Ti:sapphire laser with a pulse duration of 150 fs operating at 1 kHz was used to irradiate the thin film stacks with variations in process parameters
such as laser fluence, feedrate and numerical aperture of objective lens. The surface morphologies of the laser irradiated regions have been
examined using a scanning electron microscopy and an optical surface profiler. Morphological analysis indicates that the mechanism responsible
for the removal of Ta0.1W0.9Ox thin films from the ITO glass is a combination of blistering and explosive fracture induced by abrupt thermal
expansion. Although the pattern quality is divided into partial removal, complete removal, and ITO film damage, the ITO film surface is slightly
melted even at the complete removal condition. Optimal process window, which results in complete removal of Ta0.1W0.9Ox thin film without
ablation damage in the ITO layer, have been established. From this study, it is found that focusing lens with longer focal length is preferable for
damage-free pattern generation and shorter machining time.

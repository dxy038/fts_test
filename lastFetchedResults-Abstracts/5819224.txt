The objective of the 2nd international workshop on advanced software development tools and techniques (WASDeTT) is to provide interested researchers with a forum to share their tool building experiences and to explore how tools can be built more effectively and efficiently. This workshop specifically focuses on tools for software maintenance and comprehension and addresses issues such as tool-building in an industrial context, component-based tool building, and tool building in teams.

The training objective of software engineering is to train talented person about engineering and management. Recently, the over-materialistic &#8220;education of knowledge&#8221; led to the loss of peopleÂ´s spiritual life, and the lack of significance of life. The same is true in profession of software Engineering. Vocational education focused on knowledge and skills, ignored the humane care, neglected education for life, which leading to an imbalance of individual development. As the primary venue of professional training, the traditional higher education should carry out a &#8220;reflection&#8221;.Theory of leisure education for software engineering is very limited until now. The paper presented the research about the leisure education based on the software engineering, and through the example of Steam cafe&#769; in MIT to explain the importance to software engineering in leisure education. We proposed three methods in the paper to discuss the approach about leisure education in software engineering. Through these several ways, leisure education will play an increasingly important role in the field of professional education.

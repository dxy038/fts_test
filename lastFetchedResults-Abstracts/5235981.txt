Non Point Source (NPS) pollution is a major contributor to the degradation of surface water quality. NPS pollution is caused by water movement over and through the surface of the land. The runoff picks up and transports natural and man-made pollutants. The pollutants are transported into rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, coastal waters, and ground water. Federal and state governments have targeted the identification and control of non point source runoff as major pollution minimization goals. Location of NPS pollution runoff, types of areas drained, and drainage channels are data vital to leaders in agricultural, forestry, and urban planning industries. State and federal agencies can use these data for planning purposes and for prioritizing allocation of resources. The objective of the present study is to identify areas of prime NPS pollution concern using remotely sensed imagery and GIS modeling techniques. A model was designed to identify, quantify and prioritize areas of NPS contribution potential within a water quality basin area

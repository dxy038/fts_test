Sustainable energy resources, particularly wind power, are rapidly becoming generation technologies of significance around the world. A multi-objective generation dispatch problem that considers environment and fuel cost under substantial penetration of wind energy is proposed in this paper. The nonlinear characteristics of thermal units and their operational constraints, such as generation limitations, valve point effect, transmission loss and emission constraints are considered for practical operation. The necessary operating point that strikes a balance between cost and emission is determined by combined economic and emission dispatch (CEED) using craziness based differential evolution algorithm (CDE). The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through 10-unit and 40-unit test system study for forecasted wind power. The test results show that the craziness based differential evolution algorithm consistently provides best results compared to other algorithms.

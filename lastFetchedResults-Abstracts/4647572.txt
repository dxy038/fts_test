Cloud Computing has become a popular computing paradigm which has gained enormous attention in delivering on-demand services. Task scheduling in cloud computing is an important issue that has been well researched and many algorithms have been developed for the same. However, the goal of most of these algorithms is to minimize the overall completion time (i.e., makespan) without looking into minimization of the overall cost of the service (referred as budget). Moreover, many of them are applicable to single-cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective task scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous multi-cloud environment which takes care both these issues. We perform rigorous experiments on some synthetic and benchmark data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm balances both the makespan and total cost in contrast to two existing task scheduling algorithms in terms of various performance metrics including makespan, total cost and average cloud utilization.

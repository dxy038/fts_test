Holography offers a very general solution to almost all applications in which power has to be combined, split or converted, and signal paths have to be interconnected. Possible applications for infrared and optical wavelengths are the fibre-to-fibre and laser-to-fibre-coupling. Our objective is holographic millimeter and submillimeter solid-state power combining. Preliminary experimental results of a 65 GHz holographic power combiner are reported.

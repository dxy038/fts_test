This paper proposes a novel multi-frame error concealment algorithm for the whole-frame losses in video transmission based on H.264/AVC. In order to minimize the error propagation, the proposed algorithm estimates the distortion of both the lost frame and its succeeding frame, and determines the modes for recovering the motion vectors of the lost frame. In addition, based on the analysis of the computational complexity and the distortion of concealed frames, we introduce complexity adaptation into the proposed algorithm to achieve optimal complexity-distortion under different real-time constraints and different decoder computational power. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms in both objective and subjective quality of the concealed frames.

This paper proposes a predictive output voltage controller for the phase-controlled series-parallel resonant converter. The objective of this controller is to enhance closed loop system robustness and dynamic performance compared to conventional PI control. First, the converter non-linear large signal behavior is linearized using a state feedback based scheme. Consequently, the converter preserves its large signal characteristics while modeled as a linear system. A reduced order model is then used for the detailed design of the proposed predictive controller. Stability analysis and controller gains selection are addressed. Finally, simulation and experimental results are demonstrated to validate the improved system performance in contrast with PI control.

In this study, the physical behavior of a circular and a co-axial free jet is analyzed. The first objective of the work presented is to quantify the velocity field of firstly, a simple circular free jet and secondly, a co-axial free jet. The velocity field study included both measurements of the mean velocity and the turbulence intensity. Numerical simulations were carried out by using the computational fluid dynamics program &#8220;Fluent&#8221;. The results obtained were validated with experimental data found in the literature [1].

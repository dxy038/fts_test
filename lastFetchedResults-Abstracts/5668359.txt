Objective To study a correlation between the resistance of radiation therapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and Cox-2 protein expression for cancer organization before radiation therapy. Methods 76 cases were treated by pathology and confirmed the diagnosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and all by radical radiation therapy for 6MV X-ray, illuminated the dose of 60 Gy. According to the radiation effect, they are divided into Radiation Resistance Group and Radiation Sensitive Group. Using the immunohistochemical SP method, these two groups of cancer organizations are given COX-2 detection and also contrast analysis. Results COX-2 protein expressions for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Radiation Resistance Group and sensitivity Group are 85.71% and 30.91%, Resistance Group is significantly higher than sensitivity group (P &lt;; 0.05). Conclusion In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, high expression of COX-2 can cause tumors to resist the radiation, expression level of COX-2 can be regarded as an important index to predict radiation sensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and short-term curative effect of radiation therapy.

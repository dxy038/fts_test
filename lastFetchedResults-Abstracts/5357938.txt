The determination of the number of formation cars is an important part of making a scheduled freight train plan, and it also has a large influence on the benefits of railway freight transportation. First, the influences that affect the number of formation cars are analyzed. Secondly, taking the maximum freight transport benefits as an objective, and comprehensively considering the primary factors that include service frequency of freight trains, section traction weight, effective length of arrival-departure tracks, and so on, this paper establishes the optimization model of the number of scheduled freight train formation cars. Finally, the solving method for the model is presented, and a case is given to show the solution process. It provides a reference for decision-makers of railway freight transportation.

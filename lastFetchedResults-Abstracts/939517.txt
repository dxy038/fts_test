Monocrotophos, commonly known as azodrin, is one of the organophosphate pesticides
extensively used in agricultural practices throughout the world. However, little information
is available on its long-term genotoxic effects in different tissues of fish using genotoxicity
biomarkers. The objective of the present study was to detect DNA damage, induced by
monocrotophos in freshwater teleost fish Channa punctatus using the comet assay. The LC50-
96 h value of technical-grade monocrotophos was estimated for the fish species in a semistatic
system.On the basis of the LC50 value, the sublethal and nonlethal concentrations were
determined. The DNA damage was measured in the gill, kidney and lymphocytes as the
percentage of DNA in comet tails of fish exposed to different sublethal and nonlethal
concentrations of monocrotophos. In general, significant effects (Pb0.01) from both
concentration and time of exposure were observed in exposed fish. It was found that the
tissues at all concentrations exhibited the highest DNA damage on day 4, after which there
was a decline in percentage tail DNA. The comparison of DNA damage among tissues at
different concentrations indicated that the gill cells were more sensitive to the pesticide than
the kidney cells and lymphocytes. This study also explored the utility of the comet assay for
in vivo laboratory studies using fish for screening the genotoxic potential of various agents.

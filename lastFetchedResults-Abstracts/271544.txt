The objective of this study is to delineate electro!mechanical coupling in piezoceramic materials[ The
model system investigated is a two!dimensional linear piezoceramic strip polarized in the thickness direction\
and it is subjected to local symmetric pressures on the upper and lower edges\ traction!free boundary
conditions on both end surfaces\ and voltages on portions of the upper and lower edges[ Under a simplifying
assumption of the gradient of the electric potential\ closed form solutions of the elastic _eld have been
obtained[
It is noticed that instead of the nine constants "including the elastic compliance constants\ sij\ the
piezoelectric constants\ dij\ and the dielectric permittivity constants\ oij#\ the elastic and piezoelectric charac!
teristics of the material can be represented by three parameters\ b0\ b1 and b2[ b0 consists of elastic compliance
constants only[ b1 and b2 signify the piezoelectric e}ect[ Furthermore\ higher values of b1 imply a more
pronounced piezoelectric e}ect on the elastic _eld[ The identi_cation of these parameters greatly facilitates
the study of coupling e}ects in piezoelectric ceramics[   0887 Elsevier Science Ltd[ All rights reserved

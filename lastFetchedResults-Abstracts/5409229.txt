The objective of this research is to investigate the utility of micro genetic algorithms (GA) to determine the initial conditions of a spacecraft at the point of departure from EarthÂ´s orbit to make a successful lunar landing or a lunar flyby. The states of the spacecraft at the point at the destination are then obtained using the patched-conic approximation. As demonstrated in this work, faster convergence is obtained using micro genetic algorithms. This methodology can also be extended to interplanetary translation by utilizing the intermediate thrust of the spacecraft.

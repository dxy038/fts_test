This paper describes a compact and precision angle sensor based on laser autocollimation. Instead of using a conventional bi-cell photodiode (PD) as the detector, a new PD array with 16 cells is specifically designed and fabricated with lithography facilities available at the university. The width of each cell is designed to be 40 Î¼m, which is slightly smaller than the light spot size on the focal plane of the objective lens. Experimental results have shown that the sensor has a resolution of 0.01 arc-seconds and a measurement range of 2300 arc-seconds, which is approximately 15 times larger than the range of the same sensor with a bi-cell PD.

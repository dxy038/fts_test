To provide multi-gigabit free-space laser communications to spacecrafts and mobile users on aircrafts, ships and trains, a small and light-weight laser communication terminal have been developed at NICT. The terminal provides a seamless connectivity between optical wireless network and fiber optic network by using fast and accurate bidirectional beacon tracking which is originally required for optical intersatellite communications. This paper shows the performance of the newly developed terminal and the results of demonstration experiments over terrestrial horizontal link under heavy atmospheric turbulences.

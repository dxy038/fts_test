The output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) performance of an adaptive array in a frequency-hopped (FH) environment is examined. The combined effect of the arrayÂ´s interference nulling ability and the interference protection of FH signals results in a more robust interference rejection communication system. However, frequency hopping degrades the output SINR and thus increases the bit error probability. A look-ahead system that minimizes this variation in the output SINR is proposed. The least mean square (LMS) algorithm and the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm are discussed. The objective is to compare the performance of the look-ahead adaptive system operating under the control of these algorithms in a frequency-hopping environment.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

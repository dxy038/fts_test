This paper presents the analysis of the optimal production and corrective maintenance planning problem for a failure prone manufacturing system consisting of several identical machines. The decision variables are the production and the machine repair rates which influence the inventory levels and the system capacity respectively. The objective of the problem is to minimize the cost of surplus and repair activities

In this paper an autonomous mobile security robot named CoLORbot is introduced which operates with UWB-Radar technology. The objective is the 2D inspection of an unknown indoor area with randomly distributed unknown solitary objects. Environmental imaging by means of electro-magnetic wave propagation in the mm range is performed. Different sensor configurations (mono-static vs. bi-static) and different antenna designs (omni-directional pattern vs. narrow beam directive pattern) are evaluated and analysed. The CoLORbot which is fully equipped with professional motion units, UWB-Radar devices, antennas and a laptop for data processing is introduced and evaluated. Strategies to perform this kind of multi disciplinary purpose containing challenges in robotics, UWB-Radar sensing, imaging algorithms and antenna handling are revised and in every case experimentally validated.

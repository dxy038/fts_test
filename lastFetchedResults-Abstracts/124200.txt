Introduction: Nowadays tuba! ligation(TL) is a safe method for women that its acceptibility is increasing. Several methods are suggested for TL. The two major methods include: minilaparotomy and laparoscopy.
Objective: The goal of this study is to compare early and late complications of tubal ligation via laparoscopy and minilaparotomy.
Materials and Methods: This study is a prospective (cohort) study with one year follow up of 118 patients who underwent tubal ligation (TL) in Mahdiye Hospital in 1994. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, 90 patients underwent TL via minilaparotomy and 60 patients underwent TL via laparoscopy. In this study, complications of two methods were evaluated and compared. At last, statistical analysis was carried out with spss.9 software and using chi-square test.
Results: There was not any complication during operation in minilaparotomy group,but in laparoscopic group, mcsosalpinx rupture and hematoma were seen in one patient (P>0.05). Scrosanginous or purulent secretion of incision was observed in 3 cases in minilaparotomy group (4.1%), but this early complication was not observed in laparoscopy group (P>0.05). Menstrual disorders and pelvic pain (2 cases and 1 case respectively )were observed during one-year follow up in minilaparotomy group and these complications were not observed in laparoscopic group (P>0.05).
Conclusion: Considering the lack of significant difference in complications of two mentioned groups and since minilaparotomy is a more expensive procedure than the other one, it is better to apply laparoscopy for TL at more extensive levels.

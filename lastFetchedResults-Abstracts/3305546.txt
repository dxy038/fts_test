This paper investigates a wisdom security model against internal attackers for cyberspace. The objective is to find the defensive measures are optimized with respect to threats launched by malicious attackers, and allow the defenders to choose their optimal control strategies contingent upon the state of game. Our model provides a new method to effectively decrease the number of attackers in cyberspace under the optimal control strategies of the defenders.

WiMax mesh networks based on IEEE 802.16 standard have promised to deliver high data rates over large areas and to be deployed easily. Optimum routing and scheduling of flows can do favor for capacity enlargement. The objective of this paper is to provide a routing-construction method with larger scale applicability and a concurrent transmission scheduling strategy to improve the performance during wireless resource allocation. Firstly, by using Possion model in queuing theory, the delay time of a given path in Mesh networks is analyzed. Furthermore , we design the greedy routing algorithm and concurrent scheduling strategy based on the path-delay parameter as proposed. At last, simulation results show that not only the throughput is enhanced, but also the delay is reduced in IEEE 802.16 Mesh networks.

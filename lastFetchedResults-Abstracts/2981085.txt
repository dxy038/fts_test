In this paper two different generalizations of intermediate recombination in evolution strategies are investigated. Both generalizations allow for recombining an arbitrary number of &#961; parents. However, the so-called &#961;/&#961;-mechanism averages all &#961; parents, while the so-called &#961;/2-mechanism repeatedly (for each object variable anew) selects two out of &#961; parents and averages the corresponding object variables to create an offspring individual. Results presented for the spherical function demonstrate that these two operators can cause a significantly different behavior concerning the convergence velocity of the algorithm. Both operators are applied to a number of different objective functions (including separable and non-separable, unimodal and multimodal, regular and irregular topologies), and the impact of the number of parents &#961; is investigated. The results illustrate that important differences in the results are not consistent with the canonical topology classification of objective functions, but can be explained to some extent by the &#8220;genetic repair&#8221; hypothesis of Beyer in combination with a reasoning about the success region

In this paper, we report an evolving collaboration between a social theorist and a visual communication theorist-graphic designer. We are exploring the contributions that can be made by integrating our theories and practices to theory, design and practice in information technology. We discuss the nature and current state of our collaboration and a project in which we are developing a Web-based GUI research protocol. The overall objective of our work is to explore the implications of understanding AI, robotics, GUIs, and human-computer interactions in terms of the idea that science and technology are socially constructed. One of our objectives in this paper is to explain what it means to say something is socially constructed. Another is to show why it is important to think about visual communication and graphic design in social and cultural terms

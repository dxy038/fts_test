This paper addresses the problem of allocating (assigning and scheduling) periodic task modules to processing nodes in distributed real-time systems subject to task precedence and timing constraints. Using the branch-and-bound technique, a module allocation scheme is proposed to find an &#8220;optimal&#8221; allocation that maximizes the probability of meeting task deadlines. The task system within a planning cycle is first modeled with a task flow graph which describes computation and communication modules, as well as the precedence constraints among them. To incorporate both timing and logical correctness into module allocation, the probability of meeting task deadlines is used as the objective function. The module allocation scheme is then applied to find an optimal allocation of task modules in a distributed system. The timing aspects embedded in the objective: function drive the scheme not only to assign task modules to processing nodes, but also to use a module scheduling algorithm (with polynomial time complexity) for scheduling all modules assigned to each node, so that all tasks maybe completed in time. In order to speed up the branch-and-bound process and to reduce the computational complexity, a dominance relation is derived. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed scheme

In this paper, we propose an interactive virtual space presentation system for e-commerce or virtual museum by three dimensional objects which are correctly selected from the distributed multimedia database over Internet based on the user subjective information, such as user perceptual information and the objective information, such as his/her occupation, age, sex, nationality. XML is used to realize reusable data format and adaptive media object presentation based on userÂ´s background information as a multimedia data management. We present its system architecture, perceptual model for object retrieving and multimedia object management implemented by XML.

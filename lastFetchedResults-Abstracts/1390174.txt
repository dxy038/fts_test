Longitudinal sliding of horse’s hooves at the beginning of stance can affect both performance and orthopaedic health. The objective of this study was to compare two measurement methods for quantifying hoof slip distances at training trot. The right front hoof of four French Trotters was equipped with an accelerometer (10 kHz) and kinematic markers. A firm wet sand track was equipped with a 50 m calibration corridor. A high-frequency camera (600 Hz) was mounted in a vehicle following each horse trotting at about 7 m/s. One of the horses was also trotted on raw dirt and harrowed dirt tracks. Longitudinal slip distance was calculated both from kinematic data, applying 2D direct linear transformation (2D-DLT) to the markers image coordinates, and from the double integration of the accelerometer signal. For each stride, both values were compared. The angle of the hoof with respect to the track was also measured.

was ‘middling/satisfactory’ agreement between accelerometric and 2D-DLT measurements for total slip and ‘fairly good’ agreement for hoof–flat slip. The influence of hoof rotation on total slip distance represented &lt;6% of accelerometric measures. The differences between accelerometric and kinematic measures (from −0.5 cm to 2.1 cm for total slip and from −0.2 cm to 1.4 cm for hoof–flat slip) were independent of slip distance magnitude. The accelerometric method was a simple method to measure hoof slip distances at a moderate training speed trot which may be useful to compare slip distances on various track surfaces.

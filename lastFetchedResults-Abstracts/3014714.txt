This paper concerns the design of the Collaborative Open Learning Technologies (COLT) project, led by Dr. Larry Katz, Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary. COLT partners include: Calgary Smart Communities, First Nations (Tsuu TÂ´ina), and iW Technologies. In addition, Bow Valley College, a diversified secondary institution encompassing career training and upgrading, is a research partner providing students and research staff. The objective of the COLT project is to provide the adult, disadvantaged learner with the concepts needed for skills acquisition in computing and technology use, through collaborative approaches. This process will be supported by computer communications and multimedia technologies. Success will be defined by learners acquiring the requisite skills with improved conceptual understanding, and increased employment potential.

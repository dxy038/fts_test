A numerical method using VAMPIRE for modelling the dynamic performance of a wagon passing through a turnout is presented with a special focus on wheel–rail wear. The objective is to investigate the potential benefit for operational strategies with respect to minimising wheel–rail wear. The simulations show that the travel speed significantly affects the wheel–rail wear at turnouts and that due to vehicle–track dynamics an optimal passing speed will exist that will minimise wear.

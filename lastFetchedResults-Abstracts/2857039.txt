Two-degree-of-freedom (2DoF) proportional-integrative-derivative (PID) control algorithms are presented here in order to see the conversion factors, relations and how we can improve the performance and robustness of the system. Each configuration is proposed as a multi-objective problem (MOP) it is used the Pareto front to analyze the disturbance attenuation performance versus control input usage. Examples with normalized dead-times (0.1, 1.0 and 1.75) are used to illustrate the comparison between them.

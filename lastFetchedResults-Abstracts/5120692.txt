Design and development of a metal contact switch that employs micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) based on electrostatic actuation and implemented using a coplanar waveguide (CPW) with three switch cells is presented. The design is based on the series-shunt switch configuration. The main objective of the present design is to achieve high isolation up to 12GHz frequency (X-band). The dimensions of the MEMS switch have been optimized with finite element method based Coventor Ware software. The switch has been fabricated using gold based surface micromachining process. The mechanical response, electrical response, switching time, loss performance and Intermodulation distortions of the MEMS switch have been experimentally investigated. Return loss better than 15dB and isolation greater than 60dB have been experimentally obtained upto 12GHz from the fabricated switch.

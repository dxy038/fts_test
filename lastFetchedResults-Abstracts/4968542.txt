We present a robust method for matching point features across a set of images under full perspective projection. An expectation-maximization-like algorithm is developed to build an optimal potential match set (PMS) between each consecutive pair of views, by iteratively maximizing a heuristic objective function. All two-view matches are combined to form an M-view potential match set (MPMS) with a low contamination rate. Outliers in MPMS are removed incorporating the least-median-of-squares technique with projective reconstruction. The current work extends previous ones in two- or three-view matching, or under affine camera projection. Results on real imagery demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

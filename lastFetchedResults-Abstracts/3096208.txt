It is widely recognised that enhanced global measurements of cirrus properties are essential to the improved accuracy of Climate Prediction Models and Global Circulation Models (GCMs) such as those used for short term weather forecasting. There are currently few dedicated airborne instruments in operation and no dedicated cirrus satellite instruments. We introduce a compact, light weight and low cost polarisation sensitive radiometer for remote sensing of water ice clouds from an aircraft platform and is currently under development in Cardiff. The primary objective of CILCO (Compact Instrument for Longwave Cirrus Observations) is to provide localised cirrus data from structured air campaigns. In addition this instrument will act as a proof of concept and technology test bed for a future dedicated satellite instrument capable of expanding output to global coverage.

The objective was to evaluate antimicrobial, antioxidant and copper-chelating activities of Maillard reaction products (MRP) prepared from maltose and different molecular weight chitosan, and their effects on preservation of fresh-cut Typha latifolia L. (TLL). LMRP (maltose and low molecular weight chitosan MRP) showed the highest browning and UV absorbance as well as fluorescence intensity. The DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power and copper-chelating activity of chitosan-maltose MRP varied depending on the chitosan molecular weight. HMRP (maltose-high molecular weight chitosan MRP) exhibited better effects on inhibiting PPO activity and discoloration, alleviating declines of total soluble solids and ascorbic acid content of fresh-cut TLL. LMRP and MMRP (maltose-medium molecular weight chitosan MRP) effectively decreased weight loss and maintained firmness of TLL, respectively. These results indicated that molecular weight of chitosan had a great impact on the functional properties of chitosan-maltose MRP and their application to be used as a preservative.

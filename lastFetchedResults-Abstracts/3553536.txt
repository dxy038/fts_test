A multiple-objective function model, formed according to the goal programming techniques rather than as a single-objective function model, and subject to a number of constraints, is more realistic for all engineering problems. A new algorithm using the random search technique is presented for obtaining a nearglobal optimum solution to multiple-objective nonlinear models. The application of these tools is demonstrated for the optimal design of a 63 kVA distribution transformer.

Bidirectional equations for forward and backward waves of intense few-cycle femtosecond pulses are solved numerically for single-mode optical fibre with dispersion and cubic nonlinearity including Raman mechanism. Appearance of a weak backward wave which was absent in the initial distribution is shown. The role of Raman nonlinearity on the amplitude and profile of forward and backward waves is investigated.

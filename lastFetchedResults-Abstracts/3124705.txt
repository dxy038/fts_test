This paper presents a new genetic algorithm (GA)- based approach for the simultaneous power quality improvement and optimal placement and sizing of fixed capacitor banks and distributed generation DGs in radial distribution networks in the presence of voltage and current harmonics. The objective function includes the cost of power losses, energy losses, capacitor banks. Constraints include voltage limit, voltage THD, number/ size of (capacitor and generator) and power quality limit Candidate buses for capacitor placement and distributed generation are selected using the sensitivities of constraints and the objective function with respect to reactive power injection at each bus The effect of harmonics on reactive power compensation of radial distribution systems is studied in this paper. The problem of optimal capacitor and distributed generation sizing and placement is solved for a non-uniform radial distribution system with lateral sub-feeders with linear and non-linear loads distributed along the feeder. The voltage at each bus along the feeder after capacitor and DGs installation is calculated for each harmonic order.

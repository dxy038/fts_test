This article describes the changes in spectrum management, driven by modern communications system concepts and new-type RF hardware and software developments, briefly discusses strategy of the spectrum management in the future, including spectrum-sharing technology, multi-dimension frequency assignments, and dynamically allocated frequency assignments spectrum concept. This article draws the following conclusion in sum: 1) new-type RF technology and broadband signal are being used extensively, and the frequency band suitable for mobile communication has been already very crowded. 2) The objective actuality request the frequency management spectrum organization must adopt the counter measure, changing the traditional frequency spectrum management. 3) New-type broadband system application of technology frequently, already or will soon become the main reason that system appears electromagnetic compatible problem

The main objective of this study was to determine the degree of sensitization to Anisakis simplex s.l. in healthy population. Using the determination of specific IgE, we studied the seroprevalence against A. simplex s.l. in blood donors selected at random in the region of Antequera (Southern Spain). We detected 22.1%. The immunoblotting technique revealed a band of approximately 60 kDa in the serum of individuals who also exhibited high values of specific IgE against A. simplex s.l. This band would be useful for diagnosis.

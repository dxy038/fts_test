In this paper, a simulation-optimization system for the optimal design of a multilevel inverter is presented. This system is a combination of an optimization tool and a simulation program. The optimization tool is used as a powerful procedure for the resolution of the design problem formulated in terms of objective function and constraints. The simulation program is with knowledge of the sequences of operation and is used to compute the inverter steady-state characteristics. An optimal design of the multilevel inverter is performed with the simulation-optimization system. The design constraints include the maximum current ripple in the inductors, maximum voltage ripple in the capacitors, output power and required efficiency of the inverter. The total weight of the capacitors and the inductors is taken as an objective function to be optimized. The optimal design results of the multilevel inverter are verified by an experimental prototype. The inverter is designed and implemented for a UPS application

The objective of this study was to compare the water footprint of oil palm plantation as a source for production of alternative energy as biodiesel in Surat Thani and Rayong province of Thailand by using water footprint concept. The results showed that the water footprint of oil palm in Surat Thani province was 619.9 m<sup>3</sup>/ton while the water footprint of oil palm in Rayong province was 803.2 m<sup>3</sup>/ton. The suitable climate for oil palm plantation in Surat Thani province provided the higher yield, more over the water footprint of oil palm in Surat Thani is less than Rayong province. In addition, the irrigation water used in the oil palm plantation in Rayong province is limited due to the utilized sharing of water in industrial and tourism sectors. Thus, it is necessary to find the measures to reduce the water footprint of oil palm plantation by increasing the yield. This can be achieved by improving oil palm through breeding, development and management of irrigation system and adding natural fertilizers to increase fertility in the soil. Additionally, reducing the use of chemical fertilizers during plantation should be performed to reduce the grey water footprint.

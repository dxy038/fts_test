Power crisis in Bangladesh is a common phenomenon. To meet up this crisis government is trying for different solutions, like IPP and other different policies. These policies may be a temporary solution but not permanent solution. Another problem is most of the power station is gas based and it is used 88.39% of total generation. So government is looking for alternative energy solution especially renewable energy. Solar and Wind energy are introduced in Bangladesh and currently solar energy is very good in progress. Compared to them other renewable energies are still lag behind, especially tidal energy. Bangladesh has a long costal area with 2-8 m tidal head/height rise and fall. This height is sufficient enough to produce power. So, tidal power has a bright future in Bangladesh as well as other countries. The main objective of this paper is to introduce tidal power and at the same time potentiality of tidal power in Bangladesh is also shown.

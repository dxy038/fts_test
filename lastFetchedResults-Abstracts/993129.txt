Objective: At present, treatment of edentulous areas with implant-supported prosthesis has greatly increased. The aim of this study was to assess the survival rate of implants with different diameters.
Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on 239 warfare victims presenting to Qazi Tabatabaie Clinic during 2000-2010. A total of 1,649 implants were placed. The success criteria included presence of osteointegrated implants with no sign of infection, mobility, or lucency around them. Data were extracted from patientsâ€™ records and recorded in questionnaires. Statistical analysis was carried out using Chi-square or Log-Rank test. 
Results: A total of 1,533 implants were evaluated out of which, 61 (4%) had failed. Survival rate of implants of different brandshad a significant association with implant diameter as the highest failure rate was observed in implants with 5-6.5 mm diameter and the lowest failure rate belonged to 3-3.5 mm diameter implants.
Conclusion: Study results demonstrated that the survival of implants may be affected by their diameter as the failure rate was higher in implants with greater diameters.

Currently, sustainability represents a primary issue for construction industry. New material and technological solutions are widely proposed and investigated to meet sustainability requirements and natural fibers represent one of the most studied materials. The work presented here investigated the mechanical behavior of a sustainable composite system made by pozzolanic mortar reinforced with hemp fiber grids. To improve the durability of the system and in particular of the fibers in the pozzolanic mortar environment a latex coating was used. The objective of the study was to investigate the mechanical behavior of the proposed composite system and assess the feasibility of using the system for structural retrofit applications on existing structures. A mechanical characterization of the fibers was conducted and the effectiveness of the latex coating in improving the durability of the fibers was investigated. The mechanical behavior of the composite system was studied, through a three-point bending test program.

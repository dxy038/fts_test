A new controller aimed to regulate voltage and frequency of a Front-End Converter used in stand-alone wind generation systems is proposed. Control objective is to maintain the output voltage with constant amplitude and frequency, independently of the load supplied. Controller is designed using the Interconnection and Damping Assignment technique. System stability is ensured through a proper choice of the energy function of the system in closed-loop. The behavior of the proposed control strategy is validated through simulations using a realistic converter model.

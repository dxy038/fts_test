The main objective of this presented work is to investigate the corrosion resistance of reinforced epoxy modified concrete in the hot marine environment and the possibility of introducing epoxy in concrete to improve its durability. Different percentages of cement were replaced by epoxy. Specimens were put in the testing tanks of a specially manufactured accelerated marine durability system, where they were exposed to cycles of sea water wetting and hot air drying. The introduction of epoxy in the concrete mix was found to increase the corrosion resistance, reduce permeability, reduce chloride penetration and increase strength. The improvements were found to increase with the increase in epoxy percentage.

The diaphragm movement (DM) signal during spontaneous ventilations is analyzed in this work. The DM signal is acquired by means two surface sensors (a piezoelectric contact sensor -PCS- and a piezoelectric accelerometer -ACP) applied on the costal wall. The main objective is to develop a new non invasive technique to assess respiratory muscle effort. Experiments were performed in an animal model: four pentobarbital-anesthetized and two awake mongrel dogs, carrying out spontaneous ventilations against an inspiratory load. DM signal has been decomposed in two components: a low frequency component (lower than 5 Hz) due to the overall lateral movement of the muscle (MOV component), and a high frequency component (higher than 5 Hz) due to the lateral vibration of active muscle fibers (VIB component). It has been seen that the PCS acquires only MOV components of MD signal, while ACP acquires both components. Positive high correlation coefficients have been found between amplitude parameters of VIB components of DM signal, acquired by means the ACP, and the respiratory muscle effort during ventilation, measured with inspiratory pressures.

Background and Aim: Neonates are more sensitive to pain and more susceptible to long term effects of pain than children and adults. Therefore, pain management has become a crucial part of neonatal care and cure. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of being in mother's hug and routine clinical procedure on neonatesâ€™ pain during immunization injections in health centers of west Tehran.
Material and Method: This randomized controlled trial study was performed on 76 healthy term infants aged between 2-4 month, referred to the health centers of Iran University of Medical Sciences in west of Tehran for DPT immunization. One group were given in their mother's hug, 2 minutes before, during, and 15 seconds after the injection, and the other group were lied on the examining table according to routine of the clinic. Objective changes in appearance of neonates were assessed by Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS) from 5 second before immunization to 15 second after it.
Results: There was statistical significant difference between behavioral pain scores of the groups (P?0.0001).
Conclusion: Regarding statistical significant difference between behavioral pain responses of the groups, simple and safe practice of hugging infants by their mothers is suggested to reduce pain during immunization and muscular injections, too.

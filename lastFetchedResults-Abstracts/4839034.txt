One of the challenging problems of wireless communication systems such as GSM and CDMA networks installed in the southern part of Libya is the attenuation of microwave/millimeter signals due to the precipitations found in air. The attenuation of microwave signals caused by dust has always been a source of problems that made wireless communication facilities to be out of service at times of dust and sandy climatic conditions. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of sand and dust storms on wireless networks installed in the southern part of Libya by estimating wave attenuation, using a predicting microwave signal attenuation based on Mie scattering model.

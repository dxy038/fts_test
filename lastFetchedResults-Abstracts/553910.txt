One of the main objectives of U.S. post world war II foreign policy, when relieved from military engagement in Europe, was based on economical development and imposing American influence all over the world. Therefore the new policy today, which is translated as New Imprialism, while having less undisirable effects on U.S. prestige in comparison to the old Imprialism, is now being considered the U.S. new strategy.

Based on this new strategy, economical means have been frequently used as a new weapon against hostile countries.

The economical sanctions being used by U.S. and her allies against Islamic Republic of Iran, commencing just after Islamic revolution of Iran was mainly based on such strategy.

The main objective of this policy was to impose U.S. will on Iran in order to change Iran's behaviour and her policy towards the west.

Despite U.S. exaggeration of Iran's threat and her will in maintaining U.S. intrests in the Persian Gulf and other countries, the impact of these sanctions on Iran, according to author's analysis is as folows:

Since the U.S. policy requires acknowledgment of China, Russia, Japan and her European allies, and since none of them appear to accept such an act against Iran, thus the result is not in accordance with U.S. objectives. Iran is now obtaining her needs mainly through third world countries and is keeping U.S. companies away from Iran's market. It seems though it is only third parties benefitting from such policy and Iran and U.S. are both not gaining much.

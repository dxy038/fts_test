Neonatal 6-N-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroidism reduces body weight but increases testicular size in adult male rodents. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of prepubertal PTU treatment on boars. For Experiment I, boars (n=28) were randomly allotted to eight pens. Each pen received one of four PTU doses (0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.1% in a basal diet) between 28 and 56 days of age (DOA). Due to a lack of difference among three PTU treatments, PTU-treated boars were pooled. Boars treated with PTU had lower (P&lt;0.05) ADG during treatment, lighter (P&lt;0.05) BW after 56 DOA and less (P&lt;0.05) developed epididymides at 154 DOA. For Experiment II, boars (n=19) were randomly allotted to six pens. Each pen received one of three PTU treatments orally as: control (carrier), PTU-I (0.002% BW of PTU daily between 7 and 70 DOA), or PTU-II (0.002% BW of PTU daily between 28 and 91 DOA). During treatment, PTU-treated boars had lower (P&lt;0.05) serum T4 levels, rectal temperature, feed intake and ADG. Boars treated with PTU had lower (P&lt;0.05) BW between 63 and 154 DOA but higher (P&lt;0.05) gain/feed between 105 and 133 DOA. Boars treated with PTU had less (P&lt;0.05) developed epididymides and sperm count per gram testis at 238 DOA. These results suggest that prepubertal PTU-induced hypothyroidism had significant effects on growth, hormonal profiles, and reproductive traits of boars; however, it does not appear to be an effective method for increasing testis size and sperm production of commercial boars.

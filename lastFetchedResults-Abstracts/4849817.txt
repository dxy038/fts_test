An optimal approach to the design of low crosstalk, wideband, bidirectional, distributed amplifiers is proposed. The new technique based on Chebyshev scaling of device transconductances, gives considerably greater directivity bandwidth than the previously published approach using binomial scaling, for specified number of devices and minimum directivity. The theory and design guidelines, as well as simulated and measured results are presented.

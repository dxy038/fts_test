The objective of this work is to study the influence of electrical discharge on the evolution
of the cloud droplet spectra using a 1-D cloud model. It is shown that droplet motion and the electrical
effects produced by lightning may cause a rapid and effective droplet coalescence process, with noticeably
more phase transfer from liquid toward frozen water. As a measure of the drop spectra changes, we
investigated variations of the radar reflectivity factor and the mass-weighted mean diameters at five
temperature levels (0, )5, )10, )15, and )20C) with 15 combinations of the initial conditions. The model
simulations suggest that about where the lightning occurred, after a few seconds, the initial unimodal
spectra of supercooled water drops can be transferred to the bimodal spectra of unfrozen and frozen water
drops. The number of newly created frozen drops is a few orders less than unfrozen water drops, but can
still be very important for further transformations due to gravitational coagulation and other
microphysical processes, e.g. glaciation. The results indicate that the procedure established to describe
processes related to the electrical discharge and droplet spectra transformations can be used within a 3-D
mesoscale model. It is concluded that the outcome can be also used to explain some of the physical
characteristics inferred from polarimetric radar observations.

The objective of this study is to develop a surface scattering model including multiple scattering based on extending an existing integral-equation-based surface scattering model (IEM). This is done by removing a simplifying assumption in the spectral representation of the GreenÂ´s function used in the scattered field expression of the IEM surface scattering model. It is noted that while this simplifying assumption is valid and useful in single scattering calculation, it is a hindrance to separating and identifying terms responsible for surface multiple scattering. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the removal of this assumption permits multiple surface scattering calculations to be carried out and shown to agree with controlled laboratory measurements acquired from known surfaces

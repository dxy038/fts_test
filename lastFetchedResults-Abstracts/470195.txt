Objective
This was a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety of uterine artery embolization (UAE) compared with hysterectomy.
Study design
Twenty-eight Dutch hospitals recruited 177 patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids and menorrhagia who were eligible for hysterectomy. Patients were randomized to UAE (n = 88) or hysterectomy (n = 89). In this paper we evaluate the peri- and postprocedural complications, length of hospital stay, unscheduled visits, and readmission rates up to 6 weeks' post-intervention. Analysis was by intention to treat.
Results
Bilateral UAE failure occurred in 4 patients (4.9%). Major complications occurred in 4.9% (UAE) and 2.7% (hysterectomy) of cases (P = .68). The minor complication rate from discharge until 6 weeks after was significantly higher in the UAE group than in the hysterectomy group (58.0% vs 40.0%; RR 1.45 [1.04-2.02]; P = .024). UAE patients were more often readmitted (11.1% vs 0%; P = .003). Total length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in UAE patients (mean [SD]: 2.5 [2.7] vs 5.1 [1.3], P< .001).
Conclusion
UAE is a procedure similar to hysterectomy with a low major complication rate and with a reduced length of hospital stay. Higher readmission rates after UAE stress the need for careful postprocedural follow-up.

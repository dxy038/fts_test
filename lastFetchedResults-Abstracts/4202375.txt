The proposed idea emphasizes on the removal of weeds in a semi-structured cultivated field by using image processing. The main objective is to cut the weeds precisely which is present near to the cultivated plant and collect it separately. A static camera is mounted for taking the images of a segment of the field and the coordinates of the weeds present in that segment is detected by image processing using LABVIEW. The coordinates of the weeds obtained from camera are communicated through XBee module to the robot finally for cutting the weeds.

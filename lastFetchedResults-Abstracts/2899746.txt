In this paper operation performance of an high-frequency (HF) link ac/ac converter is demonstrated using computer aided simulation package PSCAD/EMTDC. The converter consists of input filter, input matrix converter, HF transformer, and output matrix converter. The proposed configuration permits flexibility in the choice of voltage levels and frequency in the system without the penalty of bulky magnetic components. The proposed approach achieve high voltage transfer ratio, HF galvanic isolation of the input source from the output utility, higher power density by introducing a HF transformer in between the two stages of the converter. It is capable of having bidirectional power flow, achieve lower harmonic distortion on both input and output sides with proper filter design and controllable input displacement power factor. It also provides fast response, high efficiency, and free from acoustic noise. Comprehensive results are presented to assess the performance of the converter. Several features like voltage sag compensation, instantaneous voltage regulation, and power factor correction can be combined to this converter. This kind of converter laid the base for regulated ac power supplies and electronic transformers.

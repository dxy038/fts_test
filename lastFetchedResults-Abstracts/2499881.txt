Introduction & Objective: Nowadays, the electronic devices are being used in our living environments and workplaces. The effect of magnetic fields from electronic devices on the microorganism has been taken into special consideration. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of magnetic fields on the microorganism exiting in water.
Material & Methods: In this study two solenoid with 250 standard coils connected to a power source were used. So, a magnetic field (intensity of 100,200 and 300 mT) was created. The effect of magnetic fields was investigated in laboratory condition on temperature, pH, turbidity, total coliforms, focal coliforms and heterotrophic bacteria plate count of water samples. Also the effect of the time passed (10,20,30,40 and 50 mintues) on the cases and control samples was surveyed.
  
Results: Results showed that the use of magnetic fields cause a significant increase in MPN/100 ml, coliform, total coliform and heterotrophic bacteria plate count in experimental samples in comparison  with the control samples. Also, in most samples, this increase was more effective in 100 mT.  According to the results, a slight increase was observed in temperature, pH and turbidity of samples under the influence of applied magnetic field.
Conclusion: The main results obtained in this study indicated that the magnetic fields lead to an increase inMPN/100 ml, coliform, total coliform and heterotrophic bacteria plate count. In contrast, the results did not confirm the effect of magnetic fields on temperature, pH and turbidity of the water solution.

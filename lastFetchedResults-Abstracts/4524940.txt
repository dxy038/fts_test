This paper presents a combination of RFID and robotic technologies for developing a cloth-dressing robot system in the field of robot´s body clothing innovation. By using the RFID as key elements for data management to command an adaptive cloth-dressing robot control with fuzzy-PID controller to create value add of dressing room services management system and also changes the customer´s life styles especially in the body size clothing in the future. This RFID technique deals with multiusers and an adaptive cloth-dressing robot that can be provide an efficiency time management scheme with correctly data report of each user and can work out in the real time. In particular this paper also studies the problems of detection tracking of the RFID tag that is relatively with the data base and the cloth-dressing robot module platform correctly. This RFID tag is equipped by user via Wi-Fi connected between user and cloth-dressing data based server. The necessary data for the robot system to operate include dimensions of the user´s shoulder, chest, waist, and body height. Based on details of the user´s body size were given by RFID devices, the robot can adjust its size and shape allowing testing of dressing clothes to be performed. The robot module is controlled by fuzzy-PID controller for resizing the robot´s body size that relatively with the user´s body size data. The fuzzy-PID controllers can be used to solve this objective because of the main advantage of fuzzy logic is that no mathematical modeling of any cloth-dressing body is required but can be achieved higher performance with effective tuning initial setting parameters. Finally, experimental results are revealed that the data based software can work well and fuzzy-PID can perform high performance control but must be improved for more accuracy and practical to use the robot mechanism such in the real situation of any cloth-dressing room environmental.

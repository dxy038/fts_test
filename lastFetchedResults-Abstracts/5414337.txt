This paper measures the risk of transportation scheme with the mean-variance analysis method, and considers the valid scheme of compounding transportation problem under the emergency event. Aiming at the probability and total cost of scheme of compounding transportation, a multi-objective emergency mathematical model is built, and then analyzes with an example. The results shows that a compounding of different transport schemes can reduce the risk aversion makers who prefer to choose the low variance compounding transportation scheme.

Interactive Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), a user-centric service, uses bidirectional transmissions to facilitate viewer requests for accessing various services, a feature applied within a multicast environment. This paper proposes a joint multi-guard band-based call admission policy and dynamic resource reservation management (DRRM) mechanism for radio resource management in mobile WiMAX networks. Distinguishing features of the proposed method are that it takes into account the delivery requirement of interactive IPTV services, admits calls by simultaneously considering uplink and downlink capacities, and adaptively adjusts the thresholds based on the influence curve of mobility to predict the handoff probability. Specifically, through simulations of the outage probability, the impact of the lack of required two-way bandwidth is studied.

A novel algebraic approach to restore images blurred by motion is presented. Rather than using the LS or LMS criteria, the objective function is established on the basis of the Minimal Description Length (MDL) criterion and a piecewise constant model of underlying image. In this way, the a priori knowledge of the image can be included in the objective function. Computer simulations show that the method is robust

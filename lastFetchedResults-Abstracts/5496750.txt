The author considers the functions that are necessary to create information at the level of effective decision making. He observes that a major portion of the task has not yet been formalized and carried out by conventional programs. He outlines a layered architecture that incorporates modules that will implement the objective of moving processing out of traditional programs. These software modules or mediators exploit encoded knowledge about some sets or subsets of data to create information for a higher layer of applications. The author discusses the interfaces that will be needed to incorporate mediators in future information processing systems architectures. A number of research issues are raised

A large number of different high-performance antenna placement schemes can be produced by changing the location coordinates of vehicular antenna based on Particle Swarm Optimization. A simplified model of the antenna system was generated in this work, and the optimized objective function of the mutual coupling between antennas was proposed to obtain the reasonable position coordinates of every antennas using Mat lab toolbox. Finally, we validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the method in the antenna placement problem, which can provide a new idea and an analytic method in many antennas system.

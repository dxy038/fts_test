Objective
This study was undertaken to compare laparoscopic and open sacral colpopexies for efficacy and safety.
Study design
Charts were reviewed for 56 patients who underwent laparoscopic sacral colpopexy and 61 patients who underwent open sacral colpopexy. Demographic and hospital data, complications, and follow-up visits were reviewed.
Results
Mean follow-up was 13.5 ± 12.1 months and 15.7 ± 18.1months in the laparoscopic and open groups, respectively. Mean operating time was significantly greater in the laparoscopic versus open cohort, 269 ± 65 minutes and 218 ± 60 minutes, respectively (P< .0001). Estimated blood loss (172 ± 166 mL vs 234 ± 149 mL; P = .04) and hospital stay (1.8 ± 1.0 days vs 4.0 ± 1.8 days; P< .0001) were significantly less in the laparoscopic group than the open group. Complication and reoperation rates were similar.
Conclusion
Laparoscopic and open sacral colpopexies have comparable clinical outcomes. Although laparoscopic sacral colpopexy requires longer operating time, hospital stay is significantly decreased.

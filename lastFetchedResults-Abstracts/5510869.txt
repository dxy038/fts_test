While a concise and universally accepted definition of intelligent control is elusive, the objective of enhancing the autonomous capabilities of vehicles can be practically considered along various fronts. Over recent decades, increasingly capable autonomous vehicles have been designed, developed, and demonstrated. Control theory and its application have played critical roles in these advancements. This talk will consider recent advances in the autonomous capabilities of vehicles, the role of control theory in achieving those advances, and potential directions for further enhancements in vehicle autonomy and intelligence.

Advances in VLSI technology have made it possible to design and build high performance parallel computers. The standard sequential algorithms for scientific computing therefore have to be reconsidered in a parallel context. The authors discuss approaches to make full use of a shared-memory multiprocessor supercomputer, the Alliant FX/2800, in the parallel processing of non-uniform image motion estimation leading to the design of the application specific digital signal processing VLSI chip. Non-uniform image motion estimation considers the motion of individual pixels in the image of a moving object. Image motion estimation is used in medical diagnosis, high resolution TV image transmission, target tracking and acquisition, etc. The objective of the VLSI implementation is to reduce overhead and to achieve high speed performance

Catastrophe control generally means to design a controller that is capable of modifying the catastrophe characteristics of a catastrophe nonlinear system, so as to achieving some desirable dynamical behaviors. A typical objective is to delay and/or stabilize an existing catastrophe. In this paper, we consider the catastrophe control in another way, that is, a certain catastrophe is created at a desired location with preferred properties by appropriate control. Washout filter aided dynamic feedback control laws are developed for the creation of catastrophe.

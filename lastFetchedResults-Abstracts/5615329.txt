Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are a vital part of computer games. Their behaviour is usually pre determined by the developers before a computer game is released. While these NPCs exist in a virtual environment in which they aim to achieve their objectives, these objectives might involve certain actions which should be both believable and add realism to games. In internet gameplay, these may range from navigation of the environment, attack and defense of an objective or assisting other NPCs or human players to achieve their goals. Various forms of decision making process are now implemented to provide believability and realism to games. These techniques range from reinforcement learning, imitation learning, supervised and unsupervised learning for online and offline games. While these are widely implemented, a new genre of realism is being added to games especially first person shooter games, namely Smart Terrains with virtual destructive environments. Smart Terrain has the potential to improve the realism of games and the behavior of the NPC in games such as first person shooter games where gameplay is fast paced. The potential issue would be if NPCs are dynamic enough to recognize changes in the virtual environment or if the virtual environment provides the required information to assist the NPCs with their objectives or tasks. This paper presents an overview of Smart Terrain in enhancing Online Tactic Agent decision making.

The optimization of power architectures is a complex problem due to the plethora of different ways to connect various system components. This issue has been addressed by developing a methodology to design and optimize power architectures in terms of the most fundamental system features: size, cost and efficiency. The process assumes various simplifications regarding the utilized DC/DC converter models in order to prevent the simulation time to become excessive and, therefore, stability is not considered. The objective of this paper is to present a simplified method to analyze small-signal stability of a system in order to integrate it into the optimization methodology. A black-box modeling approach, applicable to commercial converters with unknown topology and components, is based on frequency response measurements enabling the system small-signal stability assessment. The applicability of passivity-based stability criterion is assessed. The stability margins are stated utilizing a concept of maximum peak criteria derived from the behavior of the impedance-based sensitivity function that provides a single number to state the robustness of the stability of a well-defined minor-loop gain.

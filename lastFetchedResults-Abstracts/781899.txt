The French West Indies and Caribbean authorities have the objective of increasing small ruminant production to match market
demand and develop local economies. This paper highlights research results obtained in the French West Indies over the last 25
years in small ruminant farming. The accumulated knowledge enabled the design of an intensive grazing system whose main
characteristics are: (i) three mating periods a year, each one involving half the flock, in order to achieve an 8-month interval between
parturitions; (ii) rotational grazing of pastures (1 week in, 4–5 weeks out); (iii) irrigation during the dry season, according to the
grass requirement and rainfall shortage; and fertilisation from 0.5 to 1 kg N per day per ha; (iv) stocking rate of up to 40 suckling
ewes or 60 suckling goats per ha, or from 1200 to 1600 kg live weight (LW) per hectare for weaned lambs and kids. The average
live weights of weaners were 27.9 and 16.3 kg LW per female per year, for ewes and goats, respectively. The yearly post weaning
output reached 1482 and 1132 kg LW/ha, for sheep and goats, respectively. The constraints to production are highlighted and some
proposals for improved small ruminant farming are suggested.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the production of cellulolytic enzymes by Acremonium strictum isolated from Brazilian Biome using different substrates. Fermentations were initially carried out using commercial substrates, including microcrystalline cellulose (AVICEL® and SERVACEL®) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). This was followed by fermentations performed using lignocellulosic biomass: sugarcane bagasse pretreated at different intensities. The fermentations were carried out in shakers at 150 rpm, 30 °C for 240 h. Four enzyme activities were determined: CMCase, FPase, cellobiase and β-glucosidase. Among the substrates used, results showed that the sugarcane bagasse submitted to mild pretreatment was that which induced the microorganism to produce greater cellulolytic activities. This substrate was employed in the optimization study of cellulase production by A. strictum.

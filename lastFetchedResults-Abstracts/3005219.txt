Woodruff (1997) and Treacy, and Wiersema (1996) see value as the next source of competitive advantage and suggest that organisations should reinvent their companies. Moreover, to enable long-standing firms that produce value over time, it is crucial to continuously re-configure the opportunities. The objective of the paper is to illustrate through two case studies, from chemical and drink sectors, the application of the value cube. The paper starts by explaining the value cube and its six value propositions. Then, the methodology for the application of the case studies is discussed and it is followed by the identification of the value propositions of both organisations and the explanation of how these organisations create value. The paper concludes with a set of lessons learned and contributions.

Due to the deregulation in the electrical market, difficulties in building new transmission lines, and the continuous increase in power demand the maintenance of power system stability becomes difficult and a very challenging problem. In large, interconnected power system damping is often reduced, leading to lightly damped electromechanical modes of low frequency oscillations (0.1~0.6Hz). In this paper, supplementary damping control system design for Thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) based on natural inspired Virtual Bees Algorithm (VBA) is presented. The controller design problem is formulated as an optimization problem and VBA is employed to search optimal set of controller parameters by minimizing the eigenvalues based multi-objective function. The linear and non-linear simulation results of various small and large disturbances show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller design and its ability to provide efficient damping of low frequency oscillations.

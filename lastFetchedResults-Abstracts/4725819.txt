At IGARSS 2000 the Data Fusion Committee began the sponsorship of a series of contests with which the committee aimed to reach two goals. The first goal was to assess the state of the art of a clearly defined aspect of the data fusion field by empirically evaluating algorithms. The second goal was to identify collective weaknesses of current algorithms, so as to identify requirements of further research. The first contest focused in the sharpening of 30-m resolution multispectral images by using 15-m panchromatic imagery. The objective of the sharpening was to improve the spatial resolution of the multispectral imagery, while preserving the spectral information in homogeneous areas. For the IGARSS 2000 contest, Landsat 7 Thematic Mapper data acquired over urban and agricultural areas was used. Researchers from the Remote Sensing Technologies Center at Mississippi State University won the contest. This paper describes the pan sharpening methodology used

Background
The objective of the current study was to study different functional and anatomic features of the hyperplastic gland and clinical and biochemical characteristics of renal hyperparathyroidism (HPT) patients and their relationship with the scintigraphic detection of parathyroid glands.
Methods

A retrospective study was performed of 40 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) who underwent cervical surgery for HPT. Weight, histology, and localization of hyperplastic glands were recorded. Parathyroid cell proliferation was assessed by percentage of S-phase cells. Double-phase scintigraphy with technetium 99mâ€“sestamibi and serum parathyroid intact hormone (PTHi), creatinine, calcium, and phosphate levels were performed.
Results

Detection of hyperplastic parathyroid glands by 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy was associated with the weight and inferior localization of the glands. The functionality of the glands as reflected in serum PTHi and phosphorus levels was associated with the number of glands detected.
Conclusion

Double-phase 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy is of limited usefulness in patients with renal HPT. Detection of hyperplastic parathyroid glands in patients with CRF depends on the weight and inferior localization of the glands. Serum PTHi, phosphorus and creatine levels are associated with the number of glands detected by means of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy.

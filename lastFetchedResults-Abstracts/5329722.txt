Topology and reliability of urban road network are usually impacted by emergencies. Scientific evaluation of urban public transport network reliability is an objective demand of emergency management. We argue in this paper: The small world network parameters, average path length L, clustering coefficient C and traditional road network reliability indicators could be taken into reliability analysis of urban public transport network. That is to take connectivity reliability, time reliability, capacity reliability, evacuation reliability and restructuring reliability as indicators of reliability of urban public transport network. Further analysis of the relationship between the five reliability indicators are carried out. It takes Urumqi city as an example, it preliminarily analyzes the public transportation reliability of Urumqi City which is under typical incidents. The results show that the proposed indicators can be more scientific and accurate to evaluate urban public transport network reliability under emergencies. It enriches the evaluation system of urban public transport network reliability and also more effectively and scientifically supports emergency management.

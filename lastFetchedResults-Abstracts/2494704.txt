Objective: Low back pain is the most common skeletal disorder worldwide that 50%
to 80% of people experience it at least once in their lifetime. Physical and psychological
factors in the work environment can relatively contribute to low back pain. In this study,
we examined the prevalence of low back pain and influential factors in its development
among nursing staff.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study we assessed the prevalence of low back pain among
nurses working in Poursina hospital, Rasht, Iran, during March and April 2012. Demographic
data and information on the status of skeletal pain, as well as, associated factors were
collected using a pre-designed check list. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.
Results: A total of 350 nurses with a mean age of 32.00 Â± 8.24 years (minimum 22 and
maximum 56 years) were studied (90.3% female). 246 participants (70.3%) had a history of
low back pain. There was no significant difference between gender and the incidence of
low back pain, (P = 0.286). 96 participants (27.4%) aged 27 to 31 had the highest rate of low
back pain and 11 participants (3.1%) aged 52 to 56 were the least frequent age group. Low
back pain significantly differed by age (P = 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.222), and
physical activity (P = 0.050).
Conclusion: The results of this study showed a prevalence of 70% for low back pain among
nurses working in Poursina hospital in Rasht, in Gilan province. Age, BMI, and physical
activity were significantly associated with the prevalence of low back pain. However,
gender, occupation, marital status, smoking, family history, frequency of lifting heavy
things, work experience, and workplace did not show a significant relationship.

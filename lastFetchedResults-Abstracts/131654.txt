Background: Sore throat and cough are common complications after general anesthesia which are very unpleasant for patients and prevention of these events are very important. Objective: To determine the effect of topical betamethasone on reduction of sore throat and cough after general anesthesia.
Methods: In this prospective analytic study (clinical trial) 60 patients who scheduled for elective surgery divided into two equal groups. Under equal condition of general anesthesia, in one group endotracheal tube which impregnated with betamethasone jell and in the other group, endotracheal tube without jell used for intubation. 24 hours after anesthesia, patients of both groups follwed for sore throat and cough. Ultimately informations were analyzed statistically with X2 test.
Findings: During 24 hours after operation, 13.3% of patients in betamethasone group and 40% in control group had sore throat and there was significant statistical difference between two groups (P<0.05). Also 10% of patients in betamethasone group and 20% in control group had cough postoperatively but there was no significant statistical difference between two groups (P>0.05).
Conclusion: Using the endotracheal tube with betamethasone jell reduces postoperative sore throat significantly but has not significant effect on reduction of postoperative cough.

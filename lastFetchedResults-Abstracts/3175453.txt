The main objective of this paper was that take Gauss pseudospectral method applied to solve maximum hypersonic unpowered glide trajectory in the presence of constraint such as dynamic pressure, overload and heat flux. In Gauss pseudospectral method, the state and control variables were approximate using a global Lagrange interpolating polynomial. First, the equations of motion and optimization model were described. Then, the optimal control problem could discrete into a nonlinear programming problem using Gauss pseudospectral method. Finally, nonlinear programming problem was solved using Sequential Quadratic Programming. Through optimization process, constrained optimal trajectory could acquire. The precision and fast convergence of this method has been demonstrated with the trajectory optimization of hypersonic unpowered glider in near space.

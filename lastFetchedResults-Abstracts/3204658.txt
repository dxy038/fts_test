Speeding up of the conventional railways adopted in Japan and Europe requires less investment than laying a new infrastructure dedicated to fast railway systems. In this way, tilting trains that can negotiate curves at high speed will be introduced along with partial improvement of the related infrastructure. Tilting trains are currently in operation in 13 countries around the world. With the advances in tilting technology, verification of economic efficiency, and changes in economic situations, the introduction of tilting trains will rapidly spread across the globe. The Korean tilting train developed in this project is designed for a design speed of 200 km/h and a maximum operating speed of 180 km/h for bidirectional operation on the conventional lines in a power-distributed EMU type.

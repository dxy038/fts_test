Objective: Many theorists agree that intimacy is a multidimensional concept, consisting of several specific factors, but intimacy attitude components are not the same as intimate behavior components. This research is aimed to determine the components of intimacy attitude in university students.
Method: In revised Intimacy Attitude Scale (RDAS) which originally developed by Amidon et al., (1983) it was argued that the intimacy attitude components are General intimacy, Fear of Rejection/Loss of Control in interpersonal intimacy and Sexual Physical Closeness. In present study, 521 university students entered the research to study the psychometric properties and validation of RDAS. 
Results: The Cronbachâ€™s alpha was 0.84 and test-retest correlation was 0.83. Results of factor analysis supported the four specific structure components with different sub scales. Multivariate analysis of variance corroborated that intimacy attitude is very similar in different sexes and ages but vary regarding the above four components.
Conclusions: The RDAS showed acceptable psychometric qualities in Tehran university students.

The objective of this study is to elucidate the influence of postmortem freezing storage on the tensile properties of tendons. Chicken Flexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP) tendons were stored at 0&#176;C, -20&#176;C and -40&#176;C between 0 to 90 days. No statistically significant changes was found in the cross-sectional area following freezing storage. Tensile tests were performed every 5 days and the results showed that tensile properties of digital flexor tendon, as represented by stress-strain curves, Ultimate Tensile Strength, Strain at Maximum Stress, Elastic Modulus and Energy at Maximum Stress, were not affected during freezing storage at 0&#176;C, -20&#176;C and -40&#176;C for up to 90 days. Comparison between groups of same duration showed no discernable differences in tensile properties after storage at 0&#176;C, -20&#176;C and -40&#176;C. Therefore, we conclude that freezing storage at sub-zero temperature up to 90 days does not alter the tensile properties of digital flexor tendon

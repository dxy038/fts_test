As a complement to the studies of industrial engineering, students have the opportunity of making projects to improve their practical knowledge. In this case a sun tracker was built and controlled using and Arduino microprocessor. The main objective is to build an experimental plant that could be used by the students to practice in control courses. This project has been successfully used in various courses in the educational programs of teaching automatic control.

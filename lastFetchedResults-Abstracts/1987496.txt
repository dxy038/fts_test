Many stability issues may occur as agricultural reservoir embankments become superannuated in South Korea. Reinforcement of reservoir embankments is necessary because of the potential for the loss of lives and property damage can occur, if an embankment is failed due to its faults. However, construction activities that are associated with repairing reservoir embankments are not recognized as environmentally friendly, although the importance of reservoirs is increasing. Therefore, the objective of this research was to assess the environmental effect for leakage reduction methods of reservoir embankments through estimation of CO2 emissions during the construction using hybrid method for a rational selection considering economic and environmental characteristics. Based on an estimate of the construction cost and CO2 emissions at the scale assumed, the Jumbo Special Pattern (JSP) method had the highest cost and emissions and the surface impermeable wall method had the lowest cost and emissions.

r CO2 emissions for the sheet pile method were relatively low compared to the total construction cost due to use of steel sheets, which have a high unit price but low basic unit of CO2 emissions. Among the causes of emissions, material division is the largest contributor to total emissions for all of the methods. The suggested process of estimating CO2 emissions is applied to the targeted reservoir where curtain grouting was applied. For both the total construction cost and CO2 emissions, results were similar to those of the scale that was assumed. The total CO2 emissions for most of the methods were smaller than that of the curtain method that was installed in the study area, except for the JSP method.

the method for estimating CO2 emissions for leakage reduction methods properly described the characteristics of each of the methods proposed in this study, and may provide a basis for establishing a policy to reduce CO2 emissions in the selection of repair methods.

In the conventional method proposed by W.N.Lie et al., it is difficult to satisfy both the capacity of watermark information and the robustness to MP3 compression. The objective of this work is to increase the capacity of watermark information in the audio watermarking based on low-frequency amplitude modification. We increase the capacity of watermark information by embedding multiple watermarks in individual layers. In the proposed method, it has plural data channels, so it is possible to embed watermark information by selecting the proper data channel according to the capacity of data or extraction accuracy.

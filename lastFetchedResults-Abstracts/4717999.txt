Discontinuous reception (DRX) can be configured as a power saving mechanism for user equipment (UE) in connected mode in the long term evolution advanced (LTE-A) network. Since DRX saves UE´s battery power usually at the cost of increased latency, a tradeoff between these two conflicting performance metrics are inevitable. DRX parameters can be optimized for either maximizing power saving or minimizing latency based on the applications running at the UE. In this paper, we first develop an analytical model to estimate power saving achieved and latency incurred by DRX operation. We then propose a scheme to tune DRX parameters in order to keep a balance between these conflicting performance metrics by formulating a multi-objective optimization problem. The tradeoff between power saving and latency is achieved based on the operator´s relative preferences for these metrics. We also validate our analytical model by system level simulation results from OPNET Modeler. OPNET simulation results are well aligned with the MATLAB results based on analytical model and the results show that proposed scheme efficiently optimizes the DRX configuration for the battery power saving and latency requirements of various diverse data applications based on the preferences determined by operator.

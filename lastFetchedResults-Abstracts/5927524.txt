This paper introduces a fusion model to reinforce multi-level fuzzy association rules, which integrated cumulative probability distribution approach (CPDA) and multi-level taxonomy concepts to extract fuzzy association rules. The proposed model generate large item sets level by level and mine multi-level fuzzy association rule lead to finding more informative and important knowledge from transaction dataset, which is more objective and reasonable in determining the universe of discourse and membership functions with other multi-level fuzzy association rules.

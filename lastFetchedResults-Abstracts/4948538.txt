A printed circular ring antenna for UWB application is proposed in this paper. The antenna structure is composed of a circular ring patch and a partial ground plane. The proposed antenna has a total size of 39 &#215; 40 mm<sup>2</sup>. The measurement shows that the antenna has an impedance bandwidth (VSWR&#8804; 2) of 9.54 GHz (2.54 to 12.08 GHz). A nearly stable bidirectional radiation pattern with low cross polarization makes the proposed antenna suitable for being used in wireless communication system. Details of the proposed compact planar antenna design are presented and discussed.

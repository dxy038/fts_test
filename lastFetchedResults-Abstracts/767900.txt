High-velocity transverse impact of laminated
fiber reinforced composites is of interest in military, marine
and structural applications. The overall objective of this
work was to investigate the behavior of laminated thermoplastic
composites of varying thicknesses under highvelocity
impact from an experimental and modeling
viewpoint. In order to analyze this problem, a series of
ballistic impact tests have been performed on plain weave
E-glass/polypropylene (E-glass/PP) composites of different
thicknesses using 0.30 and 0.50 caliber right-cylinder
shaped projectiles. A gas gun with a sabot stripper mechanism
was employed to impact the panels. In order to
analyze the perforation mechanisms, ballistic limit and
damage evaluation, an explicit three-dimensional finite
element code LS-DYNA was used. Material model 162, a
progressive failure model based on modified Hashinâ€™s
criteria, has been assigned to analyze failure of the laminate.
The projectile was modeled using Material model 3
(MAT_PLASTIC_KINEMATIC). The laminates and the
projectile were meshed using brick elements with single
integration points. The impact velocity ranged from 187 to
332 m s-1. Good agreement between the numerical and
experimental results was attained in terms of predicting
ballistic limit, delamination and energy absorption of
E-glass/PP laminate

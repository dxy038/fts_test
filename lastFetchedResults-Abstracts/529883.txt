Today, one of the most important features of ecological changes in organizations is the rise in competition levels. Therefore universities as the center of development in a society that intends to educate professional staff in a country must continuously improve their educational as well as work processes to satisfy the students and gain international fame. This aims at promoting quality and attaining world standards.

The main objective of this study is to model university processes to attain the abovementioned points. We studied all official processes in the subordinate departments of the Vice-chancellor's Office for Research Affairs in Azad University, Science & Research Campus and that of North Tehran Branch. Through job skills questionnaires and interviews, the related data was collected From Science and Research Campus, compared to the similar data collected from the North Tehran branch.

Finally, using UML (Unified Modeling Language) in modeling processes helped draw the curve of procedures and activities of each work process and thus the shortcomings of each process and the capabilities of the staff were identified. By using this framework universities can identify the educational needs of the staff working in different sections, and can remove existing problems through developing processes, reengineering them, and teaching the staff the required skills. Thus they can prepare an integrated system. Reducing the time required for the processes, providing decision making opportunities, planning and performance, in addition to cutting the expenses and productivity are among its advanteges.

A music similarity measure system based on the instrumentation information is proposed in this paper. We combine our previous instrumentation analysis algorithm with a newly designed similarity measure system, which aims at comparing songs solely on their instrumentation content. Several midlevel features are designed and integrated along with the existing low-level feature MFCCs. The weighted distance is then applied to rank the similarity of songs in pair inside the music database. We evaluate its performance by ten-fold cross validation on a Western classical music database. The objective test shows the incorporation of new mid-level features can increase the correctness of the composer classification task by approximately 10%.

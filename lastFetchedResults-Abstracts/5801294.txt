Aiming at inherent fuzzy and uncertainty in HoQ, rough set theory with its basic principles was introduced. Rough number was proposed for the impersonal importance rating of customer requirements. The calculation of the relationship measure between customer requirements and technical characteristics, self-correlation of technical characteristics were transformed into the importance calculation of condition attributes in decision system, according to the definition of condition entropy and mutual information, an improved algorithm of attributes importance was proposed for enhance their accuracy. An integer-programming model was constructed and solved with objective to minimal deviation variable between decision and object value of usable resource for optimization configuration of technical characters. Sequentially the mapping from customer requirements to technical characters was realized. Finally, verification results by a thrust bearing design case show that the proposed method is feasible and effective.

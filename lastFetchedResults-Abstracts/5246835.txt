FEC is an error control method that can be used to augment or replace other methods for reliable data transmission. Such schemes inevitably add a constant overhead in the transmitted data. However, they are so simple as to meet a prime objective for UMTS multicast services, that is scalability to applications with thousands of receivers. This is the reason that 3GPP recommends the use of FEC for MBMS framework. In this paper, we use a probabilistic model for the multicast user distribution in the network and we define a scheme for multicast data delivery that combines FEC with traditional ARQ. It is important that our analysis is compliant with the 3GPP specifications and considers the latest advances in mobile networks. In this framework we investigate the impact of FEC use, we examine whether it is beneficial, how the optimal FEC code dimensioning varies based on the network conditions, which parameters affect the optimal FEC code selection, and how they do it.

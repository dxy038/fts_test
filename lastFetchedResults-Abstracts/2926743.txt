A new algorithm called HLVQ (Hybrid Learning Vector Quantization) is developed in this study. This algorithm is based on the combined use of the unsupervised learning algorithm of the self-organizing feature map, and a modified version of the LVQ2 supervised learning algorithm. The main objective is to obtain a classifier preserving topology mapping and performing as well as the LVQ2 classifier

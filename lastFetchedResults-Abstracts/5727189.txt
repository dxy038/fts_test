This work investigates a fundamentally novel interweave cognitive radio network where the primary transmitter takes a proactive approach towards improving the accuracy of the spectrum sensing outcomes at the secondary users (SUs). For the single-primary-receiver scenario considered here, the multi-antenna primary user constructs its transmit beamforming vector so as to increase the detection probability at the SUs while meeting a desired Quality-of-Service (QoS) target on its own link, by exploiting partial channel state information of the SUs. The objective of such a proactive approach, which we refer to as prescient precoding, is to minimize the probability of interference from SUs at the primary receiver due to imperfect spectrum sensing in fading channels. Numerical results are presented to verify the advantages of the proposed prescient transmission techniques for non-cooperative spectrum sensing scenarios.

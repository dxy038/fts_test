Using a simple multicomponent diffusion model an estimate can be made for the degree of degassing for various times and temperatures. The model enables parametric prediction of the impact of insulation thickness and temperature on a characteristic diffusion time to achieve a targeted degree of degassing. A protocol has also been established which enables the quantification of the byproduct level within manufactured cables. The model results are compared to the results obtained from typical degassing processes. The results suggest that a significant amount of byproducts remain in within cables after ambient degassing for up to one week. Alternate compositions have been developed with an objective to reduce the crosslinking byproducts and thereby reduced the required degassing time. Based upon the diffusion model a 50% reduction in degassing time was expected with the alternative compositions. The alternative composition was utilized for cable extrusion and the byproducts were measured and compared to that of a standard crosslinked polyethylene cable. The results are consistent with the expectation that the alternate composition can deliver a 50% reduction in degassing time, while also delivering an acceptable degree of crosslinking and acceptably low dielectric loss.

In order to solve multi-body elastic contact problem, condensation boundary element method is used in this paper. Taking three bodies elastic contact without friction for example, the theory of elastic contact boundary element method is given, the boundary integral equations and the discrete boundary integral equations are established and the process of condensation solution is illustrated. An example is given to show the effectiveness and high accuracy of boundary element method.

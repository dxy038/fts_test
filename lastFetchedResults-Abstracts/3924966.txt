Results from an experiment that applied one class of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) waveform techniques to over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) are reported. The experiment objective was to demonstrate that adaptive transmitter beamforming could be used in an appropriately design radar to reject spatially discrete Doppler-spread clutter. In the particular MIMO radar architecture that the authors call non-causal transmit beamforming, conventional or adaptive transmitter beamforming occurs following waveform transmission, propagation, scatter from targets and clutter sources, return propagation and finally signal reception. In the case reported herein spatially discrete clutter was successfully rejected to the noise floor of the radar return with rejection in excess of 35 dB achieved using common adaptive algorithms and straightforward training data selection. As part of the rejection algorithm the transmitted waveform direction-of-departure (DOD) from the transmitter array to the target was estimated and used as the preserved steer direction in the adaptive beamformer. The DOD estimates agree well with the geometrically determined true values. The demonstration of non-causal transmit beamforming suggests that it will be possible to create multiple simultaneous adaptive range-dependent transmitter beams with an appropriately designed OTHR. This has several applications including for the mitigation of Doppler-spread clutter.

With the objective of locating and identifying people with dementia inside a building, relevant locating systems are reviewed from the interaction, in the form of energy they use, with the indoors environment. Two systems are proposed for the application: one measures the time of flight (TOF) of radiofrequency and the other measures the TOF of ultrasound. Both systems measure in transient conditions. Specific difficulties of each approach are discussed. Simulation results that are in concordance with laboratory measurements are shown

This work is the extension of previous work dedicated to pure fluids. The
same method is extended to the representation of thermodynamic properties
of a mixture through a fundamental equation of state in terms of the Helmholtz
energy. The proposed technique exploits the extended correspondingstates
concept of distorting the independent variables of a dedicated equation
of state for a reference fluid using suitable scale factor functions to adapt
the equation to experimental data of a target system. An existing equation
of state for the target mixture is used instead of an equation for the reference
fluid, completely avoiding the need for a reference fluid. In particular,
a Soave–Redlich–Kwong cubic equation with van der Waals mixing rules is
chosen. The scale factors, which are functions of temperature, density, and
mole fraction of the target mixture, are expressed in the form of a multilayer
feedforward neural network, whose coefficients are regressed by minimizing
a suitable objective function involving different kinds of mixture thermodynamic
data. As a preliminary test, the model is applied to five binary and
two ternary haloalkane mixtures, using data generated from existing dedicated
equations of state for the selected mixtures. The results show that the method
is robust and straightforward for the effective development of a mixturespecific
equation of state directly from experimental data

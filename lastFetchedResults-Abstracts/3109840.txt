Most control system design problems involve making tradeoffs among competing objectives. In this paper we consider the control system synthesis problem that arises when the objective is to find a controller such that seveal closed loop transfer functions are small in an appropriate sense. To be more precise, given a linear-time invariant plant, the objective is to find all stabilizing compensators that are noninferior (or Pareto-optimal) with respect to a vector-valued H<inf>2</inf> performance criterion. It is shown that this multiple criteria Optimization problem can be reduced to a simultaneous model matching problem in a Hilbert space. Moreover, state-space formulas are given to solve this model matching problem. We also show that in some particular cases non-inferior controllers have the same order as that of the given plant, and in these cases the above state-space formulae can be further simplified.

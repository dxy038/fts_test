This paper addresses the energy absorption responses and crashworthiness optimization of thin-walled oblong tubes under quasi-static lateral loading. The oblong tubes were experimentally compressed using three various forms of indenters named as the flat plate, cylindrical and a point load indenter. The oblong tubes were subjected to inclined and vertical constraints to increase the energy absorption capacity of these structures. The variation in responses due to these indenters and external constraints were demonstrated. Various indicators which describe the effectiveness of energy absorbing systems were used as a marker to compare the various systems. It was found that unconstrained oblong tube (FIU) exhibited an almost ideal response when a flat plate indenter was used. The design information for such oblong tubes as energy absorbers can be generated through performing parametric study. To this end, the response surface methodology (RSM) for the design of experiments (DOE) was employed along with finite element modeling (FEM) to explore the effects of geometrical parameters on the responses of oblong tubes and to construct models for the specific energy absorption capacity (SEA) and collapse load (F) as functions of geometrical parameters. The FE model of the oblong tube was constructed and experimentally calibrated. In addition, based on the developed models of the SEA and F, multi-objective optimization design (MOD) of the oblong tube system is carried out by adopting a desirability approach to achieve maximum SEA capacity and minimum F. It is found that the optimal design of FIU can be achieved if the tube diameter and tube width are set at their minimum limits and the maximum tube thickness is chosen.

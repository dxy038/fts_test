This work presents the design, implementation and tests of an energy conversion system, formed by a Buck converter and a bidirectional DC-DC converter. The system is able to obtain the maximum power from a photovoltaic solar module, using an MPPT algorithm. Besides, the system is capable of, obtaining, storing and delivering energy in an isolated way or interconnected to a DC bus, as defined by the user. This paper also presents the system simulation, as well as its implementation and experimental tests.

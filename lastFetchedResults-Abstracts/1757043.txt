Infection of humans with Leishmania braziliensis typically results in localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL). Rarely, after months or years of apparent clinical cure, some patients develop the destructive mucosal leishmaniasis (ML). ML results from L. braziliensis dissemination, probably via phagocytic cells. As the preferred cells for Leishmania spp. colonization, macrophages are critical to infection control, and may contribute to parasite dissemination. However, the host factors that determine this outcome are unknown. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is known to be important for immune cell migration, macrophage recruitment, and effective granuloma formation. Moreover, MMP-9 has been involved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis dissemination. Here, we demonstrate that in vitro infection of human macrophages with L. braziliensis increased the secretion and activation of MMP-9. We also demonstrate that macrophages from healthy cured individuals with previous history of ML had increased MMP-9 activity compared to LCL cured individuals. These findings may represent a fundamental difference in host innate immunity that could contribute to the clinical leishmaniasis presentation.

The explosive growth of mobile communications coupled with the recent findings regarding the health and environmental hazards gives rise to a compelling case to reduce the electromagnetic pollution (EMP). While the harmful effects of EMP have been widely reported, there appears to be no objective measure to quantify EMP from the mobile communications perspective. Such an objective measure is a prerequisite to model, measure, monitor and manage EMP. In this paper, an attempt is made to define EMP in mobile communications and propose electromagnetic pollution index (EPI) as the product of normalized polluted area and polluting energy in a cell. Assuming free space propagation and isotropic antennas, a model for EPI is developed and relationships are derived to understand the fundamental factors contributing to EPI. To illustrate the use of EPI, an example is presented along with insights into managing EMP. Suggestions are made regarding the scope for further work in extending the model and multi-disciplinary research in EMP. As managing EMP is emerging as an important aspect of preserving our biosphere, this paper serves the need for a first step towards ´True´ Green Mobile Communications.

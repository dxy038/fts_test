The performances of four different configurations implementing bidirectional communication systems with erbium-doped fiber optical amplifiers in a 622-Mb/s IM/DD system are compared. The transmission span and the tolerance to variation in link attenuations (attenuation margin) are studied as a function of the amplifiersÂ´ position in the link. Operating the amplifiers slightly into saturation (0.4 dB) turns the configurations robust with respect to changes in link attenuations (4.0-dB improvement in the tolerable increase of attenuation, for a span of 76.9 dB).&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

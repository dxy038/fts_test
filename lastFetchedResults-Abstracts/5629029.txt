Sparse representations of signals have been used in many areas of signal and image processing. It has also played an important role in compressive sensing algorithms since it performs well in sparse signals. A sparse representation is one in which small number of coefficients contain large proportion of the energy. Sparsity is important also in speech compression and coding, where the signal can be compressed in pre-processing stages. It leads to efficient and robust methods for compression, detection denoising and signal separation. The objective of this paper is to evaluate several transforms which is used to sparsify the speech signals. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) will be compared and evaluated based on Gini Index. Sparsity properties and measures will be reviewed in this paper. Finally, sparse applications in speech compression and compressive sensing will be discussed.

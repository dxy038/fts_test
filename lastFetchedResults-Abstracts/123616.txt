BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: About 3-5% of Iranian general population are carriers of hepatitis B virus and about 15% of infected persons will be prone to chronic hepatitis and get cirrhosis and primary liver carcinoma. Up to now no therapeutic regimen has been introduced to eradicate completely this infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate immunity status of health care staff of Amirkola children hospital.
METHODS: This cross- sectional study was performed on 153 health care personnel of Amirkola children hospital (Babol). At first, a questionnaire included information about the time and number of vaccination was completed_ Anti-HBC, Anti-HBS and HBSAg were examined by Radim (EL1SA method).
FINDINGS: From 150 subjects, 132 (88%) of them were vaccinated against hepatitis B and 18(12%) had no positive history of vaccination. Also, 6 cases were excluded due to their Anti-HBC positive results. The mean age of studied cases was 28.5+8.3 years. On avarage, 3.8+2 dosage of vaccine was received by subjects. The time interval after the last vaccination was 3.9 -1.98 years With consideration of Anti-HBS= 10 mlulml as a cut- off value, 68.6% of subjects were immunized against hepatitis B and the mean titer of Anti-HBS was 263.9.E 391.3 mlulml.
CONCLUSION: According to the results and decrease of immunity in 31.4% of health care personnel who were vaccinated against hepatitis B, it is suggested Anti-HBS titer should be examined 2-3 months after vaccination and Anti-IIBS titer in immunized patients be controlled every 5-7 years and then booster vaccine be injected after reducing Anti-HBS titer to below protective level.

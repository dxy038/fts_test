In the early design phase, padring design is one of the critical elements in design planning. The result from padring design not only will impact packaging, board level design, power integrity and signal integrity result, but also the overall product cost .In the past, padring design is often done through separate standalone tool like Orbit IO or internal excel estimation spreadsheet. The objective of this paper is to share the unified padring design methodology where single design database is referenced hence padring design will always be in sync with fullchip backend database. Unified padring flow allows consistent cross functional review reference point as well as better controllability for core and padring design integration. Hopefully the methodology proposed will benefit the padring designers in floorplanning and product cost estimation through unified padring flow.

A novel centroid-based pulse-width-modulation (PWM) switching strategy is proposed which is suitable for full-bridge inverter applications. This method is evaluated, and its performance is compared with existing PWM switching strategies. The performance evaluation and comparison are based on the total harmonic distortion (THD) and number of pulses per cycle of the inverter output waveform. The objective of the new switching strategy is to minimize both the THD and low-order harmonics. Simulation results show that this technique yields a significant improvement in performance. In addition, a hybrid switching sequence is developed for the proposed scheme, which can lead to further reduction in switching losses

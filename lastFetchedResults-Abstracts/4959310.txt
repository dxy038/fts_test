In this paper, we discuss the product selection problem of the information security projects under the conditions of existing cooperatively in the security products. We introduce the conception of system cooperative safety coefficient, establish the multi-objective optimization model which maximize the total coordination performance-price ratio, the total relatively cooperative performance-price ratio and the system safety income. This model can be better suitable and reasonable for the Plan and construction of the information security projects. In the paper , the model parameter determination method and solution method are also put forward.

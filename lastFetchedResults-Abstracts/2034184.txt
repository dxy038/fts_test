A comprehensive knowledge on the relationship between soil salinity and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is vital for a deeper understanding of ecosystem functioning under salt stress conditions. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of soil salinity on AMF root colonization, spore count, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) and community structure in Saemangeum reclaimed land, South Korea. Soil samples were collected and grouped into five distinct salt classes based on the electrical conductivity of soil saturation extracts (ECse). Mycorrhizal root colonization, spore count and GRSP were measured under different salinity levels. AMF community structure was studied through three complementary methods; spore morphology, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Results revealed that root colonization (P &lt; 0.01), spore count (P &lt; 0.01) and GRSP (P &lt; 0.01) were affected negatively by soil salinity. Spore morphology and T-RFLP data showed predominance of AMF genus Glomus in Saemangeum reclaimed land. T-RFLP and DGGE analysis revealed significant changes in diversity indices between non (ECse &lt; 2 dS/m) and extremely (ECse &gt; 16 dS/m) saline soil and confirmed dominance of Glomus caledonium only in soils with ECse &lt; 8 dS/m. However, ribotypes of Glomus mosseae and Glomus proliferum were ubiquitous in all salt classes. Combining spore morphology, T-RFLP and DGGE analysis, we could show a pronounced effect in AMF community across salt classes. The result of this study improve our understanding on AMF activity and dominant species present in different salt classes and will substantially expand our knowledge on AMF diversity in reclaimed lands.

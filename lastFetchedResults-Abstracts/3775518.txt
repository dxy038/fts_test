This paper proposes an integrated zero voltage transition (ZVT) auxiliary commutation circuit applied to a universal input ac/dc system with a bidirectional converter for dc bus and battery bank interface. With the bidirectional converter it is possible to reduce the cost of the battery bank and virtually eliminate both low and high frequency current ripple in the batteries. An integrated ZVT auxiliary commutation circuit has been included to the system to achieve ZVT commutation at the main switches in all operation modes. In addition, this auxiliary commutation circuit controls the di/dt of the resonant process, allowing the utilization of slow diodes [intrinsic diodes of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs)] in the bidirectional converter and, therefore, reducing the overall system cost. Integrated commutation circuit is based on a new concept in which the energy involved in one or more commutation processes is utilized to assist another commutation processes. Moreover, a control system has been developed and analyzed for the correct operation of the proposed system. Experimental results based on a 580-W prototype are presented to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed system.

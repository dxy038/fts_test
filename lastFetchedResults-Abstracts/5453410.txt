This paper presents Alembik, a framework for the transcoding of multimedia content. Alembik has been designed to adapt and transform image, audio and video files in a mobile Web environment. This objective is achieved through a collection of tags defined by the framework. Developers exploit the collection of tags to integrate and adapt multimedia information to the applications needs, as well as to the features of the mobile devices requiring the information. In this paper, attention is focused on the types of the defined tags and their runtime exploitation for multimedia content adaptation.

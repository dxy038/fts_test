The initial objective of this project was to directly couple the RAMONA and TRAC codes running on different PCs. The idea was to use the best part of each one and eliminate some of their limitations and widen the applicability of these codes to simulate different BWR and system components. It was required to try to minimize the amount of changes to present code subroutines and calculation procedures. If possible, just substitute values obtained in the parallel code. Preliminary results indicated that using a CHAN component of TRAC to model thermal-hydraulic phenomena for each

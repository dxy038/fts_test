The objective this study was to compare the official EU liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) method with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for the analysis of compounds migrating from cross-linked polyethylene into water. A medium polarity polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) 65 μm fibre proved most efficient for the SPME extraction of nine test compounds and the optimum extraction conditions were an immersion time of 30 min with heating to 60 °C. The repeatability of the SPME method was variable: RSD values ranged from approximately 4–18% depending on the individual compound, though correlation coefficients were greater than 0.999 in the concentration range 0.5–1000 μg/l. It would also seem that there is some competition amongst different compounds for sites on the fibre and this is a potential drawback of SPME when applied to unknown samples. However, when applied to water samples in contact with polyethylene, SPME proved to be immensely more sensitive and to have a greater extraction range than LLE. These factors coupled with the rapidity and ease of use of SPME mean that it could be developed for use as an alternative to the existing official method or as an alert system in the routine analysis of materials used to transport domestic water.

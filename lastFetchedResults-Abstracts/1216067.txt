Considering the multivariable, strong-coupled, and nonlinear features of tandem cold rolling mill, a mathematical model of multi-objective optimization was built to facilitate the design of new systems aiming at equating the relative load, preventing slip, and obtaining best shape. BP (back propagation) neural network based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used for predicting the rolling force. The multi-objective fuzzy theory and method were introduced during the optimization. With an example of 1370 mm tandem cold rolling mill, the rolling schedule of the common rolling, the single-objective optimization design, and the multi-objective fuzzy optimization design were compared with each other. The results generated from the case study showed that the proposed approach could significantly decreased the values of three objective functions simultaneously and the performance of the optimal rolling schedule was satisfactory and promising. Moreover, the capability and usefulness of fuzzy application in tandem cold rolling schedule were clearly demonstrated.

With the development of science and technology, many areas become more and more urgent need for microsystems, thus the micro-mechanical technology which is famous for its small shapes and sizes is becoming a high-tech by which people can understand and transform the objective world from the micro perspective. Micro stereovision via SLM is applied to the 3D shape reconstruction of microstructures. The model development for micro vision via SLM is discussed, and a vision model that describes the projection between 2D image space and 3D object space is derived. A pair of optical paths of SLM is denoted by a group of basic points and basic planes, and then two models of micro stereovision with SLM are derived via the geometrical projection of virtual incident rays and the weak nonlinear phenomenon. At last, experiments are given for 3D shape reconstruction of microstructures in this model. In this paper, we introduced a new reconstruction method stripes projection supporting. Under the support of stripes projection, we can find more accurate matching point, so we can get more accurate reconstruction.

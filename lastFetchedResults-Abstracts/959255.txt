Wood samples treated with ammonium copper quat (ACQ 1900 and ACQ 2200), chromated copper arsenate (CCA), Tanalith
E 3491 and Wolmanit CX-8 have been studied in accelerated weathering experiments. The weathering experiment was
performed by cycles of 2 h UV-light irradiation followed by water spray for 18 min. The changes on the surface of the weathered
samples were characterized by roughness and color measurements on the samples with 0, 200, 400 and 600 h of total weathering.
The objective of this study was to investigate the changes created by weathering on impregnated wood with several different
wood preservatives. This study was performed on the accelerated weathering test cycle, using UVirradiation and water spray in
order to simulate natural weathering.
Surface roughness and color measurement was used to investigate the changes after several intervals (0–200–400–600 h) in
artificial weathering of treated and untreated wood.

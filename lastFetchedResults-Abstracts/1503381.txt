Damage detection and estimation in structures using incomplete static
responses are presented in this study. In the proposed approach, damage location and
severity is determined by solving an optimization problem using a pattern search algorithm.
Therefore, an objective function is formulated using incomplete static responses. Because
of limitations in using sensors and diculties in sensing all degrees of freedom, the eect of
using incomplete responses has been evaluated. The performance of the proposed method
was evaluated using three numerical examples, namely, a simply supported beam, a threestory
plane frame, and a plane bridge with and without noise in measured displacement
and containing one or several damages. The results indicate that the proposed method is
eective and robust in the detection and estimation of damage in spite of the incomplete
responses.

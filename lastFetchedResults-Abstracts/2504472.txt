Yoga which is used as an adjunct treatment for bronchial asthma is gaining popularity throughout the world. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of yoga on quality of life in patients with bronchial asthma. 120 non-smoking male and female patients of asthma in the age group of 17-50 years were randomized into two groups i.e. Group A (Yoga group) and Group B (control group). All patients remained on their prescribed medication, but Group A patients practiced yoga breathing exercises for 8 weeks. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and diary record was used to assess quality of life, number and severity of asthmatic attacks, and the dosage of the medication required at baseline and after 8 weeks. Group A subjects showed a statistically significant improvement in "symptoms", "activities" and "environmental" domains of AQLQ at 8 weeks (p<0.01) and significant reduction in daily number and severity of attacks, and the dosage of medication required at 4 and 8 weeks (p<0.01) compared to the baseline. Yoga breathing exercises used adjunctively with standard pharmacological treatment significantly improved quality of life in patients with bronchial asthma.

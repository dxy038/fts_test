Earlier studies on lactate-mediated colour stability in beef did not address the possible influence on cooked colour. Our objective was to examine the effect of lactate-enhancement, muscle source, and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on the internal cooked colour of beef steaks. Longissimus lumborum (LL) and Psoas major (PM) muscles from 16 (n = 16) beef carcasses (USDA Select) were randomly assigned to 4 enhancement treatments (non-injected control, distilled water-enhanced control, 1.25% and 2.5% lactate), and fabricated into 2.54-cm steaks. Steaks were individually packaged in either vacuum (VP), high-oxygen MAP (HIOX; 80% O2 + 20% CO2), or carbon monoxide MAP (CO; 0.4% CO + 19.6% CO2 + 80% N2), and stored for 0, 5, or 9 days at 1 °C. At the end of storage, surface and internal colour (visual and instrumental) was measured on raw steaks. Steaks were cooked to an internal temperature of 71 °C, and internal cooked colour (visual and instrumental) was evaluated. Lactate-enhancement at 2.5% level resulted in darker (P &lt; 0.05) cooked interiors than other treatments. Interior cooked redness decreased (P &lt; 0.05) during storage for steaks in VP and HIOX, whereas it was stable for steaks in CO. Our findings indicated that the beef industry could utilise a combination of lactate-enhancement and CO MAP to minimise premature browning in whole-muscle beef steaks.

Objective: This study was conducted to investigate the frequency and type of ovarian tumors amongst patients who underwent surgery for ovarian cyst diagnosed on ultrasound and also to compare a change in pattern of type of tumors between 2002 and 2009. Study Design: Comparative,Observational study. Setting & Duration: This study was carried out in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology Foundation University Medical College, Fauji Foundation hospital Rawalpindi that is a tertiary care hospital, from 1" June 2002 to 31" May 2003 (Study period 1, n=90) and from 1" November 2008 to 31" October 2009 (Study period 2, n=93). All the patients who had ovarian cysts larger than five centimetres in size diagnosed on ultrasonography and planned for surgery were included in the study. All the relevant details were entered in proformas. Histopathology of excision biopsies was analysed. Results: The overall incidence of ovarian tumors was 7.1% and 5.4% with a rate of malignancy 18% and 5.4% in period 1 and 2 respectively which was statistically non significant (p>0.05). The most common malignant tumour was serous cyst adenocarcinoma during both study periods. The most common benign tumor was simple follicular cyst 25% during study period one and serous cyst adenoma 23% during period 2. Conclusion: The frequency and patterns of ovarian tumors has remained unchanged between 2002 and 2009.

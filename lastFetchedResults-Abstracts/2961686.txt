Robust vector quantization of LSF parameters at a low bit rate is essential for voice coders operating below 5 Kbps. A novel aspect of the proposed technique is the use of decorrelated residual LSF vectors from speech mode based backward prediction along with a multi-stage VQ design. Rates as low as 12 bits per 20 ms speech frame for the stationary voiced speech mode and 22 bits/frame for unvoiced and non-stationary voiced frames are shown to result in efficient quantization. In our classification scheme, spectrally stationary voiced frames constitute around 30% of active speech frames resulting in a minimum average bit rate of 19 bits/frame. The objective VQ performance is compared with cellular standard coders such as the IS-641 and IS-127. The proposed VQ has been integrated into a speech mode based 4.8 Kbps coder resulting in subjective performance close to that of the 7.4 Kbps IS-641 coder

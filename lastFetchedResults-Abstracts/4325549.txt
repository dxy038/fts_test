The potential and existing problem of local water resources development can be directly reflected by the quantification of water resources carrying capacity evaluation index according to the mutual inverse and interactive relationship between optimal allocation of water resources and water resources carrying capacity evaluation. This paper established a multi-objective optimal allocation model through analyzing the characteristics of water resources, calculated regional water resources carrying capacity on this base, applied this method in the evaluation of groundwater resources carrying capacity of 2020 of Baojixia irrigation area in Shaanxi province. The results show that the concept of this method is clear, and this method has very strong practicality and operability, it can provide scientific guiding for sustainable development and utilization of regional water resources.

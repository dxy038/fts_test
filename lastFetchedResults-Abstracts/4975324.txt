Service consumer ranking are used by many existing computing models for reputation. Although a variety of methods are proposed, the subjectivity and scarcity of service consumer ranking can hardly be overcome. Moreover, service consumers cannot find service providers with high reputations as well as satisfying their QoS constraints. In order to solve these problems, we proposed an extensible computing model which uses objective and automatic feedbacks to evaluate reputation with the support of measurable QoS constrains. As a typical QoS constraint, performance is discussed in detail. We also talked about invocation fraud issue and presented some general ideas to solve this problem.

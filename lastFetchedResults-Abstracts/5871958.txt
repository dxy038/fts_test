Bidirectional optical cross connects (BOXCs) using a fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and optical circulators (OCs) have been considered for bidirectional WDM ring networks. Theoretical analysis is carried out to evaluate the performance of a bidirectional optical cross connects (BOXCs) in a wave length division multiplexing (WDM) transmission system in the presence of homodyne crosstalk due to fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs). We analyzed here two configurations of FBG-based bidirectional optical cross connects: 2&#195;&#151;2 BOXC and 4&#195;&#151;4 BOXC for bidirectional WDM ring networks and evaluate the bit-error-rate (BER) and power penalty (PP) of these configurations. It is found that the bit-error-rate and power penalty, due to linear homodyne crosstalk induced by fiber Bragg gratings, both are increased with the number of wavelength channels increased for both bar and cross state of BOXCs. BER and power penalty are not affected with the position of the wavelength channels in the bar state while in the cross state, if the position of the wavelength channels is increased, the BER and power penalty both are increased.

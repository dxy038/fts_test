Objective
mine the evidential basis underpinning the monitoring of skin temperature and core-peripheral temperature gradient as elements of hemodynamic assessment in critically ill and adult cardiac surgical patients.
s
-six studies examining the efficacy of skin temperature or temperature gradient as markers of hemodynamic status were selected as part of an integrative review.
s
ce pertaining to the efficacy of these parameters as markers of cardiac function is equivocal and has not been well appraised in the adult cardiac surgical population. Skin temperature and systemic vascular resistance are also affected by factors other than cardiac output.
sions
emperature and core-peripheral temperature gradient should not be considered in isolation from other hemodynamic parameters when assessing cardiac status until they are validated by further large-scale prospective studies.

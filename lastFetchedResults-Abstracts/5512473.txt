This article identifies a possible evolutionary path for IN service logic. The starting point is the range of UNIX-based IN platforms in operation today. A step-by-step progression is defined towards fully distributed object-oriented service logic capable of supporting more personalized and more complex services. The objective of the evolution is integration with medium- to long-term architectures like TINA and UMTS

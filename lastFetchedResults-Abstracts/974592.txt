The objective of the present study is to preliminarily explore the effect of surface chemistry modification of Ti6Al4V with a fluorine-contained copolymer thin film on the cellular behavior of osteoblasts. A fluorine-contained random copolymer thin film was fabricated on Ti6Al4V substrate, and then characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle meter and surface profiler. The results showed that the surface modification of Ti6Al4V alloy could simultaneously transform the surface chemical constitution and reduce the surface energy evidently. However, the surface morphology and roughness of the Ti6Al4V substrate were hardly changed after the modification. By immersion process with simulated body fluid (SBF) and then by in vitro cytotoxicity test with MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, the fluorine-contained copolymer thin film exhibited desirable stability and admirable cytocompatibility. In conclusion, the fluorine-contained copolymer thin film could be easily applied in modifying various solid surfaces, and the as-fabricated film also has potential applications in biomedical field.

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> This study sought to assess the attitude of Healthcare Providers towards providing contraceptives for unmarried adolescents in four Local Government Areas in Ibadan, Nigeria.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong>A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 490 Healthcare Providers in 24 randomly selected healthcare facilities using self-administered, pre-tested questionnaires.<strong><br />Results: </strong>More than half (57.5%) of the respondents perceived the provision of contraceptives for unmarried adolescents as promoting sexual promiscuity. The attitude of 42.7% of them was informed by the Nigerian culture which does not support premarital sex. About half (51.7%), reported that unmarried adolescents should be asked to abstain from sex rather than providing them with contraceptives. Over a third (44.2%) reported that providers should not provide services for both married and unmarried adolescents<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong>Many healthcare providers have unfavourable attitudes towards the provision of contraceptives for unmarried adolescents. There is a need for further training of Healthcare Providers to address this situation.</p>

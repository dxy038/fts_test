It was found that when electrolessly deposited thin Pd and Pd–Cu membranes were exposed to air at temperatures above
350 8C, their H2 flux increased substantially immediately after the air exposure, then decreased to a new steady-state value.
While this was a quasi-reversible change for the H2 flux, the flux of insoluble species, such as N2, irreversibly increased with
every air exposure but by a much smaller extent. The extent of these changes was found to be dependent on the exposure time and
the temperature of the tests. Thus, we decided to investigate the effect of gas exposures on the properties of these materials.
Palladium and palladium–copper films, prepared by electroless deposition on ceramic supports, and commercial foils were
exposed to air, hydrogen and helium at 500 and 900 8C for times varying from 1 h to 1 week with the objective of determining the
effect of the different exposure conditions on the surface morphology, the flux of different penetrants and the crystalline structure
of the materials. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to study the changes occurring in the
films under those conditions.
It was observed that the exposure of both the electroless films and the foils to hydrogen and air markedly modified their surface
morphology. The hydrogen exposure tended to smooth the surface features whereas the oxygen exposure created new surface
features such holes and large peaks. Additionally it was found that the air exposure produced some oxidation of the film to create
PdO.
These results suggested that a common hypothesis stating that air oxidation just cleans the surface of the membrane might not
be sufficient to explain all of those changes. A contributing effect of air exposure may be the increase in surface area due to the
formation of palladium oxide. However, the extent of the surface area increase was insufficient to explain the increase in steadystate
H2 flux

Pulse field magnetization (PFM) is viewed as an appropriate method to provide a strong trapped field in a superconductor. However, a large amount of heat is generated because of dynamic motion of magnetic flux during PFM, which will affect the trapped field and the corresponding magnetic force properties. In this paper, an electromagnetic simulation of the PFM coupling with heat transfer is conducted. The time evolution and the spatial distribution of the temperature and induced current in the superconductor are studied. The magnetic force between the magnetized bulk and an electromagnet is also simulated to show the influence of the PFM on the application of the bulk into a superconducting interface module. The simulation suggests that the initial temperature of the bulk has an important influence on the current density and heat distribution in the magnetized bulk. In addition, with the objective of a stable mechanism for docking and self-assembly of space module systems, the effect of pulse field magnitude and the temperature fluctuation on the interaction force characteristics are also analyzed and discussed.

The authors deal with mode and parameter-dependent robust mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub>filtering design for a class of discrete-time switched polytopic linear systems. The objective is to design a homogeneous switched mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>infin</sub> filter guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the resulting filtering error systems with given performance measures. Based on a switched parameter-dependent Lyapunov function combined with FinslerÂ´s lemma, some novel conditions for robust H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>infin</sub> H performance analysis are proposed and in turn the filter synthesis is developed. It is shown that by using a new linearisation technique combined with a bounding approach, the filter gains can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed approach.

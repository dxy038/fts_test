<p><strong>Objective: </strong>The aim of this study was to better understand the triggers of suicide, particularly among the ‎ancient Greek and Persian soldiers and commanders.‎<br /><strong>Method:</strong> ‎‘Herodotus: The Histories’ is a history of the rulers and soldiery who participated in the ‎Greco-Persian wars (492-449 BCE). A new translation (2013) of this manuscript was studied. ‎Accounts of suicide were collected and collated, with descriptions of circumstances, ‎methods, and probable triggers.‎<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Nine accounts of suicide were identified. Eight of these were named individuals (4 Greeks ‎and 4 Persians); of whom, seven were male. Only one (not the female) appeared to act in ‎response to a mental disorder. Other triggers of suicide included guilt, avoidance of ‎dishonour/ punishment and altruism. Cutting/ stabbing was the most common method; others ‎included hanging, jumping, poison, and burning (the single female).‎<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: While soldiers at a time of war do not reflect the general community, they are nevertheless ‎members of their society. Thus, this evidence demonstrates that suicide triggered by ‎burdensome circumstances (in addition to mental disorder) was known to the Greek and ‎Persian people more than two millennia ago.‎</p>

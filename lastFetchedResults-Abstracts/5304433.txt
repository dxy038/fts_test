The problem of water resources sharing is dealt with in this paper. In the solution of such a problem, water quality constraints have to be taken properly into account, as a considerable reduction of the flow in a river may seriously compromise the surviving of the river ecological system, especially in presence of polluting discharges of sewerage water. The water resources sharing problem may be considered within two different decisional frameworks. In the first one, a planning problem is stated and solved, which corresponds to fixing the set points for the second decisional framework, which is an online management problem. The latter problem has the objective of keeping the systemÂ´s behaviour close to the nominal one which has been determined via the solution of the planning problem. In other words, online management policies react to deviations from the nominal system behaviour and are based on freshly acquired information about the system.

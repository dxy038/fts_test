The main focus of this work is on the development of incremental graph-based techniques for satisfying a coupled set of engineering and geometric constraints. The objective is to speed up a constraint-based design. A prototype constraint-based system has been developed to demonstrate the feasibility of these incremental algorithms. The proposed techniques were applied to the internal-combustion engine and the results are presented and discussed

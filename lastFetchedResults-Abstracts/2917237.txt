Describes a method to integrate information systems (IS) design performance evaluation with the IS development process. The nature and cost of an information system is shaped by decisions about where to provide computer support, the hardware platform, and the database management system (DBMS) architecture-decisions influenced largely by how quickly work must be done. A prototype system has been developed which produces simulation results automatically from data flow diagrams (DFDs) augmented with information regarding the performance of system components. The objective is to make the evaluation of IS design dynamics a common and integral part of the development process by producing simulation results directly from computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tool data dictionaries. The prototype reads DFDs from a custom DFD-drawing tool and formulates a corresponding simulation model. The prototype provides model-based expert advice in the use of the simulation model and in the interpretation of its output. The use of the prototype is illustrated through its application to a proposed research clinic information system

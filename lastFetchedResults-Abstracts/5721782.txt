The objective of the automated manufacturing system reconfiguration is to react to failures and thus to engage the required monitoring treatments to restart the AMS as fast as possible. But the control laws run by the control system are often blocked and thus become inadequate. Therefore it is required to reconfigure the control system. This reconfiguration process is based on functions such as detection, diagnostic, prognostic, decision and automatic control laws synthesis. In the context of discrete event systems (DES), this paper focuses on the synchronization of the operating part model after a failure, in order to take decisions and to synthesize new adapted control laws.

Objective The aim of this study was to identify quantitative
data on the use of seclusion and restraint in different
countries and on initiatives to reduce these interventions.
Methods Combined literature review on initiatives to
reduce seclusion and restraint, and epidemiological data on
the frequency and means of use in the 21st century in
different countries. Unpublished study was detected by
contacting authors of conference presentations. Minimum
requirements for the inclusion of data were reporting the
incidence of coercive measures in complete hospital populations
for defined periods and related to defined catchment
areas.
Results There are initiatives to gather data and to develop
new clinical practice in several countries. However, data on
the use of seclusion and restraint are scarcely available so
far. Data fulfilling the inclusion criteria could be detected
from 12 different countries, covering single or multiple
hospitals in most counties and complete national figures for
two countries (Norway, Finland). Both mechanical restraint
and seclusion are forbidden in some countries for ethical
reasons. Available data suggest that there are huge differences
in the percentage of patients subject to and the
duration of coercive interventions between countries.
Conclusions Databases on the use of seclusion and
restraint should be established using comparable key
indicators. Comparisons between countries and different
practices can help to overcome prejudice and improve
clinical practice

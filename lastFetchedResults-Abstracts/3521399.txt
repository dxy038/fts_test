An effective test program for an IC requires the devising of input signals that will exercise a substantial proportion of the internal nodes of the IC, and produce output signals that allow the faulty device to be distinguished from one that is functioning correctly. The Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) is an international consortium with the objective of finding a test solution for PCBs. The use of boundary scan cells for testing is discussed

The objective of this paper is to propose an active power conditioner (APC) with a multi-mode power control strategy for a microgrid. The proposed APC is able to self-control the direction and magnitude of power flow between the dc bus and the AC line in a microgrid. The power control strategy of the proposed APC is characterized into the DC mode and the AC mode. In DC mode, the proposed APC will transfer active power from/to the AC line to regulate the DC bus voltage. On the other hand, the proposed APC will try to stabilize the AC line by delivering active/reactive power from the DC bus to the AC line. The operation principle of the proposed multi-mode power control strategy is introduced. A 5 kVA prototype APC with experimental results are shown to verify the validity of the proposed APC with multi-mode power control strategy.

Multi-objective evaluation of distributed hydrological models enables an analysis of prediction behaviour
of individual sub-systems within a catchment. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate an application of
multi-response, multisite calibration strategy for a distributed hydrological model, so that model limitations
can be identified and subsequently improved. The study was carried out for calibration of flows
from two gauging stations in a 152 km2 catchment in Elbe Basin in Germany. The multi-objective optimisation
tool NSGA-II was used for the calibration of distributed hydrological modelling code WaSiMETH.
A fuzzy set theory based methodology was formulated for selection of preferred solution from
numerous Pareto solutions in four-dimensional space. The methodology consistently led to selection of
the solution which is able to reasonably represent the magnitude and dynamics of streamflow hydrograph.
For a reasonable simulation of water balance in the downstream gauge, overprediction of water
balance in the upstream gauge was necessary. The analysis of precipitationâ€“discharge data and geological
conditions in the river channel support the possibility of flow reduction in the upstream gauge and
increase in the downstream gauge. Due to this limitation in observation data, additional optimisation
runs were carried out by explicitly considering the effect. This led to a significant improvement in the
performance of the model. Therefore, the study provides an effective implementation of the multiobjective
calibration strategy for a distributed hydrological model, which can be used for the analysis of
different catchments using a combination of different objective functions.

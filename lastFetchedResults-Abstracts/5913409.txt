This study aims at evaluation of crashworthiness of rhombus concept car by comparing the response of related parameters in different collision conditions. For this objective the numerical method was used to simulate the dynamic responses of the rhombus concept car in frontal and small overlap collisions. The dynamic response parameters was analyzed and discussed in terms of the invasion quantity of rhombus car, accelerations, and impact force-displacement curves from both front impact and small overlap impact. The results from simulations of rhombus car impacts were compared with the results from simulations of ordinary passenger car. The results of the study demonstrate that: in the case of front impact and small overlap impact, rhombus car has good crashworthiness, which indicated also a good performance in protecting the integrity of its own body structure.

We consider fc-median clustering in finite metric spaces and fc-means clustering in Euclidean spaces, in the setting where k is part of the input (not a constant). For the fc-means problem, Ostrovsky et al. show that if the optimal (k - 1)-means clustering of the input is more expensive than the optimal fc-means clustering by a factor of 1/&#8712;2, then one can achieve a (1 + f(&#8712;))-approximation to the fc-means optimal in time polynomial in n and k by using a variant of Lloyd\Â´s algorithm. In this work we substantially improve this approximation guarantee. We show that given only the condition that the (k - 1)-means optimal is more expensive than the fc-means optimal by a factor 1 + &#945; for some constant &#945; &gt; 0, we can obtain a PTAS. In particular, under this assumption, for any &#8712; &gt; 0 we achieve a (1 + &#8712;)-approximation to the fc-means optimal in time polynomial in n and k, and exponential in 1/e and 1/&#945;. We thus decouple the strength of the assumption from the quality of the approximation ratio. We also give a PTAS for the fc-median problem in finite metrics under the analogous assumption as well. For fc-means, we in addition give a randomized algorithm with improved running time of n<sup>o(1)</sup> (k log n)<sup>poly(1/&#8712;,1/&#945;)</sup> Our technique also obtains a PTAS under the assumption of Balcan et al. that all (1 + &#945;) approximations are &#948;-close to a desired target clustering, in the case that all target clusters have size greater than &#948;n and &#945; &gt; 0 is constant. Note that the motivation of Balcan et al. is that for many clustering problems, the objective function is only a proxy for the true goal of getting close to the target. From this perspective, our improvement is that for fc-means in Euclidean spaces we reduce the distance of the clustering found to the target from O(&#948;) to &#948; when all target clusters are large, and for fc-median we improve- - the "largeness" condition needed in to get exactly &#948;-close from O(&#948;n) to &#948;n. Our results are based on a new notion of clustering stability.

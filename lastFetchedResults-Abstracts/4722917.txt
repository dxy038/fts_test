This paper presents a novel approach for quantifying the security of specific services as well as that of a whole organisation. This is done by reducing the security of any service to five selected security factors which can be measured by posing questions with objective answers. The security of any specific service is the weighted average of those five factors, whereas the overall security is the weighted average of the services.

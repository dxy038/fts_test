A novel four main switches and four auxiliary switches power converter configuration of the three-phase voltage-doubler soft-switching rectifier is proposed in this paper. The reduction in the number of main switches can also increase the reliability because the control circuits and the auxiliary circuits are thereby reduced to two sets. All main switches in the proposed rectifier operate at zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) turn-on. Also, the auxiliary switches operate at zero-current-switching (ZCS) turn-on and turn-off. Furthermore, the proposed rectifier achieves unity power factor, sinusoidal input currents, adjustable output voltage and bidirectional power flow capability. Some experimental results of the proposed soft-switching rectifier are presented for verification.

There has been considerable recent interest on the problem of enhancing degraded speech. This interest is motivated by several factors including a broad set of important applications and the apparent lack of robustness in recent speech compression and recognition systems. One objective of this paper is to provide an overview of various techniques that have been proposed for enhancement of speech. Another objective is to suggest some directions for future research in the speech enhancement problem.

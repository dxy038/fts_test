A hybrid Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm based on the NSGA-II algorithm is presented and evaluated. The local optimization algorithm called SASS has been modified in order to be suitable for multi-objective optimization where the local optimization is intended towards non-dominated points. The modified local optimization algorithm has been incorporated into NSGA-II in order to improve performance.

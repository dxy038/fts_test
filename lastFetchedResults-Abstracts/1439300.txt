Surveying social isolation subject at least at the last century shows that this concept is more related to some sociological dimensions such as Marx’s view, Marx’ alienation concept, the school of mutual interaction and Chicago school. Some writers stress on subjective elements and some others on objective elements. Persons who are socially isolated and have not interaction with others, suffer often from lack of social ability, so they may have not social-cognitive knowledge and do not know how to understand the others’ intentions.

The objective of this study was to apply cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) to measure the dynamic two-dimensional (2D) displacement and Lagrangian strain fields in the biceps brachii muscle. Six healthy volunteers underwent cine DENSE MRI during repeated elbow flexion against the load of gravity. Displacement encoded dynamic images of the upper arm were acquired with spatial and temporal resolutions of 1.9×1.9 mm2 and 30 ms, respectively. Pixel-wise Lagrangian displacement and strain fields were calculated from the measured images. We extracted the first and second principal strains (E1 and E2) along the centerline and anterior regions of the muscle. E1 and E2 were relatively uniform along the anterior region. However, E1 and E2 were both non-uniform along the centerline region–normalized values for E1 and E2 varied over the ranges of 0.27–1.35, and 0.45–2.36, respectively. The directions of the first and second principal strains varied throughout the muscle and showed that the direction of principal shortening is not necessarily aligned with fascicle direction. This study demonstrates the utility of cine DENSE MRI for analyzing skeletal muscle mechanics and provides data describing the in vivo mechanics of muscle tissue to a level of detail that has not been previously possible.

Effect of time delay cannot be ignored because of time delayÂ´s objective existence in a control system and that a nonlinear control system has a rich nonlinear characteristics and complex control strategy. In this paper, a nonlinear high-speed locomotive control system is taken to analyze the effect of time delay on a nonlinear control system. Theoretical studies are focussed on the time delay problem in a nonlinear locomotive system under active control strategy. Simulations are included about the effect of time delay on a nonlinear locomotive system under active control and semi-active on-off control strategy. Further discussion is given on the effect of time delay under different control strategy.

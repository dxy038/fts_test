In this paper, the artificial neural network based multi-objective optimization of twist extrusion process is carried out. The target purpose functions are equivalent plastic strain, strain distribution and extrusion force. The design variables are twistangle, friction factor and loading rate. The FEM model of the process is ?rst created and used to create training cases for the ANN, and the well-trained ANN is used as a quick and exact model of the process. Then theoptimization of the design variables is conducted by an integrated genetic algorithm and ANN modelto create a set of optimal solutions (Pareto front). Leveldiagrams are then used to select the best solution from the Pareto front. Finallythe response surface methodology has been used to study the interaction between the design parameters. The obtained results show thatthe best range of twist angle is from 0.7 to 45 degree, friction factor from 0.65 to 0.7 and loading rate from 6.5 to 7 mm/s. Also variables with the largest effect on the process are twist angle and friction factor.

The main objective of this work is the identification of inorganic pigments with X-ray diffraction analysis in combination with X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF). By using these techniques, differences of specific pigments with identical names but produced by different manufacturers, techniques, or raw materials are revealed. The purity and the chemical compositions of these pigments are tested and the different phases in the diffractograms identified. Measurements with XRF are carried out in order to facilitate the analysis of the diffractograms and to point out differences in the elemental composition of different pigments. The creation of a database of the obtained data and diffractograms is in progress. It will be a collection of the most common and interesting pigments used in art. Furthermore, this database will enable a fast and easy identification of pigments during the restoration and conservation of an object of art.

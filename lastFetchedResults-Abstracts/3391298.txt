We address the problem of "link activation" or "scheduling" in multihop packet radio networks. The objective is to determine a conflict-free schedule of minimum length that satisfies the specified end-to-end communication requirements. It is well known that this problem, in almost all of its forms, is a combinatorial-optimization problem of high complexity. We approach this problem by the use of a Hopfield neural network model in which the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to vary dynamically the values of the coefficients used in the connection weights.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

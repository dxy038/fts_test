The Oceanographic Systems Laboratory of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has developed the REMUS 600, a new 12.75 inch (32.385 cm) diameter autonomous underwater vehicle that will be used to carry mine countermeasures sensors for the Office of Naval Research. Vehicle Control Technologies has been tasked by ONR to develop autopilot and simulation software for several REMUS 600 sensor configurations, with the objective of achieving enhanced platform steadiness to improve sensor performance in the shallow water and very shallow water environment. The most stringent motion steadiness requirements for the REMUS 600 vehicle are derived from the image forming specifications of a new side-looking synthetic aperture sonar developed for ONR by the Penn State Applied Physics Laboratory and the Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida. This payload necessitated the use of a forward fin section for enhanced control authority. This forward fin section gives the vehicle the ability to command vertical and horizontal sideslips, in addition to roll, pitch, and yaw control, using independently commanded fins. This is a unique capability for a vehicle of this class. In addition, the 12.75 inch diameter vehicle class offers new capabilities for endurance and payload capacity. The REMUS 600 software architecture has been designed with the flexibility to accommodate various payloads and both the VCT autopilot and the Woods Hole autopilot. We present the VCT approach to autopilot design which makes use of a high-fidelity hydrodynamics model, software in the loop simulation test, vehicle motion steadiness performance predictions, and post-test validation. The REMUS 600 vehicle has collected extensive in-water data. We present performance results based on this data

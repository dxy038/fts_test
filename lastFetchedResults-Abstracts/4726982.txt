There has import signification for research on hydraulic characteristic of flap gate. This paper study on hydraulic characteristic of Suzhou River river mouth flap gate by physical model test, include that the discharge capacity of the flap gate and flow condition of gate downstream etc. Test indicates that the discharge coefficient was affected by the angle of gate opening at the free discharge. When the angle of gate opening is about 30??, the discharge coefficient had the maximum. The discharge coefficient decreased as the relative degree of submergence increased at the submerged discharge. That offers the bases for design and application of the flap gate.

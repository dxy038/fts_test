The bootstrap problem is often recognized as one of the main challenges of evolutionary robotics: if all individuals from the first randomly generated population perform equally poorly, the evolutionary process wonÂ´t generate any interesting solution. To overcome this lack of fitness gradient, we propose to efficiently explore behaviors until the evolutionary process finds an individual with a non-minimal fitness. To that aim, we introduce an original diversity-preservation mechanism, called behavioral diversity, that relies on a distance between behaviors (instead of genotypes or phenotypes) and multi-objective evolutionary optimization. This approach has been successfully tested and compared to a recently published incremental evolution method (multi-subgoal evolution) on the evolution of a neuro-controller for a light-seeking mobile robot. Results obtained with these two approaches are qualitatively similar although the introduced one is less directed than multi-subgoal evolution.

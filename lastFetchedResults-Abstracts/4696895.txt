We present a practical approach to implement existing expert system specification concepts. The approach is based on the previous development of expert system primitives where the focus was on the orthogonality and functionality of the primitives rather than their application aspect. An important objective is to formulate a software paradigm to enable existing expert system primitives to be combined into various expert system tools where different types of expert systems can be constructed. Expert systems built this way have been tested in telecommunications and are moving towards practical use

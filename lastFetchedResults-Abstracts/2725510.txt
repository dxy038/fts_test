A dynamic Taylor Kriging (DTK) is newly developed and combined with a multi-objective differential evolution algorithm to get a numerically efficient multi-objective optimization strategy. In the DTK, basis functions are not predefined but optimally selected so that the fitting error with the given sampling data may be minimized. In the developed multi-objective optimization algorithm, the DTK provides predicted objective function values as an alternative to direct finite-element analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed DTK and multi-objective optimization strategy are verified through applications to analytic example and TEAM 22.

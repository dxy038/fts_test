OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of catheter-associated infection after radical hysterectomy and to evaluate the role of prophylactic antibiotics in these patients.
STUDY DESIGN: A 4-year retrospective review of 102 women undergoing radical hysterectomy for cervical or endometrial cancer was performed. Clinical data were abstracted and analyzed with Ï‡2 and t tests.
RESULTS: Catheter-associated infection was observed in 11% (12 of 102) and was not altered by the administration of prophylactic antibiotics (11.1% vs 11.8%, P = .95). Of the 12 women who had infection, 11 were treated as outpatients, and 1 patient required admission for pyelonephritis. Patient age, comorbid medical conditions, class of radical hysterectomy, perioperative complications, operative time, blood loss, catheter type, duration of catheterization, and length of hospitalization had no effect on the development of catheter-associated infection.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of catheter-associated infection in women requiring prolonged catheterization after radical hysterectomy is relatively low. Withholding prophylactic antibiotics from these patients is a reasonable clinical option.

Objective(s)
Comparison of prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) assay with crocin assay.
Materials and Methods
Twenty eight serum samples were chosen, PAB and the total antioxidant capacity were measured by PAB assay and crocin, respectively, and the correlation of both assays, along with their correlation with other clinical and biochemical parameters, were determined. 
Results
A significant negative correlation was established between PAB assay and crocin assay. Also a significant negative correlation was established between PAB and uric acid and creatinine.
Conclusion
The results showed that by increasing the total antioxidant capacity, which is showed by crocin, the PAB shifts in favor of antioxidants, which is showed by PAB assay. Now, it could be considered that the PAB, along with other risk factors, might help in the prediction of the risk for cardiovascular events; and further research could clarify whether by application of PAB assay and appropriate interventions for correcting oxidative stress, progression of the cardiovascular disease could be reduced.

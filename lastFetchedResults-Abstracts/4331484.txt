This paper presents preliminary results of microstrip patch antennas made on glass substrates. The antennas are CPW-fed, using a 2D metallic PBG, photonic band gap, matrix. The objective of this work is to show the feasibility of antenna structures to operate at Ka-Band on different materials. A complementary task is to establish a lithographic process on different substrates in order to investigate alternatives for low cost, high performance microwave devices. The millimeter wave or near millimeter wave bands are expected to be a frequency resource for wireless terrestrial and satellite 3G and 4G mobile communication systems and PC-card-radio terminals. These bands also accommodate multimedia wideband operation.

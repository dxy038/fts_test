In this paper we present an implementation of a multiuser technical laboratory that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and Bluetooth (BT) techniques. The objective is to build an m-learning environment where students can work in a customized way. Applying BT capabilities this domain can be isolated into a classroom and used by several learners simultaneously. The student activities can be supervised by means of AI strategies such as planning, scheduling and expert systems. Integrating these technologies, the whole system will be able to recognize each user, organize his/her work and evaluate his/her results without or little educator intervention.

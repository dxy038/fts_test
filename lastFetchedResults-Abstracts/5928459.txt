A technique for objective assessment of larynx cancer patient voice quality using a single parameter is introduced. It is based upon the evaluation of vocal fold functionality using fundamental-harmonic normalisation (FHN) of spectra derived from impedance LX-waveforms for the vowels /ae/ and /i/. Patient FHN-spectra are correlated against pooled FHN-spectral `normalÂ´ reference standards constructed using data from healthy volunteers. Spectral correlations closely reflect refined expert judgement. There is close correlation between voice quality and the stage of larynx disease

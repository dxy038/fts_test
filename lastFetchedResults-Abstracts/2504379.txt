Background: Recurrent abortion is a difficult medical problem happening in about 1-2% of fertile
women. Most spontaneous miscarriages which happen in the first and second trimesters are caused by
chromosomal abnormalities.
Objective: The present study tries to find the rate of chromosomal abnormalities in couples with
recurrent pregnancy loss.
Materials and Methods: In total 165 couples were referred to genetic counselling clinic with a history of
at least three previous abortions. In all women antibodies against toxsoplasmose, rubella and
cytomegalovirus (CMV) were analysed by ELIZA. In 88 couples karyotyping was conducted by analysis
of G and/or C banding. Metaphase spreads were made from phytohaemaglutinin-stimulated peripheral
lymphocytes using standard cytogenetic techniques. The chromosomal status was analyzed using
CytoVision Ultra ver.4.0 from Applied Imaging.
The 2-test and ANOVA were used for statistical evaluation. The level of p < 0.05 was considered as
significance.
Results: Most of the patients had 3 repeated abortions (61.2%). Cytogenetic analysis performed for 88
couples and karyotypes of 12.5% of them were abnormal. The majority of them had monosomy X
(6.82%), followed by balanced translocation (2.27%). The number of female carries chromosomal
abnormality exceeded significantly than of male. Coefficient of inbreeding in more than 50% of couples
had fifth degree of relationship (89 out of 165).
Conclusion: Our results showed that 12.5% of the couples with missed abortion had an abnormal
karyotype, with no other abnormality. Cytogenetic findings in spontaneous aborted specimens could
provide valuable information for genetic counseling and prenatal care in future pregnancies in couples
with a history of repeated pregnancy loss.

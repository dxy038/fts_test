Background and Objective: Diazinon (DZN) as an organophosphate is used for household and agricultural pest control. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and vitamins E and C against DZN-induced oxidative stress in rat erythrocytes.

Materials and Methods: In present experimental study, male Wistar rats were randomly divided into eight groups: control group (corn oil as DZN solvent), DZN group (100 mg/kg), NAC group (160 mg/kg), vitamin E group (150 mg/kg), vitamin C group (200 mg/kg) group, and NAC+DZN group, vitamin E+DZN group and vitamin C+DZN group, all of which were given intraperitoneally. 24 hours after injection, blood was collected and erythrocytes were obtained. Then, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, as well as glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined by biochemical methods. 

Results: DZN increased SOD (p < 0.001) and GST (p < 0.01) activities and MDA (p < 0.05) level and decreased CAT (p < 0.01) and LDH (p < 0.01) activities and GSH content in erythrocytes. Administration of antioxidants changed antioxidant enzymes activities, decreased MDA level and increased GSH level.

Conclusion: NAC by increasing the synthesis of GSH and vitamins E and C by scavenging free radicals reduces DZN-induced oxidative stress, but they do not protect completely.

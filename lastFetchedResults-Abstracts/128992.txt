Method: Forty-two girl students and 31 boy students were selected randomly from two high schools in eighth grade in Tehran. The tool used in this research were the Farsi version of UCLA scale to measure the degree of loneliness feelings and a questionnaire to determine the type of Internet use in the subjects. Results: There was a significant relationship between feeling of loneliness and chatting among girl students. This relationship was not observed among boy students. No significant relationship was detected between feeling of loneliness and educational use of Internet. Conclusion: This study showed a relationship between feeling of loneliness and chatting. More studies should be done to show the cause and effect relationship between these two.

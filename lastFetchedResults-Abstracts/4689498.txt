This paper presents transient modeling of a grid connected three phase photovoltaic (PV) system. A multi-objective controller with Power Quality Control (PQC) and Fault Ride Through Control (FRTC) is proposed. Generally, the PQC is activated to perform voltage flicker suppression and harmonic reduction function. During system contingency, FRTC improves the dynamic performance of PV generation by coordination of controls of the PV power electronics interface, DC-DC booster and DC-AC inverter. This paper proposed to integrate a simple Reverse Maximum Power Point Tracking (RMPPT) with FRTC to avoid the overcharging of the DC capacitor bank (coupling capacitor between DC-DC booster and DC-AC inverter) and the risk of increased short circuit current during system fault. The proposed control strategy is tested on an 11 bus system with an 8 MW PV under different simulation scenarios.

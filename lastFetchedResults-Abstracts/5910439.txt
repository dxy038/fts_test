The main objective of this project is to design a spiral antenna at a frequency range between 2.4 to 2.5 GHz. The spiral antenna is fed by a microstrip line and RT Duroid 5870 is used with dielectric constant, epsiv<sub>r</sub> and thickness, t<sub>sub</sub> of 2.33 and 0.5 mm respectively. For the spiral antenna design and simulation, the Genesys software is utilised. A prototype of a circular microstrip antenna is fabricated and measured. Simulated results like return loss, VSWR and input impedance are compared with those obtained from measurements where good agreements are shown.

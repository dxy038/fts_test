According to the characteristic of the mixed-model assembly line balancing problem, the multi-objective optimization mathematical model is set up, PSO-SA alternate algorithm which is based on is Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm and Simulated Annealing Algorithm is proposed to solve the MMALB problem. The result shows that the PSO-SA algorithm is better efficient on the search speed and solution accuracy, which ensures a higher assembly line balancing ratio and makes the work time more even among all stations. The PSO-SA algorithm for the mixed-model assembly line balancing is feasible and effective.

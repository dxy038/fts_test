This paper introduces our ongoing development of a network node architecture, which meets the requirements of dynamic run-time installation and configuration of network services. The objective is to provide a network service run-time system, which is independent from installed services and suitable for effective deployment of existing, new and future services. By developing network service specific resource abstractions, the architecture will be more flexible than existing approaches

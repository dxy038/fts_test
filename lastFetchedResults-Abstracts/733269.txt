Objective.
The French health authorities instituted in 1999 a campaign to educate physicians, high-risk populations, and the public about hepatitis C (HC). To what extent has knowledge about HC increased among members of the French public?
Method.

A convenience sample of 706 French adults, aged 18 to 87, completed in 2003 a questionnaire designed to assess their knowledge of HC. Their responses were compared to those in 1997 of a different group of French adults on an identical questionnaire.
Results.

Between 1997 and 2003, knowledge significantly improved on 13 of the 26 items for which strong expertâ€“public differences were found in 1997 and significantly worsened on 3 items.
Conclusions.

France's public education campaign led to only a limited increase in knowledge about HC. Further public education is needed.

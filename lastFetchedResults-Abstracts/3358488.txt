Inductive power transfer (IPT) technology is a well-recognized technique for supplying power to a wide range of applications with no physical contacts. With the emergence of applications such as electric vehicles and vehicle-to-grid systems, IPT systems with bidirectional power flow have become a recent focus. In contrast to simple unidirectional IPT systems, bidirectional systems are complex in nature and essentially require more sophisticated and robust control strategies. This paper proposes a new controller, which is based on power-frequency droop characteristics of IPT systems, to regulate its power flow in both directions without a dedicated communication link. The proposed controller is applicable to unidirectional as well as bidirectional IPT systems with either single or multiple loads and ensures that power intake by the load side is always kept within the capability of the supply side. Analysis, together with both experimental and simulated results, of a 1-kW single-load bidirectional IPT system is presented with discussions to show that the proposed droop controller can successfully be used to regulate the two-way power flow.

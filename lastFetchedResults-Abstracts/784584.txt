Objective: This study characterized the relationship of body mass index (BMI) and high waist
circumference (WC) with the prevalence of selected comorbidities among older adults receiving nutrition and
wellness services from Georgiaâ€™s Older Americans Act programs at senior centers. Methods: Participants were a
convenience sample (N = 759, mean age = 75 years, 81% female, 63% white, 36% black). Correction factors
were applied to measured WC and to measured and self-reported height and weight. Results: The prevalence of
several comorbidities showed striking relationships with WC and BMI, independent of age, gender, and race.
Conclusion: The health burden of overweight/obesity is very high in these older adults creating an urgent need
for evidence-based nutrition, physical activity programs, and therapeutic lifestyle counseling to prevent and
manage weight-related comorbidities.

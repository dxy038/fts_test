This paper describes objective and subjective display-related measurement methods to evaluate the performance of a laser illuminated head tracked auto-stereoscopic display. Essential characteristics are speckle, exit pupils and crosstalk. The described methods are used to evaluate a first prototype of an auto-stereoscopic display developed within the European Union-funded HELIUM3D project.

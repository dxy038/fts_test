With the development of electronic techniques and computer science, digital control systems are used more and more. The authors present some problems frequently encountered in digital control and their solutions. The objective of the work is to help students to understand: digital firing circuits for a DC motor, identification of the firing circuit motor system, choice of controller and its parameters to improve the performances of the system, simulation of the choice, and implementation of the controller and comparison of the experimental results with theoretical ones

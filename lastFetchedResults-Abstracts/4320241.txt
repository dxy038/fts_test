Information technologies (ITs) are recognized critical for supply chain integration because ITs facilitate information interchanges, decision and process synchronization. But the integration of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to supply chains is difficult due to their limited technological capabilities. The objective of this work is to determine those factors affecting IT implementation among SMEs. To determine which factors of the internal context of the company (its characteristics and structure) and which of their external atmosphere (businesses environment and partners\Â´ influence) affect the adoption and/or the assimilation of technology, a survey among SMEs located in the central part of Mexico was conducted. Multivariate statistical analysis allowed determining that the external factor "influence of clients" only affects IT adoption, whereas all the internal factors related with the perceptions of the CEO-owner, plus a technology supporting culture and human resources, affect both adoption and assimilation. Contrary to expectations, a high CEO-owner innovation perception decreases the adoption and commitment to ITs implementation; whereas a high perception of insecurity/discomfort about electronic relations increases both adoption and assimilation of ITs. The study results allow the establishment of recommendations for the design of technology supporting plans for SMEs integration to their supply chains.

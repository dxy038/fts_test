Objective
psychopaths are thought to have risky decision-making and behavioral disinhibition, but little is known about the moderating effects of psychosocial factors and whether these associations can be observed in children with psychopathic tendencies. This study tests the biosocial hypothesis that social class will moderate psychopathyâ€“neurocognition relationships, with these effects being stronger in children from high social classes.

lescent community twins (N = 298) were assessed on decision-making (Iowa Gambling) and behavior inhibition (Porteus Maze) tasks, while psychopathic tendencies and socioeconomic status were assessed by the child's caregiver.
s
ificant interaction was observed whereby risky decision-making was associated with psychopathic tendencies only in children from benign home environments.
sions
gs support a biosocial interaction perspective on child psychopathy, suggesting that risky decision-making may particularly predispose to psychopathic traits in children from benign home backgrounds.

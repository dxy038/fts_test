Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and a major cause for death among women. Current clinical treatments are generally divided into surgical treatment, chemical synthetic drug treatment and radiotherapy. However the cure rate of these methods is lower and the poisonous side effect is great. With the development of bio-electro-magnetic, the electromagnetic radiation is frequently used in the biomedical science. The objective of hyperthermia treatment is to raise the temperature in the tumor to 42degC-43degC for a sufficient time, thus the tumor cell can be killed. In this paper, annular phased arrays outside body is adopted to treat breast tumor and finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is used to analyze breast tutor magnetic field and calculate the SAR in the tumor. Finally, comparison between result of FORTRAN computation program and result of commercial software XFDTD is presented, which validates the accuracy of this method.

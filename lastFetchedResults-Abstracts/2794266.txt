This paper presents the application of a Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) with Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) to increase the damping of low-frequency oscillations in a wide-area power system. The proposed FLC is applied to SSSC and tested the performance in a two-area and four-generator interconnected power system. The main objective of this controller design is to enhance the stability of power system. The effectiveness of this control method is verified by simulations. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that the proposed control method can improve the stability and robustness of a wide-area power system better than the conventional lead-lag controller.

Objective
raumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with greater concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers as well as substantial medical burden; however, it is not clear if these morbidity risks change following recovery from PTSD. In this study we compare women who have recovered from PTSD, to those with current PTSD, and healthy controls on their perceived health and inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers.
s
died 3 groups of women: those with current PTSD, those who reported recovery from PTSD, and healthy non-traumatized controls, which were determined using standard diagnostic instruments. We obtained a morning blood sample and examined concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers of: interleukin 6 (IL-6) and c-reactive protein (CRP), and lipid concentrations. Lastly, we evaluated health related quality of life (HRQOL).
s
who had recovered from PTSD had a similar HRQOL and inflammatory biomarkers as non-traumatized controls. Their concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers were lower than women with current PTSD, and similar to non-traumatized controls.
sion
 perception as well as biological indicators of health significantly differ in women in recovery from PTSD, compared to those who remain symptomatic. These findings suggest that the psychological recovery is associated with normal levels of inflammatory biomarkers and HRQOL.

Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is a congenital disorder, which is basically a tonsillar herniation (? 5 mm) below the foramen magnum with or without syringomyelia. The real cause behind this malformation is still unknown. Patients may remain asymptomatic until they engender a deteriorating situation, such as cervical trauma. The objective of this case report is to give a broad perspective on CM-I from the clinical findings obtained in a patient with asymptomatic non-communicating syringomyelia associated with a CM-I exacerbated within 2 years of a TBI, and to discuss issues related to that condition.

Online bidders use different strategies in their biddings. However, we are unsure of the bidders strategies and their effectiveness in achieving auction goals. Our study was an attempt to identify bidding strategies empirically in online single-unit auctions and evaluate their outcome in terms of cost saving, perceived bidder enjoyment, and bidder satisfaction. A research model was developed and used to examine the relationships. Both objective and subjective data of online single-unit auctions were collected from to validate our postulated hypotheses. We found three main bidding strategies: early, snipe, and agent-supported ratchet bidding based on their behavior patterns. These resulted in different levels of winning outcome and cost saving, but had no significant effect on perceived enjoyment. The hypotheses of the relationship between auction outcomes and bidder satisfaction of their bidding strategies were confirmed.

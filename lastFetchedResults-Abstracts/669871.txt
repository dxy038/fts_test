The purpose of the present study is to review and identify turning status in the right and left-handed individuals. The main question of the research is that are right and left-handed different or similar while turning? This study is practical from viewpoint of objective and quasi-experiment from viewpoint of method. A sample of 112 students (61 right-handed and 51 left-handed) were selected meaningfully from the third, fourth and fifth grades of a girl elementary school in the third educational region of Tehran. Edingburges questionnaire was used for measuring the superior hand. (Crownback Alfa= 0.97, correlation= 0.92). The findings show that there is a meaningful relationship between turning status of the right and left among right and left-handed girls in each cycle and superior hand. The results represent that the majority of the left-handed examinees are used to turning to the right and the majority of the right-handed tend to turn to the left while turning that shows there is a meaningful difference between superior hand and turning.

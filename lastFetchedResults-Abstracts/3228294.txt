This paper discusses the effective contribution of a Learning Object (LO) to teach circuit theory based on research conducted with students of higher education, and their interaction with a teacher of Electronics. From the results of such research, it is pointed out which features one wants in the LO so that it successfully promotes learning. It is in this perspective that this work was conceived having as goal the development of LO, admitting that this may be a possible alternative to represent models of interactions, which occur within the area, thereby improving understanding of physical concepts, in particular those involved with the subject of electrical circuits. It has also as objective to characterize the learning process through a series of situations that are replicated leading to a set of behaviors from the students. It is assumed that the use of this tool can lead to acquiring a specific set of skills, a better practice and meaningful learning.

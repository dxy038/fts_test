In this paper, a new network planning framework is proposed for orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular systems based on co-channel interference and traffic congestion avoidance. The network planning is formulated as a non-linear multi-objective optimization problem subject to minimum interference and related resource constraints at each cell under heterogeneous traffic. The multi-objective problem is represented by the throughput maximization of each single cell without penalizing the remaining cells, which results in a throughput equilibrium over the whole network. The fundamental objective is to maximize the throughput balance and, hence, traffic and co-channel interference congestions are avoided across the network. In order to maximize the equilibrium, the optimization problem is decomposed into a positioning problem and a resource allocation problem, which are solved by parallel heuristics and convex optimization. Additionally, a novel rotated polarization assignment method is proposed to minimize further the effect of the co-channel interference.

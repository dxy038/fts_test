How to solve uncertainty of assessment result is an important issue in E-government. Current qualitative assessment are based on subjective qualitative evaluation and the rigid division of the quantitative data, however both methods are less objective, precise and impartiality, as a result cause accuracy of assessment poorly. D-S Evidence theory is fit for processing the subjective judgment and synthesizing the uncertain knowledge. So, this theory is applied to the uncertainty of assessment results. Firstly used the classic 2/8 rule to build a dynamic contribution matrix. Then after weighted and normalized, we got a basic probability assignment MASS matrix. Final chosen one of the largest number of synthetic probability as assessment result. The algorithm has a strong versatility and an example is used to demonstrate its effectively in this text.

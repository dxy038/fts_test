This paper presents an approach based on energy control for thermal generating unit economical dispatch considering transmission safety, energy and emission constraints. With integration of safety or emission constraints, many algorithms are varied with years. This paper converts a multi-objective model to a single object model with emission using nonlinear model. The framework include: unit economic dispatch, power flow calculation, a test on constraint condition and security assessment. The main object in providing an energy control based approach for thermal unit economical dispatch is to make it pragmatic for real time or day-ahead dispatch in bulk power system. It can be used in a composite system concerned with generation and transmission focusing on both economical condition and reliability.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a specific recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is designed to model temporal sequences and their long-range dependencies more accurately than conventional RNNs. In this paper, we propose to use deep bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) for audio/visual modeling in our photo-real talking head system. An audio/visual database of a subjectÂ´s talking is firstly recorded as our training data. The audio/visual stereo data are converted into two parallel temporal sequences, i.e., contextual label sequences obtained by forced aligning audio against text, and visual feature sequences by applying active-appearance-model (AAM) on the lower face region among all the training image samples. The deep BLSTM is then trained to learn the regression model by minimizing the sum of square error (SSE) of predicting visual sequence from label sequence. After testing different network topologies, we interestingly found the best network is two BLSTM layers sitting on top of one feed-forward layer on our datasets. Compared with our previous HMM-based system, the newly proposed deep BLSTM-based one is better on both objective measurement and subjective A/B test.

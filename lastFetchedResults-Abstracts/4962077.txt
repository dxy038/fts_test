In this study, biomass catalytic gasification process for producing H<sub>2</sub>-rich gas was presented. The process consists of mainly two fluidized beds-a gasifier and a CaO regenerator. The objective of this research is to develop a computer model of biomass catalytic gasification. A model was developed using Aspen Plus software. The model predicted gas composition and hydrogen yield in good agreement with experimental data. In the case of CaCO<sub>3</sub> catalysis, the effects of operating parameters, including gasification temperature, steam to biomass ratio and CaCO<sub>3</sub> addition on product gas composition, and hydrogen yield were analyzed. The results showed the use of CaCO<sub>3</sub> has the potential to enhance the hydrogen content, and the suitable gasification temperature is at 650-700&#176;C in this catalytic reaction. Furthermore, the hydrogen yield can reach 77.48g/kg biomass, and the highest hydrogen concentration can reach more than 70% (mol) at the optimal conditions.

This paper studies the economical operation of cogeneration systems under emission constraints. It attempts to control the production of atmospheric emissions such as NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>x </sub> caused by the operation of fossil-fueled thermal generation. The objective of this paper includes fuel cost, population cost and tie-line energy cost, subject to fuel mix ratios in a boiler, operational constraints and emission condition. Evolutionary programming was adopted to solve this problem. The steam and fuel ratios of boilers and generation output will be obtained by considering the time-of-use (TOU) dispatch between cogeneration systems and utility companies. With the introduction of optimization methods, one can explore the potential for operational changes in unit commitment and dispatching to achieve minimal cost while complying with environmental standards

Elevator group control system (EGCS) with multi-objective, stochastic and nonlinear characteristics is a complex optimization system. After analyzing characteristic of typical traffic mode of elevator. This paper proposed a new simulation platform of an elevator group control system implemented in C# using the fuzzy-neural network technology. The result of simulation shows that this method realizes reasonable elevator dispatching under various passenger traffic conditions and indicates the validity of this method.

Background and Objective: Solid waste management has always been one of the major challenges of large cities. Conversion of waste to energy in the form of biogas is known to be an appropriate solution. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of total solids (TS) content and alkaline pretreatment on biogas production from municipal solid waste (MSW).

Materials and Methods: Experiments were done in 1 L glass bottles at 37 &deg;C with different TS contents&nbsp; (5, 10, and 15%), each in 3 replications based on a completely randomized design. Comparison of means was used for interpretations of the result. The volume of the produced biogas, the amount of methane, and changes in pH were measured on a daily basis. In order for better mixing, the digesters were manually shaken for 30 seconds every day. TS, volatile solids (VS), carbon and nitrogen of the feedstock were determined according to APHA standard methods.

Results: The highest methane yield and VS reduction was observed in 5% TS. Therefore, this TS was chosen for alkaline pre-treatment. The results showed that pre-treatment with NaOH significantly improved biodegradability of MSW. In 25 days, the production of biogas was 30.38% higher than that of the untreated digester. The highest methane yield was 83.35 mL/g TS and 132 mL/g TS from the control and the pretreated digesters, respectively.

Conclusion: The results of the lab experiments showed that the TS of 5 % and the alkaline pre-treatment, significantly improved biodegradability of MSW and consequently increased biogas and methane yield.

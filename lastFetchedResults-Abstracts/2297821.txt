In this work an innovative optimization process for airfoil geometry design is introduced. This procedure is based on the coupling of a PARSEC parameterization for airfoil shape and a genetic algorithms (GA) optimization method to find Nash equilibria (NE). While the PARSEC airfoil parameterization method has the capability to faithfully describe an airfoil geometry using typical engineering parameters, on the other hand the Nash game theoretical approach allows each player to decide, with a more physical correspondence between geometric parameters and objective function, in which direction the airfoil shape should be modified. As a matter of fact the optimization under NE solutions would be more attractive to use when a well posed distinction between players variables exists.

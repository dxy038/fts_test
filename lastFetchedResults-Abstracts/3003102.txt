This paper presents the directivity enhancement of a bidirectional antenna using a linear array of a probe excited circular ring. A choice of the ring radius that yields the propagation in dominant mode is first chosen. The ring width that provides the maximum directivity is determined. This optimum ring radius and width is used as the design parameters for an element. Subsequently, the array of a probe excited circular ring is investigated and characterized. The array on x, y and z axes and off axis in the xy plane are examined. The results of directivity are determined. Applications are in antenna design for mobile communication in the long and narrow path service area.

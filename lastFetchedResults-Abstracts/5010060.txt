This work considers the design of point-to-point input trajectories for flexible motion systems. The objective is to excite the systemÂ´s dynamics as little as possible so as to reduce residual vibration and settling time. Simulation and experimental results of a recently developed optimization framework for polynomial splines are presented. This framework is capable of automatically selecting the optimal number and location of the knots of the polynomial spline and allows input constraints and robustness against parametric uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics to be included during the design. The obtained results are compared to two literature benchmark methods.

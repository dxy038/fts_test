The objective of this study is to investigate the treatment efficiency of the biologically treated effluent by single ozonation and ozonation in the presence of activated carbon (AC), TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts. Results showed that treatment efficiency was enhanced by the simultaneous use of ozone and the catalysts, evaluated as chemical oxygen demand (COD) and color removal rates. The COD and color removal rates reached 51% and 91% for ozonation with TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC, 55% and 92% for ozonation with TiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst, compared with 37% and 83% for single ozonation. It was also found that BOD<sub>5</sub>/COD effectively increased after ozonation and catalytic ozonation, indicating obvious enhancement of the biodegradability of the effluent.

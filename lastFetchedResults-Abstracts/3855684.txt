A 7 kW voltage-sourced reversible rectifier (VSRR) which achieves bidirectional power flow between a single-phase AC supply and a DC busbar voltage is described. A current-forced control (CFC) strategy is used to switch two power transistors, enabling the device to operate with a unity power factor and a sinusoidal line current to produce a regulated DC busbar voltage. The advantages of the scheme are its simplicity, an extremely fast and well damped response and its adaptive nature to nonlinear effects such as transistor switching delays. The device operates with a DC busbar voltage which is greater than the peak-to-peak voltage of the utility supply so that it is especially suitable for use as a source of power in a variable-speed AC induction-motor drive

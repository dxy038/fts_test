The grid integration of Distributed Generation (DG) is considerably increasing in recent days in order to meet the ever increasing electricity demand and reserve the fossil fuel resources. The purpose of the present work is to analyze the network performance with optimally sized Wind Turbine Generator System (WTGS) based DG units with random wind velocity variations. In the present work, three DG units are integrated in the Radial Distribution System (RDS) simultaneously. The grid integration points of DG units are determined using Maximum Penetration Ranking. The sizing of DG is carried out by optimizing a multi-objective function formulated using Goal Attainment Method. The solution of the multi-objective function is obtained employing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. The network performance is evaluated by varying the stator connection of WTGS based on wind speed and also by varying the network parameters. The analysis is carried out in a 25-bus radial distribution network considering different wind velocity patterns.

Objective
esent study examined the relationship between volitional modes of coping (self-regulation, volitional inhibition, and self-control) and depression in individuals with multiple sclerosis.
s
s-sectional study of 121 participants aged 22â€“60 years with clinically defined MS who were consecutively admitted to a neurological rehabilitation center during a 23-month period. Correlation analyses and hierarchical regressions were conducted to evaluate the predictive value of volitional competencies (Volitional Components Questionnaire, short form, VCQ-S) on depression (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D), while controlling for demographic (age, gender, and education) and certain clinical variables (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS; disease duration; and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, MFIS).
s
chical regression analyses of depression revealed a model in which 68% of the variance in the CES-D was explained by daily stress situations (VCQ-S), self-regulation (VCQ-S), fatigue (MFIS), and education. However, when the analysis included only participants who had scored above the cut-off of the CES-D (n = 42), the VCQ-S factor volitional inhibition seemed to play a more relevant part in depression. In particular, the VCQ-S scales stimulation of self-access, stimulation of volitional inhibition, self-motivation, and emotional perseverance/state orientation after failure appear to be valuable predictors on CES-D.
sions
sults suggest that personality-accentuated volitional coping competencies elicited by daily stressful situations could be a relevant factor for depressive mood states in individuals with MS. However, to clarify the exact relationships of this rather circular framework, longitudinal study designs with objective measurements and a stronger focus on MS-specific stressors are needed.

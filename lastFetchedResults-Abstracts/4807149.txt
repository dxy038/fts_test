The objective of this paper is to analyze the stress and displacement of the fracture of neck of femur after fixing with a new design screw. In particular, the finite element model of the proximal femur, which was developed for different material properties of compact bone and spongy bone, had been accurately solved by aids of these software- MIMICS and ANSYS. To simulate the environment of the fracture, diverse forces were imposed on the model and appropriate friction coefficients were used between the contact elements. By assuming that the constituting elements were made of isotropic material, the results of the stress distribution of the screw and the displacement of the femur were calculated under the fixed angle of 60 degrees. The results show that the model can represent the fixation more accurately. Furthermore, the improved screw is reliable and stable by analysis.

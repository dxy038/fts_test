This paper implemented Fractional Order PID (FOPID) controller to study and assess the effectiveness of the Thyristor Controlled Series Compensation (TCSC) on power system transient stability enhancement. The basic operating principle of the device is introduced along with the main circuit configuration and models. A control scheme to increase the system damping and improve the system response is proposed. Then, an optimization algorithm (PSO) is employed for optimal tuning of FOPID controller. Nonlinear time domain simulation based multi-objective function is formulated to minimize time-weighted errors in order to damp system oscillations inherent in the nonlinear system model. A weakly interconnected power system equipped with TCSC is discussed in this paper. The system response is examined under sever disturbance. The results are presented and compared with a previous study.

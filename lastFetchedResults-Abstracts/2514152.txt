Using GIS in locating has a history that is as old as the presence of GIS itself. This ability is used in different studies which some how engaging with location features. Time and operational cost saving are the main advantages of this system. Therefore, using GIS technology in site-selection and other related activities guarantees better, faster, and more accurate results with lowers costs. Ever since, site-selection has been done by various methods with different models. In most of these studies and also the studies which is about space zoning,  It should be mentioned that few studies have done using data-based methods. ( objective methods). Therefore, investigating and recognizing an optimum pattern in combining the various Knowledge-based and Data-based techniques and models in GIS and how to combining the results (Decision Fusion) to select the best site with sufficient precision seems necessart. Furthermore, the method of integtrating the results obtained from different methods in GIS is among the items which is less considered in the studies.In this research, Knowledge-based and Data-based  methods have been used to primary zoning of the geographical space and prioritizing the recognized optimum sites. Also, recommended pattern used to identify each mentioned techniques properties with respect to the results of a case study (economical zoning of the urban space and prioritizing the optimum zones) have described as a finding. Results of assessment shows that the three Data-based methods (RBFLN, Fuzzy Clustering and PNNâ€Ž) have better performance in comparing  with Knowledge-based methods (SAW, GCA and Fuzzy Logic). Furthermore, Tajrish, Enghlab and 15th Khordad squares gain the firs rank in ranking by multi-criteria techniques by quality criteria.

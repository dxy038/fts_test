A lot of study has been done on the voice QoE (Quality of Experience). However, QoE study on the background of Chinese language is scarce. PESQ (Perceptual evaluation of speech quality) is a well known objective method for the voice QoE evaluation, it is approved as ITU-T P.862 Recommendations. This paper research the accuracy of PESQ in evaluating speech codec in Chinese environment. Two 3G speech codecs are chosen, including Adaptive Multi-Rate codec (AMR) and Enhanced Variable Rate Codec (EVRC), which all used in 3G communication systems. In this paper, we firstly construct a Chinese speech database, which is used to the study of voice QoE. Then, do lots of experimental test, to get the accuracy of PESQ for evaluating the two codecs under Chinese database. And analyze the reason of the experiment result. Finally, in order to improve the accuracy of PESQ for speech codec, we proposed the improved of the PESQ algorithm.

Introduction & Objective: Palatal fistula is one of the complications of Palatal surgery, most common after cleft palate repair. Its management is difficult due to presence of fibrotic and scarred tissue and absence of local virgin tissues. Recurrence rate is high after any technique of palatal repair.
Materials & Methods: The authors have operated on 12 cases of palatal fistula with the use of pedicled buccal fat pad flap. The patients were operated on, from March 2003 to August 2005. Patients, age ranged from 2 to 19 years. The size of the fistulas were between 10mm to 20mm. Nasal layer was closed by local mucosal flap (turn down flap) and pedicled buccal fat pad flap was used for oral lining.
Results: In one case, there was a 2mm defect in anterior part of previous fistula site, which was healed in 2 months. Mild pain and swelling of cheek were seen in 10 patients which disappeared after 5 days spontaneously. Full epithelization of BFP layer was done during 4 weeks.
Conclusions: The pedicled BFP flap is an easy and relatively secure method for palatal fistula management. It is recommended for fistula less than 20mm located in posterior two-third of palate.

This paper proposes method for evaluating interference from LTE User Equipment (UE) operating in the frequency band 792-862 MHz to Short Range Devices in the band 863-870 MHz. The primary analysis objective is to investigate the efficacy of LTE UE emission mask as defined in current standards. The study was carried out in two phases: first applying theoretical analysis and statistical Monte-Carlo simulations, followed by practical measurements in order to verify results obtained in theoretical simulations.

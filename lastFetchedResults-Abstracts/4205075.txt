The objective of this work is to analyze stresses induced in the solder joint and to minimize the risk of crack initiation at the solder-joint level. Thermomechanical analysis of solder joints and thermomechanical simulation have helped the authors to optimize the process, to give recommendations for solder-joint inspection, and to put in place new quality insurance procedures that take into account the thermomechanical parameters of components and mounting processes. Experimental results support these first simulation results. Recommendations and proposals for new quality insurance procedures are presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Female genital tuberculosis remains as a major cause of tubal obstruction leading
to infertility, especially in developing countries. The global prevalence of genital tuberculosis
has increased during the past two decades due to increasing acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome. Genital tuberculosis (TB) is commonly asymptomatic and it is diagnosed during
infertility investigations. Despite of recent advances in imaging tools such as computed tomography
(CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasongraphy, hysterosalpingography
has been considered as the standard screening test for evaluation of tubal infertility
and as a valuable tool for diagnosis of female genital tuberculosis. Tuberculosis gives rise to
various appearances on hysterosalpingography (HSG) from non-specific changes to specific
findings. The present pictorial review illustrates and describes specific and non-specific radiographic
features of female genital tuberculosis in two parts. Part I presents specific findings of
tuberculosis related to tubes such as "beaded tube", "golf club tube", "pipestem tube", "cobble
stone tube" and the "leopard skin tube". Part II will describe adverse effects of tuberculosis
on structure of endometrium and radiological specific findings, such as "T-shaped" tuberculosis
uterus, "pseudo-unicornuate "uterus, "collar-stud abscess" and "dwarfed" uterus with
lymphatic intravasation and occluded tubes which have not been encountered in the majority
of non-tuberculosis cases.

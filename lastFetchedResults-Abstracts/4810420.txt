Organizations are adopting multiple best practices models to improve overall performance. Their objective is to capture the cumulative added value of each model into one single environment. These multimodel environments raise several challenges, selection and composition of models are not straightforward tasks. This paper proposes an approach to help address these challenges by comparing models at a quantitative level. We propose a characterization of size of a model as a measure of scope coverage and detail of descriptions when compared to a reference model and model complexity in terms of architectural structural connectedness. An example of applying the proposed approach is described in an Industrial context where a multimodel process solution was evolved from CMMI-Dev level 3 to level 5.

Objective
ntrol of saliva secretion is mainly under parasympathetic control. The submandibular ganglion (SMG) is a parasympathetic ganglion which receives inputs from preganglionic cholinergic neurons, and innervates the submandibular salivary gland to control saliva secretion. The aim of this study was to investigate if adrenomedullin (ADM) and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) modulate voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCCs) current (ICa) in SMG.

ofile of CGRP and ADM actions in SMG was studied using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique.
s
DM and CGRP facilitated ICa. These facilitations were attenuated by intracellular dialysis of the anti-Gαs-protein and pretreatment of SQ22536 (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor).
sions
d CGRP facilitates VDCCs mediated by Gαs-protein and adenylate cyclase in SMG.

The problem of optimal disturbance rejection of bounded persistent disturbances is solved in the general nonsquare case. The minimum value of the objective function can be obtained by solving a semi-infinite linear programming problem, and an iterative procedure for obtaining approximate solutions is introduced. Application of the <e1>l</e1><sup>1 </sup>-optimal problem to robustness is discussed. A mixed sensitivity problem is formulated and shown to guarantee good disturbance rejection in the presence of plant perturbations

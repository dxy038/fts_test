COSPAS-SARSAT is an international satellite system designed to assist search and rescue operations using distress beacons operating on 121.5 MHz or 406 MHz and providing alert and location data to rescue coordination centres (RCCs). The system objective is to serve all organizations in the world with responsibility for search and rescue (SAR) operations, whether at sea, in the air, or on land. The COSPAS-SARSAT system was jointly developed and established by Russia (formerly the USSR), USA, Canada and France. The cooperation of the countries involved proceeded under the Memorandum of Understanding, signed in 1979. Following extensive testing and operation, an &#8220;International COSPAS-SARSAT Programme Agreement&#8221; was signed on 1 July 1988 in Paris by the governments of Russia, USA, Canada and France. This agreement established a framework for long-term operation of the system. The COSPAS-SARSAT system is used by all member states of the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. By May 1998 26 countries and/or competent organizations had officially joined the COSPAS-SARSAT programme

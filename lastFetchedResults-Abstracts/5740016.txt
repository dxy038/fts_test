Matrix converters are capable of managing bidirectional power flow while fully controlling the source currents and load voltages. The topology is characterized by its reduced size and weight compared to Voltage Source Inverters because there is no DC link stage. Unfortunately, any source voltage disturbance like unbalances, among others, can be reflected directly on the load. This work uses the advantages of the predictive control algorithms in a direct matrix converter operating under polluted sources to overcome this potential drawback. Particularly, three control schemes based on predictive control algorithms are proposed to compensate for source voltage unbalance. As a result, the topology combined with the proposed control schemes behaves as a buffer for supply voltage unbalances as they do not reach the load.

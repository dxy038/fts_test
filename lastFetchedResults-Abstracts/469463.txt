Objective
This study was conducted to determine the frequency and clinical significance of intra-amniotic inflammation in patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes.
Study design
Amniotic fluid was retrieved from 219 patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes; the fluid was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasmas and assayed for neutrophil collagenase, which is also known as matrix metalloproteinase-8. Matrix metalloproteinase-8 was used because previous studies indicated that this was a sensitive and specific index of inflammation and that is correlated with the amniotic fluid white blood cell count. Intra-amniotic inflammation was defined as an elevated amniotic fluid matrix metalloproteinase-8 concentration (>23 ng/mL). Nonparametric and survival techniques were used for statistical analysis.
Results
The overall rate of intra-amniotic inflammation was 42% (93/219 samples); proven intra-amniotic infection was detected only in 23% (50/219 samples). Intra-amniotic inflammation with a negative amniotic fluid culture for micro-organisms was found in 23% (51/219 samples) and was as common as proven intra-amniotic infection. Pregnancy outcome was worse in patients with intra-amniotic inflammation and a negative culture than in those patients with a negative culture and without inflammation. There were no differences in the interval-to-delivery or rate of complications between patients with intra-amniotic inflammation and a negative culture and patients with proven amniotic fluid infection.
Conclusion
We conclude that intra-amniotic inflammation, regardless of culture result, is present in 42% of patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes and that it is a risk factor for impending preterm delivery and adverse outcome. We propose that intra-amniotic inflammation, rather than infection, be used to classify and treat patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes.

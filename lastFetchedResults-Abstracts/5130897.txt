The determination of maximum endpoint tracking error due to uncompensated inertial payload dynamics is investigated. The problem is formulated on the basis of well-known kinetic and kinematic relationships with constraints on maximum joint positions and velocities as well as the generalized force/speed constraint relationship for each actuator. An endpoint tracking error objective function is formed, and numerical optimization is used to determine the maximum. An example computation is presented to show the tracking error under progressively increasing payload using a PUMA 560 manipulator with its first three joints in motion

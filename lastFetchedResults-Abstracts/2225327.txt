Objective: Due to the restricted potential of neural stem cells for regeneration of central
nervous system (CNS) after injury, providing an alternative source for neural stem cells is
essential. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) are multipotent cells with properties suitable
for tissue engineering. In addition, alginate hydrogel is a biocompatible polysaccharide
polymer that has been used to encapsulate many types of cells. The aim of this study was
to assess the proliferation rate and level of expression of neural markers; NESTIN, glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in encapsulated
human ADSCs (hADSCs) 10 and14 days after neural induction.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, ADSCs isolated from human were
cultured in neural induction media and seeded into alginate hydrogel. The rate of proliferation
and differentiation of encapsulated cells were evaluated by 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-
2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, immunocytoflourescent and realtime
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyzes 10 and 14 days
after induction.
Results: The rate of proliferation of encapsulated cells was not significantly changed with
time passage. The expression of NESTIN and GFAP significantly decreased on day 14
relative to day 10 (P < 0.001) but MAP2 expression was increased.
Conclusion: Alginate hydrogel can promote the neural differentiation of encapsulated
hADSCs with time passage.

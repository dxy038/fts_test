In this paper a new hybrid rotor geometry is suggested for line start permanent magnet synchronous motor, which uses circumferentially as well as radially magnetized magnets. It is derived from two basic configurations of interior permanent magnet motor and has the advantages of both the configurations. The main objective is to increase the air gap flux density of PM motor using ferrites magnets. The proposed geometry is also suitable for bonded rare earth magnets. The four pole configuration is studied using FEM analysis and different alternatives are suggested. A hybrid rotor using both ferrites and bonded rare earth magnets is also studied as a compromise between the performance and the cost. The field plots of computer simulation using Maxwell software are presented. The results are compared with the basic configurations for same magnet volume.

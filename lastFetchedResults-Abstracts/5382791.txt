The simplicity of the required transmitter-receiver pair and inherent coding ability of non-coherent multicarrier on-off keying (MOOK) are the reasons for its popular choice for a number of communication systems. Among the disadvantages for this technique however are its relative bandwidth inefficiency and its susceptibility to frequency selective fading channels which are often encountered in the wireless environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate and analyse antenna diversity exploitation techniques with the objective to enhance the performance of MOOK transmissions. Two antenna combining techniques are considered at the receiver and their performances are compared in both static and time varying frequency selective fading channels.

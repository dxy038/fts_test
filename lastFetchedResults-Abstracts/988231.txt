Free cyanide and its related compounds are the most known contaminants which
are released from industrial effluents to the environment; the objective of this study was to
evaluate the efficiency electrocoagulation reactor with iron plate in order to find optimum
operational conditions for cyanide removal from cyanide-containing effluents. The reactor
was tested under different operational conditions of voltage (20, 30, and 40 V), detention
time (20, 30, 40, 60, and 90 min), and influent concentration (20, 30 40, and 50 mg/l). Since
ferrous ion capability to react with free cyanide and its related compounds are (97%) well
established, iron plate was used as electrode in the present study. Additionally, to prevent
creating ferric ion and ferric hydroxide precipitates in the reactor which decrease the removal
efficiency, bisulfite was applied to hold ferrous ion in the reactor. The optimum operational
conditions were obtained after running the reactor for several times. Based on the results, the
optimum removal efficiency was obtained at voltage of 40 V, detention time of 90 min, and
influent concentration of 50 mg/l. Therefore, this process may be considered as an alternative
method for the removal of cyanide from cyanide- containing wastewaters.

The purpose of airport operation management is reasonably to appoint the resources in order to not only improve the efficiency of system operation, but also ensure the safety. Due to the existing multi-objective optimization problems of AGAP have paid no attention to push-out conflict avoidance, flight push-out conflict is considered as a safety restriction in this paper, and a multi-objective optimization model with push-out avoidance is established. The numerical examples solved by genetic algorithm show the validity of improving both safety and efficiency by comparing our approach to that one without safety restrict.

The paper proposes novel FACTS based stabilization scheme for maximum energy utilization of a tidal energy system using Particle Swarm Optimization PSO search technique. PSO is implemented in the control of a hybrid low cost dynamic filter/capacitor compensation DFC and Static VAR Compensator SVC (TCR+FC) scheme. The dynamic self regulating control method uses real time error to stabilize the Tidal Wave Energy Conversion Scheme (TWEC). The control objective is to track and extract maximum available energy from the tidal wave energy scheme and transfer this energy efficiency to the local isolated electric load.

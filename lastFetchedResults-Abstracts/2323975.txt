Inroduction & Objective: Cadmium is an important environmental contaminant, and has various toxic effects on living beings. In this research, the effect of hydro alcoholic extract of Oliveria decumbens on the levels of Creatinin, BUN, Uric acidand kidney histological  changes following toxicity induced by Cadmium Chloride in rat was investigated.
Material and Methods: 48 adult male Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups of 8. These groups are as follow: the Control, left untreated; the Sham, just received distilled water, the experimental group 1, treated with 2mg/kg cadmium chloride; the experimental group 2 received 500 mg/kg oliveria extract, and experimental groups 3 and 4 initially received 2mg/kg cadmium chloride followed by 250 and 500 (mg/kg) extract respectively for 21 days. At the end of experiment, all groups weighed and blood samples were taken for measuring serum levels of creatinin, BUN and uric acid.after removing the kidneys, prepared tissue sections were studied by light microscopy. Results using statistical tests were one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test.
Results: Cadmium chloride caused significant decrease in body weight and significant increase in serum levels of creatinin, BUN, uric acid and damage was the kidney tissue in comparison with control and sham groups.Where as Oliveria decumbens extract cause significant increase in body weight and significant decrease in serum levels of creatinin, BUN ,uric acid, and improve kidney damage in groups poisoned with cadmium chloride (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: The results showed that Oliveria decumbens probably a protective effects against nephrotoxicity induced by cadmium chloride and the kidney parameters.

Key words: Oliveria decumbens, Creatinin, BUN, Uric Acid, Cadmium Chloride.

With the advent of green generation technologies in recent years, utilizing distributed generation (DG) such as photovoltaic and wind-based has gained a significant attention. In this paper, authors present a multi-objective probabilistic based method to determine the optimum capacity and location of wind-based DG in order to minimize the costs of Energy Not Supplied and annual energy losses as well as insure a desirable profile of voltage. A discreet GA is used to solve existing mixed integer optimization problem. To this end, a Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering is utilized to classify output power of DG units and load demands. Then, considering the center of each cluster and its respective probability, uncertainty in both of the load and wind-based DG has been considered. Proposed method is applied to an IEEE 33-bus test system. Results obtained from executing of proposed method, illustrates the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.

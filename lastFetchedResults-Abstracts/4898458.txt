In order to eliminate the synchronous-switching requirements imposed by zero-voltage-transition (ZVT) integrated multipole topologies, this paper proposes the concept and the synthesis methodology of simplified ZVT circuits applied to bidirectional poles. The main goal of these circuits is to make possible the use of conventional modulation schemes. With the proposed synthesis methodology, new ZVT topologies can be synthesized, as well as the already known ZVT topologies. In order to validate the proposed approach, experimental results for a three phase ZVT inverter operating at 1.5 kW and 20 kHz are presented and some conclusions are stated.

A goal in the software radio design philosophy is to place the analog-to-digital converter as near the antenna as possible. This objective has been demonstrated for the case of a single input signal. Bandpass sampling has been applied to downconvert, or intentionally alias, the information bandwidth of a radio frequency (RF) signal to a desired intermediate frequency. The design of the software radio becomes more interesting when two or more distinct signals are received. The traditional approach for multiple signals would be to bandpass sample a continuous span of spectrum containing all the desired signals. The disadvantage with this approach is that the sampling rate and associated discrete processing rate are based on the span of spectrum as opposed to the information bandwidths of the signals of interest. Proposed here is a technique to determine the absolute minimum sampling frequency for direct digitization of multiple, nonadjacent, frequency bands. The entire process is based on the calculation of a single parameter-the sampling frequency. The result is a simple, yet elegant, front-end design for the reception and bandpass sampling of multiple RF signals. Experimental results using RF transmissions from the US Global Positioning System-Standard Position Service (GPS-SPS) and the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) are used to illustrate and verify the theory

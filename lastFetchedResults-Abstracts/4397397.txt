This study explains the design and implementation of a Virtual Reality (VR) framework for `fun-based´ interactive programming instruction in engineering education courses. Students continue to face several difficulties when learning programming [1] and the lack of efficient tools to overcome such difficulties can affect the students´ motivation [2]. Over time, this creates a drastic and negative impact in their attitude towards `learning programming,´ which is undesirable for student success in engineering education. To rectify this, a suitable approach that can motivate students needs to be developed to change students´ mindset towards learning programming. Student motivation is considered imperative as it is directly influences a student´s perseverance and dedication towards accomplishing an objective [3]. Rather than viewing programming courses as a means to complete coursework requirements, students should be made to realize the `power of programming.´ Learning and gaining experience in computer programming necessarily involves the development of computational/critical thinking and problem solving skills. All these skills sharpen the minds of the students while simultaneously opening up multiple job prospects for them upon graduation. To this end, to facilitate interactive and fun-filled learning, this research employs a learner-centric, user-friendly Virtual Environment (VE) to teach programming concepts. In doing so, this research aims to make a paradigm shift in the `approach to teaching and learning programming.´

Background: Malnutrition is common among older hospital patients and contributes to poor clinical
outcomes. Poor intake among this group of patients could be due to a variety of factors. Objective: To better
understand the causes and consequences of inadequate food intake among hospitalised elderly patients,
specifically: to determine (i) the prevalence of factors contributory to inadequate food intake, (ii) the relationship
of these factors to nutritional status and course of hospital stay. Design: A longitudinal observational study of a
convenience sample. Setting: Inpatients of an inner city elderly care unit in the UK. Methods: One hundred
patients (mean 81.7years (sd 7.2);27 male,73 female) were observed twice weekly, from admission to
discharge/maximum of 4 weeks. Anthropometric assessments of nutritional status were made on admission and
discharge. At each visit, adequacy of intake in the preceding 24-hour period, and reasons for inadequate intake,
were determined using nurse observations, food-charts, case-notes, and interviews of patients/carers. With all
available information, adequacy was estimated whether the subject had consumed at least three-quarters of their
standard diet along with any prescribed food supplements. Inadequate nutritional intake was defined as
completing less than this amount. Results: On admission, 21 patients were malnourished [below the 10th
percentile for demiquet (weight/demispan2) for males or mindex (weight/demispan) for females. Three patients
became malnourished during their stay. At 285/425 assessments (67%), patients were judged to be eating
inadequately. Acute illness, anorexia, catering limitations and oral problems were the most prevalent reasons for
inadequate intake during the earlier part of patientsâ€™ hospital stay. Confusion, low mood and dysphagia remained
prevalent throughout. Compared to well-nourished patients (n=67), malnourished patients (n=24) had higher
prevalence of oral problems (22%v6%;p<0.001), mood/anxiety disturbances (33%v19%;p=0.02), anorexia
(38%v23%;p=0.02) and catering limitations (34%v12%;p<0.001), but lower prevalence of dysphagia
(4%v13%,p=0.015). Of 51 patients in hospital for less than 10days, 36 were eating inadequately. Conclusion:
Reasons for inadequate intake vary according to stage of hospital stay and nutritional status. Inadequate intake in
the early stage after admission is mainly due to self-limiting temporary factors associated with acute illness.

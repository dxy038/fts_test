In this paper, we present a work on control and scheduling in flexible manufacturing cells (FMC). We developed an FMC with industrial characteristics, with the objective of studying the control and scheduling problems in these types of manufacturing systems. First, we developed several software and hardware to control the equipments used in the FMC. Second, we developed a software tool, called HybFlexGA, to study scheduling problems, with genetic algorithms (GA), in the FMC. Finally, we applied the HybFlexGA to solve scheduling problems in the FMC.

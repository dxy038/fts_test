Along with the growing energy consumption of modern society, the environmental protection of power system becomes more important. In this paper, the environmental impacts on thermal power plants are considered in optimal power flow, and a new method to determine the weight of objective function is proposed. Thermal power plantÂ´s geographical location, weather conditions and the impact of population factors are taken into consideration to form relevant impact factors which are translated into meaningful penalty factors through the emissions fine, and then the multi-objective optimization problem could be translated into a single objective optimization problem. A program based on primal-dual interior point method is used to solve the problem and an IEEE30 bus system is used to verify the validity of the algorithm.

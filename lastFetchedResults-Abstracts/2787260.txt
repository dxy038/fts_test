The economic environment is consistently challenging the ability for organisations to see the future boldly. In addition, customer value has moved from a products specific requirement to a bundle of solutions inclusive of the product and the services associated therewith. Manufacturing companies not only need to adapt to the client pull effect but also require a sense of positive adaptation in the face of dynamic or significant change. The primary objective of this research study was to gain an understanding of the concept &#8220;servitization&#8221; from a resilience incorporation perspective. An additional aim of the research study was to gain an appreciation of the impact of resilience on a servitized organisation or the implementation of a servitization process. The research study suggests that T-shaped sills profile and relationship management are critical aspects of consideration in fostering ability for servitized organisations to adapt to adversity.

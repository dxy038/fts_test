This paper addresses the No-Wait Two-Stage Assembly Flow-shop Scheduling
Problem (NWTSAFSP) with the objective of makespan minimization. The problem is a
generalization of previously proposed general problem in the Two-Stage Assembly Flow
Shop Scheduling Problem (TSAFSP). The TSAFSP is NP-hard, thus the NWTSAFSP
is NP-hard too, and three meta-heuristic algorithms, namely, Genetic Algorithm (GA),
Dierential Evolution Algorithm (DEA) and Population-based Variable Neighborhood
Search (PVNS) are proposed in this article to solve this problem. Computational results
reveal that PVNS outperforms other algorithms in terms of average error and average
Coecient of Variation (CV). Nevertheless, GA has the least run time among the proposed
algorithms.

This paper presents the results of a study on Semantic SDP, bridging semantic web principles with Service Delivery Platform. The objective is to enrich user experience with more significant information and contextual applications, while providing new business opportunities for Service Providers and their ecosystem of application providers.The Semantic Web is a vision for the future of the Web in which information is given explicit meaning, making it easier for machines to automatically process and integrate information available on the Web. When applied to SDP, it leads to Context aware management as a key technology for adaptive service delivery, enabling applications or services to sense the context in which it is currently executed and to react accordingly.

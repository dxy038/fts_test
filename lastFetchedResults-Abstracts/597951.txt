The objective of this study is to develop an operational model for analysing public policy based on the typology of stakeholders. This typology, which categorised stakeholders into seven types on the basis of three stakeholder attributes (power, legitimacy and urgency), provided a useful conceptual definition and categorisation of stakeholders, but it failed to provide a practical framework for subsequent development of public policy, especially in the context of conflicts between various types of stakeholders. The present study therefore utilised the conceptual typology to develop a practical analytical operational model for the development of public policy in the context of potential stakeholder conflict. The operational model involved two stages and two layers in developing a procedure for analysing stakeholder conflict. A five-level evaluation system was developed to specify the level of intensity of stakeholder conflict. To demonstrate how the proposed model works, the paper presented an empirical case study of the construction of Taiwan's No. 5 National Highway.

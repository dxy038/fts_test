The objective of our research is to develop a wireless sensor network construction system by teleoperated mobile robot. Our proposed system is that mobile robot carries the sensor nodes and deploys them for constructing wireless network in the working environment. For deployment of the sensor nodes, we introduced to estimate maintainable data transfer speed based on statistic approach. When estimated transfer speed is over required one, the operator can determine to place the sensor nodes and establish wireless sensor network. As the experimental result by prototype system with proposed method, it was confirmed that data transfer speed on constructed network could be maintained over required one.

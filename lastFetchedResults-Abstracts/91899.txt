By its numerous properties and importance in cheese technology (production of colour, flavour, bacteriocins and resistance to salt) Brevibacterium linens is a major cheese ripening bacteria. However, the genetic approach of such biological functions has been hindered, up to now, by the lack of tools necessary to realise genetic modifications in this species. Our objective was to demonstrate that it is possible to genetically modify several strains exhibiting interesting technological properties, especially the production of sulphur compounds. We worked with a phenotypically and genetically diverse collection of 11 strains. We genetically transformed several Brevi. linens with acceptable rates with plasmids classically used to transform lactic acid bacteria and other Gram+ bacteria. These results open up new prospects to investigate the most interesting Brevi. linens metabolic pathways both at the biochemical and genetic level.

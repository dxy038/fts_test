Objective
ess the efficacy of an electrically assisted application technique on dentine wettability (water contact angle measurements) and to determine the promoted surface roughness of dentine after applying 37% phosphoric acid etching, a self-etching primer or a self-etching adhesive system.
s
ility was assessed on 30 caries-free extracted human third molars. Specimens were sectioned parallel to the occlusal surface to expose moderately deep dentine and ground flat (water-wet 180-grit SiC) to provide uniform flat surfaces. 37% H3PO4, Clearfil SE Bond (CSEB) primer or Prompt-L-Pop (PLP) adhesive system were applied on dentine surfaces. In half of the specimens, the electric impulse-assisted application technique/ElectroBond-assisted application was followed. Contact angle measurements were performed to assess wettability using the Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis technique. Additional surfaces were conditioned for atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. Two-way ANOVA, Student's t and Student–Newman–Keuls tests were performed (P &lt; 0.05).
s
eated dentine showed the highest intertubular roughness and the lowest dentine wettability. ElectroBond application reduced water contact angles when dentine was treated with H3PO4 or Clearfil SE Bond primer, but not when dentine was treated with PLP.
sions
e of electric current improved wettability of dentine surface following application of phosphoric acid and a mild self-etch primer, but not self-etch adhesive.
